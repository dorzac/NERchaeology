Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central
Region of Texas
Linda W. Ellis, Timothy K. Perttula, and Wilson W. Crook, III

ABSTRACT
Ceramics began to be made and used by the aboriginal populations of North Central Texas possibly as early as
ca. A.D. 200 in the Trinity River basin, but more generally are found in sites dating between ca. A.D. 900-1600
in most other parts of the region. Only among aboriginal populations in the upper Red River, upper Trinity
River, and the East Fork of the Trinity River were ceramic vessels an important technological part of artifact
assemblages; ceramic assemblages are especially sparse in the Brazos and Colorado River basins in the region.
In this article we discuss the diverse character of the aboriginal ceramic assemblages documented to date in
North Central Texas, which primarily feature plain shell-tempered wares of Late Prehistoric Plains Village
age and/or grog-, bone-, and grit-tempered plain wares and decorated wares that strongly resemble East Texas
Caddo ceramics in decorative styles.

INTRODUCTION
North Central Texas is an environmentally
diverse ecoregion with respect to its geology,
physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, wildlife,
and hydrology (Bureau of Economic Geology
1996a, 1996b; Raisz 1957). Its western margins are
bounded by the Rolling Plains (Figure 1). Moving
eastward, the region encompasses the river valleys
of the Oak Woods and Prairies and the grasslands
of the Blackland Prairie. These resource-rich
habitats would have provided a variety of plant
and animal resources for the early inhabitants of
North Central Texas.
Culturally, the North Central Texas archeological region is bounded by the Red River on the north
and extends roughly from the edge of the Blackland Prairie on the east into the eastern portions of
the Rolling Plains on the west (see Figure 1). Its
southern margins are generally seen as encompassing the drainage basins of the upper Trinity River,
the middle and upper Brazos River, the middle
and upper Red River basin, the uppermost part of
the Sabine River basin, and portions of the upper
Colorado River basin (Lynott 1981). However,
these boundaries are relatively fluid and tend to
shift as new information is added to the cumulative
body of archeological knowledge for this region.
Like much of the greater Central Texas region, the

North Central Texas archeological region can be
viewed as a geographic transitional zone whose archeology reflects cultural influences from adjacent
archeological regions and whose margins are often
defined more by what they are not than by what
they are (Fields et al. 2002; Kenmotsu et al. 1993;
Perttula 2004). Much of the region falls within
what is generally believed to be the southernmost
extension of the Plains Village adaptation after ca.
A.D. 1200 and thus the aboriginal communities
living there are part of a frontier margin of cultural
interaction and transmission with many neighboring cultural groups.
Late Prehistoric sites often show marked inter- and intra-regional differences in settlement
patterns, chronology, and artifact assemblages.
Ceramic assemblages, in particular, suggest the
existence of generalized boundaries among the
indigenous groups occupying and interacting in
the region. The aboriginal ceramics found in North
Central Texas often reflect cultural influences
from several directions at different points in time.
Somewhere between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900, for
example, plain sandy paste pottery (common in
East, Southeast, and East Central Texas regions)
appears in the archeological record, but in low
frequencies. By around A.D. 1000, decorated grog,
sand, and bone-tempered pottery begin to dominate
ceramic assemblages. Shell-tempered technology

any of these wares were actually
manufactured in North Central Texas
during the Late Prehistoric period is
an intriguing research question that
remains to be fully addressed, as
does the meaning of the appearance
of Puebloan trade wares from north
central and southern New Mexico in
North Central Texas sites (see Lorrain
and Hoffrichter 1968; Crook 2013).

sites are relatively scarce in North
Central Texas, and the frequency of
ceramic sites appears to decrease
from east to west. This east/west
gradient may simply be a factor of
the relatively low number of sites
recorded in many of the western
counties; however, this does not appear to be the case if we look at the
results of an intensive survey conducted in the South Bend Reservoir
area in the late 1980s (Saunders et
al. 1992). The survey area included
portions of Throckmorton, Young,
and Stephens counties in the Rolling
Plains (see Figure 1) and followed

villages to small campsites, more than 76 percent

Hughston 2008b).
CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGES
ACROSS THE REGION
In the discussion that follows, we begin in the
northern and eastern part of the region, with assemblages in the Red, upper Trinity and upper Sabine River basins (see Figure 1). We then consider
selected sites and assemblages in the western and
southern parts of the region, namely with assemblages in the Brazos and Colorado River basins.
Red River
In the upper Red River basin in the Rolling
Plains, ceramics from prehistoric sites along the
Little Wichita River in Clay County are primarily
plain shell-tempered, and a few are decorated with
cord marks or have a row of appliqued nodes below
the rim (Krieger 1946:131); some rims have an exterior clay strip. The vessels have globular bodies
as well as flat or round bases, as well as handles
and lugs. Krieger (1946:132) also noted thick finger-molded bowl rim sherds. Both shell-tempered
and cord-marked pottery sherds have been found
on sites on the Red and Pease rivers in Wilbarger
County (Krieger 1946:134); Krieger (1946:134)
noted that “Wilbarger County appears to mark
the western limits of shell-tempered pottery,” but

that shell-tempered pottery is found along the Red
River from the Rolling Plains east through the
Western and Eastern Cross-Timbers in Montague,
Cooke, and Grayson counties (see Figure 1).
Excavations in Bryan County, Oklahoma,
sites at Lake Texoma have recovered two different kinds of apparently locally-made aboriginal
ceramic wares. The first is a heavily shell-tempered
ware, with relatively thick walls, either jars or
bowls, and both forms have flat bases (Bell and
Baerreis 1951:47). The shell-tempered ceramics
are generally plain. The other ware is tempered
with grog or bone, with jars and bowls; when they
are decorated, the vessels have horizontal incised
lines or vertical tabs on the rim (Bell and Baerreis
1951:Plate 8). Sherds from possible trade vessels
found in these sites are apparently from ca. A.D.
1100-1300 Red River Caddo decorated vessels.
There are abundant aboriginal ceramics from
Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34Ma15), in the
eastern Cross Timbers on the Red River at the upper end of Lake Texoma (Rohn 1998; Brack 2000).
Approximately 3500 shell-tempered sherds have
been recovered in excavations in several areas of
the site (Brack 2000:126), most notably in Area
F. These occur in association with several house
structures and numerous storage/refuse pits. Calibrated two sigma radiocarbon dates from Area F
range from A.D. 1150-1300, with median calibrated ages between A.D. 1220-1280. The assemblage
(Table 1) represents an early expression of the plain
shell-tempered wares that occur along this part of
the Red River, in the upper Trinity River basin, and
elsewhere in North Central Texas.
More than 98 percent of the ceramic sherds
from the Haley’s Point site are shell-tempered;

Rohn (1998) notes that about 35 percent also have
crushed limestone and/or bone temper, and Brack
(2000:129) suggests that upwards of 80 percent of
the sherds may have limestone inclusions, likely
because the potters used fossil shell as a temper.
The remainder of the sherds from Area F at the
Haley’s Point site comprise plain or slipped sherds
from grog, bone, and sand-tempered vessels (see
Table 1). The shell-tempered sherds are from
deep bowls and barrel-shaped jars with smoothed
vessel surfaces, direct rims, and flat disk and
stilt-defined bases (Rohn 1998:121-123); about 6
percent of the base sherds are rounded in profile
(Brack 2000:135). Vessel walls have a mean thickness of 6.4 mm, and bases range from 6.0-21.0
mm in thickness. The only form of decoration on
these shell-tempered vessels are appliqued bands
(from one to three bands) or collars on the rim
and smoothed into the lip (Rohn 1998:Figures 45,
47-48; Brack 2000:Figure 17). Comparable plain
shell-tempered wares are present at other Lake
Texoma sites in Grayson and Montague counties
(Brack 2000:155-156).
About 2 percent of the analyzed sherds from
Haley’s Point are considered to be exotic or nonlocally manufactured pottery, primarily pointing to
Caddo sources along the Red River in East Texas
or southeast Oklahoma (Brack 2000:147-155).
These include grog, shell-in-grog, grog-bone, and
grog-grit-bone-tempered plain wares, as well as
several grog-tempered engraved sherds that may be
from Spiro Engraved or Holly Fine Engraved vessels (generally dated between ca. A.D. 900-1200
in Caddo sites in the region), and red-slipped and
grog-tempered Sanders Plain, dating between ca.
A.D. 1100-1300.
Rohn (1998:129) differentiates between the
shell-tempered ceramics found at Haley’s Point,
which he identifies as Woodward Plain, var. Haley’s
Point, and Nocona Plain, found in Plains Village
sites in central and western Oklahoma and northern
Texas (e.g., Drass 1997:195). This differentiation
is based on the suggestion that the shell-tempered
pottery at Haley’s Point has more elaborate rim
treatments than Nocona Plain; limestone was commonly used as a temper; flat bases are predominant,
whereas Nocona Plain has rounded bases; and the
absence at Haley’s Point of “lugs, handles, appliqued nodes, punctation, or incising found in small
numbers” on Nocona Plain (Rohn 1998:129). The
most recent description of Nocona Plain, however,
by Drass (1997:195) indicates that appliqued strips

or bands are sometimes present on the vessel rim
(and Krieger [1946:132] had mentioned appliqued
strips), and bases are flat or round; limestone temper is also present as a non-plastic in other Red
River and upper Trinity River plain shell-tempered
assemblages (see Martin 1994; Prikryl 1990;
Prikryl and Perttula 1995). Brack (2013 personal
communication) also has identified shell-tempered
grog in the Haley’s Point ceramics, and suggests it
was a common technological practice.
It is possible that the distinctions between Nocona Plain and Woodward Plain on the Red River
in the Lake Texoma region, and perhaps in other
parts of the Southern Plains, that Rohn (1998) and
Brack (2000) have identified represent temporal
changes in vessel form and rim treatment of the
locally manufactured shell-tempered wares. That
is, the shell-tempered wares may have changed
primarily from barrel-shaped jars with flat bases
and appliqued bands between ca. A.D. 1200-1300
to post-A.D. 1300 jars in Henrietta and Washita
phase Plains Village sites that have globular bodies, everted rims, and both round and flat bases, as
well as rare decorative elements such as appliqued
nodes, fillets, lip tabs, and trailed, brushed, incised,
punctated, and impressed lines and rows (Brack
2000:210). In fact, Brack (2000:215) states that
“Nocona Plain and Woodward Plain probably represent closely related geographic varieties within a
single type, rather than two exclusive types.”
The Dillard site (41CO174) on Fish Creek at
its confluence with the Red River has an extensive
ceramic sherd assemblage (n=754) in an archeological component that has been dated to A.D. 12601420 (2 sigma calibrated range of two dates, Martin
1994:Table 12). The vast majority (98.5 percent)
of the sherds are from shell, limestone, and shelllimestone-tempered Nocona Plain jars and bowls
made by coiling clay and smoothing the interior and
exterior vessel surfaces. There are also 11 sherds
of grit- and bone-tempered Lindsay Cordmarked
vessels. These may represent a trade ware obtained
from Plains Village, Washita phase, peoples that
lived in south central Oklahoma (Martin 1994:164).
A single sherd from a Caddo water bottle is also in
the assemblage, but it is undecorated. Perttula et al.
(1996) also report on the recovery of East Texas
Caddo Crockett Curvilinear Incised vessel sherds
from a pre-A.D. 1300 context at another site along
this part of the Red River in North Central Texas.
Similar kinds of shell-tempered pottery were
found at the roughly contemporaneous Chicken

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
House site (41CO156) on Fish Creek by Lorrain
(1969). This shell-tempered pottery is from plain
flat-based flowerpot-shaped vessels as well as
bowls (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:191; Brack
2000:175). The rims have appliqued collars similar
to those seen at the Haley’s Point site (Brack
2000:Figure 21), and one body sherd has two
parallel rows of fingernail punctations. The Glass
and Coyote sites on the Red River in Montague
County have ceramic assemblages dominated by
a plain, smoothed, shell-tempered Nocona Plain
ware (Lorrain 1967:198; see also Brack [2000:101107, 112-122]). This ware is primarily in the form
of large jars with flat disk bases and everted rims.
The few decorated sherds have appliqued nodes
on the rim (Brack 2000:Figures 7 and 11a). Other
ceramics in the assemblage include non-tempered,
thick, and hand-molded Redware “mugs” or small
cups from 40-80 mm in diameter, often with corn
cob impressions on their outer surfaces (Prikryl and
Perttula 1995:Figure 11i). This Redware pottery,
probably functioning as paint cups, is also found
in Washita River and Turkey Creek phase sites and
Zimms complex sites in southwestern Oklahoma
Plains Village sites (Brooks and Drass 2005). The
Glass site also has a few sherds of a thin black
(smudged?) shell-tempered ware.
Martin (2005:144-145, 152) reported the
recovery of shell-tempered ceramic sherds from
Nocona Plain vessels at the Sivells Bend site
(41CO159), located on a Red River alluvial terrace, as well as at the Beck site (41CO179) on Fish
Creek, a tributary to the Red River. There were
also sherds with no apparent temper that may have
derived from a water bottle. Another site in the area
(41CO176) had very thick grog and bone-tempered
pottery that may have been cord-marked, perhaps
from a Lindsay Cordmarked vessel.
Just north of the Red River in Cotton County,
Oklahoma, the Burton #1 site (34CT39) has ceramic sherds from archeological deposits that
date (calibrated two sigma age ranges) from A.D.
1165-1310, A.D. 1355-1385, and A.D. 1280-1440
(Stokes 2003:32). The sherds are tempered with
bone and quartz sand, and have a sandy, gritty,
paste. Two of the sherds have rows of tool punctations (Stokes 2003:Figure 9a-b).
In the Kemp Bottoms along the Red River,
in Oklahoma opposite eastern Grayson County
in Texas, Albert (1984:54, 84-85 and Figure 30e)
reported the recovery of grog, grit, limestone,
and shell-tempered pottery in association with

163

a Bonham arrow point at the Steakley #1 site
(34Br161). The body sherds are thick (10-11.7
mm), and one grog-shell-tempered sherd has rows
of tool punctates. Thick grog and grit-tempered
plain wares were also noted at 34Br165, along
with an engraved sherd with a narrow hatched
zone (Albert 1984:Figure 25j). Albert (1984:132133) suggests these sites may have been occupied
by “Caddoan farmers” prior to ca. A.D. 1300, although the occurrence of shell-tempered pottery in
the assemblage suggests it more likely dates after
ca. A.D. 1300 if they were “Caddoan” farmers (see
Perttula et al. 2012).
East Fork of the Trinity River
Harris (1936, 1945) noted that ceramics
stylistically and technologically akin (i.e., grogtempered, with high proportions of decorated
sherds) to East Caddo wares occur on sites on the
East Fork and Elm Fork of the Trinity River, as do
other sites with plain and heavily shell-tempered
ceramics. Krieger (1946:137) considered the latter “very likely identical to Nocona Plain.” The
sites with the shell-tempered pottery—found in
Collin, Dallas, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall
counties (see Figure 1)—were initially linked with
the Henrietta focus by Krieger (1946:137). Later,
Stephenson (1952), Lynott (1975), Crook and
Hughston (2008), and others have postulated that
the Late Prehistoric peoples along the East Fork
represent a separate culture that shares material
culture characteristics of both the Henrietta phase
to the west as well as with Caddo cultures to the
east. The stylistic similarities of the grog-, grit-,
and bone-tempered ceramics found in sites along
the East Fork to East Texas Caddo wares have been
suggested by Todd (2014) and Crook (2014a) to
be the result of either: (a) trade wares, (b) locally
manufactured ceramic copies of Caddo pottery; (c)
actual ceramics from Caddo settlements, or (d) a
combination of the above.
Crook and Hughston are in the process of
completing a 42 year re-evaluation of the Late
Prehistoric cultures of the East Fork. As part of
this study, they have documented all the collections from previous excavations in the area plus
those of most local avocational collectors. To
date, this comprises a total of nearly 32,000 artifacts, of which 10,208 are pottery sherds. From
this study, four major areas where ceramic vessels
have been traded or acquired by East Fork groups

are suspected to be of local manufacture, primarily
because of the different kinds of tempers that were
used, as well as the firing conditions exhibited by
Vessel 2, the exterior roughening of Vessel 4, and
the poorly executed incised decoration on Vessel 2.
The five sherds from Vessel 3, a carinated
bowl, are undecorated. It is also probably of Caddo
origin given the occurrence of grog temper in the
paste. The vessel was tempered with grog and
small bits of crushed hematite. Vessel 3 was fired
in a reducing environment, and cooled in the open
air, leaving either one or both vessel surfaces with
thin oxidized surfaces visible in the sherd cores.
The vessel is well smoothed on both interior and
exterior vessel surfaces, and the vessel walls range
only from 6.6-6.9 mm in thickness.
Vessel 4 (one body sherd) has small bits of
what appear to be burned bone added to the paste.
There is no evidence of surface treatment, and in
fact the exterior sherd surface is roughened and
unsmoothed. It is from a vessel fired in a reducing environment, and then cooled in the open air,
leaving a thin oxidized band visible on the exterior
surface of the sherd core. It has moderately thick
body walls (7.4 mm), and may be from a jar.
Finally, 41DL203 along Rowlett Creek in the
East Fork of the Trinity River basin also has shelltempered ceramics. They are from archeological
deposits with a two sigma calibrated age range of
A.D. 1310-1440 (Tinsley and Dayton 2011:68).
The few sherds are from plain shell-tempered vessels made from local clays.
Elm Fork of the Trinity River
Prikryl’s (1990) summary of the archeological record on the lower Elm Fork of the Trinity
River mentions aboriginal ceramic sherds at 37
sites (16 percent of the sample of 238 sites in the
study area), with samples ranging from one to
196 sherds per site. One site (41DN49) had two
Southwestern sherds, and another (41DN260) had a
number of sherds from at least one Bullard Brushed
vessel; this Caddo vessel likely originated in the
upper Neches River basin in East Texas. Prikryl
(1990:77) suggests that aboriginal ceramics began
to be made in the area between 1250-750 B.P.
(A.D. 700-1200), and that they were primarily
grog-tempered wares with incised, punctated, and

169

brushed decorative elements. The ceramics from
lower Elm Fork sites that date from 750-250 B.P.
(A.D. 1200-1700) are tempered with bone, crushed
limestone, and fossil shell, not just shell temper
(i.e., Nocona Plain) (Prikryl 1990:80).
Aboriginal ceramics are abundant on sites
along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River at Lake
Lewisville in contexts dating only between ca.
A.D. 1250-1425. These ceramics are overwhelmingly plain shell-tempered Nocona Plain globularshaped jars and bowls (Brown and Lebo 1991;
Ferring and Yates 1998). These vessels have
smoothed interior and exterior surfaces, and are
relatively thick-walled (mean thickness of 7.5 mm
at 41DN26, Ferring and Yates 1998:71). Shelltempered sherds comprise more than 90 percent
of the assemblages, with a few sherds from grogand bone-tempered vessels. Decorated vessels are
extremely rare in the Elm Fork sites, consisting
of a few sherds with simple incised lines, several
with an interior red slip, and two cord-marked
sherds from 41DN372. These may be from Plains
Village Lindsay Cordmarked vessels (e.g., Drass
1997:192-193).
Upstream at Lake Ray Roberts on the Elm
Fork, only a few of the sites investigated by Ferring and Yates (1997) have aboriginal ceramics.
These occur in contexts dated between 693 ± 70
B.P. (A.D. 1187-1327) and 474 ± 100 B.P. (A.D.
1376-1576), indicating that they are basically
contemporaneous with the ceramic-bearing Late
Prehistoric sites at Lake Lewisville. Ceramic
sherds are almost uniformly from plain, smoothed,
shell-tempered vessels with rounded lips that have
been typed as Nocona Plain (Ferring and Yates
1997:192, 212, 261, 266). At the Calvert site
(41DN102), 299 sherds were recovered in three
block excavations. Only 1.7 percent of the sherds
were not shell-tempered, and they included one
plain sherd with no temper, and four sherds with
grit temper. Two of these sherds were decorated
with fingernail punctations.
West Fork of the Trinity River
The best known aboriginal sites with ceramics
on the West Fork of the Trinity are the Cobb-Pool
(41DL148) and Baggett Branch (41DL149) sites,
as well as 41DL184 (see Raab 1982; Peter and
McGregor 1988), at Joe Pool Lake on Mountain
Creek. Ceramics from the Cobb-Pool site represent wares tempered with grog and decorated with

incised, incised-punctated, and punctated elements
(Raab 1982:17 and Figure IV-8).
There is an extensive and diverse ceramic
sherd assemblage (n=641) from the Cobb-Pool
site. Calibrated radiocarbon dates from features
and Structure 2 range from A.D. 1080 ± 79, A.D.
1247 ± 24, and A.D. 1275 ± 90 (Peter and McGregor 1988:Table 9-27). Peter and McGregor

N

(1988:158) suggests that the ceramics are part of
a single component occupied between A.D. 10001200, although the radiocarbon dates suggest the
occupation probably lasted until ca. A.D. 1300
or later. Approximately 33 percent of the sherd
assemblage at the site is decorated (Table 3) and
the remainder are from plain wares. The plain to
decorated sherd ratio is 2.0.

Figure 7. Selected decorated sherds from the Cobb-Pool site: a, incised; b-d, punctated; e, incised-punctated, Kiam Incised.

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
Almost 60 percent of the decorated sherds
have punctated decorative elements (Figure 7b-d).
Another 21 percent have incised lines (Figure 7a),
7 percent are engraved fine wares; 6.5 percent have
brushed marks; 2.8 percent are incised-punctated
(Figure 7e); and 2 percent have a red slip on one
or both vessel surfaces. The decorated sherds
have close stylistic similarities to pre-A.D. 1300
East Texas Caddo wares—with the exception of
the brushed sherds, which become common only
after ca. A.D. 1250 in East Texas contexts (Perttula 2013)—and pre-ca. A.D. 1300 types such as
Canton Incised, Davis Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Kiam Incised, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed have been identified in collections obtained by R. King Harris from the site (Peter and
McGregor 1988:131).
The assemblage includes sherds from vessels tempered with shell (10 percent), grog (58
percent), sand-bone (4 percent), sand (5 percent),
sand-shell (4 percent), grog-sand-shell (7 percent),
grog-shell (5 percent), and grog-sand (9 percent)
(Peter and McGregor 1988:Tables 9-13 and 9-16).
The principal tempers—alone or in combination
with other non-plastics—at Cobb-Pool are grog (79
percent), shell (26 percent), and sand (29 percent).
The sherds tempered with shell (as the sole temper or in combination with other non-plastics) are
decorated with either random punctations; incised
lines; engraved lines; an interior/exterior red slip;
and brushing.
At the Baggett Branch site, test excavations
recovered grog- and bone-tempered body and
base sherds; body sherds were decorated with
shallow incised and brushed lines and marks
(Raab 1982:23). This assemblage is thought to be
associated with an uncalibrated radiocarbon date
of A.D. 1200 ± 200. A later occupation was investigated during data recovery work at the site, and
its archeological deposits also had ceramic sherds;
there is a calibrated date of A.D. 1454 ± 65 for this
occupation. The 163 sherds found at the site during
the data recovery were sorted into 12 vessel lots,
but only four of the vessels (Vessels 2-5) are represented by more than three sherds. Two of these
vessels have shell temper (Vessels 3 and 4), and
the other two (Vessels 2 and 5) are grog-tempered.
The shell-tempered vessel lots were a punctated
bowl (Vessel 3) and a plain jar (Vessel 5). Vessel
2, the first of the grog-tempered vessel lots, is a
flat-bottomed jar with brushed and brushed-incised
marks and lines (Peter and McGregor 1988:Figure

171

10-10). Vessel 5 has at least two rows of tool
punctations on the rim panel. The other vessel lots
are identified as follows: shell-tempered incised
(Vessel 1); shell-tempered plain (Vessel 9); grogtempered slipped (Vessel 6); grog-tempered plain
(Vessels 7, 8, and 12); grog-tempered appliqued
(Vessel 11); and sandy paste excised (Vessel 10)
(Peter and McGregor 1988:216-220). Although the
grog-tempered and shell-tempered ceramics are
found together in the same shallow deposits (i.e., all
but one sherd was found from 0-30 cm bs), Peter and
McGregor (1988:241) suggest that they are from at
least two temporally sequent occupations, the most
recent occupation having shell-tempered ceramics as
well as Perdiz and Fresno arrow points. The older
occupation with grog-tempered ceramics dates to the
earlier part of the Late Prehistoric period.
The few ceramic sherds from 41DL184 represent four different vessels. All the vessels are
grog-tempered. One has a brushed exterior surface,
and another has tool punctated elements (Peter and
McGregor 1988:111-112). Peter and McGregor
(1988:125) suggest the site may represent a single
occupation dating from ca. A.D. 1200-1300.
There are a few ceramic sherds from the Fort
Worth Nature Center Gravel Quarry site (41TR113)
in the West Fork of the Trinity River basin. They
consist exclusively of body sherds from relatively
thin-walled vessels tempered, fired, smoothed, and
decorated in several different ways. The analysis of
the prehistoric sherds suggests that they are from
a minimum of five different vessels. At least four
of the vessels from the site are tempered with grog
(or crushed fired clay) and the other has abundant
burned pieces of mussel shell. The sherds from the
grog-tempered vessels are decorated either with
tool punctations or with a red clay wash, while the
shell-tempered sherds are undecorated. The grogtempered pottery from the Fort Worth Nature Center Gravel Quarry may have its origins in pre-A.D.
1300 East Texas Caddo ceramic traditions, as much
of the Caddo ceramics found in East Texas are
also grog-tempered (either before or after ca. A.D.
1300), but instrumental neutron activation analysis
and detailed petrographic analysis of sherds from
the site are needed to definitively establish the
provenience and manufacture locale of the sherds
found at this upper Trinity River basin settlement.
The first possible grog-tempered vessel at
the site appears to be a jar that has a sandy paste,
probably from the use of a naturally sandy clay
in vessel manufacture, smoothed interior vessel

172

walls, relatively thick body walls (8.0-8.4 mm),
and it was fired in a reducing environment, but
cooled in the open air. This firing left the exterior
surface lighter-colored than the vessel interior
surface. Both sherds have a single tool punctate
on them as decoration, suggesting that the body of
the jar had widely-spaced and probably randomly
placed tool punctations. Similar vessel lots of
sherds have been documented from the Cobb-Pool
site (41DL148) in the upper Trinity River basin in
ca. A.D. 1000-1300 contexts (Peter and McGregor
1988:Table 9-12).
The other three possible grog-tempered vessels
from the Fort Worth Nature Center Gravel Quarry
site have a thin red wash on either interior and/or
exterior surfaces. Two of the vessels were fired in
a reducing environment and cooled in the open air,
while the other was incompletely oxidized during
firing. Vessel walls range between 6.6-7.7 mm in
thickness. Two of the possible vessels have a red
wash on both vessel surfaces, while the third has a
red wash on only the exterior surface. One of the
44 vessel lots (Vessel 25) at the Cobb-Pool site
has sherds with an interior and exterior slip that
was reddish-yellow on the interior and dark brown
on the exterior (Peter and McGregor 1988:1545),
suggesting it was not well-fired. Two of the three
sherds in this vessel lot were tempered with grog
and shell, which probably hints at its manufacture
during the latter part of the occupation in the 13th
century A.D. (Peter and McGregor 1988:194, 198),
given the possible late adoption of shell-tempered
pottery in this part of the upper Trinity River basin around A.D. 1300 (Daniel E. McGregor, 2010
personal communication).
The last vessel in the small sherd assemblage
from 41TR113 is represented by two plain shelltempered body sherds, probably from a Nocona
Plain jar or bowl (Suhm and Jelks 1962:115). These
sherds are from a vessel, again most likely a jar,
with thin body walls (4.8 mm), that was fired and
cooled in a reducing or low oxygen environment.
As we have already noted, shell-tempered pottery (Nocona Plain) is abundant in both Washita
River and Henrietta phase sites on the Southern
Plains in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma,
and is present as well at ca. post-A.D. 1300 sites
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the upper Trinity
River basin (Daniel E. McGregor, 2010 personal
communication). Drass (1997:87) notes that by
A.D. 1300, between 71-96 percent of the ceramics at Washita phase sites are shell-tempered,

increasing “dramatically through time” from earlier
Paoli phase (ca. A.D. 900-1300) contexts. These
earlier sites tend to have less than 12 percent shelltempered pottery. “In general, there is an increase
in shell temper from very small amounts at the
early Paoli sites to predominantly shell tempered
ceramics at Washita River phase sites dating between A.D. 1300 and 1450” (Drass 1997:88).
Shell-tempered pottery is also the principal
ceramic ware in post-A.D. 1300 Henrietta phase
sites in the upper Trinity, Brazos, and Red River
basins in northern Texas. At the Harrell site on the
Brazos River, for example, shell-tempered pottery
comprises 97 percent of the sherd assemblage
(n=597) (Krieger 1946). That percentage is 98.6
in post-A.D. 1430 sites (n=292 sherds) on the Elm
Fork of the Trinity (Ferring and Yates 1997), and,
as mentioned above, 79 percent at the 14th century
A.D. Dillard site sherds (n=754) on the Red River
are shell-tempered (Martin 1994). About 20 percent of the sherds from this site are tempered with
limestone instead of shell, and another 30 percent
have both shell and limestone tempers; the only
non-shell or limestone-tempered sherds are grit and
bone-tempered cordmarked Washita River phase
pottery (cf. Drass 1997:Tables 18 and 19).
The shell-tempered pottery from the Fort
Worth Nature Center Gravel Quarry site has affiliations with post-A.D. 1300 Southern Plains cultures on the Red, Brazos, and Washita rivers to the
north and west of here, as well as with Late phase
(ca. A.D. 1300-1600) Late Prehistoric period sites
elsewhere in the upper Trinity River basin (Ferring
and Yates 1997; Peter and McGregor 1988:367).
Another West Fork of the Trinity River site
with ceramics is 41TR198. The few sherds from
the site occur in occupational deposits dated to
ca. A.D. 900 (Peter and Harrison 2011:iv, 231).
The undecorated sherds are from poorly fired and
unsmoothed vessels with a gritty paste and a fine
grit temper. Peter and Harrison (2011:151) argue
that “the limited number of sherds together with
the contexts of the finds suggest that experimentation with ceramic technology was occurring
much earlier in northcentral Texas than previously
thought.” Ferring (1995) reports on the occurrence of shell-tempered ceramic sherds from the
George King site in the headwaters of the Denton
Creek basin in the upper West Fork. The shelltempered sherds are found in a component with
bison remains and an uncalibrated radiocarbon
date of A.D. 1425 ± 60.

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
South Fork of the Trinity River
The Bell Camp site (41PR107) on the South
Fork of the Trinity River has pre-A.D. 1300 Caddo
style pottery sherds (Todd et al. 2009:Figure 3).
Among them are Weches Fingernail Impressed,
var. Weches rim and body sherds, Crockett Curvilinear Incised body sherds, and a slipped Holly
Fine Engraved body sherd.
Trinity River and Major Tributaries
Richner (1982) reports on aboriginal ceramic
sherds from a number of sites in Henderson and
Freestone counties in the proposed Tennessee
Colony Lake area in the mid-Trinity River basin.
The largest samples came from midden deposits
at the Brown’s Creek site (n=237, 41FT5) and
a floodplain rise at the Hound Dog site (n=137,
41HE247). The ceramics from the Brown’s Creek
and Hound Dog sites appear to date primarily
before ca. A.D. 1300, and the decorated sherds
from the Brown’s Creek site are incised (n=24),
punctated (n=13), brushed (n=4), and slipped (n=1)
(Richner 1982:142). Notably, 14 percent of the
sherds are tempered with shell, 2.5 percent have
bone temper, and the remainder have grit-, grog-,
and/or sand non-plastic inclusions. At the Bazette
Bridge site (41HE47) in the project area, with a
corrected radiocarbon date of A.D. 1493 from the
archeological deposits, the relatively thin-walled
(6.3-6.6 mm mean thickness) sherds are grog-,
grit-, and shell-tempered, and a number of sherds

173

also have a sandy paste. Decorated sherds have
incised, brushed, and appliqued elements (Richner
1982:83). Incised-punctated and brushed ceramic
sherds were also recovered from the Winston site
(41HE245) from a context radiocarbon-dated to
between A.D. 1456-1657 (Richner 1982:221).
Investigations in the Richland-Chambers
Reservoir in Freestone and Navarro counties in
the Post Oak Savanna and Blackland Prairie (see
Figure 1) recovered substantial amounts of prehistoric ceramics from sites dating as early as ca.
A.D. 200 to as late as ca. A.D. 1650 (Bruseth and
Martin 1987; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The
earliest pottery from these sites is reputed to be
a plain shell-tempered ware, including 19 sherds
from Adams Ranch (41NV177), one sherd each
from 41FT158 and 41FT161B, eight sherds from
41FT200, and a handful of shell-tempered sherds
from Bird Point Island (41FT201). In the case of
Bird Point Island, the few shell-tempered sherds
(<1 percent of the assemblage of 4967 sherds) were
found in contexts post-dating A.D. 1000 (Bruseth
and Martin 1987:112-113). This temporal context
for the shell-tempered sherds is consistent with
the post-A.D. 1000 assemblages from the Brown’s
Creek and Bazette Bridge sites in the same general
locale (see Richner 1982). At Adams Ranch, however, six shell-tempered sherds were found in basal
deposits dating from ca. A.D. 200-700 in a large
pit (Feature 1), as well as in ca. A.D. 800-1000
Zone 2 deposits (n=2 sherds) in the same feature.

shell-tempered sherds were “limited to this basal
layer and to pits intrusive into this layer from the
subsequent layer (Zone 2).”
Plain sandy paste pottery is thought to characterize ca. A.D. 700-900 ceramic assemblages in
the Richland-Chambers Reservoir (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:Figure 15-2), but this ware appears
to be contemporary with plain and decorated grog
and bone-tempered wares that are “part of the ceramic tradition of East Texas which began around
A.D. 800” (Bruseth and Martin 1987:229); this
ceramic tradition continued until ca. A.D. 1650 in
this part of the Trinity River basin. The principal
decorative methods in the Richland-Chambers Reservoir assemblages include sherds from engraved
and slipped fine ware vessels and sherds from
brushed, incised, punctated, and incised-punctated
utility ware vessels with East Texas Caddo styles
(Table 4). Fine wares comprise no more than 23.1
percent of the decorated sherds at any one of the
sites. Utility wares are dominated by sherds with
incised and punctated decorative elements, but jars
with brushing marks are relatively common at the
Polecat Hill (41NV203), Adams Ranch, and Bird
Point Island sites.
Post-ca. A.D. 1400 fine wares and utility ware
sherds at sites such as Bird Point Island, Little
Cedar Creek (41NV173), and Polecat Hill stylistically resemble upper Neches River basin Frankston
phase Caddo ceramics (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:116). In particular, Poynor Engraved sherds
are present (Bruseth and Martin 1987:Figures 8-2eg and 8-3c; McGregor and Bruseth 1987:Figures
11-19a-h, 13-5g) in the fine wares, and the utility
wares include Killough Pinched and La Rue Neck
Banded (Bruseth and Martin 1987:Figure 8-2h-j)
jar sherds; these utility wares are also known to be
associated with Poynor Engraved in upper Neches
River basin Caddo assemblages (Perttula 2013).
The Pecan Springs site (41EL11) in Ellis
County, on an eastward-flowing tributary to the
Trinity River, has a small assemblage (n=99
sherds) from shell-tempered (n=21) plain wares
and grog- and bone-tempered sherds (n=78); about
26 percent of the latter have a distinctive paste
with crushed quartz particles (Sorrow 1966:46).
The brushed, engraved, incised, punctated-incised,
and appliqued sherds appear to be from post-A.D.
1400 Late Caddo vessels, including a sherd from a
Poynor Engraved vessel (Sorrow 1966:Figure 23k)
that was very likely from a vessel made in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas.

Story (1965:222-234) described ceramic
assemblages from the Lacy (41HE70), Wild Bull
(41HE61), and Gossett Bottoms (41KF7) sites on
Cedar Creek, a major southward-flowing tributary
to the Trinity River in the Post Oak Savannah. The
ceramics include sherds from a few plain shelltempered (2.4 percent), bone-tempered (27 percent),
grog-tempered (35 percent, including one strap
handle), and sand-tempered (2.7 percent) jars and
bowls. The sandy-tempered sherds may be from
Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified vessels, and thus
this ware’s occurrence would mark the manufacture
and use of pre-A.D. 900 Woodland period vessels in
this part of the Trinity River basin. The decorated
sherds (e.g., engraved, brushed, incised, trailed,
brushed-incised, punctated, punctated-incised, and
pinched) closely resemble East Texas Caddo styles
(Story 1965:Figures 24 and 25a-h), particularly with
post-A.D. 1400 upper Neches River basin ceramics.
This is evident by the fact that almost 42 percent of
the decorated sherds are from jars with brushed rim
and/or body markings. Such brushed jars become
common in the upper Neches River basin only after
ca. A.D. 1250 (Perttula 2013), and they come to
dominate Caddo utility wares in the basin by the
15th century A.D.
Upper Sabine River Basin
One site in the upper part of the Sabine River
basin in the Blackland Prairie has an interesting
assortment of aboriginal ceramics. The 110 sherds
from 41HU39 are tempered either with grog
(n=21), grog and sand (n=18), sand (n=8), sand
and shell (n=17), grog-sand and shell (n=5), grog
and shell (n=30), and shell (n=9). The proportion of
sherds with shell-temper is 55 percent (Black et al.
1994:Table 4), which would suggest an occupation
of the site well after ca. A.D. 1250. The sherds are
from vessels with a fine paste and relatively thin
vessel walls (an average of 5.73 mm). Only one
grog and sand-tempered sherd is decorated, and it
has several rows of tool punctations.
Brazos River Basin Sites
Ceramic-bearing sites in the Brazos River
Basin are relatively scarce. When they do occur,
ceramic assemblages often exhibit distinct
regional influences, especially to the east towards
East Texas Caddo cultures (e.g., Watt 1953).
However, the dearth of controlled excavations

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
from well-dated contexts has made it difficult to
establish a chronological sequence for a number
of the different kinds of ceramic assemblages
documented in the area. It is widely known that
East Texas Caddo ceramics of both pre-A.D.
1400 and post-A.D. 1400 manufacture are well
distributed in “the area from the Brazos River
valley around Waco south to the Georgetown
area…by contrast, the occurrence of Caddo pottery
in Central Texas after about A.D. 1400 is much
more widespread” (Creel et al. 2013:74). After ca.
A.D. 1400, Caddo ceramics are apparently more
abundant in the “Blackland Prairie just below the
Balcones Escarpment, from about the Colorado
River (maybe as far as the San Marcos River)
north to the Brazos River valley in the vicinity of
Waco” (Creel et al. 2013:75; see also Perttula et al.
2003:Figure 16 and Table 9).
While some of the earliest archeological
investigations in the state occurred in this region,
this early work was often poorly recorded and done
in a non-systematic manner, making it difficult to
interpret the archeological findings (Fox 1939;
Ray 1929, 1938, 1947; Sayles 1935). Several
more systematic surveys were undertaken in the
1960s (Malone and Briggs 1970), 1970s (Etchieson
et al. 1978, 1979), and 1980s (Thurmond et al.
1981; Wulfkuhle 1986). However, few ceramics

175

were recovered during these investigations and
when they were recovered, only limited ceramic
descriptions were provided or the ceramics were
simply classified as unidentifiable (e.g., Wulfkuhle
1986).
One exception is the pottery sherds recovered
at four sites at Lake Whitney on the Brazos River
(Stephenson 1970): the Stansbury, Pictograph
Shelter, Buzzard Shelter (see also Long 1961), and
Sheep Shelter. At Pictograph Shelter, 15 sherds
from six different East Texas Caddo vessels were
recovered in deposits dominated by Scallorn arrow points, and thus they likely predate ca. A.D.
1200. They are grit- and grog-tempered, and have
red slips or washes or engraved lines (Stephenson 1970:129-130). Pre-A.D. 1200 Caddo vessel
sections were recovered from Buzzard Shelter,
including Holly Fine Engraved (sherds from two
different grog-tempered vessels) and grog-gritbone-tempered Dunkin Incised sherds, as well as
bone-tempered engraved sherds, and plain grogand bone-tempered vessels. One sherd has a sandy
paste, and may be from a Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified vessel (Stephenson 1970:166-171).
The 39 sherds at the Sheep Shelter are from at
most seven or eight different East Texas Caddo
style vessels of probable ca. A.D. 1200-1400 age,
including an engraved and red-slipped bottle, two

Canton Incised jars, a plain carinated bowl, a plain
grog-bone-tempered bottle, a grog-grit-tempered
brushed jar, and a cross-hatched incised bonetempered vessel (Stephenson 1970:199-201). Late
18th to early 19th century Caddo ceramics (n=18
sherds from 11 different vessels) were recovered
in excavations in several parts of the Stansbury site
(Stephenson 1970:76-79). They included sherds
from Womack Engraved and Patton Engraved,
Historic Caddo ceramic types manufactured and
used by Caddo peoples in either the upper Red and
Sabine River basins or the Neches-Angelina River
basins in East Texas.
One intensive survey conducted in the South
Bend Reservoir area in the late 1980s (Saunders et
al. 1992) provided more detailed descriptions of
the recovered ceramic sherds. The survey included
portions of Throckmorton, Young, and Stephens
counties (see Figure 1) and followed the main
channels and associated tributaries of the Brazos
and the Clear Fork of the Brazos Rivers. Only seven of the 586 sites with prehistoric components had
aboriginal ceramics, but the total number recovered
from all seven sites numbered only 46 sherds. All
of the prehistoric ceramic-bearing sites were found
in Young County (Table 5).
Two pottery types were identified, including
Nocona Plain and Sanders Plain, as defined by
Krieger (1946) and Suhm and Jelks (1962). While
fairly detailed descriptions of the ceramic attributes were provided, the data was presented as a
group summary, thus making it difficult to relate
the attributes to specific sites. Further, no specific
chronological relationships could be established
because the sherds came from surface collections.
Nocona Plain sherds were recovered from
41YN182, 41YN327, and 41YN366. The majority
of the recovered ceramics were small body fragments that provided little indication of vessel shape
and size. However, two rim sherds from 41YN327
suggest that at least two vessels were represented
at this site. Both rim sherds were from Nocona
Plain vessels that had rounded and undecorated
lip edges. One rim was direct in profile and one
was thinned. One of the rim sherds appears to be
from a restricted bottle with an orifice diameter of
approximately 11 cm.
Pastes were relatively homogenous, with a
dense compact appearance. Crushed shell had been
added, representing less than 30 percent of the total
paste volume. Paste colors varied from light gray to
dark gray. Exterior and interior surfaces had been

either smoothed or lightly burnished and uniformly
finished. Vessel wall thicknesses ranged from 4-8
mm, with a mean thickness of 6.1 ± 1.1 mm.
The 24 sherds typologically classified as Sanders Plain were recovered from 41YN7, 41YN266,
and 41YN425. The sherds had been tempered with
crushed sherds or grog that represented less than
20 percent of the total paste volume. Their exterior
surfaces had been finished in a consistent manner
and the majority had lightly burnished exterior
surfaces; without slips on either one or both sherd
surfaces, these sherds would not be classified as
Sanders Plain in the current Caddo ceramic taxonomy (see Perttula and Selden 2014). The majority
of the interior surfaces had been smoothed. None of
the sherds were large enough to assess vessel size
or shape; however, the vessel walls appear to have
been relatively thick, averaging between 7-9 mm,
with a mean thickness of 8.3 ± 0.1 mm.
Coloration varied in the sherd assemblages.
The one sherd recovered from 41YN7 had a
white exterior surface and the sherd recovered at
41YN266 had a brown exterior surface. The exterior surface color of the 22 sherds from 41YN425
was most often tan, but in a few cases gray or
brown. Interior coloration is predominately gray or
tan, and the majority of the paste cores were black.
Since 41YN425 included both transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric lithic artifacts, the ceramic assemblage at this site may be representative
of more than one time period. Given their overall
thickness and coloration, it is possible that some
of the grog-tempered ceramics at this site may well
have been from Williams Plain vessels, dated to the
Woodland period in East Texas, and contemporaneous at least in part with the Transitional Archaic
period in North Central Texas.
Six sherds were not typologically identifiable.
Three undecorated body sherds recovered from
41YN327 had calcite inclusions embedded in a
homogenous paste matrix. The small mineral inclusions were angular and appear to have been crushed
into fine to silt-sized grains before being added to
the paste. The tiny parallel striations observed on
several of the inclusions, and the fact that these
inclusions reacted strongly to hydrochloric acid,
suggest that they may have come from fossiliferous rock.
Two of the sherds had been smoothed on both
their exterior and interior surfaces, while one sherd
had burnished exterior and interior surfaces. The
sherds ranged from 4-8 mm in thickness.

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
Ceramics with similar paste inclusions have
a wide distribution. Matson (1935) identified
similar aplastics in sherds recovered from five
sites in the Abilene area (discussed below). Similarly, limestone-calcite-tempered pottery has been
found in sites in the upper Trinity River Basin
(Rohn 1998; Brack 2000) and the upper Red River
basin (Drass 1997).
Three plain body sherds with no apparent temper were recovered from two of the sites, 41YN118
and 41YN327. While microscopic examination of
the paste detected a few isolated mineral inclusions, the well-consolidated paste matrix was composed almost entirely of pure clay. All three sherds
were relatively thick, ranging from 8-10 mm.
The surfaces of these three non-tempered
sherds were somewhat irregular and uneven. The
exterior and interior surfaces of the two sherds recovered from 41YN118 were burnished and brown
in color. The sherd recovered from 41YN327 has a
brown, burnished exterior surface, but its interior
had been smoothed and is light red in color.
Based on their association with time diagnostic
lithic artifacts (e.g., Fresno and Clifton projectile
points), the Nocona Plain ceramics most likely
date after ca. A.D. 1200-1500. At 41YN425, the
presence of an untyped dart point among the
surface-collected grog-tempered wares may also
suggest the presence of Woodland period pottery.
In summary, the occurrence of technologically
variable pottery at these seven sites point to occupations at different times by aboriginal groups with
contacts and affiliations to the north/northeast and
the west, with occupations occurring at different
points in time.
Forrester (1988:39, 42) described sherds from
two different Nocona Plain shell-tempered vessels from the Bee Mountain Shelter No. 2 on the
Brazos River in Bosque County, Texas, one a jar
and the other a possible water bottle. The jar had
a very thick base (14-15 mm). The vessel sherds
were probably associated with a post-A.D. 1200
occupation in the rock shelter that also had Perdiz
and Cliffton arrow points.
Five ceramics were recovered in archeological
investigations at 41BQ285 on the North Bosque
River in a component that dates from the late 13th
to the mid-17th century A.D. (Griffith et al. 2010).
Technological, stylistic, petrographic, and instrumental neutron activation analysis of the sherds
indicated that four of the sherds were manufactured
from Central Texas clays; two were plain and two

177

had simple fingernail punctated designs. The fifth
sherd is a grog-tempered carinated engraved bowl
(Perttula et al. 2010). Taking all ceramic analyses
into account, Perttula et al. (2010) concluded that
this engraved sherd was from a vessel made from a
Central Texas clay source. What prehistoric aboriginal group made this sherd remains to be determined.
The Blum Rockshelter on the Nolands River
in Hill County had 88 sherds from probably five
different vessels, all recovered from post-A.D.
1200 contexts with Perdiz arrow points. One grogtempered vessel section may be from a Poynor
Engraved bottle (see Jelks 1953:Plate 19u), Vessel
2 is a plain grog-grit-tempered bowl with charred
residue on its exterior surface, while Vessel 3 is
a grog- and bone-tempered bowl with diagonal
incised lines and punctations (Jelks 1953:205).
Vessel 4 is a bone-tempered jar with rows of fingernail impressions, and Vessel 5 is a grog- and
bone-tempered bottle with engraved pendant triangles (Jelks 1953:Plate 19y). Jelks (1953:206)
concluded that these vessels “seem to be Caddoan
ware. It is safe to assume that all are trade items
from the east.”
Other sites in the Brazos River basin in North
Central Texas have been excavated where primarily pre-A.D. 1200/1300 Caddo sherds were
recovered, including sherds from a section of a
Hickory Engraved bottle from Kyle Rockshelter,
along with two plain bone-tempered sherds and a
plain sandy paste body sherd (Jelks 1962:60-61).
Several sites at Aquilla Lake, including the McDonald site (41HI105, with n=127 sherds, most of
them plain or from the undecorated lower portions
of vessels), has Caddo style ceramics of the types
Kiam Incised, Canton Incised, Maydelle Incised,
and Bullard Brushed (Brown 1987:48-14).
There were a few plain ceramic rim and body
sherds from ca. A.D. 900-1200 and post-A.D. 1200
zones at Bear Creek Shelter (41HI17) on the Brazos River at Lake Whitney (Lynott 1978:43). One
sherd from the older deposits was tempered with
grog, and another was tempered with limestone.
The sherd from a Toyah phase zone had a fine
sandy temper.
One of the earliest ceramic-bearing sites excavated in North Central Texas was the Harrell
site (41YN1) (Fox 1939; Hughes 1942; Krieger
1946; Texas Beyond History 2013). Located on
the floodplain of the Brazos River in south central
Young County, the Harrell site assemblage included roughly 597 sherds, all of which occurred

178

Texas Archeological Society

in the upper stratigraphic levels. Approximately 80
percent of the ceramics were shell-tempered wares
which were classified as Nocona Plain. The paste
matrix of the remaining sherds included those that
exhibited no apparent temper and those with white
clay lumps as probable grog temper. Two sherds
were considered “trade pieces”: one was an apparent southeastern New Mexico ceramic ware and
one was a Poynor Engraved sherd from a Caddo
group living in the upper Neches River basin in
East Texas.
Krieger (1946) noted the similarities between
the sherds found at the Harrell site and whole
ceramic vessels found in graves in East Central
Oklahoma and Northeast Texas. Thus, Krieger
(1946) believed the Harrell site to be the southernmost expression of the Plains Village tradition
and considered the site to be the “type site” of the
Henrietta Focus. Subsequent investigations at the
Harrell site point to intermittent occupations that
date between ca. A.D. 800 and A.D. 1500.
The ceramics from the Harrell site were later
reexamined by Brack (2000; see also Brayshaw
[1970]), who determined that between 25 and 30
separate vessels are represented in the assemblage.
He concluded that most of the vessels were roundbottomed jars with restricted necks averaging 15
cm in diameter, many of which flared out at the
rims. At least four bowls were also represented in
the collection. The vast majority of the sherds (98
percent) are plain shell-tempered wares; however,
a few exhibit simple decorations, primarily rows
of appliqued nodes. Other decorative techniques
appearing on the vessel body were vertical fingernail marks, incised diagonal lines, and stamped
impressions. From Brack’s (2000) comparative
study of shell-tempered pottery from North Texas
and Oklahoma, the pottery found at the Harrell site
was believed to be the most technologically varied,
but Brack agreed with Krieger’s earlier conclusion
that the pottery found at the Harrell site closely resembled pottery found at Plains Village sites along
the Red River and the Washita/Canadian River
drainages in southern and western Oklahoma.
Interestingly, the Harrell site assemblage
displayed a rather heterogeneous mix of culturally
distinct artifacts, including both Southwest and
Caddo pottery types. Also recovered were marine
shells from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico,
sandstone pipes, and obsidian from the Rocky
Mountains. The presence of exotic goods and
an admixture of ceramic types suggest contacts

with, and/or occupation of the site by, a variety of
cultural groups.
The geographic location of the Harrell site
places it in a boundary zone bordered by different ecoregions and cultural zones. Situated on the
eastern flank of the Rolling Plains in the Western
Cross Timbers ecoregion of southern Young
County (see Figure 1), approximately 15 km west
of the Cross Timbers and 15 km east of the Broken
Red Plains at the confluence of the Salt and Clear
Forks of the Brazos River, the site would have
been a favorable place on the landscape. If one assumes that different artifact styles (i.e., projectile
points and pottery types) and exotic goods (i.e.,
marine shell) reflect culturally (linguistically,
economically, politically, and socially) distinct
peoples, then the artifact assemblages recovered
at the Harrell site suggest that different cultural
groups occupied and/or interacted at this location
over a substantial period of time.
The O. W. Hill site (41YN2) is located approximately 2.5 km northeast of the Harrell site.
Originally identified and excavated by the Works
Progress Administration (Fox 1939), this relatively large site included 21 hearth features, a large
lithic assemblage, ceramics, worked bone, and a
sizable quantity of faunal material. The archeological data suggest multiple occupations at the
site over a fairly long period of time (Brayshaw
1970; Denton 1984).
Eleven sherds were recovered at 41YN2, and
five of the 11 had been tempered with mussel
shell. A smoothly polished bead measuring 2 cm in
length was also recovered and was believed to be
shell-tempered. The paste matrix of the remaining
sherds was not noted; however, this group of sherds
was described as being thinner than the mussel
shell-tempered group. One sherd was decorated
with punctations, and two sherds that appeared to
be from the same vessel had shallow incised parallel lines (Brayshaw 1970; Denton 1984). While
overall vessel size and shape was difficult to determine, the three rim sherds found in the collection
were relatively thin, ranging from 3.6-4.8 mm in
thickness. One of the rims had an outward flaring
lip. Despite their sketchy descriptions, this small
assemblage seems to represent different ceramic
types. One interesting observation is that among
the diverse faunal assemblage from the site, mussel
shell was negligible. This suggests that the shelltempered wares found at the O.W. Hill site were
probably manufactured elsewhere.

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
Perhaps some of the earliest work done in the
Upper Brazos River basin was done by Cyrus Ray.
Ray (1935:75) recorded numerous Late Prehistoric
sites in the Abilene area; however, many were surface scatters that he observed in plowed fields. In
1935, Ray published a general article on what he
termed the “pottery complex artifacts” of the region,
providing rough counts and a cursory description
of 20 sites in the Abilene area from which pottery
sherds had been recovered. Most of the pottery-bearing sites described by Ray (1935) contained all or
most of the Toyah lithic assemblage and the ceramics included a wide variety of wares, including Rio
Grande glaze ware from New Mexico (confirmed
by H. P. Mera [Ray 1935: 84]). Unfortunately, documentation for many site locations is unclear and with
the exception of an article by Griffin (1935), little

179

or no detailed analyses were ever conducted on the
recovered ceramics.
The only detailed data on pottery recovered at the
ceramic-bearing sites described by Ray (1935) comes
from an analysis done by James B. Griffin (1935) and
Frederick Matson 1935). Griffin (1935) looked at a
sample of the pottery recovered from 13 sites near
Abilene, Texas. His analysis in most cases included
descriptions of the type of tempering material, texture
of the paste and aplastics, surface finish, color, and
any rims present in the assemblage (Table 6).
Roughly 55 percent of the analyzed sherds
were described as having “calcium phosphate”
inclusions that were uniformly white in color (Matson 1935). Analyses indicate that this tempering
material has optical properties resembling those of
the mineral Collophanite. This amorphous mineral

occurs in sedimentary phosphatic limestones and
is the dominant material in fossil bone in which
the microstructure of the original bone is usually
preserved. This microstructure was noted on fragments of the aplastic inclusions in several of the
analyzed sherds. Amorphous deposits of “bone
phosphate” are known to occur in a number of
states outside Texas (Matson 1935).
The paste fabric of several of the analyzed
sherds also contained calcite, identifiable because it
effervesced upon the addition of Hydrochloric acid.
Calcite is a polymorphous mineral that occurs in
almost every type of environment. It is a crystalline
form that often binds with other compounds (such as
limestone). Thus, the white aplastics that appears in
many of the ceramics in North Central Texas appear
to be at least two different mineral types that can occur separately or they co-occur in the same formation.
Petrographic analysis of those ceramics containing
white mineral aplastics would aid in characterizing
the various types of “white” inclusions in ceramic
sherd pastes, and could eventually enable the identification of potential source deposits.
As can be seen from the preceding discussion,
Brazos River basin sites with aboriginal ceramic

assemblages are not especially prevalent in the
prehistoric archeological record and are technologically variable. While shell-tempered wares
are heavily represented, other potentially informative temper types are also found. Unfortunately,
most of the recovered ceramics are from surface
collections that are often poorly or inconsistently
described. Even among those ceramic-bearing
sites, such as the Harrell site, that have been more
extensively excavated, the recovered assemblages
have never been critically evaluated and are lacking in securely dated components. Thus, it is difficult to make more than general statements about
the spatial distribution of the ceramics found in the
Brazos River basin or to date their occurrence in
time with any degree of confidence.
Colorado River Basin Sites
Some of the earliest archeological work in the
state was done in the Colorado River basin area
by Cyrus Ray and E. B. Sayles. Unfortunately,
the results of many of these investigations have
never been fully reported and aboriginal ceramics

are rarely mentioned. Much of our information
on pottery in this portion of North Central Texas
comes from a survey (Wooldridge 1981) and later
excavations (Lintz et al. 1993) conducted along the
Concho and Colorado rivers in the proposed O. H.
Ivie (formerly Stacy) Reservoir area. Similar to
the archeological record in the Brazos River basin,
only a proportionately small number of ceramicbearing sites were identified during these investigations (Treece et al. 1993; Wooldridge 1981). In
an area encompassing more than 19,000 acres, 369
sites having prehistoric components were identified. Of those, only seven sites (1.9 percent) had
aboriginal ceramic sherds. However, two of the
seven sites (41CC 131 and 41RN169 yielded fairly
large numbers of ceramics (Table 7).

Data recovery investigations were undertaken
at the Currie site (41CC131), located on and within
an alluvial terrace of the Concho River 3.4 km
upstream from its confluence with the Colorado
River. Three stratified components were identified during the investigation. Radiocarbon dates
indicate that the site was intermittently occupied
between A.D. 756 and A.D. 1790, with a large
number of dates clustering around A.D. 1500
(Lintz et al. 1993:126-127).
A total of 731 sherds were recovered from
41CC131, all of which were typologically classified as Leon Plain. While the basic ceramic attributes were provided in table format (Treece et al.
1993:Table C-6), some key attribute data was only
presented in summary form, thus making it difficult

significant because not all ceramics with bone inclusions belong to the Leon Plain type and the various
combinations of tempering agents in a paste matrix
can be better characteristic of specific ceramic types.

Vessel form was largely indeterminate in the
41CC131 sherds, but the assemblage includes
sherds from four jars and five bowls. Unfortunately, the sherds were listed separately in the table
and no notations were made as to whether they
could have been part of the same vessel (Treece
et al. 1993:Table C-6). Furthermore, 11 different
surface finishing and/or decorative techniques were
observed on the ceramics from this site. While
the majority were classified as having smoothed

184

Texas Archeological Society

or burnished exterior and/or interior surfaces, 43
sherds had been enhanced with some form of decorative treatment. These included: painted/burnished
(n=17); painted/smoothed (n=5); painted/brushed
(n=1); brushed (n=15); incised (n=1); incised/
burnished (n=1); incised/painted (n=2); or slipped
(n=1). Since Leon Plain, by definition, does not
include decorated ceramics, these 43 sherds would
be from typologically distinct wares. At least three
of the painted ceramics were from either bowls or
jars. Attributes such as paste and thickness would
be critical to making typological distinctions, but
unfortunately, there is no way to correlate paste,
decorative treatment, and/or thickness because a
significant level of detail is not provided in the
Treece et al. (1993) report.
The Rocky Branch site (41RN169) is located
on a terrace at the confluence of Rocky Branch and
the Colorado River. The site was described as having three occupation zones that included a Toyah
phase zone dating to ca. A.D. 1450. A total of 319
sherds were recovered during investigations. As
with the 41CC131 ceramics, the ceramic data for
this site was presented in table format. Seven incised sherds were recovered at this site.
Sites 41CC222, 41CN19, 41CN64, 41CN95,
and 41RN3 also contained small numbers of
technologically variable prehistoric ceramics (see
Table 7). For example, only one sherd from a
sand-tempered Polychrome vessel was recovered at
41CN19. Among the three sherds found at 41RN3
were two sherds classified as Doss Redware. At
41CN95, 48 sherds were recovered. Among those
were two incised sherds.
The analyses of sherds from these seven sites
illustrate a common problem encountered when
trying to interpret ceramic data from some published reports. The sherds at these sites appear to
have been classified as Leon Plain simply because
they contained crushed bone temper. However,
the paste often included other tempering agents in
addition to the crushed bone and no attempt was
made to account for the various combinations and
correlate them with the technological variations in
surface treatment and thickness. Since bone inclusions are also regularly found in Caddo ceramics,
it may be that some of the sherds that were characterized as incised or brushed are in fact Caddo
ceramics, or ceramics from some non-Toyah phase
ceramic tradition. This may be especially the case
with regard to 41CC131 given the radiocarbon
dates obtained from this site that range from A.D

756 to A.D. 1790. Given the presence of three
stratified components at the site, a reanalysis of
these sherds could provide new information on the
character of ceramic wares in the upper Colorado
River basin in North Central Texas.
Finally, in a recent study by Creel et al. (2013),
a large scale compositional analysis of Central
Texas ceramics from Late Prehistoric Toyah phase
hunter-gatherer assemblages was undertaken.
Among the many ceramic samples were several
samples from Brown, Coleman, Jones, Runnels,
and Taylor counties, including six samples from
41CC131 and several from the E. B Sayles collections. The data suggests that the Concho/Colorado River confluence is a relatively significant
area where several of the observed compositional
clusters overlap (Creel et al. 2013:71). This study
adds greatly to our understanding of some of the
definitional issues involving the Leon Plain type.
It also illustrates that more detailed analyses, and
in some cases reanalysis, of ceramic assemblages
need to be done in order to fully understand the
aboriginal ceramics from this area.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Like many other regions across Texas, ceramics are a key component of the artifact assemblage
present in aboriginal sites in North Central Texas.
The ceramics found in these sites in North Central
Texas have a complex history. Ceramics in North
Central Texas demonstrate a long period of use,
possibly being introduced as early as A.D. 200
in some parts of the Trinity River basin but are
more prolific in sites dating from A.D. 900-1600.
However, ceramic usage is not homogeneous
across the region. In the aboriginal populations
of the upper Red River, the upper Trinity River,
and the East Fork of the Trinity, ceramic vessels
were an important part of the overall toolkit.
Conversely, to the west in the upper Brazos
and Colorado basins, ceramic usage was fairly
sparse. Furthermore, in the western portions of
North Central Texas, particularly in sites in the
upper Brazos and upper Colorado River basins,
the technological and stylistic character of the
ceramic assemblages have never been critically
evaluated and they lack secure radiocarbon-based
temporal ranges.
Across North Central Texas sherds from plain
ware vessels dominate ceramic assemblages, often

Ellis et al.—Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas
comprising 90-100 percent of the total ceramics
present in a site. This plain ware is typically represented by shell-tempered wares of Late Prehistoric
Plains Village age and/or grog-, bone-, and grittempered wares that strongly resemble East Texas
Caddo ceramics in style. As would be expected,
shell-tempered wares dominate the ceramics in the
Red River basin portion of North Central Texas and
decrease in abundance in sites in the upper Sabine,
Trinity, and Brazos River basins; bone-tempered
ceramics are particularly abundant in Colorado
River basin sites in the region. Grog-tempered
ceramics are more abundant in the eastern part
of the region, most notably in the Trinity River
basin and its major tributaries, and decreases in
abundance moving west toward the plains. Locales
in the middle of these two ceramic manufacturing
centers, such as the upper Trinity River basin and
the East Fork of the Trinity, have ceramic assemblages with nearly equal amounts of shell or grogtempered ceramic wares.
Much of the shell-tempered pottery present
in North Central Texas, both in appearance and
vessel type, is similar to the defined type Nocona
Plain from the southern Plains and the upper Red
River basin; Brack (2000) labels the same ware as
Woodward Plain for shell-tempered assemblages
at Lake Texoma on the Red River. The grog-,
bone-, and grit-tempered plain ware sherds dating before ca. A.D. 1200 found in North Central
Texas sites has been considered similar to that
described as the thick-walled Williams Plain from
Northeast Texas and southeastern Oklahoma sites,
although Williams Plain sherds are common only
in East Texas Caddo sites in the Red and Sulphur
River basins. Thinner-walled grog-, bone-, and
grit-tempered plain wares in North Central Texas
and East Texas are from currently typologically
unidentified ceramics.
How much of this plain ware pottery is the
result of local manufacture and how much of it is
due to trade? In general, assemblages with large
sherd sample sizes (ca. 1000+ sherds) are likely
from vessels that were made on the site or are
from vessels made in a local community, even if
there is no direct evidence of manufacture (i.e.,
pits used for firing pottery; preserved clay coils;
firing discards). For example, a small hint of local
manufacture was found at the Upper Farmersville
site in Collin County in the East Fork of the
Trinity River where a Nocona Plain-like vessel
was found to have fallen apart during firing and

185

was discarded in a trash pit. However, as has been
observed in East Texas (Perttula 2013), direct
evidence of pottery manufacture even in areas
known to be large ceramic production centers
is extremely rare; typically preserved clay coils
are the only archeological evidence for on site
manufacture.
One thing is clear: temporal and spatial differences in the character of aboriginal ceramic
assemblages in North Central Texas indicate the
existence of different manufacturing traditions
and/or broad scale interactions with neighboring
groups with different ceramic traditions. To assess
the various technological traditions evidenced
in ceramic assemblages in North Central Texas
will require consistent evaluation of the ceramic
attributes associated with ceramic manufacturing
behavior (see Ellis et al. 2010). When enhanced
with petrographic and trace element geochemical
studies (Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis), we will hopefully clarify the origin of the
region’s ceramics.
In addition to plain ware vessels and vessel
sherds, a number of decorated wares (both utility ware and fine ware) have been recovered in
North Central Texas sites (especially in the upper
Trinity and Brazos River basins) that in both type
and style resemble ceramic types made by Caddo
peoples throughout East Texas. While a number
of individual types can be identified in sherd assemblages, they are never present in any great
abundance, typically comprising only a few percent
of the total ceramic assemblage at any given site.
Moreover, when whole vessels have been found,
they tend to show extensive repair and preservation to extend their life after accidental breakage.
This observation, coupled with their rarity, supports the hypothesis that unlike the plain ware, the
decorated vessels are imported trade ware and, as
such, are highly valued objects in North Central
Texas communities.
Concurrent with trade between Caddo peoples
and the aboriginal communities living in the
Southern Plains of North Central Texas is a further link between North Central Texas aboriginal
groups and the Puebloan peoples of northern and
southeastern New Mexico. While not abundant,
Pueblo pottery, obsidian artifacts, turquoise, red
coral, and Olivella sp. shell from Baja California
have all been found in East Fork of the Trinity River sites (Crook 2013). Similarly, marine
shells from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico,

186

Texas Archeological Society

sandstone pipes, and obsidian from the Rocky
Mountains have been recovered at the Harrell site
in the Brazos River basin (Brack 2000; Krieger
1946). Moreover, based on the pottery types present, this trade persisted from at least A.D. 1000 to
as late as A.D. 1400-1500 (Crook 2013).
The general abundance of trade activities
that can be documented in the occurrence of ceramic vessels and other goods in North Central
Texas sites then begs the question: what did the
inhabitants of North Central Texas have to trade
in exchange for these ceramics and other goods?
A number of natural resources are abundant in the
region but items like white-tailed deer and various
kinds of toolstone, etc. were not unique enough to
have been valued as a trade item with other aboriginal peoples living in other parts of the Southern
Plains, East Texas, or the Puebloan world. Instead,
the key trade items likely included access to buffalo (for meat and hides) on the western edge of
the region and large stands of bois d’arc wood in
the eastern part of North Central Texas, especially
along the East Fork of the Trinity and in a few
locales in the upper Red River basin. The latter,
along with the English yew tree, is the finest wood
for the construction of bows in the world (Bush
2014). As such, bois d’arc was in continual demand
by those people who lived outside its natural range.
This would have included the aboriginal peoples of
the Southern Plain, the Puebloan peoples of New
Mexico, the Spiroan trade centers of eastern Oklahoma and their extensive trade partners, and even
some of the more southern Caddo groups.
