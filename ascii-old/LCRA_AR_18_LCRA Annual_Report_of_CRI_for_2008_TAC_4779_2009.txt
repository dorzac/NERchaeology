MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In May 2005, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The new MOU replaced a previous
Memorandum of Agreement that the agencies had entered into in August 1989. As with the previous
agreement document, the new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology department to conduct construction
monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance, and intensive cultural resource surveys on new and
existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines, and substations 300 acres or less in size under authorization
of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee Archeology Permit issued for the calendar year. Such
projects are submitted to THC through an interim report that THC reviews and comments on during a 30day review process. These reports are then finalized and included in the Annual Report.
There are two notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is for
small (less than 2 acre in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results of
such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights-of-way (ROW) but may also include
fence repair and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such
projects receive at minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of
previously identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
If warranted, projects will also undergo a field survey that will typically focus on high probability areas
where ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance avoidance
areas are then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form, and likewise compiled in the
Annual Report for post facto THC review.
Additionally, some projects that are reviewed by LCRA archaeologists are considered to not require an
archaeological survey, typically because they are in low probability areas, have been previously disturbed,
or have been previously evaluated. In such cases a letter is sent to the THC reviewer explaining the
rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports, THC reviews and comments on these
within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in the Annual Report.
A final section of the Annual Report includes projects that have not been submitted to THC previously.
These are usually the results of agreed-upon monitoring and other permit-related research.
During 2007, the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted 69 in-house cultural resource
assessments. These were in 26 counties in west-central, south-central, and central Texas. Total project
acreage totaled over 5,200 acres, although a large percentage of this is from long transmission line
maintenance projects that were reviewed through file searches. Actual on-the-ground survey projects
covered just over 765 acres. A total of 57 previously unrecorded archaeological sites were recorded, of
which 51 were prehistoric and six historic. Ninety-two previously recorded sites were assessed, either
through file review or field work. Of these, 84 had prehistoric components, and 21 had historic
components. Out of these 149 sites, 43 are considered to be potentially eligible for formal SAL status,
four are considered eligible, and two (41BP463 in LCRA’s McKinney Roughs facility, and 41CD132
within a transmission line ROW) are listed.

i

Draft cultural resource survey reports (interim reports) for 17 of these projects were submitted to the
Archeology Division (AD) of the THC throughout the year. These are compiled in Part 1 of the Annual
Report, with sensitive locational information redacted from copies for public distribution. Notable
projects reported to THC included survey of Muleshoe Bend Park (160 acres, Project 5.08), survey of
transmission line T-216 (153 acres, Project 62.08), survey of transmission line T-113 (55 acres, Project
6.08), survey of the new Rim Rock to Jack Furman transmission line (44 acres, project 25.08), and the
reevaluation of potential SAL sites 41ME193, 41BT41, 41KR200 and 41TV1849 (projects 16.08, 8.08,
67.08 and 4.08, respectively), all of which were subsequently determined to be ineligible.
Forty-two projects were cleared through internal memos. These are compiled in Part 2 of this report.
Twenty-one of these were transmission line maintenance projects. Sixteen were limited to file searches,
and five included field survey. The most notable of these was the survey of T-130, 191/192 (102 acres,
Project 17.08). The remaining 21 were for various construction and other ground disturbing projects,
fifteen of which required field survey and five that were cleared through file searches.
In ten cases letters were sent to THC. Six of these requested that no survey was needed, and in all cases
THC agreed. Two others led to additional historical investigations (Project 53.08 - Jarvis Creek Bridge in
Wharton County, Project 57.08 - Landa Mills remediation in New Braunfels), one to detailed recording of
cisterns removed from Muleshoe Bend Park (Project 39.08) and one to emergency recovery of an
apparent Toyah-aged bison kill in Bastrop County (Project 9.08). These are all reported in Part 3 with
additional detailed information for the last three projects reported in Part 4.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2008, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA)
Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural
resource investigations, and archaeological monitoring for 69 projects within the LCRA’s 11-county
statutory district and broader 42-county service area (Figure 1). These cultural resource investigations
were conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff members Daniel J. Prikryl, Andrew F. Malof and
Charles A. Hixson along with the aid of contracted archaeologists Glenn T. Goode, Cody M. Kiker, Pat
Hatten and George Thomas under the authorization of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4779. Mr.
Prikryl, Mr. Malof and Mr. Hixson were the Principal Investigators under this permit.
The LCRA’s 2008 Annual Report, the eighteenth in a series of yearly reports submitted to the Archeology
Division (AD) at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), summarizes in-house investigations that
include records checks, reconnaissance, intensive surveys, and monitoring of projects that are each 300
acres or less and are located on LCRA’s lands and easements. Investigations for projects of more than
300 acres or involving test excavations or full-scale mitigative excavations are conducted under
authorization of separate Texas Antiquities Permits either by in-house staff or consultants and are not
reported in this document

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and
cultural evolution along the river is a goal of the LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant
than in others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background
for the Colorado River within the 11-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano
Uplift Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on
the ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country, and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Misissippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations
that range from 1,500 ft above mean sea level (MSL) to 825 ft MSL along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain, and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland Site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and
quartzite for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the
Hill Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the
area as “.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther west”. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country.

From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette, and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene and Miocene age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran et
al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
MSL in the uplands to 350 ft MSL along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop and
Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda counties are composed of
relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces. Relief
is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 ft MSL in the uplands to 5-10 ft MSL on the flats near the
river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to other types of
material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene Beaumont clays
predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains ( e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon, bison, sloth) has
been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the Sabine River
(Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby beach
(Long 1977).
Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (The Kingsland Site), some of the sandy granitic
soils have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope
where the soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination
has left alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow, and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl, and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on

5

erosional benches. Since these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl, and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9 ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbes (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9 to 30 ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm, and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.
In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
under story species such as agarito, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter
grass, and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge
tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca, and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm, and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry, and yaupon.
Anomalous to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the
coastal prairies in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse
bunch grasses and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered
the vegetation regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of the LCRA’s 11-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down
into central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during
prehistoric times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop, Texas to Wharton,
Texas, prehistoric remains show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain
prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977). At least one attempt to define an East-Central Texas prehistoric
culture area within the Post Oak Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the
fact that burned rock midden sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological
materials from the Paleoindian and Archaic periods in East-Central Texas and along the coastal portions
of the Colorado River drainage are generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For
this reason, the prehistoric Culture History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established
Central Texas chronology. In the Late Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast
are discussed separately from those inland since a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident
on the coast from the Bay City area down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning
approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all, the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et al’s (1995) argument
that the traditional Central Texas prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in
archeological reports glosses over the wide range of environmental diversity and the full range of huntergatherer adaptations and processes. However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the
full range of such prehistoric adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.
Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 years BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two
distinct periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview cultures
present at 11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game,
the Clovis on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is
suggesting that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or
advantageous, but subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This
early Paleoindian period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of
Prewitt’s Early Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt,
has been placed in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as
edge grinding and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382).
This has been termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broaderbased pursuits of the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP, and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers
to it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with
Austin phase peoples around until about 800 BP when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994),
the Toyah phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,

7

and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times, but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but
are in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnson’s reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons were having to adapt to the widespread extinction of the
large animals that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian period. Although the big game hunting
nomadic lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations
relatively low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the
Early Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem, and include the Gower type first defined at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
1995:Figure ----), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table ----). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table ----). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.’s (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too fine
grained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage

8

coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits
in general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).
The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a
continuation of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this
time. The Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at
least by Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the
northeast and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in
succeeding Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted
in this major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time
that Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently
bison are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not
clear what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewitt’s Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The late Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back towards a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table ----; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the
arrival of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.

9

In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about AD 1000 to about AD 1700. During that era the material assemblage includes pottery
with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray variations some
with asphaltum decorations. During the historic period and quite probably during the later part of the
Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archeological data suggests that the
Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis 1996:101).
Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the early spring,
and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along the rivers and
creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of deer and bison
were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendents of the Late Prehistoric in the
vicinity of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the
cultural evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas
region. For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated
with the Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The
Tonkawa, generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were
immigrants probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill
Country, the Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European
settlement across eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the
native population prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salle’s expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late 17th century, but it was not until the early 18th
century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river (Baumgartner et al.
1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Augirre Expedition stopped
along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present day Austin and Bastrop, Texas
(Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, Texas where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It
was not until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of
settlers associated with Stephen F. Austin’s third grant that was also known as the “Little Colony.”
Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the “Old Three Hundred” families on the lower Brazos
and Colorado rivers was well underway. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange, Texas in Fayette
County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beason’s Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus, Texas (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse

10

Burnam, who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beason’s Crossing area in 1822 to march
down to the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378).
Downstream in present-day Wharton County, twenty-five of the “Old Three Hundred” families received
title to land in that county in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called
Preston, which was located on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of
Wharton (Webb 1952:890). By the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into
eastern Travis County with a chain of small family forts located at Webber’s Prairie, Coleman Branch,
and Fort Prairie (Webb 1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However,
none of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beason’s Crossing figured prominently,
though, in the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe
passage, Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain, plantation
style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers were
originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegel’s Settlement
area Fayette County area in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many former
plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to other
German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as tenant
farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn, and sorghum were the staple
crops well into the mid 20th century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet, and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Swithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormons’ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webb’s
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
Following Webb’s thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley
shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)
in the late 1930s and early 1940s dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along
the Colorado River in western Travis, Burnet, and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has
given way to the development of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2008, the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for 69 projects. As shown on Figures 3, 4 and 5, 41 of these projects were located in the
Edwards Plateau/Hill County Region and areas westward, while 28 were situated on the Gulf Coastal
Plain. Table 1 provides a listing of the project names, project numbers, Interim Report (IR) numbers,
dates of investigations and THC concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status of each
project. This table also gives data on archeological sites that were recorded/revisited during each project,
the State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status of each archeological site, the amount of acreage
involved in each project area, and the county in which each project is situated.
Figures 3, 4 and 5, along with Table 1 show that the vast majority of construction-related project were
located in Travis and Burnet counties, continuing the trend of LCRA development projects west of
Austin. Much of this activity is related to development of parks and preserves along the Highland Lakes.
Transmission line activity, however, was more prevalent east of Austin. These transmission line
maintenance and construction projects are a reflection of Transmission Services priorities.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey and Assessment of LCRA’s Proposed
Pace Bend- Camp Chautauqua Oak Wilt Trenching Project
Travis County, Texas

By
Cody M. Kiker
Andrew F. Malof,
Principal Investigator

TAC Permit # 4412 (for 2007)
Interim Report # 2.08
Lower Colorado River Authority
Community and Natural Resources Services
January 2008

Abstract
Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource
survey for the proposed Pace Bend- Camp Chautauqua Oak Wilt Trenching Project. Pedestrian survey
and shovel tests were conducted on January 10 and 15, 2008, within the proposed approximately 9-10
acre project area located on the Pace Bend arm of Lake Travis in western Travis County, Texas.
One new prehistoric archaeological site was recorded, 41TV2286. This site is categorized as a very low
density, buried, lithic scatter. Attempts were also made to relocate sites 41TV169 and 41TV966, a
possible rockshelter and prehistoric lithic scatter, respectively. Both sites were described as essentially
destroyed when recorded and neither could be relocated for the present project.
Given that sites 41TV169 and 41TV966 are apparently destroyed and that site 41TV2286 is not felt to
contain research potential beyond its recording, none of the three sites are considered eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. As a
result, it is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed.
In addition, no artifacts were collected during this project so no curation will be necessary.

Management Summary
LCRA arborists have determined that there is oak wilt present within portions of LCRA’s Camp
Chautauqua (old Bergstrom AFB Recreation Area) on the Pace Bend arm of Lake Travis in western
Travis County, Texas (Figure 6). To prevent the spread of oak wilt to trees within the adjacent Travis
County-operated Pace Bend Park and other nearby properties a plan of trenching, bulldozing and burning
of the diseased trees is proposed. The discontinuous trenches will have a combined total length of
approximately 4,800 ft, be four to five feet deep, and surround a 19-20 acre area. The trenches will be
only four inches wide, just enough to sever and kill the roots of the diseased trees to keep them from
spreading oak wilt to healthy trees. These trenches will surround a smaller, approximately eight acre
main area of oak wilt blighted trees. Dead trees from within this main oak wilt blighted area will be
bulldozed and burned. Healthy trees within this main blighted area will be left standing. In addition,
approximately 38 trees from seven discrete areas, covering one to two acres will be bulldozed to one or
more centralized piles and burned (Figure 7).
The survey investigation was undertaken in order to meet the requirements of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. For State Antiquities Code purposes, the investigation is being reported under TAC Blanket Permit
#4412, which was issued to the LCRA by the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2007, in
accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas Council of Archeologists
(1992).
The cultural resources survey conducted on January 10 and 15, 2008, by LCRA Staff Archaeologist
Andrew F. Malof (Principal Investigator) and contracted archaeologists Cody M. Kiker and Patrick
Hatten, consisted of a pedestrian survey of the entire nine to ten acre project area (eight acre main blight
area plus one to two acre discrete areas) with shovel testing done in areas of diseased oaks designated for
or likely to be bulldozed. Minimum survey standards require 20 shovel tests to be excavated within the
project area. In all, 23 shovel tests were excavated within the project area; either within designated or
likely bulldozer areas or to define the boundaries of the newly recorded archaeological site, 41TV2286.
Site 41TV2286 is a low density, buried, prehistoric lithic scatter discovered as a result of several positive
shovel tests.
Attempts were also made to relocate sites 41TV169, a possible rockshelter, and site 41TV966, a
prehistoric lithic scatter. Both sites were described as essentially destroyed when recorded and neither
could be relocated for the present project.
Given that sites 41TV169 and 41TV966 are apparently destroyed and that site 41TV2286 is not felt to
contain research potential beyond its recording, none of the three sites are considered eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. As a
result, it is recommended that the trenching and bulldozing project to control the spread of oak wilt be
allowed to proceed.

Environmental Background
The soils of this and nearby areas are of the Pedernales Series (Werchan et al. 1974). These soils are
gently sloping or rolling and eroded, with a typical slope of five to eight percent. They are composed of
deep, well-drained, fine sandy, loamy soils that are moderately slowly permeable and have a high
available water capacity. The vegetation regime at Camp Chautauqua is a grassland mosaic with
scattered clumps of predominantly live oak but also some persimmon, ashe juniper and mesquite. There
are also scattered patches of prickly pear and tasajillo cactus. This savannah-like landscape is the result
of brush control to curb the growth of ashe juniper which would otherwise be the dominant tree, as it is in
the surrounding area and throughout much of the Hill Country. This is readily evident just west of Camp
Chautauqua on the other side of Grisham Trail road where there has been no brush control and ashe
juniper dominates a scrubland landscape of scattered live oak and mesquite. Prickly pear and tasajillo
cactus patches are also larger and more numerous on this landscape. The predominance of ashe juniper in
the surrounding area is the result of the naturally shallow soils combined with livestock overgrazing
common throughout the Hill Country in the mid- 1800s. This continuous overgrazing allowed the ashe
juniper to spread beyond the stream/ river channels and steep canyons where it had previously been
concentrated, turning the grasslands and savannahs of the Hill Country into scrublands covered
predominantly by ashe juniper, with pockets of oak and mesquite.
The underlying geology of Pace Bend is limestone which dates to the early or lower Cretaceous Period,
approx. 145-100 million years ago. At the higher elevations of Pace Bend this limestone formation is
known as the Glen Rose Limestone lower unit (Fisher 1981). This formation is outside the actual project
area. Within the project area the geology is slightly older Hensell Sands overlying even older Cow Creek
Limestone. Hensell Sands consist of red sand, silt, clay and conglomerate composed chiefly of pebbles
and cobbles of Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks. The Hensell Sand formation can be up to 220+ ft. thick
and generally forms shoreward facies of the Glen Rose Limestone, as in this case. Cow Creek Limestone
generally has a honeycomb appearance due to the many dissolved fossils. This formation is massively
bedded, up to 60 ft. thick and forms scarps (Fisher 1981).

Previous Investigations
Site 41TV169 was originally recorded in 1973 as a completely destroyed, possible rockshelter (THC
1973). There is no clear evidence it was ever occupied by prehistoric peoples. The record made in 1973
was based on information recorded in 1963-64 by Mr. Preston Millican, when the lake level was at 615644 ft msl. Lake Travis has yet to drop below 644 ft msl. again. The lowest the lake has dropped since
was during the June 2005- May 2007 draught, when it dropped to only 644 ft msl.
Site 41TV966 was originally recorded in 1984 as a very light, prehistoric lithic scatter, essentially
destroyed (THC 1984). Local, avocational archaeologist Bob Wishoff attempted to relocate the site in
2006, but could find no evidence of it. LCRA archaeologists attempted to relocate the site for the current
project, but again, no evidence of it could be found.

Research Design and Methodology
The project was designed to identify and evaluate sites within the project area, and to provide assessments
regarding their research potential and subsequent eligibility for listing as State Archeological Landmarks
or placement on the National Register of Historic Places and then, based on known or perceived impacts
from construction, to make recommendations regarding their recording, avoidance, or mitigation, if

33

necessary. This was accomplished by following standard survey and reporting procedures as outlined by
the Council of Texas Archeologists and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission.
The cultural resources survey was conducted by two qualified archaeologists walking transects within the
project area using topographic maps, aerial imagery, and GPS as locational aids. All but one of the 23
shovel tests excavated within the project area were placed within areas to be bulldozed, or likely to be
bulldozed to remove dead trees. The final shovel test was placed at a point where the trench will cut
through the terrace above a possible rockshelter. Shovel tests were dug in 20 cm intervals and the fill was
screened through ¼” mesh as per Texas Historical Commission requirements.

Results
One new archaeological site was recorded, 41TV2286. This site is categorized as a very low density,
buried, prehistoric lithic scatter discovered as a result of several positive shovel tests (Figure 7). Approx.
12 small (less than 3 cm) decorticate flakes and 15 small decorticate flake fragments were recovered from
shovel tests 7-9 and 11-13. All artifacts were recovered from within the top 25 cm of soil in STs 7-9 and
13 and from within the top 40 cm of soil in STs 11 and 12. Reddish clays were encountered below these
depths in all shovel tests (Appendix 1).
Three flake fragments and a core fragment were also found within ST 21, but no artifacts were recovered
from the next shovel test (ST 22), less than 12 m. away. ST 21 also appeared to be on the edge of a wash
draining down into the lake, which might explain why artifacts were found here and not in the less eroded
area of ST 22. Shovel Test 23, 30 m upslope from ST 21, also contained no artifacts (Appendix 1).
Flakes were also found within STs 2-4, 16, 20 (one per shovel test) but these are considered isolated
artifacts as no artifacts were recovered from other shovel tests near these and no artifacts were found
where the ground surface could be observed nearby (Appendix 1).
Attempts were also made to relocate sites 41TV169 and 41TV966, a possible rockshelter and prehistoric
lithic scatter, respectively. Both sites were described as essentially destroyed when recorded and neither
could be relocated for the present project.

Recommendations
Given that sites 41TV169 and 41TV966 are apparently destroyed and that site 41TV2286 is not felt to
contain research potential beyond its recording, none of the three sites are considered eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. As a
result, it is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed.
In addition, no artifacts were collected during this project so no curation will be necessary.

Management Summary
LCRA proposes to allow development of a 21.04 acre section of land by the Young Men’s Business
League (YMBL) for Sunshine Camp, designed to provide outdoor education for underserved inner-city
youth. The land is located in western Travis County on Lake Travis, within LCRA’s Turkey Bend park
(Figure 8). Primary development elements include a 54 x 80 ft enclosed pavilion, a 20 x 54 ft restroom
and shower facility, and six 16 x 28 ft cabins. There will be an on-site well, two sets of septic tanks, an
approximate 1-acre drain field that will hold a volleyball court, underground electric utilities, both high
and low ropes challenge courses, and floating canoe and swim docks. Two 10 x 10 ft storage sheds and a
small office building/medical station will be placed on piers. Other buildings will be placed on slabs built
to grade. Ground disturbance will include bulldozing, trenching, and drilling of holes for piers and ropes
structures. Access will be along an existing park road. Total disturbance will be approximately 2 acres.
There are five known archaeological sites located either completely or partially within the project area
(Figure 9). These are prehistoric sites 41TV1849, 1853, 1860 and 1882, and historic site 41TV1835.
Only site 41TV1849 is within an area that will be directly impacted by construction (Figure 10). This is
an open camp with chipped and ground stone tools, fire cracked quartzite, chert and sandstone and
weathered mussel shell in sandy, gravelly soils at depth of up to 50 cm. Portions of the site have been
heavily impacted by ongoing looting, which appears to have been occurring for decades (Figure 11).
41TV1849 is closely associated with 41TV1853, also an open camp, but located below the ridge that
holds 41TV1849. The majority of this site is normally under the waters of Lake Travis. Sites 41TV1860
and 41TV1882 are both lithic acquisition locales within gravels exposed on slopes on either side of the
ridge. These sites impinge only slightly into the lease area at the south and north. Site 41TV1835 is the
location of the Burton House, as determined by a 1936 contour map, on which four structures are seen.
This homesite has been severely impacted by past clearing activities, but is not within an area proposed
for impacts associated with the present project.
Although site 41TV1849 has dense amounts of debitage and time diagnostic artifacts dating from Middle
though Late Archaic times, there is little potential for separating time periods vertically. There appear to
be trends suggesting site use varied horizontally, but a lack of intact features and organic preservation
coupled with the extent of previous impacts makes any substantive interpretations a tenuous prospect.
Site 41TV1849 is not considered to be eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed.
Artifacts collected during this project will be permanently curated at an accreditated curation facility.
The background sections from the following report are taken from an internal LCRA resource assessment
document for Turkey Bend.

Environmental Background
Geology
Surface geology results at Turkey Bend were derived by visual inspection of the property during 2005 and
by research primarily based on NRCS data. The Turkey Bend Resource Area was found to be evenly split
between Cretaceous-aged Cow Creek Limestone and Hammett Shale Undivided on the western part of the
property and Quaternary-aged deposits in the east. The Cow Creek Limestone is a white, honeycombed

limestone of about a 60-foot thickness, while the Hammett Shale is greenish-gray shale that includes
oyster beds, cobbles, and pebbles. The limestone and shale outcrops occur in the upland physiographic
zone.

Figure 11. Relatively recent looting at 41TV1849. Clipboard for scale.
The Quaternary deposits consist of Pleistocene-era fluviatile terrace deposits, which coincide with the
upland margin physiographic zone, and more recent Holocene alluvium, which occurs on the
lowland/floodplain zone. The fluviatile terrace deposits are noteworthy for their large volume of gravels,
which are visible on terrace slopes.
Although the site has geologic characteristics capable of developing subsurface solution cavities (karst
features), no known caves have been identified to date.
Soils
The soils at Turkey Bend Resource Area were surveyed in 2005 using a combination of on-site visual
inspections and reviews of secondary sources. Seven soils were identified. The research found that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s NRCS’s soil surveys of Travis and Burnet counties define the soil in
the project area as Travis and Tarrant series.
The soils formed from several kinds of parent material: in the western part of the county, the parent
material was principally limestone dolomite, interbedded limestone and marl, and clay, but along the
Colorado River, the parent material was alluvium. The surface layer is light brownish-gray gravelly loam
or clay loam about four inches thick. The next layer is pale-brown clay loam to a depth of about 15
inches. The underlying material is interbedded limestone and marl.

43

Erosion problems were noted during the course of field investigations. Those observed in the western
section appear to be due to the steepness of slope. This is indicative of Cretaceous-aged Cow Creek
Limestone and Hammett Shale and is also attributed to previous overuse of the property.
Closer to the water, increased erosion and scattered rock deposits are attributed to the bend in the river.
The more easterly soils, associated with Quaternary-aged deposits, have areas of erosion which appear to
have been caused by frequent flooding and overuse.
Approximately 30 percent of the entire Turkey Bend property is bare ground. This is standard for rocky
Hill Country soils.
Extended overuse has deteriorated the condition and diversity of biomass on Turkey Bend. Using best
management practices, it is possible to restore this property to near pristine condition. Decreased canopy
and increased grass and forb production will boost infiltration rates, yielding increase quantity and quality
of overland flow.
Physiography and Landforms
The Turkey Bend Resource Area is located within the Edwards Plateau section of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Carr 1967:3). In the general area around Turkey Bend, land surfaces consist
mostly of plains with high hills (Hammond 1964:Map 4). However, the landscape at the resource area
differs from that of the surrounding region because it flanks the Colorado River. Through time, this river
has dissected the landscape to create a deep valley while simultaneously depositing sediment loads from
upstream areas within the valley and adjacent areas. As a result, the Turkey Bend Resource Area includes
floodplain/lowland acreage that is associated with the largest stream channel in Travis and Burnet
counties.
This property is a northeast to southwest trending terrace that is situated within a bend of the Colorado
River. LCRA’s Turkey Bend landholding can be divided into three gross environmental/topographic
zones: lowland/floodplain, upland margin, and upland.
Lowland/Floodplain Zone
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original bank of the Colorado River at an
elevation of 620 feet mean sea level (ft msl) up to 700 ft msl. Presently, approximately 60 percent of this
zone is normally inundated by the conservation pool level of 681 ft msl of Lake Travis. A pre-reservoir
map indicates that expanses of a lowland/floodplain zone were present at the far south central end of the
terrace landform at Turkey Bend, and that at its maximum, this zone was about 3,270 feet wide. It
consists of deep alluvial soils that have a surface veneer of fine sandy loam. From this south central area,
the width of this zone progressively decreases on both the upstream and downstream sides so that at the
far northwest and southeast ends of the current recreation area, steep cliffs descend from the uplands
straight down to the former river channel. LCRA acquired Turkey Bend for the development of Lake
Travis and maintains the property, in part, to serve as a buffer for flooding, so inundation is expected.
Sections of the western portion and major parts of the eastern portion lay within the floodplain.
Upland Margin Zone
The upland margin zone extends from about 700 to 800 ft msl. At the northwest and southeast ends of the
resource area this zone lies on very steep slopes with exposed shale, gravelly conglomerate, sandstone,
and limestone bedrock often visible on ground surfaces. Elsewhere, the terrain varies from slightly to
moderately sloping, and in these areas the generally shallow topsoils vary from gravelly clays to gravelly
fine sandy loams. The presence of a spring-fed tributary creek in the east-central part of the property and

44

a smaller tributary near the far eastern edge of the property add to the environmental variety of the upland
margin zone. The data suggest that, prior to modifications resulting from historic land use patterns, the
upland margin area may have supported diverse floral and faunal communities.
Upland Zone
Topographically, the upland zone extends from 800 ft msl upward. Upland surfaces have little
topographic relief. Limestone bedrock and/or patches of loose limestone rocks cover about one-half of
the land surface. Elsewhere shallow, cobbly, clay topsoils are present. Overall, this zone lacks the
environmental variety that is evident in the upland margin.

Cultural Background

Prehistoric Background
The Turkey Bend Resource Area lies within the Central Texas prehistoric cultural region (Prewitt 1981).
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). The
numerous excavations of major campsites conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf. Peter et al.
1982; Prewitt 1982) have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 13,000 years prior to
the coming of Europeans. Generally accepted prehistoric chronological divisions are as follows:
Paleoindian (pre-6800 B.C.), Early Archaic (6800 B.C. - 4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000 B.C. - 2000
B.C.), Late Archaic (2000 B.C. - A.D. 700), and Late Prehistoric (A.D. 700 - 1600) (Collins 1995).
Historic Background
The Turkey Bend property is carved from three original patents: the C. Lane Survey, the H. Phillips
Survey, and the H. Vickers Survey. These were granted in 1845 by the Republic of Texas (Lane), and the
state in 1846 (Vickers) and 1850 (Phillips).
In 1865 the Henry Thomas Masonic Lodge was founded there, and for a time the area was known as
Lodge Valley (Debo 1979). The lodge moved to Smithwick in 1876, and at some point the community
was renamed Turkey Bend, presumably in recognition of the numerous wild turkeys that were present.
Debo refers to Turkey Bend as a “pioneer hamlet”, and a sketch map in Thompson and Frasier (1996)
shows a community located far down on the bend, near the river, and just west of the Burnet County line.
Debo describes the Spanish Oak School as being in the Turkey Bend community, and states that it was
more commonly referred to as the Turkey Bend School. The school was in operation prior to 1899 and
operated at least until 1942, and possibly as late as 1948, when it was consolidated with the Smithwick
school district (Smyrl 2001). A photo from 1902 shows the students in attendance.
A USGS map from 1900-01, with “culture revised” in 1906, shows a dispersed community with perhaps
six structures across a portion of Turkey Bend. A school is not shown as such, but Spanish Oak Church is
clearly mapped just west of the Burnet/Travis County line, and is almost certainly the location of recorded
archaeological site 41BT322. No mention of a church has been found in historical records, but it is likely
that church services were held in the school building at this location on what is now LCRA property. It is
also unknown where the Masonic Lodge was located. A lodge might have been a communal property and
may have sustained such status as a school or church after its departure.
It is unclear when the first settlement on what is now LCRA property occurred, but it almost certainly
predates 1865, when the Henry Thomas Lodge met “in Lodge room (sic) near the residence of Bro. John

45

F. Burton” (Debo 1979:264). Charter members included Burton, M. Cox, J. Vickers, H. L. Hensel, and
Calvin Hall.
Following the various chains of title becomes quite complicated, largely due to intermarriages between
closely associated families, often after the death of a spouse. Surviving children were not necessarily
adopted, and retained their original surnames as new children were added to recombined families. It was
not uncommon for there to be 10 or 12 children under one roof. Various families apparently consolidated
land holdings through time, but also seemed to make land sales based on perceived future inheritances.
There are four structures seen on a map commissioned by LCRA in 1936 that have family names
associated with them. These are, from west to east, Phillips (TN-35), Boultinghouse (TN-34), Hall, and
Burton TN-32. The map did not extend above the 740 amsl contour, so any potential additional structures
at higher elevations may still have been present at that time.
The main economic pursuits at Turkey Bend were clearly farming and ranching, perhaps with an
emphasis on the former. On the 1936 map, the lower terraces are all marked as “cultivated fields.”
Photographic evidence shows a number of the Halls, along with Lewises and Dennistons, as members of
the Farmers Union, a collective bargaining organization that was an offshoot of the Grange (Thompson
and Frasier 1996:46). Statements made during probate hearings describe fences, dwellings, houses, barns,
outbuildings, and “appurtenances” being occupied continuously by families and tenants for cultivation
and pasture. The estate of H. S. Phillips, in 1935, listed 10 cattle, one horse, and 85 goats.
Economic diversification was attempted. Interestingly, in 1919, Brown Boultinghouse leased his property
to J. R. Yett, a member of a prominent local family, and a J. W. Hunnicut for oil and gas exploration. It is
unknown whether any wells were actually dug, but it is assumed that the venture was not successful. In
1925 Brown Boultinghouse leased 225 acres for $400 to a Tom Heine for timber cutting. Heine was
allowed to build gates and roads and permitted to camp. Timber cutting apparently was a successful
enterprise. In 1927, Hall traded timber rights to J. H. Shaffer in the amount of $500 for 350 acres.
Numerous cedar stumps bear witness to these activities. One of these “cedar chopper” camps is probably
represented by site 41TV536.
The properties were all conveyed to LCRA between 1938 and 1939. This includes the Wilson Tract (TN36), which was part of the original Vickers Survey, and is usually underwater. The 1906 map shows a
structure very near where the tract boundary should be, and clearly shows a portion of a road that led to a
river crossing known as the Phillips/Rod Lewis Swiftwater crossing to Post Oak Bend. These crossings
were certainly used, and photos show Burtons attending school with Boultinghouses, Grelles, DeSpains,
Krauses, Hollingsworths, Carpenters, and Coxes in 1910 at Haynie Flat, near Muleshoe Bend. As these
families grew and dispersed, many left their names on pieces of the landscape, such as Boultinghouse
Mountain, Shaffer Bend and Krause Springs, and in geologic descriptions such as Hensel and Smithwick.

Previous Investigations
Scientific archaeological studies in Central Texas can be traced to J. E. Pearce’s early 20th century
investigation of burned rock middens. A number of large-scale excavations later took place as the
Marshall Ford Reservoir (Lake Travis) was under construction. Investigations in Turkey Bend began in
the early 1980s when LCRA instituted a series of fence-building and brush-clearing projects. Numerous
sites were recorded, the majority of which would probably have escaped the attention of the earlier
researchers. Of interest was that several sites which had been recorded as isolated finds of a single
artifact, when revisited during recent surveys, were found to be relatively extensive scatters of prehistoric

46

materials, at times with fairly complex inventories of artifacts. Most recent work has been during the past
10 years as part of ongoing inventory on LCRA lands, and occasionally for minor development projects.
A total of 67 archaeological sites have been recorded, including 47 previously unrecorded (new) sites
documented during recent archaeological reconnaissance and survey. Fifty-three were prehistoric, 11 had
both prehistoric and historic components, and three were strictly historic. There were therefore a total of
76 archaeological components. These 76 components consisted of 10 lithic procurement sites, 23 lithic
scatters, 20 mixed use locales, 11 open camps, three historic house sites with cisterns, four foundations
(two with cisterns), and four historic artifacts scatters (one with an apparent nearby root cellar).
Of the 67 recorded sites, 44 appeared to warrant preservation or additional work if they cannot be avoided
by ground-disturbing activities. These 44 sites consist of 47 individual components: three historic house
sites with cisterns, four foundations (two with cisterns), three historic artifacts scatters (one with what
appears to be a nearby root cellar), two lithic procurement sites, 10 lithic scatters, 15 mixed use areas, and
10 open camps.
Sixty-six percent of the known archaeological sites at Turkey Bend have sufficient preservation to suggest
that their interpretive and research potentials are not exhausted. Sites buried along the lower terraces may
be in excellent condition. Some exposed or shallowly buried prehistoric sites in upland settings also
appear to have intact activity areas. Archival research indicates that some historic sites have the potential
to predate the Civil War, and are associated with persons who were instrumental in early settlement of the
area. Additional field work may help to date both the mapped and unmapped historic sites that are
present, and to place them in association with past residents. Additional artifact analyses and archival
work may clarify the economic status of the residents, especially in regard to the tenant farming system as
seen at nearby Muleshoe Bend.
The interpretive potential is high for both the historic and prehistoric sites. Groups such as the Burnet
County Historical Commission have an ongoing interest in the region and are connected with descendents
of the original settlers. Large areas containing relatively undisturbed prehistoric sites are becoming
increasingly rare. Such site distributions can be the focus of many different types of studies based on
varying theoretical perspectives. For example, the majority of site areas, both historic and prehistoric,
tend to face southeast, presumably taking advantage of both summer and winter climatic variations. The
effects of intermittent inundation on archaeological sites have been addressed in various studies (e.g.,
Lenihan et. al 1981, Will and Clark 1996, Malof 1999), but little research has been conducted on how site
stabilization can best be addressed or the effectiveness of such efforts (Ware 1989:31, Thorne 1988).
There is potential for long-term studies in this area, as well as site preservation in general.

Research Design and Methods

A files search indicated that site 41TV1849, the prehistoric open camp, was the only known site within
the construction impact area. Site 41TV1853, another open camp, is normally submerged under Lake
Travis and has no impacts associated with it, although portions of it will provide access to the water.
Historic site 41TV1835 is within the lease property, but no improvements or land use is planned for its
area. Field work was therefore designed to more fully investigate 41TV1849 and other areas which will
receive project-related impacts and to determine if there were areas potentially eligible for formal listing
as State Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. This was
accomplished by placing shovel tests systematically within areas to be developed, and judgmentally in at
least one spot thought to be of high probability of containing buried cultural materials. Shovel tests
averaged 40 cm in diameter, were excavated in 20 cm levels and matrix was passed through standard 1/4

47

in wire mesh. Total project impacts will be approximately 2 acres within a six area portion of the larger
24 acre lease. The most substantial impacts will be construction of an approximate 1-acre septic drain
field. Other impacts will be placement of piers and grading in preparation for building slab foundations.
In total, 26 shovel tests were placed within this six acre area, well above minimum survey standards as
suggested the by the Texas Historical Commission. Materials recovered from shovel tests were collected,
except in a few cases where recovery was extremely limited. Project maps, aerial imagery, and survey
stakes were used for ground orientation, and a GPS receiver was used to help document shovel test
locations. GPS shots were typically within a 3 m error range. Investigations took place on January 30
and February 1, 2008, by a crew of three archaeologists.

Results of Investigations

As a result of the investigations, the boundaries of 41TV1849 were enlarged considerably, primarily in
the septic drain field to the north (see Figure 10). Shovel testing indicated a very consistent soil profile
across the project area, consisting of reddish-brown gravelly to very gravelly sandy loams that would
contain increasing amounts of cobbles with depth, and typically terminated in reddish clays at about 40
cm. In no place were soils seen to exceed about 55 cm in depth.
Site 41TV1849 occupies a linear ridge at the southern edge of a broad lobe overlooking Lake Travis
(Colorado River), and a low interfluvial divide between two steep drainages just to the north, both
mapped as Travis gravelly soils. This is at the junction of an unnamed spring-fed tributary and the
Colorado River.
Materials observed on the surface during previous reconnaissance and recording included chipped stone,
ground stone and mussel shell. A Fairland point was observed in 1999. The site has been severely
impacted by looting, both in the past, presumably for decades, and recently.
Despite this, it was possible to gather additional information. Flake counts from shovel tests along the
ridge nearest the river had very large numbers of artifacts in the form of lithic debitage. Most of these
were small decorticate flakes. This contrasts with flake counts on the northern half of the ridge, and even
more pronouncedly, with recovery from the lobe located to the north in the septic drain field, where
recovery was very low. A number of time diagnostic artifacts were recovered. These consisted of:
Nolan – ST 2, L 2
Bulverde (?) stem – ST 6, L 2
Castroville – ST 9, L 1
Marcos – ST 26, L 2
Ensor – ST 21, L 2
Fairland – ST1, L 1
Scallorn – ST 20, L 3
Arrow tip (Perdiz?) – ST 14, L 2
Arrow (?) medial – ST 24, L 1
One mano was recovered from the ground surface near ST 5. Interestingly, there appeared to be few
flakes that had been used as tools, with only three or four recognizable as such. No formal unifaces were
recovered. Cores were occasionally found, but hard hammer flakes were rare. Burned rock was not
uncommon, but it was never found in high numbers. It was primarily quartzite, followed by sandstone,
including possible recycled metates. There was almost no burned limestone recognized. The only
organic material recovered was mussel shell, which was fragmentary and highly weathered, and a very

48

small amount of charcoal. Only at ST 6 did there appear to be development of soil with increased organic
content. The soil here was noticeably darker than elsewhere, although there was no distinct difference in
the burned rock count.
Site 41TV1849 is considered to be fully investigated. Although it undoubtedly contains additional time
diagnostic artifacts, there is little to suggest vertical or horizontal patterning (e.g., a Scallorn point was
found below 40 in gravels, a Nolan was found adjacent to the location of a Fairland) and the broad time
range so far represented merely indicates this was a highly favorable location for a long period of time.
The lack of organic preservation (the small amount of charcoal may be of recent origin) and lack of
recognizable burned rock features make any meaningful data recovery a highly tenuous prospect.
The site is almost certainly associated with 41TV1853, located at lower elevations past the tip of the
upper ridge. It extends to near the present river channel. Previous inventory level investigations found
burned rock, debitage, and bone at these lower elevations. A local avocational archaeologist also reported
a human burial near the tip of this lobe, exposed during very low water conditions (30 – 40 ft below
normal pool of 681 amsl). Portions of the site above normal pool are primarily gravels exposed along
slopes that have evidence of lithic procurement activities. This site is also subject to vandalism during
periods of low water. This site will have no direct impacts. When lake levels recede there will certainly
be foot traffic, but at expected lower frequency than at present, and under more controlled conditions.
Site 41TV1835 is recorded as the S. S. Burton House. Deed records and a site description conducted by
Dan Utley indicate the house was built around the turn of the century, perhaps 1909. Little remains but
some period fencing and low mounds of rubble and scattered artifacts generally typical of the period. An
April 1, 2005 obituary was published in the Austin American Statesman for Tiny Burton Naumann, born
in 1902 as the daughter of Silas Sylvania Burton and Mary Ellen Boultinghouse, whose “families farmed
and ranched along the Colorado River as early as the 1850s in an area called Turkey Bend…” The
unpublished Utley files indicate that 41TV1835 is fully recorded and ineligible for formal SAL or
National Register listing. However, no shovel testing was conducted at the site, and should future
development threaten it, minimal shovel testing is warranted in order to confirm there is no earlier
occupation. In addition, adjacent prehistoric buried lithic scatter 41TV1881 may extend into the lease
area and may overlap 41TV1835.
Site 41TV1860 and 41TV1882 are both lithic procurement locales located in cobbles along sloping
surfaces at the southern and northern edges, respectively, of the lease area. No impacts are planned for
either of these two areas, and neither site is felt to contain additional research potential, regardless.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA has agreed to lease approximately 21 acres of land located in its Turkey Bend property on the
northern bank of Lake Travis in western Travis County to the Young Men’s Business League for
development of the Sunshine Camp for underserved inner-city youth. Construction will involve the
building of six cabins, a restroom/shower facility, and an enclosed pavilion on cement slabs, an
office/medical hut and some small storage buildings as well as a ropes course on piers, and an
approximate 1-acre septic drain field that will serve two septic tanks, one at the shower and one at the
pavilion. Total project impacts are about 2 acres within a six acre portion of the larger lease area.
Development will directly impact site 41TV1849, a large open campsite that was occupied minimally
from Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric times. A total of 26 shovel tests was excavated that
demonstrate that despite the wealth of chipped stone tools and debitage, there is little additional

49

information that can reasonably be obtained from the site. Extensive looting and relatively shallow,
gravelly sandy loams have resulted in mixed horizontal and vertical components. Site 41TV1849 is
therefore considered ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TV1853 is normally submerged by Lake Travis, and no direct impacts are planned. Historic Site
41TV1835 is outside any area presently planned for use. Site 41TV1860 and 41TV1882 are minor
procurement locales located on the edge of the lease, and no impacts are planned for these areas either.
A standard clause in LCRA lease agreements states that the agreement is defaulted if the lessee engages
in knowing or reckless destruction or misappropriation of archaeological or historical resources, known or
unknown. This is particularly relevant to site 41TV1853, the SAL status of which remains unknown.
Increased presence and control of the property will help minimize impacts that are presently abated only
through chance encounters with law enforcement personnel. Additionally, any possible future
improvements to the camp will require an LCRA environmental review, which includes a cultural
resources assessment.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed as described.

Appendix
Shovel Test Data
Note: Pending a full lithic analysis, flake counts and categories are generalized. “Flakes” are typically
less then 2 cm in greatest dimension, usually decorticate or mostly so, and can include flake fragments
and chips. Counts are described as “very numerous,” “numerous,” “flakes,” “several,”, “some,”, “few,”
and “very few.” These can roughly be transcribed, in order, as more than 80, 40-80, 20-40, 15-20, 7-15
and 1-7. Exceptions to flake categories such as chunks, core fragments and burned shatter are typically
noted. The artifact assemblage can by considered typical of late stage tool manufacture and maintenance,
with production of bifaces a common task. (No additional analysis was conducted prior to curation.)

Abstract
During the period from mid November 2007 through January 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the LCRA’s new Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area
Capital Improvements Plan. Four proposed development areas totaling about 160 acres were field
surveyed through a combination of pedestrian survey and subsurface testing that consisted of both
mechanical auger testing and shovel testing.
As a result of the survey, four new cultural resource sites consisting of 41TV2287-2289 and 41TV2291
were discovered and assessed. Six previously recorded sites consisting of 41TV498-500, 41TV505,
41TV507, and 41TV508 were also revisited and assessed.
Prehistoric materials were found at 41TV498, 41TV500, 41TV505, 41TV508, 41TV2287, 41TV2288,
41TV2289, and 41TV2291. All of these sites can be classified as lithic scatters with lithic procurement
activities also evident at 41TV500, 41TV508, 41TV2287, 41TV228, and 41TV2289. In general, the
prehistoric materials at these sites are sparse and lack diversity. No diagnostic artifacts or evidences of
intact features were found at any of these prehistoric sites. Further, the archaeological materials at these
sites either occur in sandy loam deposits that show evidences of bioturbation or occur on upland surfaces
in shallow gravelly sandy loam deposits that are vertical mixed. Given these facts, all eight prehistoric
components examined during the field survey are assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places and not meriting formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks.
Sites with historic remains consist of 41TV498, 41TV499, 41TV505, 41TV507, and 41TV508. The
recovery of eight hand-forged square nails from two shovel tests placed adjacent to the presumed former
house location at 41TV499, represent the earliest identified artifacts found at any of the historic sites.
Avoidance of an approximately 40x40 meter area centered on these finds is recommended (see Figure
38). This avoidance area is assessed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and potentially
meriting formal designation as an SAL. If avoidance of this portion of 41TV499 is not feasible, then
additional investigations will be needed.
Historic remains at all other historic sites and at other portions of 41TV499 all appear to date from the
very late 19th century to as late as the mid 20th century. The dating of these components fits well with
the historic archival and oral history research conducted by Utley (1996) at Muleshoe Bend. His research
indicated that sites 41TV498, 41TV499, 41TV507, and 41TV508 were sharecropper house sites that were
a part of the Turner Farm. The tenant farming operation probably began in the 1880s or 1890s.
Production of cotton and corn on the lowland/floodplain terraces adjacent to the river channel was the
principal economic pursuit at the Turner Farm. Although the fifth historic period site, 41TV505, was not
researched by Utley, it is probable that it was associated with the tenant farming operation.
Except for the potential earlier component area at 41TV499 recommended for avoidance, the other
historic period archaeological remains at these five sites do not appear to have any potential in providing
new information about rural lifeways in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Utley’s historic archival
and oral history research has already provided a more detailed story about the history of the Turner Farm
and its tenants. Since Utley interviewed many individuals who were already quite elderly in 1996, it is
probable that very few of them or other individuals who were not interviewed are still living. Because of
the very limited potential for additional oral history research and lack of the archaeological potential to
provide new and interesting data, the historic components at 41TV498, 41TV505, 41TV507, 41TV508
are all assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not worthy of formal designation as SALs.
Similarly, the portion of site 41TV499 not recommended for avoidance is assessed as not NRHP or SAL
eligible.

57

Aside from the avoidance of a portion of site 41TV499, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
recommends that the proposed Muleshoe Bend CIP project be allowed to proceed without any further
cultural resource investigations. As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to
this project. Should the construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological
features during construction work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the
LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be
assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no
archeological materials are present.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing a set of park improvements in new Capital
Improvements Plan (CIP) for its Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area, which is located on the south side of
Lake Travis in Travis and Burnet counties, Texas (Figure 12). The improvements will include a multi-use
campground where overnight camping pads will be constructed along with a pavilion and restrooms with
showers at Development Area 1 (Figure 13). Three new day use areas that are proposed are shown as
Development Areas 2-4 on Figure 13. Facilities proposed for these day use areas include restrooms,
picnic tables, pavilions, special event areas, volleyball courts, playscapes, small floating docks, a disc golf
course, and interpretative kiosks. In total, about 160 of the 787 acres currently open to the public will be
developed during the implementation of the Muleshoe Bend CIP.
From November 2007 through January 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an
intensive cultural resource survey of the areas slated for development. The survey consisted of pedestrian
survey, shovel testing, and mechanical auger testing, Personnel who conducted the fieldwork consisted of
LCRA staff members Daniel Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and Andrew Malof and contracted
archaeologists Cody Kiker, Patrick Hatten, and Glenn Goode. The investigation was conducted under
TAC Blanket Permits #4412 and #4779, which were issued to the LCRA by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) for Calendar Years 2007 and 2008, respectively. All work was completed in
accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas Council of Archeologists
(1992).

Environmental Background
Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area is located within the Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Carr 1969:3). The Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area is a part of northeast to
southwest trending terrace that is situated within a giant bend of the Colorado River. The recent in-house
Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area Land Management Plan (LCRA 2006:14-16) provides information on
the three environmental/topographic zones present at the park. Data on these three zones –
lowland/floodplain, uplands margins, and uplands – is summarized in the next three paragraphs.
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original bank of the Colorado River at an
elevation of 620 ft mean sea level (msl) up to 700 ft (msl). Most of this zone is normally inundated by the
conservation pool level of 681 ft msl of Lake Travis. However, the eastern portion of Development Area
2, the northern edge of Development Area 3, and almost all of Development Area 4 lie within the
lowland/floodplain zone. Detailed mapping of the river basin undertaken just prior to the construction of
the lake indicates that within the park area, the lowland/floodplain terrace is as wide as 950 to 1,950 ft in
some areas. The lowland/floodplain zone consists of deep alluvial terrace deposits (Barnes 1981).

58

During times of low lake levels due to drought, staff examined cutbanks that indicate that this terrace has
40 ft alluvial deposits in some areas adjacent to the river channel.
The upland margins extend from about 700 to 800 ft msl. All of the Development Area 1 and the majority
of Development Area 3 are situated within this zone. In many parts of the park, base of the upland
margins are marked by moderately steep slopes that rise abruptly from the inner edges of the
lowland/floodplain. The surfaces of the upland margins are draped with Pleistocene-era

Figure 12. Section of the Pace Bend, Texas 7.5’ USGS map showing the LCRA Muleshoe Bend property
boundary outlined in red.

59

fluviatile terrace deposits (Barnes 1981). These terrace deposits are generally less than 4 ft in thickness
and include large volumes of lag gravels (Figure 14.
None of the proposed development areas are located in the upland zone. Topographically, the upland
zone extends from 800 ft msl upward. Upland surfaces have little to no topsoil. Outcrops of the Cow
Creek Limestone and Hammett Shale are frequently evident on ground surface in upland areas as are
surface exposures of Pleistocene lag gravel deposits (Barnes 1983)

Figure 13. Enlarged section of the Pace Bend, Texas 7.5’ USGS map showing the four proposed
Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area Capital Improvements Plan development areas outlined in black.

A variety of soil types is present within the four proposed development areas (Werchan et al 1974). The
Travis soils (TrC) cover the majority of the upland margins ridges and side slopes of Development Area
1. The representative soil profile of the Travis soils has an approximately 36 cm thick surface layer of
brown and light brown fine sandy loam that is slight acidic and contains a few rounded pebbles. The
underlying B21t and B22t horizons are usually a red to light red to reddish brown sandy clay of about 91
cm thickness.

Figure 14. Examples of chert cobbles in lag gravel deposit exposed on slope of upland margins at
Development Area 3.
The Doughtery loamy sand (DoA) is found across much of the lower elevations of Development Area 2
and in a small part of Development Area 1. The surface layer of pale brown to light brown loamy sand
ranges from 60 to 100 cm thickness. This deposit is well-drained and acidic in nature. The B horizon is a
red to light red sandy clay loam of approximately 90 thickness.
The Travis gravelly soils (TsD) are the principal soil type in higher elevations at the north end of
Development Area 2. This soil also covers small portions of Development Area 1. Where not eroded
from previous land use, this soil usually has a surface layer that is an approximately 46 cm thick brown
gravelly fine sandy loam. The upper part is brown in color while the lower part is light reddish brown.
The next layer is the red gravelly sandy clay B horizon that is typically 80 cm in thickness.
The Tarrant soils and Rock outcrop (TdF) occupy the entire Development Area 4 tract. In some areas,
limestone outcrops and/or smaller loose limestone fragments cover the ground surface. Elsewhere, the
surface layer is an approximately 18 cm thick dark grayish brown stony clay or stony clay loam. This
deposit is underlain by limestone bedrock.
A final minor soil type is the Volente complex (VoD) which is a calcareous soil that occurs in the
bottomlands of several narrow valleys in Development Area 3. In representative profile, Volente
complex soils have a surface deposit of dark grayish brown silty clay loam of about 56 cm thickness. The

61

next layer is usually an approximately 36 cm deposit of dark brown silty clay. Deeper, the B horizon is a
dark brown silty clay of 25 cm thickness.
Vegetation found on the alluvial terraces such as the eastern part of Development Area 2 and northern
edge of Development Area 3 consists a predominantly herbaceous community that includes
bermudagrass, switchgrass, and eastern gammagrass with some buttonbush and mesquite trees also
present. Post oak, live oak, and Buckley’s yucca, cow pen daisy, Texas croton, and wooly croton are also
found on these terraces.
In the upland margins in remaining development areas, dense thickets of Ashe juniper are the
predominant vegetation along with some live oak, post oak, and mesquite trees (Figure 15). Shrub
species including agarita, hog plum, prickly pear, brasil, Texas persimmon, twist leaf yucca, and
mountain laurel are very common. In some areas, especially at the locations of former historic house
sites, white brush, tassajila catci, and prickly pear catci are very dense (Figure 16).

Culture History
Prehistoric Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region (Prewitt 1981; Ellis et al. 1995).
The Central Texas archeological record has typically been divided into four main subdivisions. These
periods, in chronological order from most ancient to most recent are: the Paleoindian, the Archaic, the
Late Prehistoric, and the Historic periods. These periods are differentiated mostly by broadly defined
subsistence patterns. The prehistoric part of this chronology has been subdivided further into phases
based largely on changes in material culture, especially projectile point styles. Combined, this
information begins to describe the 11,500 year history of human occupation in Central Texas.
A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been revised by Johnson and Goode
(1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and geomorphological
data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins (1995), who indicates climatic
variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and Goode. Though these chronologies
are invaluable to our knowledge base for Central Texas archeology, they must be used as a stepping-stone
to expand our understanding of the cultural history of an area by addressing the question of why changes
occurred in various regions and cultures when they did.
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf.
Peter et al. 1982; Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied
for at least 11,500 years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these
millennia, prehistoric peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting
seasonally available plant and animal resources.
Historic Background
Most of the historic background information in the following paragraphs is taken from Utley’s (1996)
previous historical study of the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. A number of local area residents,
including some who lived within Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area on the historic tenant farms as children,
were interviewed by Utley. Their recollections of life on the tenant farms as well as descriptions of the
farmsteads are found in Utley’s (1996) report entitled Through Boundary Waters, which was published by
the LCRA.
Although some undocumented historic period activities may have occurred earlier, it was not until the
1870s that sustained, intensive settlement of the immediate Muleshoe Bend area began. Muleshoe Bend
has traditionally been considered to be a part of a dispersed, rural community called Haynie Flat. While
this community did not have a commercial center, there was at least one cotton gin in operation in the
early 20th century. It was located about one-half mile south of the project area. The real focal point of
the community was the local school and nearby cemetery, which are located about 2 miles south of the
park. The one-room school was started in the 1870s and offered only seven or eight grades. The school
operated until 1949, when it was consolidated with the Spicewood school.
The first settlers in the vicinity of Muleshoe Bend were subsistence farmers. They planted small patches
of corn and vegetables, raised a few cattle and hogs, and hunted wild game. Although the rocky, shallow
soils west of Austin made farming difficult, by the late nineteenth century there appears to have been
increased economic emphasis on cotton farming area on the broad floodplain terrace expanses adjacent to

63

the Colorado River at Muleshoe Bend. Specifically, the economic system of land tenancy, that was
prevalent across the eastern half Texas at that time, was found on much of the property that now
comprises Muleshoe Bend Park. Utley notes that this was an economic system “where cashless tenants
worked for landlords who lacked sufficient capital to pay wages.” Basically, the production of crops took
the place of rent, and tenants worked on shares, typically referred to as “thirds” or “fourths,” with the
fraction referring to the amount of the tenant’s crop that was owed to the landlord for use of his property.
Tenant farm families were provided houses on the land they worked by the landowner. Sometimes, too,
the owner provided farm machinery for crop production.
At Muleshoe Bend, George S. Turner, a prominent rancher, started a sharecropping farm operation in the
late 19th century. Following his death in 1903, his granddaughter, Lura Penelope “Nella” Turner Evans
inherited this land and oversaw the farm operations until she sold the land to the LCRA in 1939. Today,
the descendants of some of the sharecropper families who were tenants on the Turner Farm still live in the
vicinity of Muleshoe Bend Park. The locations and family names of the occupants of five tenant farm
houses are shown on a 1936 era contour map made by LCRA land surveyors of the then proposed Lake
Travis basin (Figure 17).
The archeological remains of six tenant farmsteads and one unrelated owner-occupied farmstead are
among the cultural resource sites within the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. All houses and
outbuildings at five of these sites were deliberately removed by LCRA when it purchased the Turner
Farm over 70 years ago. LCRA allowed one of the farmsteads to remain occupied into the 1950s, and
then demolished that house and its associated outbuildings. In some cases, underground cement-walled
cisterns, root cellars, trash dumps, portions of barbed wire fences, and remnants of house foundations are
still discernable at these sites. Limited numbers of artifacts such as metal fragments and broken glass and
ceramics are also visible on ground surface at the sites.
Cotton farming and its accompanying tenant farming system waned in the 1930s and 1940s across Texas,
at approximately the same time that the LCRA was purchasing the Turner Farm to become a part of its
Lake Travis lands. In adjacent areas not bought by the LCRA, cattle ranching became the predominant
economic activity in the following decades along with land leasing for deer hunting. In more recent
years, many areas adjacent to Muleshoe Bend Park have been subdivided for rural residency with most
occupants either being either retirees or workers who commute to and from Austin each day.

Previous Archaeological Investigations
In the 1930s, when archeologists conducted a reconnaissance survey of the Lake Travis basin prior to the
construction of Mansfield Dam, one archeological site, 41TV250, was recorded in the Muleshoe Bend
park tract. Jackson (1938) described it as a small prehistoric campsite with shallow deposits. No
excavation work was recommended at that time. In 1979, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. recorded 16
additional cultural resource sites within the Muleshoe Bend

64

cases, the family names are shown with the house locations.
Recreation Area in advance of a proposed LCRA brush control project (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). These
consist of sites 41BT147 and 41BT148 in Burnet County and sites 41TV495 through 508
in Travis County. Site 41TV250 was also revisited during that investigation. In all, Prewitt and
Associates recorded 13 prehistoric sites, 3 historic sites, and 1 multi-component site that is primarily

65

historic, but includes a small amount of prehistoric material. Most of the prehistoric sites were described
as upland lithic scatters and lithic procurement areas. Only four of the prehistoric sites were described as
having campsite materials. The historic period sites all appeared to be former late 19th to early 20th
century house sites. Although the houses had been removed, surface features including cisterns,
foundation stones, rock walls, and root cellars were still evident. In summarizing the historic sites, Utley
(1996:64) later noted that of the four historic sites recorded by Prewitt and Kotter, 41TV499 and
41TV507 appeared to be the most stable and had been less damaged. Overall, Prewitt and Kotter (1979)
recommended avoidance of 13 of the prehistoric and historic sites during the proposed brush clearing
program.
Additional cultural resource survey work was conducted by the LCRA archaeological staff intermittently
from 1995 through 1998, and on a few occasions thereafter. Staff investigations in the 1995-1997 era
primarily focused on historic period house sites in conjunction with Utley’s (1996) historical research.
Other fieldwork that focused on prehistoric sites was conducted during droughts when areas normally
covered by the lake were exposed. All of these investigations were primarily reconnaissance level work,
and importantly, did not include any shovel testing or other types of subsurface probing. As a result of all
previous investigations, a total of 33 archaeological sites had been recorded prior to the current
investigation for the proposed CIP.

Methodology
Prior to the field survey, a cultural resource file search including a review of data on the THC’s
computerized Site Atlas database along with LCRA’s internal cultural resource files was conducted. The
file search showed that there were five recorded cultural resource sites within the four proposed
development areas. These consisted of the north end of site 41TV498 in Development Area 1, the eastern
parts of sites 41TV499 and 41TV505 within Development Area 2, 41TV508 within Development Area 3,
and the southern part of 41TV500 within Development Area 4. Additionally, it appeared that site
41TV507 was located either within or immediately adjacent to the southeast edge of Development Area 3.
The review of LCRA’s internal files also showed that LCRA had previously sponsored Utley’s (1996)
historical study of Muleshoe Bend that included archival research and oral history interviews. The results
of that study were reviewed prior to the field investigation.
The field survey for the CIP project consisted of 100% pedestrian survey along with shovel and auger
testing of all four proposed development areas. Additionally, areas immediately south of Development
Area 1 and east of Development Area 3 were surveyed because of concerns of secondary impacts to
previously recorded sites 41TV498 and 41TV507.
Appropriate USGS quadrangle maps and aerial photographs were used for ground orientation. During the
pedestrian survey, the archeologists walked 30-m transects across the project area. Bare and eroded areas
on the ground surface were examined for the presence of cultural materials. Overall, ground surface
visibility was found to be poor in most areas. Shovel tests were placed at locations where ground surface
visibility was poor in areas thought to have a potential for archeological materials. All shovel and auger
tests were excavated to a depth of 100 cm or to the top of the B horizon clay. Other shovel tests were
utilized to examine the subsurface deposits of previous recorded and newly discovered archaeological
sites and help define their boundaries. A total of 85 shovel tests and 35 auger tests were excavated
(Figure 18). All shovel and auger tests were excavated in 20 cm levels with soil matrix passed through ¼
wire mesh artifact recovery. The number of subsurface tests easily meets the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) requirements for subsurface examination of projects in the100 to 200 acre range.
Figure 19 shows the numbered locations of all subsurface tests within the four development areas. Data

66

generated from the shovel and auger tests were recorded on LCRA shovel test forms. Appendices 1 and 2
provide artifact tabulations and soil profile descriptions, respectively, for these subsurface probes.
All sites were recorded on the TexSite database and documented with sketch maps. Site were also
photographed and plotted on aerial maps.

Survey Results
As a result of the survey, four new cultural resource sites were discovered and six previously recorded
sites were revisited. Descriptions and assessments of these sites are provided by development area in the
following paragraphs.
Development Area 1
Site 41TV498
The far north edge of this cultural resource site is located within the southern edge of Development Area
1 (Figure 20). Topographically, the site is located on a terrace in the upland margins with a moderate
sized tributary inlet situated about 60 meters west of the west edge of the site. The site covers an area
measuring about 300 meters on a north-south line by 150 meters on an east-west line. The long axis of
the site is bisected by the main park entry road, and the site is currently covered with dense brush and
thick grasses.

67

41TV498 was originally recorded during Prewitt and Associates, Inc.’s survey for proposed brush
clearing as a prehistoric lithic scatter/procurement site situated on the west side of the park entry road
(Prewitt and Kotter 1979). The site was assessed as not requiring avoidance since materials appeared to
be surficial and partially disrupted. In 1996 and 1997, LCRA staff expanded the site

68

all subsurface tests.
boundaries eastward across the park entry road where historic features and artifacts were found as were
additional prehistoric materials.
The historic component is a late nineteenth to mid twentieth century farmstead that is shown on the prereservoir 2 ft contour map as the Trammell house. Utley’s (1996) research indicates that the historic

69

component was one of seven tenant farm houses that were a part of the Turner Farm. While all of the
other farm house sites were demolished in the 1930s when LCRA became the owner of the land, the
Trammell house was left standing and it continued to be occupied by renters into the 1950s.
Historic features that are still evident at the site consist of a concentration of foundation stones at the
southwest end of the site where the house once stood, a collapsed outbuilding (Figure 21) located at the
southeast end of the site, and a cattle chute with a dilapidated cattle pen enclosure (Figure 22) which are
located at the northwest end of the site. Individual artifacts noted on

Figure 21. Remains of collapsed outbuilding at site 41TV498.

Figure 22. Remains of cattle chute and associated stock pen at site 41TV498.

ground surface at the site include window screens, bedsprings, a tractor seat, and fragments of glass, sheet
metal, and crockery. Two larger trash piles, that are located on the opposite side of the entry road from
the historic features, were also observed in 1996.
After the main features were relocated during the present survey and the surface was examined for
artifacts, shovel testing was untaken. Eleven positive shovel tests (STs 69, 70, and 74 through 84) were
recorded (Figure 23). These positive shovel tests indicate that the majority of the subsurface historic
artifacts cluster around the former house (see foundation stones on Figure 23).

Figure 23. Map of site 41TV498 showing locations of features and shovel tests.

71

and the collapsed outbuilding although the surface scatter of historic artifacts extends northward to the
area of the former cattle chute and stock pen. Historic artifact yield was densest in and around the areas
of the former house and collapsed outbuilding where STs 77, 79, and 80 were excavated (See Appendix
1). At ST 80 which had the highest artifact yield, several nails, a piece of copper wire, a whiteware sherd,
and several pieces of glass were recovered. These are most probably related to the former house and
associated domestic activities. These artifacts and the other recovered at the site confirm previous
estimations of an occupation that dated from the very late 19th through mid 20th centuries. While the
historic artifact yield in shovel testing is low, it should be noted that previous investigators had noted the
presence of two historic trash dumps further southwestward on the opposite side of the park entry road in
areas that were not examined for the current development project.
The shovel testing indicated that widely dispersed prehistoric artifacts, consisting of about 29 chert flakes,
one chert core, one mussel shell fragment are also present. These occur in nine shovel tests throughout all
of the twenty cm levels in the one-meter deep shovel tests. Thus, prehistoric artifact density is very low.
Only two burned rock fragments were found, and these are just as likely to be related to historic activities.
No prehistoric features or diagnostic artifacts were found, nor have any been reported by previous
surveyors.
Given the results of the current and previous archaeological investigations of the historic component, and
the relatively late date of this component, no further archaeological investigation of the portion of the
historic component within the CIP area is recommended. All pertinent oral history and archival data has
already been retrieved during Utley’s previous study. The prehistoric component appears to represent a
low density lithic scatter. Based this fact, along with the absence of prehistoric features or diagnostic
artifacts, no further investigation of the prehistoric component is recommended. Overall, the portion of
site 41TV498 that was investigated for the current CIP project is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and not meriting formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL).

Site 41TV2291
This prehistoric lithic scatter site is located within the east central end of Development Area 1 on gently
sloping terrain on the upland margins zones. Although no prehistoric materials are visible on ground
surface, small numbers of chert flakes were recovered at depths ranging from 20 to 80 cm below ground
surface in a cluster of four subsurface tests - STs 63, 113, 114, and 119 (Figure 24). No artifacts were
found in level 5 (80 to 100 cm) in any of the shovel tests, and most the positive and surrounding negative
yield shovel tests struck either basal clay or gravelly deposits at approximately 100 cm below ground
surface.
The site extends over an area measuring 140 m on a NW-SE line by 75 m on a NE-SW line. Total artifact
recovery from the four positive shovel tests consisted of 10 small chert tertiary flakes and chips. No
features or diagnostic artifacts were seen. The topsoils are the site range from loamy sands to fine sandy
loams. The fact that such soils are susceptible to bioturbation probably explains the 60 cm vertical range
of the artifacts. Site 41TV2291 is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not worthy of
formal designation as an SAL.

Development Area 2
Site 41TV499
This historic period site is located in the northwest part of Development Area 2 on northeast part of an
upland terrace that overlooks the former Colorado River floodplain (Figure 25). The site

73

Figure 25. Development Area 2 showing the locations of sites 41TV499 and 41TV505 and locations of all
subsurface tests.
was first recorded during Prewitt and Associates, Inc.’s 1979 survey for LCRA’s proposed brush clearing
activities (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). Faint traces of a dirt road that extended on an east-west line from an
existing gravel-covered park road were noted along the southern end of the site. Overall, Prewitt and
Kotter (1979:3.4) estimated that the site covers an area of about 100 meters on an east-west line by 70
meters on a north-south line.

74

Features noted at the site during the original recording were described as including an apparent limestone
chimney foundation that was associated with two large, flat limestone boulders that were thought to
possibly be foundation piers for a house. The investigators stated that it appeared that the house had been
deliberately removed. Two segments of a low limestone wall were also seen, as were two subsurface
cisterns and a short section of aligned wooden fence posts. Prewitt and Kotter (1979:3.5) stated that
cultural debris seen at the site included pre-1914 era glass was indicative of a late 19th to early 20th
century occupation. They recommended avoidance of the site during the proposed brush clearing
activities.
Subsequent archival research by Utley (1996:69-70) indicated that this historic site was occupied by the
Boyd Heffington family in 1936, and that the family was among the tenants on the Turner Farm. Utley
located and interviewed Lyndon Heffington, a son who resided in Marble Falls. He stated that he was
seven years old when the family moved off the tenant house site, and did not remember much about the
farm, except for the in-ground cisterns associated with the house site. At the time of the interview, he was
the only surviving Heffington child who had lived at the site. Utley (1996:70) did learn from another
interviewee, Bea Ruth Tatum Collier that the Tatum family had also resided on the Heffington house site
for several years, and that the Robert Holliway family may have also resided in the house briefly.
Although the site has been become severely overgrown with invasive species, principally various catci
and bee brush, it was relocated during the current survey investigation (Figure 26). The cistern at the
western edge was found to have been capped with concrete in recent years for safety concerns since it lies
near one of the current park roads. The foundation stones and chimney foundation were relocated in the
central part of the site as was the limestone wall section shown on Kotter’s previous field sketch map to
the west of the house. However, the cistern previously mapped at the far northeast end of the site could
not be found, nor was the survey crew able to relocate the line of several limestone blocks previously
mapped by Kotter in 1979 on the far east edge of the site. It is probable that these features are now
covered by the dense vegetation present at that part of the site.
Six positive shovel and auger tests (STs 13, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40) were excavated at the site. Artifact
yield was high in the first two levels of ST 35, which was excavated about 20 meters northwest of the
house and chimney foundation stones (see Appendix 1). Debris recovered from Level 1 of that shovel
test included seven square nails, one whiteware sherd, one brown slipped Albany type sherd, one wire
fragment, one metal bolt, three sheet metal fragments, one clear glass fragment, and one thick mussel
shell fragment. In Level 2 of ST 35 consisted of a horse shoe fragment, one metal door or drawer handle,
one metal strip fragment, and one shotgun shell cap.
Elsewhere, ST 39, which was placed about 10 meters south of the house and chimney foundation stones,
had one square nail, one blue plastic button, one clear glass fragment, one curved clear glass fragment,
and one patinated clear glass fragment in the first level. Level 2 of that shovel test was sterile. Five other
shovel tests yielded very small numbers of historic period artifacts. Based on the results of the shovel
testing, it appears that the majority of the historic artifact assemblage is located within 10 to 20 meters of
the former house.
Several prehistoric artifacts were also found during the subsurface testing. These consist of single chert
tertiary flakes found in Levels 1 and 6 in ST 13 and a chert secondary flake that was recovered in Level 1
of ST 38. No prehistoric diagnostics, burned rocks, or other artifact classes were noted. Since prehistoric
materials are extremely sparse, there appears to be no potential for any further useful investigation of the
prehistoric component at this site.

75

Figure 26. 41TV499 site map showing locations of features, subsurface tests, and proposed avoidance
area.
To conclude, the current investigations indicate that site 41TV499 covers an area measuring about 140
meters on a NE-SW line by 80 meters on a NW-SE line. Most of the historic period artifacts found at
41TV499 came from subsurface tests in the vicinity of the former house. Poor ground surface visibility
severely hampered inspection of the ground surface for additional artifacts, and is responsible, too, for the

76

inability to relocate two features at the northeast and eastern edges of the site. Although the majority of
the historic artifact assemblage appears to be typical of very late 19th to early 20th century sites, several
square nails were found in STs 35 and 39 in the area where the old house is thought to have stood. These
could be evidence of an earlier historic period structure had once stood at this location. Because of the
potential significance of the area around the old house, this part of the site is recommended for avoidance
(see Figure 26). The portion of the site around the old house is assessed as potentially NRHP and SAL
eligible. The remainder of the site is assessed as not NRHP and SAL eligible.
41TV505
This prehistoric and historic site is located at the northern end of Development Area 2 (see Figure 25). It
was originally recorded during the Prewitt and Associates, Inc. survey for an LCRA brush control project
in 1979 (Prewitt and Kotter 1979:3.8-3.9). The site was described as containing a possible limestone
chimney foundation, a light scatter of historic debris and a light scatter of prehistoric lithic debris located
on a small sand and gravel knoll approximately 30 meters south/ southwest of the lake in the northeastern
part of the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. It was also noted that the site had already been disturbed by
previous recreational activities, namely camping and picnicking. When revisited in 1997 and 2005 the
site was described as further disturbed by recreational use.
During the current investigation, the cut limestone possible chimney foundation was relocated (Figure
27). This limestone pile is less than 2x2 meters and contained smaller, irregularly shaped rocks. Beyond
this pile of cut limestone, no prehistoric or historic artifacts were found in shovel tests or on the surface
other than recent camping and flood debris.

Development Area 3
41TV507
The historic site is located immediately east of the eastern edge of Development Area 3 (Figure 28). It
was originally recorded during the Prewitt and Associates, Inc. survey for an LCRA brush control project
in 1979 (Prewitt and Kotter 1979:3.10-3.11). The site was described as a former house site that is located
on low gravelly sandy rise in the northeastern part of the Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area. Historic
features discovered consisted of an approximately 10x10 meter limestone foundation outline that
appeared to represent the location of a former
house structure, a subsurface cistern with an above ground concrete collar, and a 2x3 meter subsurface
depression with corner wooden posts that was thought to represent a root cellar. Artifacts seen by the
surveyors included whiteware and stoneware sherds, glass fragments, and metal fragments. The artifact
assemblage suggested a late 19th to early 20th century occupation.
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. recommended avoidance of the site during brush clearing activities since the
site appeared to be fairly intact except for the removal of house structure.
Utley’s (1996:73) subsequent archival research and oral history interviews determined that the house had
been occupied by the John Tatum family and that it had been a part of the Turner Farm complex. Utley’s
interview with family daughter Bea Ruth Tatum Collier provided data on the former house. It apparently
was a four room structure of board-and-batten construction. These rooms consisted of two bedrooms, a
living room, and a dining room/kitchen. There were two

77

doors that faced onto a front porch. According to Mrs. Collier, the house was typical of the tenant houses
on the Turner Farm.
Mrs. Collier also indicated that the root cellar that had been noted by Prewitt and Kotter was a hand-dug
storm cellar that had heavy logs on its top and a doored entry (Figure 29). She remembered that there had
been a smokehouse, a chicken house, and a barn that also served as an automobile garage at the site. She
also recollected that the cistern was not always dependable. Thus, the family hauled water from the river
in barrels. To conserve water, the family bathed in the river, and watered their stock at the river.
According to local informants, the John Tatum house burned down around 1934.

78

and locations of all subsurface tests.
During the time that Utley was conducted his research, the LCRA archaeological staff, revisited site
41TV507 to map the site and more precisely plot its location on a USGS map. In 2005, the LCRA
archaeological staff also checked the condition of the site. An additional feature, which consists of a
dispersed cluster of cut limestone foundation stones, was observed about 35 meters northwest of the
house foundation outline. These cut stones could mark the location of the barn,

79

Figure 29. View of storm cellar depression at site 41TV507 with faintly visible crew member standing in
the bottom of the depression.
garage, or smokehouse that had been described by Mrs. Collier. Because these stones lay on a terrace
edge overlooking a small tributary drainage, they may, instead, represent a trash dump.
During the present survey investigation, the site was relocated (Figure 30). The cistern, house foundation
outline, and storm cellar were easily identified, as was the new feature that had been discovered northwest
of the house area in 2005 . This site does not appear to have been as densely overgrown with invasive
species as other historic sites within the Muleshoe CIP areas. Thus, surface artifacts are more apparent on
ground surface especially immediately north of the house foundation outline. In that area various clear
and light green glass dish and glass fragments were seen as well as whiteware ceramic sherds.
Four shovel tests (STs 93, 94, 104, and 105) were also excavated to further gauge the potential for buried
archaeological remains. Topsoil deposits were found to range from 15 to 33 cm. Only two, STs 93 and
104, produced any artifacts, and the artifact yields of these were very minor. ST 93 had one metal fence
staple and a very small piece of sheet metal while at ST 104 the artifacts consisted of three clear glass
fragments. All of these artifacts were found in Level 1.
During the present field investigation, GPS readings indicated that the previous plotting of the site on
USGS maps was incorrect. As a result of the GPS readings, the site’s location was moved about 95
meters northeastward. The corrected location places the site just outside of the eastern boundary of
Development Area 3. At that point, field investigation of the site was halted.
However, the revisit to site 41TV507 did indicate that preservation and visibility of features are much
better than at other historic sites investigated during the survey. The good preservation of

80

Figure 30. 41TV507 site map showing locations of features and subsurface tests.

81

features may be due to the fact that LCRA did not have to use heavy machinery to demolish the house
since it burned down several years prior to LCRA’s purchase of the property. Despite the good
preservation of features, the shovel testing had a low yield. This site is among the group of tenant farmer
house sites that were a part of the Turner Farm that was researched by Utley (1996). The potential for
additional oral history data is thought to be very limited. Overall, the site has been documented and is
assessed as not eligible for NRHP or formal SAL listing.

41TV508
This historic site was first described in Prewitt and Kotter’s (1979:3.10) brush clearing report. It is
located in the western part of the Muleshoe CIP Development Area 3 on an upland terrace ridge (see
Figure 27). The site overlooks the now inundated former Colorado River floodplain terrace which lies to
the north of the site. The site was described as consisting of a few structural remains, a subsurface
cistern with an above ground collar (Figure 31), and an artifact concentration that appeared to date to the
early 20th century. The site was assessed as insignificant because of the absence of any substantial
structural remains.

Figure 31. View of above-ground collar of subsurface water cistern at site 41TV508.
Utley’s (1996) archival and oral history research confirmed that this site was another tenant farm house
site that was a part of the Turner Farm. Utley was not able to obtain much oral history data on this site,
but was able to learn that the site had been occupied by the Reeves and Vivian Tatum family for several
years in the 1930s.
In 1996, the LCRA archaeological staff revisited the site to map features and further assess the site’s SAL
status. The site location was replotted on a USGS map and a scaled map of the site was drawn depicting
its few features and scattered debris. Prehistoric materials representing an ephemeral prehistoric lithic
scatter were also noted. Based on the revisit, the LCRA staff assessed the site as not meriting formal
designation as an SAL.

82

During the current investigation, the site was relocated, but was found to be very densely overgrown with
tassajila, white brush, prickly pear, various grasses, Ashe juniper, and mesquite (see Figure 16). The
cistern was relocated at the southern of the site, and shallow depression was also observed about 20
meters east of the cistern (Figure 32). Elsewhere, a large limestone block was found on ground surface
in the north central part of the site. A cluster of late 19th to early 20th century artifacts was seen on
ground surface in the central part of the site about 10 to 30 meters north of the previously mentioned
shallow depression.

Figure 32. Map of site 41TV508 showing locations of features and subsurface tests.
Shovel Test 92 was then excavated on the eastern edge of this surface artifact cluster. This shovel test
yielded a high density of historic materials within a 12 cm thick cm surface deposit that had an ashy gray

83

color suggestive of previous burning. Artifacts from the shovel test consisted of 23 patinated clear bottle
glass fragments, 29 patinated clear flat glass fragments, 3 patinated brown bottle glass fragments, 2
patinated aqua bottle glass fragments, 5 milk glass fragments, 24 rusted metal fragments, 7 whiteware
sherds, 1 porcelin sherd, 4 light blue glazed flatware sherds, 1 blue and white glazed rim sherd, 1 orange
or terracotta colored sherd, and 3 tan stoneware sherds with interior black glaze. Beneath this gray, ashy
soil lens, the red clay B horizon was encountered at 12 cm below ground surface. Overall, the results of
this shovel test were suggestive of a trash dump at which materials had been purposely burned.
The other five shovel tests containing historic materials yielded much smaller amounts of historic
materials (See Appendix 1). Sparse numbers of prehistoric chert flakes, a core, and a battered cobble
were found in the five subsurface tests at the north end of the site within the approximately 30 to 35 cm
thick topsoil deposits. Several of these shovel tests also contained burned chert chunks but no burned
rock clusters were noted. Since historic artifacts were also present with the burned rocks, it is uncertain
whether these burned chunks are associated with the prehistoric component or are burned materials
associated with the historic period occupation.
In summary, site 41TV508 is a multi-component site containing a late 19th to early 20th century historic
sharecropper component associated with the Turner Farm and a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter. No
definite location for the house structure was found during the current fieldwork or during past
investigations. Observed features consist of a subsurface water cistern with an above ground collar and a
shallow depression that may represent a storm cellar. One artifact cluster was observed on ground surface
in the east central part of the site. A shovel test excavated at that location produced a high yield of
artifacts within an ashy deposit suggestive of former burning. The historic artifact assemblage appears to
date from the late 19th to early 20th centuries.
Prehistoric materials lack diversity and no features or diagnostic artifacts have ever been found at this
site. As with two previous assessments by Prewitt and Kotter in 1979 and LCRA archaeological staff in
1996, site 41TV508 continues to be rated as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not meriting
formal designation as an SAL.
Site 41TV2287
This prehistoric lithic scatter/procurement site is situated on a heavily eroded Pleistocene terrace ridge in
Development Area #3 (see Figure 28). The site appears to cover an area measuring 135 meters on a NWSE line by about 80 meters on a NE-SW line (Figure 33). The site is wooded with Ashe juniper, and
ground surface visibility was found to be poor due to dense grasses and brush. As a result, only a few
pieces of lithic debitage were evident on ground surface. Six shovel tests were subsequently excavated to
better determine the site boundaries and evaluate the subsurface potential of the site deposits. The four of
the shovel tests excavated on the main ridge produced a few pieces of lithic debitage with most of it
coming from the upper 40 cm of the very gravelly sandy loam deposits. These gravels mostly consist of
chert cobbles with a few quartzite cobbles also being present. The only tool fragment recovered was a
bifacially worked secondary flake that was recovered from Shovel Test #6. Moderate amounts of burned
chert cobbles and fragments were also evident throughout gravelly deposits that were shovel tested.
However, no burned rock clusters suggestive of features were seen, and it is probable that the burning is
the result of natural grass fires.
Since the gravels were laid many thousands of years before human occupation, it is probable that all
artifacts deeper than 10 cm below ground surface have worked their way downward into the gravelly
deposits by bioturbation. This potential for vertical mixing along with the lack of diagnostic artifacts and
features leads to an assessment that this site is not NRHP or SAL eligible.

Site 41TV2288
Site 41TV2288 is a prehistoric lithic procurement/lithic scatter site that is situated in a narrow creek
valley at the base of the slope of an upland terrace in Development Area 3 (see Figure 28). Since chert
and quartzite cobbles occur in high density at the base of this slope, there is little vegetation to obscure the
ground surface (Figure 34). The gravel exposure measures about 40 meters on an N-S line by 8 meters on
an E-W line (Figure 35).

Figure 34. Archaeologist examining chert biface preform at base of upland slope at Site 41TV2288.
Several concentrations of cores and early stage bifaces were observed within the gravel deposit in the
central and northern parts of the site. The density of these materials is approximately 3 to 4 specimens
per 2 square meters. Due to the steepness of the slope, it is possible that some artifacts have moved
downslope through time. No shovel testing was attempted due to the density of the cobbles on ground
surface.
The site appears to have been a favored locale for procurement of chert cobbles and for initial reduction
of materials. Numerous exposures of chert and quartzite were noted on eroded sections of upland terrace
slopes throughout the course of the field survey. Although occasional evidences of tested cobbles and
cores were observed at some of those exposures, none of those has the density of materials like that at Site
41TV2288.
Although sites such as 41TV2288 are an integral part of the overall prehistoric settlement pattern at
Muleshoe Bend, the apparent lack of diagnostic artifacts and features hinders the potential for any useful
further investigations. Furthermore, there is a high probability that artifacts have been displaced by
downslope movement. Therefore, the site is assessed as not eligible for NR or SAL listing.

86

Figure 35. 41TV2288 site map.
Site 41TV2289
This prehistoric site is situated in Development Area 3 and extends over an area measuring 150 meters
east-west by 60 meters north-south (Figure 36). The site is located on an upland terrace that overlooks
the former Colorado River floodplain terrace. The site is a low density lithic scatter with cores and flakes
sitting on the surface of a Pleistocene terrace. Cultural materials are most common on the surface of the
terrace slopes on the far west end of the site. In that area, one piece of debitage appears to be present per
2 square meters of ground surface area. Further eastward across a gully, lithic debitage appears to be
sparser despite the excellent ground surface visibility on eroded surfaces.

87

Figure 36 . 41TV2289 site map.

Two shovel tests were excavated on the terrace top at the western end of the site where artifacts are more
plentiful on ground surface. Shovel Test #19 produced only one chert flake in gravelly sandy loam
topsoil that was only 8 cm thick. About 30 meters further southward where Shovel Test #20 was
excavated the red clay B horizon was encountered just below ground surface. No artifacts were found in
that shovel test.
The site is an ephemeral lithic procurement/lithic scatter with very little depth of deposits. No diagnostic
artifacts or features were observed. Given these facts, the site is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP and not meriting formal designation as an SAL.

88

Development Area 4
41TV500
The southern end of this prehistoric site covers much of the Development Area 4 area (Figure 37, 38).
The site was also among the sites recorded during the Prewitt and Associates, Inc. survey for an LCRA
brush control project (Prewitt and Kotter 1979:3.5). The site was briefly described as primarily a lithic
procurement/scatter site with battered chert cobbles, cores, and cortex flakes visible on the lower eastern
slopes of a gravelly sandy ridge. The surveyors also stated that materials were ephemeral. Avoidance of
the site during brush clearing activities was recommended.

Figure 37. Development Area 4 showing location of site 41TV500 and all subsurface tests.

Figure 38. Development Area 4. Typical view.
This site was revisited by LCRA archaeological staff in 1997. Staff noted that the southern part of the site
had been developed into a campground area since the time of the Prewitt and Associates, Inc. survey.
Very little prehistoric cultural material was seen during the revisit, although the site had become more
overgrown by grasses and Ashe juniper. The LCRA staff stated on their revisit site form that the site had
been fully documented, and that it did not appear to merit further avoidance or formal designation as an
SAL.
Since the southern part of 41TV500 lies within the north central part of Development Area 4, it was again
revisited during the current investigation. Very little prehistoric material was observed on ground surface,
and five shovel tests that were excavated were all negative. Based on the negative findings of the current
fieldwork, it does not appear that the portion of site 41TV500 within Development Area 4 is eligible for
NR or SAL listing.

Summary and Recommendations
During the period from mid November 2007 through January 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the LCRA’s new Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area CIP.
Four proposed development areas totaling about 160 acres were field surveyed through a combination of
pedestrian survey and subsurface testing that consisted of both mechanical auger testing and shovel
testing.
As a result of the survey, four new cultural resource sites consisting of 41TV2287-2289 and 41TV2291
were discovered and assessed (Figure 39). Six previously recorded sites consisting of 41TV498-500,
41TV505, 41TV507, and 41TV508 were also revisited and assessed.
Prehistoric materials were found at 41TV498, 41TV500, 41TV505, 41TV508, 41TV2287, 41TV2288,
41TV2289, and 41TV2291. All of these sites can be classified as lithic scatters with lithic procurement
activities also evident at 41TV500, 41TV508, 41TV2287, 41TV228, and 41TV2289. In all cases, the

90

proposed Muleshoe Bend CIP areas.

prehistoric materials at these sites lack diversity, and except for two artifact concentrations at 41TV2288,
all of these sites have sparse materials. No diagnostic artifacts or evidences of intact features were found
at any of these prehistoric sites. Further, the archaeological materials at these sites either occur in sandy
loam deposits that show evidences of bioturbation or occur on upland surfaces in shallow gravelly sandy
loam deposits that are vertical mixed. Additionally, at site 41TV2288 some artifacts have probably rolled
downslope from their original locations. Given these facts, all eight prehistoric components examined

91

during the field survey are assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not meriting formal
designation as SALs.
Sites with historic remains consist of 41TV498, 41TV499, 41TV505, 41TV507, and 41TV508. The
recovery of eight hand-forged square nails from two shovel tests placed adjacent to the presumed former
house location at 41TV499, represent the earliest identified artifacts found at any of the historic sites.
Avoidance of an approximately 40x40 meter area centered on these finds is recommended (see Figure
38). This avoidance area is assessed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and potentially
meriting formal designation as an SAL. If avoidance of this portion of 41TV499 is not feasible, then
additional investigations will be needed.
Historic remains at all other historic sites and at other portions of 41TV499 all appear to date from the
very late 19th century to as late as the mid 20th century. The dating of these components fits well with
the historic archival and oral history research conducted by Utley (1996) at Muleshoe Bend. His research
indicated that sites 41TV498, 41TV499, 41TV507, and 41TV508 were sharecropper house sites that were
a part of the Turner Farm. The tenant farming operation probably began in the 1880s or 1890s.
Production of cotton and corn on the lowland/floodplain terraces adjacent to the river channel was the
principal economic pursuit at the Turner Farm. Although the fifth historic period site, 41TV505, was not
researched by Utley, it is probable that it was associated with the tenant farming operation.
Aside from the potential earlier component at 41TV499 recommended for avoidance, the other historic
period archaeological remains at these five sites do not appear to have any potential in providing new
information about rural lifeways in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Utley’s historic archival and
oral history research has already provided a more detailed story about the history of the Turner Farm and
its tenants. Since Utley interviewed many individuals who were already quite elderly in 1996, it is
probable that very few of them or other individuals who were not interviewed are still living. Because of
the very limited potential for additional oral history research and lack of the archaeological potential to
provide new and interesting data, the historic components at 41TV498, 41TV505, 41TV507, 41TV508
are all assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not worthy of formal designation as SALs.
Similarly, the portion of site 41TV499 not recommended for avoidance is assessed as not NRHP or SAL
eligible.
Aside from the avoidance of a portion of site 41TV499, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
recommends that the proposed Muleshoe Bend CIP project be allowed to proceed without any further
cultural resource investigations. As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to
this project. Should the construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological
features during construction work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the
LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be
assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no
archeological materials are present.

Abstract
In January and February 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource
survey of high probability areas along the proposed T-113 transmission line rebuild project. As a result of
the fieldwork, six new cultural resource sites, 41CD135-140, were recorded and assessed, and one
previously recorded site, 41CD132, was revisited and assessed.
Site 41CD136 is a historic period site that dates from 1855 to the late 20th century. The site was
originally established as the location of the William Harbert family plantation. The original plantation
house is said to have been situated just 10 to 25 meters north of the north edge of the transmission line
right-of-way. Despite the pre-Civil War date for the original occupation, the overwhelming majority of
artifacts recovered from shovel testing within the transmission line right-of-way appear to date to the 20th
century. An oral history interview with a family descendent, who is current landowner, indicates that
there were no structures or foundations present within the LCRA transmission line ROW that were visible
during the descendant’s lifetime. Thus, although the site has an interesting history, it does not appear that
LCRA’s transmission line rebuild project will negatively affect any significant cultural deposits. LCRA
assesses the portion of site 41CD136 within the transmission line ROW as not eligible for inclusion in the
National Register Historic Places and not meriting formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
The other five new archaeological sites, 41CD135 and 41CD137-140, recorded during the current
investigation are all prehistoric sites. Shovel testing at site 41CD135 produced a moderate density of
artifacts that primarily consisted of small chert tertiary flakes and chips. A few scattered burned chert
chunks were also recovered at 41CD135. No discrete subsurface components, features, or diagnostic
artifacts were found. Importantly, the artifacts occur in fine loamy sand deposits that show evidences of
bioturbation. For this reason, the portion of site 41CD135 within the transmission line ROW is rated as
not eligible for the National Register Historic Places and not worthy of formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark.
At the other four new prehistoric sites, very low numbers of artifacts were found in similar sandy topsoil
deposits. Numerous backdirt piles from gopher burrows are present at these sites, and the integrity of
cultural deposits is questionable. No evidences of features were found at these sites, nor were any time
diagnostic artifacts. Based on the results of the fieldwork, the portions of sites 41CD137-140 within the
right-of-way are assessed as not National Register or State Archeological Landmark eligible.
The final site, 41CD132, is a previously recorded site that represents the old elevated railroad grade of the
Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad that was constructed in 1860. At the terminus of this rail
line, the City of Alleyton was founded that same year just 100 to 700 meters further southward. Although
pedestrian survey and shovel testing did not reveal any artifacts or features adjacent to the section of the
railroad grade within the LCRA transmission line right-of-way, it is within the part of the old railroad
grade that has been previously formally designated as a State Archeological Landmark. Because of the
State Archeological Landmark designation, LCRA will avoid the railroad grade feature during
construction. This will include not constructing any of the new transmission structures within the site
area and minimizing any vehicular traffic that could damage the elevated railway grade feature.
Aside from the restrictions concerning the portion of site 41CD132 within the LCRA transmission line
right-of-way, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that rebuilding of the T-113 transmission
line be allowed to proceed as currently planned.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to rebuild the section of the T-113
transmission line that extends from the Columbus CPL Substation to the Peters Substation in Colorado
and Austin counties, Texas (Figures 41 and 41). This section of the T-113 transmission line has a total
length of approximately 24.4 miles. The current transmission line consists of a combination of H-frame
wooden transmission poles and metal lattice towers. The wooden H frame poles which constitute the
majority of the existing transmission structures, will be replaced with single metal or concrete poles.
Some of the existing lattice tower structures, which are mostly located at stream crossings and at angled
turns in the transmission line right-of-way (ROW), may also be replaced with single poles. The erection
of the replacement poles for the wooden H frame structures will require the excavation of 4 to 6 ft
diameter holes to depths of 12 to 17 ft below ground surface. The new single pole structures for
replacement of the lattice towers will have a larger diameter that requires the excavation of 10 ft diameter
holes.
Where possible, LCRA is also proposing to increase the spacing between structures during the rebuild
activities so that many of the new structures will be placed at the locations in between the current
structures. As a result, ground-disturbing activities will occur in locations not previously impacted by the
placements of the original structures. The original T-113 transmission line route had not been previously
surveyed for cultural resource sites because its construction predates the enactment of the State
Antiquities Code. Based on these facts, a cultural resource survey appeared warranted.
In January and February 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of high probability areas for cultural resource sites along the T-113 rebuild route. The
survey consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing, Personnel who conducted the fieldwork
consisted of LCRA staff members Daniel Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and Andrew Malof and
contracted archaeologists Cody Kiker, Patrick Hatten, and Glenn Goode. The investigation was
conducted under TAC Blanket Permits #4779, which was issued to the LCRA by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) for Calendar Year 2008. All work was completed in accordance with methods for
fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas Council of Archeologists (1992).

Environmental Background
The project area is located in Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938:100-103) in Southeast Texas. At the
western end of the transmission line corridor, the project area crosses the Colorado River and its
associated floodplain. The transmission line also crosses the San Bernard and Little San Bernard rivers in
the eastern half of the project area.
Surface geology at the western end of the project area consists of Holocene era alluvium and Pleistoceneaged fluviatile deposits associated with the Colorado River channel (Barnes 1974). From the area north
of the Alleyton community across the remainder of the route the surface geology consists of the
Pleistocene era Willis Formation.
According to the generalized soil map for Colorado County, soils on the alluvial floodplain areas of the
Colorado River in the project consist of the Mohat loam, Gad loamy fine sand, Norwood silty clay loam,
Bergstrom silt loam, and Wilson clay loam. The transmission line also crosses a former sand and gravel
pit in one area of the river floodplain.

Within the project area, topsoils present on the Pleistocene terrace flanking the Colorado River include
the Raabs clay loam, Burleson clay, Wilson clay loam, Gholson fine sandy loam, Dutek loamy fine sand,
and Trinity clay. Further eastward, soils along the transmission line corridor are
Mostly the sandy loams and loamy fine sand categories described in the previous paragraphs.
The far western edge of the project area is located within the Oak Savanna vegetation region with the
remainder of the project area being within the Oak-Hickory Forest vegetation region (Arbingast et al.
1976:13). Aside from bottomlands in some parts of the Colorado River floodplain and several creek
crossing areas such as Live Oak Creek, the overwhelming majority of the project area was cleared and
cultivated during the historic period. Much of this acreage is now pasture land for cattle.

Culture History
Prehistoric Background
The project area is located adjacent to the boundaries of the Southeast, South, and Central Texas
Archeological Regions (Patterson 1995; Hester 1995; Prewitt 1981). While Patterson places Austin
County within the Southeast Texas region, none of the authors of recent articles on these three
archeological regions claiming Colorado County as being within their respective region of interest.
Skelton (1977) described the transitional nature of Fayette/Colorado county area in the discussion of his
excavation work at the Fayette Power Project in nearby Fayette County. Skelton also noted that J.
Charles Kelley (1955) had previously advanced the notion of that this area was transitional zone in
prehistoric times. Specifically, Kelley discussed cultural relationships between coastal and inland
prehistoric groups and suggested that geographically diverse cultural groups may have co-existed within
this area.
Common prehistoric site types in the Austin and Colorado County area consist of open campsites, lithic
scatter/procurement sites, and cemeteries. Archeological investigations in neighboring areas have shown
occupation by Native American peoples for at least 12,000 years prior to the coming of Europeans. The
data show that throughout these millennia, prehistoric peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved
across the landscape exploiting seasonally available plant and animal resources. In terms of a
chronological sequence for these nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples, Patterson’s (1995:243) proposed
sequence for Southeast Texas, for example, is as follows: Early Paleoindian 10,000-8000 B.C., Late
Paleoindian 8000-5000 B.C., Early Archaic 5000-3000 B.C., Middle Archaic 3000-1500 B.C., Late
Archaic 1500-A.D. 100, Early Ceramic A.D. 100-600, Late Prehistoric A.D. 600-1500, Protohistoric A.D.
1500-1700, and Historic Indian A.D. 1700-1800.
Historic Background
The transmission line passes through the southern part of the City of Columbus and just north of City of
Alleyton, both in Colorado County. The transmission line also passes near the smaller crossroads
communities of Mentz and Bernardo in Colorado County and Peters in Austin County. Information on
these communities and important historical events is taken from The Handbook of Texas Online and is
summarized in the following paragraphs.
According to legend, the City of Columbus was originally the location of Indian village named
Montezuma. No specific data could be found on this village or its inhabitants. The first Anglo-American
settlers, Robert and Joseph Kuykendall and Daniel Gillehand, all members of the Stephen F. Austin’s Old
Three Hundred, moved to the area near Columbus in 1821. In 1823, Benjamin Beeson, another early
settler, established a ferry across the Colorado River at the fledgling community, which became known as

115

Beeson’s Crossing. As early as 1822, the settlers in the area gathered at this spot for elections of local
officials of the Mexican government’s Colorado River District.
At the time of the Texas Revolution, the settlement was known as Columbus and had about 25 families.
Although Houston’s army burned all of the buildings in Columbus during the Runaway Scrape, the town
was soon rebuilt after the Revolution and designated as the county seat of Colorado County in 1836. By
1847, it had 20 houses, 3 stores, 2 taverns, and a blacksmith shop. An early industry was a German cigar
factory that was established in 1840. Cotton production became the major economic pursuit in the 1850s
and continued to be important into the early 20th century.
By 1880, there were 1,666 farms in Colorado County. However, like many other areas in Texas, the
period after the Civil War was marred by violence. A fresh wave of killings even occurred as late as
1906. Cattle production was also important to the economy, especially in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1883,
the Columbus Meat and Ice Company was established in Columbus. Exploitation of large sand and
gravel deposits became a flourishing industry in the first decade of the twentieth century. By 1910,
Columbus was said to be surrounded by gravel pits. Sand and gravel mining continues to be important to
the local economy today.
After World War II, a large part of Columbus’ local economy began to focus on recreational activities. In
Columbus, this focus centered on historic buildings and “down-home atmosphere”. Numerous historic
buildings were restored and the Magnolia Homes Tour was begun in 1961. In the year 2000, Columbus
had a population of 3,916 and 326 businesses.
The City of Alleyton, which is situated about three miles east of Columbus, was first settled by five
brothers, Rawson, Abraham, John, Thomas, and William Alley, who arrived at various times in 1821 and
1822. It lies on the east bank of the Colorado River near the current intersection of Farm Road 102 and
Interstate Highway 10. In 1859, William Alley arranged for an extension of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos,
and Colorado Railway to his property by donating land for the right-of-way. At the railroad terminus, he
also provided land for a new town, which became Alleyton. With the completion of the railroad to
Alleyton in 1860, the town became the terminus of the southernmost railroad in the state. During the
Civil War, cotton that brought by rail to Alleyton was then loaded on wagon trains and hauled to Mexico
to bypass the Union blockade of Texas ports. Wagon trains returning from Mexico brought military and
other supplies, which were shipped by rail from Alleyton to other parts of the Confederacy. After the
Civil War, the railroad was extended to Columbus, and Alleyton declined in importance at a railroad
terminus.
However, Alleyton remained a supply center for area farmers. In 1896, the town had a population of 320.
Cotton became the primary agricultural product in the early twentieth century in the Alleyton area.
Extensive sand and gravel mining, which occurred around Alleyton in the early twentieth century, led to
the destruction of valuable farm and ranch land. In 2000, Alleyton had a population of 165.
The communities of Bernardo and Mentz, which are all near the central part of the project area, were first
settled by German immigrants around 1845. Bernardo was as also known as Bernardo Prairie and was
also sometimes called Braden in its early years. The community was located on the main road from
Houston to inland settlements. During the Civil War it became a dumping station for cotton being hauled
to Mexico. Bernardo remained a small rural settlement through the remainder of the nineteenth century.
From 1898 to 1917 it had a post office, and from 1872 to 1911, there was a local Catholic school staffed
by the Sisters of Divine Providence. In 1911, the school merged with the Mentz Catholic school. In
2000, the community had a population of 155.

116

Mentz, which is located about 2.75 miles west-southwest of Bernardo, lies at the intersection of Mentz
and Frelsburg roads. The town’s name is derived from the fact that many of the early settlers were from
the Diocese of Mainz, Germany. In 1858, the settlers constructed a Catholic church and named it St Roch
after a chapel in their native country. From 1872 to 1916, the community had a Catholic school staffed
by the Sisters of Divine Providence. A post office sporadically operated at Mentz from 1853 until 1913,
when it was transferred to Alleyton. In 2000, St. Roch’s Church was still in operation and the community
had a population of 100.
A final rural community, Peters, is located in Austin County about 1.25 miles west of western edge of the
project area on State Highway 36. While Anglo-American settlement started around Peters in the 1820s,
the town was not founded until 1880 when it was established as a station for the Bellville-Sealy spur of
the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway. Peters had a post office from 1883 until the mid-1940s. Its
population peaked at 125 in 1925. In 2000, the population was 95.

Previous Investigations
There are relatively few previously recorded archeological sites within and around the project area. In the
west-central part of the project area, the transmission line does cross one previously recorded site,
41CD132, which represents the old railroad grade of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado railroad
tracks just north of the town of Alleyton. Importantly, 41CD132, was been formally designated as a State
Archeological Landmark in 1998. A second related previously recorded site is 41CD133, the Alleyton
townsite. The north boundary of 41CD133 lays just 130 south of the point at which the transmission line
crosses the old railroad grade.
Other sites within 2 km of the transmission line in the western end of the project area consist of 41CD38
which is a prehistoric site and 41CD126 which consists of the historic concrete bridge supports for the
1898 to 1932 U.S. Highway 90 bridge over the Colorado River in Columbus (TARL:Colorado County
files).
In the central part of the project area, only one site 41AU50, has been previously recorded. The site is
located on an upland terrace about 800 meters east of the San Bernard River and about 1.9 km southeast
of the transmission line’s crossing of that river (TARL:Austin County files). Although the site is plotted
as covering a 500x300 m area, information about the size and contents of the site is sketchy. It appears
that recorder collected a large side scraper tool and two flakes. He also states that the landowner had
previously found a Bulverde point.
The closest large scale professional investigations consist of those for the proposed Columbus Bend
Reservoir and the Fayette Power Project. At Columbus Bend, which is located on the Colorado River
between La Grange and Columbus north of the western end of the project area, Nunley (1963) recorded
36 archeological sites within Colorado County. No follow up excavation work was conducted because the
proposed reservoir was cancelled. At the Fayette Power Project, a 2,400 acre survey area on the Cedar
Creek drainage yielded 10 historic and 19 prehistoric sites. Most of the historic sites were associated with
the historic Biegel Settlement, which was founded in the mid 19th century as a part of Austin’s Little
Colony. Seven prehistoric and three historic sites were recommended for excavation work. Skelton
(1977) subsequently excavated six of the prehistoric sites. Most of these prehistoric sites turned out to be
shallow lithic scatters interpreted as temporary upland work camps occupied intermittently over the last
8,000 years. At site 41FY74, however, the remains of a single butchered bison were found in association
with Late Prehistoric Toyah Phase artifacts and activity areas.

117

Methodology
Prior to the survey, the files search data was utilized to determine high probability areas for cultural
resource sites. Most high probability areas consisted of the portions of the transmission line corridor that
pass across the floodplains and first terraces adjacent to stream channels including larger streams such as
the Colorado, San Bernard, and Little San Bernard rivers, and smaller streams such as Live Oak,
Deadmans, Bernardo, and Sandy creeks. It was also noted that the Colorado River has a wide floodplain
with alluvial deposits where buried archaeological sites might be present.
Other high probability areas were established at likely locations for historic period sites such as areas
adjacent to the Alleyton and Bernardo communities. For the investigation of areas with high probabilities
for historic period sites, the early 20th century 15’ USGS Glidden, Eagle Lake, Bellville, and Sealy Tx.
quads were examined with the T-113 transmission line ROW being overlaid on these maps as an aid in
determining whether any historic period house sites might be situated within the transmission line
corridor. Unfortunately, the topographic survey teams who made maps such as the Glidden 1919 map did
not appear to put in any effort in mapping the locations of house structures like survey teams did in other
parts of the state. Similarly, the extent to which the survey teams plotted house sites on the other three
15’ USGS maps is questionable. In any case, no historic period sites were indicated on these maps as
being within the transmission line corridor. Importantly, too, the 1919 Bellville 15’USGS seemed to
indicate that the original townsite of Bernardo had been located 3 to 4 miles northwest of the project area
opposed to the current location near the transmission line on the Bernardo, Tx. 7.5’ USGS map.
Field survey methods used during the project consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey of all
high probability areas as described above along with shovel testing. Pedestrian survey methods for high
probability areas consisted of walking the transmission line corridor in zig-zag transects while intensively
inspecting bare and eroded patches of ground surface. Additionally, the walls of cutbanks and gullies
were examined for evidences of buried cultural materials. During the pedestrian survey shovel tests,
which consisted of small 35 to 40 cm (13.5 to 15 inch) diameter holes excavated to maximum depths of
100 cm (39 inches) or to the top of the B horizon/bedrock, were judgmentally placed in areas of high
probability having poor ground surface visibility and also to help determine the boundaries of any
archeological sites. All shovel tests were carefully backfilled immediately after excavation to restore the
ground surface to its original appearance. Further, no artifacts were removed from the property of any of
the landowners. Any artifacts observed on the ground surface or found in the shovel tests were examined,
analyzed, and photographed in the field, as necessary, and then placed back in their original locations.
Appendix 1 provides artifact descriptions from the shovel tests by 20 cm level, and Appendix 2 lists the
soil descriptions from each shovel test.
Survey Results
Approximately 4.55 linear miles of the 24.4 mile long transmission line ROW were intensively surveyed
(Figures 42-47). Ground surface visibility was found to range from fair to poor. In many sandy topsoil
areas with poor ground surface visibility, there were numerous gopher burrow backdirt piles within the
ROW corridor. These backdirt piles were very helpful in determining if artifacts were present. In fact, at
four of the six newly discovered sites, buried cultural deposits were initially identified by the presence of
artifacts on gopher burrow backdirt piles.

Shovel testing on the Colorado River floodplain showed that in almost all cases, the depth of alluvial
deposits was less than one meter. Therefore, there does not appear to be a need for any additional
investigation of deeper deposits with heavy machinery. A total of 55 shovel tests were excavated within
the 4.55 mile length of the ROW that was surveyed. Since the width of the T-113 ROW varies from 60 to
100 ft in different areas, the 12.08 shovel tests dug per linear mile is about equal to the THC’s minimum
standard of 16 shovel tests per linear mile for a ROW having a 100 ft ROW. Also, the presence of
gopher burrow backdirt piles alleviated the need for some of the shovel testing.
As a result of the field survey, six new cultural resource sites, 41CD135-140, and one previously recorded
site, 41CD132, were recorded and assessed. Descriptions of these sites are provided in the following
paragraphs.
New Sites
41CD135
This Native American campsite is situated on the west bank of the Colorado River around the area of the
existing LCRA lattice tower Structure 23/7 (Figure 48). The site is located within the backyard of
suburban residence within the City of Columbus near the intersection of Harbert and Charter streets.
The east boundary of 41CD135 is a steep terrace slope that drops about 20 ft to the west bank of the river
channel. The west boundary of the site lies about 55 meters west of this terrace slope in the area between
ST #2 and #3. The known width of the site is restricted to the narrow 18.5 m (60 ft)wide LCRA ROW.
Although much of the site is covered with San Augustine grass and ornamental vegetation, four pieces of
chert debitage were found on ground surface of gopher backdirt piles, and in recently disturbed areas
along a chain link fence. Several other pieces of debitage were seen around a deck platform that is located
on the terrace edge overlooking the river. The landowner later told the crew that some of the disturbed
fill around the deck platform was fill excavated to install a subsurface swimming pool that is situated
immediately north of the transmission line ROW in the backyard of the residence. Thus, it is probable
that the site extends northward outside the ROW. The adjacent landowner to the south of the ROW also
told the crew that a spring issues from the terrace slope to the south of the ROW.
Three shovel tests were then excavated to help determine the vertical and horizontal extents of the cultural
deposits. Shovel Test #1, which was placed about 3.5 m west of the existing LCRA lattice structure,
yielded 22 artifacts. Level 3 of this shovel test had the highest artifact count (n=10). Level 2 followed
with 5 artifacts and Levels 1 and 4 each produced two artifacts. Almost all artifacts recovered from ST #1
were small chert tertiary flakes/chips. Two somewhat larger chert flakes were found in Level 2, however,
and three burned chert chunks, possibly hearthstone fragments, were found in Level 4.
ST #2 was excavated about 5 m east of the existing lattice tower structure. Nineteen artifacts, again
mostly small chert tertiary flakes/chips, were spread throughout the approximately 70 cm thick fine sandy
loam A horizon at ST #2. Other artifacts included a blade core or thick biface fragment from Level 1 and
four burned chert chunks (two each in Levels 2 and 4) that may be

125

Figure 48. 41CD135 site map.

126

hearthstones. The B horizon, which was encountered at 70 cm below ground surface (bgs), was mottled
yellow and red sandy clay.
Following the excavation of these two shovel tests, the surface of the area west of ST #1 was closely
examined, especially the backdirt piles of gopher holes. As no artifacts were seen, and the crew did not
want to damage the manicured yard of the home immediately to the north, a third shovel test, ST #3 was
placed further westward at the intersection of Harbert and Charter streets (see Figure 48). No artifacts
were recovered from this shovel test. The depth of the sandy loam topsoil above the B horizon was found
to be 70 cm.
The investigation of 41CD135 indicates that it extends for a length of about 50 m within the LCRA
transmission line ROW. Most artifacts are very small chert tertiary flakes suggestive of the final stage
production of chipped stone tools and the maintenance of such tools. Several burned chert chunks
probably represent hearthstones from cooking/heating features. The small size of the debitage and the
potential burned hearthstones suggest that 41CD135 is an aboriginal campsite.
The site materials are within loamy fine sand topsoil, and the backdirt of recent gopher burrows were
noted within the site area. In ST #1, the highest artifact yield came in level 3 and the bottom of the sandy
loam topsoil suggesting that artifacts may have moved downward in the loose sand, while in ST #2
artifacts seemed evenly distributed throughout all levels. No burned rock clusters suggestive of intact
hearth features were seen, nor were any diagnostic artifacts found. Some previous damage to the site
deposits from the original construction of the transmission line structure and two nearby houses is
probable also. Principally because of the bioturbation of deposits and the potential for damage from
previous construction, the portion of site 41CD135 within the transmission line ROW is assessed as not
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and not meriting formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
41CD136
This historic period site is located on the south side of Interstate Highway 10 (I. H. 10) about 1.8 miles
east-northeast of the I. H. 10 bridge over the Colorado River (Figure 49). The site is situated on the edge
of a Pleistocene terrace at an elevation that is about 5 to 10 feet higher than the river floodplain to the
south. The LCRA staff investigated this area because an old barn is plotted on the 1957 Columbus, Texas
7.5’ map at distance of about 30 meters from the centerline of the transmission line. Several other nearby
structures consisting of house present when the quad map was published in 1957 and two other newer
homes plotted when the map was revised in 1981 lay further northward at distances of 50 to 80 meters
north of the ROW.
The principal component at this site is the historic period farmstead component which is related to the
Harbert family. Although the overwhelming majority of artifacts found during surface inspection and
shovel testing within the transmission line ROW produced 20th century artifacts, the farm complex dates
back as early as 1855 when William Harbert constructed his residence at a location about 30 to 40 meters
north of the transmission line centerline where the old barn is plotted on the USGS map. Harbert had
become wealthy as a merchant and plantation owner in Madison County, Tennessee before moving with
his wife and eight children to Texas in 1854 or 1855. Arriving in Colorado County with his family and
more than 100 slaves that he owned, he purchased 3,000 acres in the J. Hadden league on the east bank of
the Colorado River between Columbus and Alleyton. He quickly became one of the wealthiest men in
Colorado County. In addition to producing cotton at his plantation, he also constructed a general store
and bank in the town of Columbus. He also became one of the biggest moneylenders to other citizens
(Colorado County Historical Commission 1986:82-83, 134-135).

127

Figure 49. 41CD136 site map.

128

During the Civil War, Harbert hauled his cotton to the Mexican border to bypass the Union blockade of
Texas ports. In 1865, he died in Clinton, Texas while returning from one of these trips (Jackson 2008).
According to James Wooten (Personal communication 2008), the current landowner and a descendent of
William Harbert, the plantation house was demolished in the 1960s and some of the wood from the house
was used to construct a barn on the same spot where the house had stood (Figure 50). This is the barn
shown on the 1957 Columbus, Texas 7.5’ USGS map at a distance of 10 to 25 meters north of the north
edge of the transmission line ROW. The plantation house’s cistern is still present about 5 meters
northeast of the northeast edge of this barn. The cistern has an above ground brick collar.

Figure 50. Looking east at Site 41CD136. Barn at left has been constructed on the spot where the preCivil War Harbert Plantation House formerly stood. LCRA transmission structure 22/5 and ROW
corridor to the right.
Mr. Wooten stated that a small building located about 20 meters west of the barn is a 1920s era farm
office and that the other three structures shown further northward as the 1981 era photorevised additions
to the Columbus, Texas USGS map consisted of a home that later burned down and two other houses that
were later demolished. Mr. Wooten recollected that there had been other structures further westward
present earlier during his lifetime that were said to have been some of the slave cabins associated with the
plantation house. These are no longer present. Other slave cabins were said to have been scattered
throughout the original plantation acreage. Mr. Wooten also stated that a two story brick smokehouse
built in 1857 by William Harbert was situated further northward on the opposite (north) side of I. H. 10.
That structure was destroyed by a tornado in the late 20th century. Importantly, Mr. Wooten stated that
there were no former structures or foundations of structures associated with the plantation house within
the LCRA transmission line ROW.
At site 41CD136, the LCRA field investigations consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing within
the ROW areas adjacent to the former plantation house location and to the northeast and southwest.

129

Pedestrian survey of area showed very little ground surface visibility, and the few bare areas present
revealed no artifacts. A total of seven shovel tests, STs 13 through 19, were then excavated. The artifact
recovery from these shovel tests is found in Appendix 1.
Artifacts were recovered STs #14-18 with the highest density (n=13) coming from ST #17, which was
excavated on the north ROW edge about 13 meters southeast of the southeast corner of the barn. ST #16,
which was located 13 meters south of the southwest edge of the barn had a total of 8 artifacts as did ST
#14, which was placed 45 meters southwest of the barn along a fenceline. ST #18, the last positive shovel
test, was located about 50 meters east-southeast of the barn and it had only 3 artifacts. While most of the
artifacts were recovered from Level 1, some were also found in Levels 2 and 3 in ST #17. ST #18 was
unusual in that all three artifacts found there came from Level 3.
Twenty-one of the 38 total artifacts from these four shovel tests are small brownish-orange brick
fragments that each average less than 1 cm in diameter. The dates of these bricks are uncertain. The only
two artifacts that definitely appear to be diagnostic of the 19th century are a dark green wine bottle
fragment from Level 1 of ST #15 and an olive green glass fragment with an etched line across its surface
that came from Level 1 of Level #16. Otherwise, the remainder of the artifacts consist of eight clear glass
fragments, two round headed nail fragments, one green glass fragment, one brown beer bottle glass
fragment, two plain whiteware sherds, and one rusted sheet metal fragment. Some of these are more
likely to relate to the activities associated with the small farm office structure that was constructed in the
1920s, while several such as the brown beer bottle glass and the green 7-Up soda bottle glass could date
to the late 20th century.
Overall, the artifact yield suggests that additional excavations for samples of 19th century artifacts would
not be fruitful. Further, Mr. Wooten had stated that, to his knowledge, there are no foundations or
features related to the plantation era house within the LCRA transmission line ROW. Based on these
facts, the portion of site 41CD136 within the transmission line ROW is assessed as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and not worthy of formal designation as an SAL.

This prehistoric site is located on a terrace slope on the west side of an unnamed tributary of the Colorado
River about 290 meters south-southwest of the point at which the transmission line crosses County Road
268 (Figure 51). The Colorado River, itself, is about 600 meters due south of the site at the closest.
Pedestrian survey in this area revealed four chert flakes/chips and one possible burned rock fragment on
ground surface in gopher backdirt piles. The excavation of four shovel tests, STs 22-25, in the vicinity of
these surface finds produced no additional cultural materials. Based on these findings, it appears that the
site represents an ephemeral prehistoric lithic scatter. South of the transmission line ROW, there is a
considerable topographic rise that lies closer to the Colorado River channel. That area looks to be a
probable location for a more substantial prehistoric site, and it may be possible that our staff’s finds at
41CD137 represent activities peripheral to that hypothesized site. In any event, the minor amount of
prehistoric materials found in the ROW at site 41CD137 does not appear to be NR or SAL eligible.

Figure 51. Map of sites 41CD137 and 41CD138.
41CD138
Site 41CD138 is located about 150 meters west of the point at which the transmission line crosses County
Road 268 (see Figure 51). It is also situated about 50 east of an unnamed tributary of the Colorado River.
The previously described site 41CD137 is located on the terrace on the opposite side of this tributary.
Although pedestrian survey of the terrace revealed no artifacts on ground surface or in gopher backdirt
piles, two shovel tests, STs 26 and 27, produced a total of three chert tertiary flakes in the upper 20 cm of

131

sandy topsoil deposits. A third shovel test, ST28, was negative. Since areas further southwest and
northeast of these three shovel tests were low lying areas that did not appear to be likely spots of
prehistoric occupation, no additional shovel tests were attempted.
The portion of site 41CD138 within the transmission line ROW is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP and not worthy of formal designation as an SAL due to low artifact yield and bioturbation of
the sandy topsoil deposits.
41CD139
This center of this prehistoric site is located about 155 meters southwest of the point at which the T-113
transmission line crosses Live Oak Creek (Figure 52). The site lies on the slope of a well-defined terrace
that is heavily wooded with oak, hackberry, and green briar except for the cleared, well-maintained ROW.
Pedestrian survey of this terrace led to the discovery of two chert flakes in eroded cattle trails and road
ruts. Three shovel tests, STs 40-42, were then excavated to gauge the subsurface deposits. ST #40 which
was excavated upslope from the surface finds was negative and indicated that the sandy loam topsoil was
only 23 thick at the terrace summit. ST #41 in the central part of the site yielded two burned tertiary
flakes and a burned chert chunk in the upper 20 cm of the 66 cm thick sandy topsoil deposits. ST #42,
which was excavated about 30 meters downslope from ST #41, produced one tertiary flake and one
burned chert spall in Level 1. Depth of sandy loam topsoil at ST #42 was 39 cm. Examination of gopher
backdirt piles and several eroded areas downslope from ST #42 produced no evidences of prehistoric
materials, so shovel testing was curtailed.
The sparse finds at site 41CD139 indicate that the portion of the site within the transmission line ROW is
a low density prehistoric lithic scatter. Soils have been disturbed from vehicular traffic associated with
the use of a deer blind in the central part of the site, and the presence of gopher backdirt piles suggests
bioturbation of the sandy topsoils. Artifacts lack diversity and no evidences of features or diagnostic
artifacts were seen during the investigations. The portion of the site within the transmission line ROW is
assessed as not eligible for the NRHP and not meriting formal designation as an SAL.
41CD140
This prehistoric site is located on the terrace on the opposite side of Live Oak Creek from Site 41CD139
(see Figure 52). The center of the site is located 170 meters northeast of the point at which the line
crosses Live Oak Creek. Following the discovery of several pieces of chert debitage during pedestrian
survey of the terrace, STs #43 and 44 were excavated in the area of the surface finds. ST #43, located in
the central part of the surface finds, yielded a total of five chert flakes/chips that were evenly spread
through the first three levels in fine sandy loam matrix. No additional artifacts were found in Levels 4
and 5 which was a gravelly sandy loam. ST #44, which was excavated about 12 meters upslope from the
surface finds, produced two chert flakes/chips and two pieces of burned chert shatter in Level 1. Two
chert flakes/chips were found in Level 2, and the B horizon clay was struck in Level 3 at 46 cm bgs.

Previously Recorded Sites
41CD132
This previously recorded site is a section of the old Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad grade
that is located within and north of the town of Alleyton, Texas. The extension of this railroad line to
Alleyton was completed in 1860 making it the terminus for the southernmost railroad in the state. During
the Civil War, Alleyton became the beginning point of the “cotton road.” Cotton was transported by the
railroad to Alleyton and then loaded on wagons and carried to Mexico in order to bypass the Union
blockade of Texas ports. Returning wagon trains brought
Various supplies were shipped on the railroad to other Confederate states. After the Civil War, the
railroad was extended from Alleyton to Columbus. As a result, Alleyton lost its importance as a railroad
terminus and its population declined.
The railroad grade was recorded as archaeological site 41CD132 in 1995 as was a broader site, 41CD133,
which encompasses the old Alleyton townsite. The recorders noted that within the town of Alleyton, a
street called Center Street now runs along the top of the railroad grade. The investigators found various
19th century artifacts in shovel tests along the flanks of the railroad grade including whiteware ceramic
sherds, bottle glass fragments, and cast iron metal objects. Site 41CD132 was formally designated as an
SAL in 1998.
The existing T-113 transmission line crosses site 41CD132 at a location about 100 meters north of the
north edge of the old Alleyton townsite (Figure 53). Although the site survey forms for 41CD132 and
41CD133 suggest that the majority of the archaeological materials associated with the railroad are located
southward within Alleyton, it appeared prudent to make a field visit to the railroad grade area within the
T-113 ROW.
The railroad grade ridge was readily apparent within the ROW as a humped ridge 60 cm high and 4
meters wide. No artifacts were found during pedestrian survey of the area, and it was noted that the area
immediately west of the railroad grade is a lowland area with standing water. Two shovel tests were
excavated to the east side of the railroad grade. ST #35 was placed about 25 meters east of the railroad
grade feature. No artifacts were found in the clay soil matrix. ST #36 was excavated on the opposite
(west) side of the county road that runs parallel with the feature. No artifacts were recovered from that
shovel test.
Since this site has been formally designated as an SAL, the LCRA will avoid impacting the site area by
ensuring that no new transmission poles are placed within the site.

Other Areas Surveyed with Negative Results
The area extending from the east bank of the Colorado River to the I. H. 10 ROW is a noteworthy area
that was surveyed with negative results at the west end of the project (see Figure 42). Most of the area
extending from the east bank of the river to Interstate Highway 10 is a lowlying flat terrace. Shovel Tests
#4 and 5, which were excavated in that area showed sterile brown loam topsoil down to one meter below
ground surface. There is, however, an abrupt 5 to 6 ft rise to a higher terrace surface at the east end of
this segment adjacent to the I. H. 10 ROW. Shovel Tests #6 and 7 were excavated down to the B horizon
clay with negative results in this terrace rise (see Figure 42).

134

Similar negative results came from STs #8-12 on the Colorado River floodplain on the south side of I. H.
10. Survey of the transmission line corridor northeast of site 41CD136 produced no additional historic
features or artifacts that might be related to the Harbert Plantation site. Mr. Wooten, our informant on the
plantation site, had also stated that there was a legend about a Confederate Regimental camp that had
been present somewhere between the plantation site and

135

the town of Alleyton during the Civil War. The purpose of the Confederate camp was to guard the
railroad terminus in Alleyton. For this reason the entire transmission line route was surveyed
between the plantation site and terrace area where STs #32-34 (see Figures 43 and 44). Although
prehistoric sites 41CD137 and 41CD138 were found in this stretch, no historic artifacts that might have
been associated with the Confederate camp were found.
Other high probability areas where no archaeological sites were found include the San Bernard and Little
San Bernard river areas where STs 45-53 are shown on Figure 46. Survey of the Willow Creek area
where the modern-day Bernardo community is situated likewise yielded no sites. Last of all, survey of
the Little Bernard and Deadmans creek areas toward the northeast end of the project area produced
negative results (see Figure 47).

Summary and Recommendations
In January and February 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource
survey of high probability areas along the proposed T-113 transmission line rebuild project.
Approximately 4.55 linear miles of the 24.4 mile transmission line ROW were intensively surveyed. As a
result of the fieldwork, six new cultural resource sites, 41CD135-140, were recorded and assessed, and
one previously recorded site, 41CD132, was revisited and assessed.
One of the newly recorded sites, 41CD136, is a historic period site that dates from 1855 to the late 20th
century. The earliest component is of interest as it represents the location of the William Harbert family
plantation. Harbert was a wealthy merchant and plantation owner in Tennessee who moved to the
Columbus area in 1855 with his family and approximately 100 slaves. He acquired 3,000 acres on the
Colorado River and constructed his plantation house just 10 to 25 meters north of the north edge of the T113 transmission line ROW. Occupation of the house continued after the Civil War, and the house was
eventually demolished in the 1960s with a barn then constructed where the house had stood. Also, in
1920 a farm office building was constructed by Harbert’s descendents about 20 meters west of the
plantation house at a distance of about 25 to 40 meters north of the north edge of the transmission line
ROW.
Despite the pre-Civil War date for the original occupation, extremely few 19th century artifacts were
found in seven shovel tests dug within the transmission line ROW adjacent to the former plantation
house. An interview with a family descendent who is the current landowner indicates that there were no
structures or foundations present within the LCRA transmission line ROW that were visible during the
descendent’s lifetime. Thus, although the site has an interesting history, it does not appear that LCRA’s
transmission line rebuild project will negatively affect any significant cultural deposits. LCRA assesses
the portion of site 41CD136 within the transmission line ROW as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and not meriting formal designation as an SAL.
The other five new archaeological sites, 41CD135 and 41CD137-140, recorded during the current
investigation are all prehistoric sites. Shovel testing at site 41CD135 indicated a moderate density of
artifacts that primarily consisted of small chert tertiary flakes and chips. A few scattered burned chert
chunks were also recovered at 41CD135. These may represent hearthstones from former cooking/heating
features. The chert debitage may result from final stage production of bifacial tools or from resharpening
of existing tools. Such activities along with the possible hearthstones suggest that 41CD135 represents an
actual aboriginal campsite. However, the artifacts occur in fine loamy sand deposits that show evidences
of bioturbation. For this reason, the portion of site 41CD135 within the transmission line ROW is rated
as not eligible for the NRHP and not worthy of formal designation as an SAL.

136

At the other four new prehistoric sites, very low numbers of artifacts were found in similar sandy topsoil
deposits. Numerous backdirt piles from gopher burrows are present at these sites, and the integrity of
cultural deposits is questionable. No evidences of features were found at these sites nor were any time
diagnostic artifacts. Based on the results of the fieldwork, sites 41CD137-140 are assessed as not NR or
SAL eligible.
The final site, 41CD132, is a previously recorded site that represents the old elevated railroad grade of the
Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad that was constructed in 1860. At the terminus of this rail
line, the City of Alleyton was founded that same year just 100 to 700 meters further southward. Although
pedestrian survey and shovel testing did not reveal any artifacts or features adjacent to the section of the
railroad grade within the LCRA transmission line ROW, the ROW is within the part of the old railroad
grade that has been previously formally designated as an SAL. Because of the SAL designation, LCRA
will minimize impacts to the railroad grade feature during construction. This will include not
constructing any of the new transmission structures within the area marked for avoidance on Figure 53,
and minimizing any vehicular traffic that could damage the elevated railway grade feature.
Aside from the restrictions concerning the portion of site 41CD132 within the LCRA transmission line
ROW, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that rebuilding of the T-113 transmission line
be allowed to proceed as currently planned.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with
the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are
present.

Management Summary
In April of 2007 LCRA Natural Resource Services requested coordination with LCRA Archaeology
Services in planning for an invasive species management project at LCRA’s Double Horn Preserve,
located in southern Burnet County, Texas (Figures 54, 55). Due to an unexpected reduction of force in
Archaeology Services staff, this project was not subjected to the normal internal review process. In
February of 2008, Archaeology Services was made aware that clearing needed to begin immediately
because of a March 1 deadline due to endangered species habitat being present in the area. After a review
of previous archaeological work and similar projects, it was determined that the project would be allowed
to proceed with avoidance measures for known sites in place, and with selective monitoring of clearing
activities. Avoidance areas were defined based on previous investigations, coupled with additional shovel
testing at previously recorded site 41BT41. Site 41BT272 was determined to be outside any proposed
impact zones. Monitoring was accomplished by way reviewing four machine-cleared transects prior to
allowing clearing to continue, and by subsequent spot-monitoring. As a result of these investigations it
was determined that site 41BT41 has very limited research potential. It is not felt to be eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No
new information was obtained on 41BT272. No new sites were recorded and no collections were made.

Introduction
LCRA’s Double Horn Preserve is an 800-acre tract of land located on either side of Double Horn Creek
where it drains into the Colorado River near the community of Spicewood, in southern Burnet County. A
total of 20 archaeological sites have been recorded within the property over the past several years. Some
of these are very extensive prehistoric campsites, and the remains of a small historic community are
present as well. The sites have been recorded for various brush and fence projects and ongoing inventory
and resource assessments. Notable among the projects as limited testing that occurred at 41BT37, where
a 2 x 2 m excavation unit was excavated within the high terrace across the creek from the present project
area (Prikryl et al. 2004). Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric materials were recovered,
demonstrating a continuum of land use with a focus on hunted and gathered resources. Materials were
found to a depth of 2 m, and other testing and cutbank profiles indicate that cultural materials may be
present at depth exceeding 4 m. Other sites include an apparent pristine incipient burned rock midden,
hearths visible in cutbanks and in shovel tests, areas with bison bone, as well as extensive scatters of
artifacts and burned rocks. These are present along the creek and exposed along lower river terraces
when lake levels are low.
The present project is located within a previously plowed agricultural field, as demonstrated by dense
mesquite and, to a lesser extent, juniper regrowth within deep, brown loams. In order to recreate a native
grassland environment, the existing vegetation was bulldozed, then pushed and raked into piles for
eventual burning. Root plowing follows, which uses a 13 inch plow to aerate the soil and break the
subsurface roots into sections, thus killing them.
Prior to ground disturbance in the vicinity of 41BT41, previous investigations were reviewed and an
additional series of shovel tests excavated, for a total of 31 shovel tests defining the site’s boundaries
(Figure 56). Ten of these tests were positive for cultural materials, which were consistently small
amounts of chipping debris and occasional small burned rock and mussel shell fragments. The only
obvious tools were two biface fragments. Some groundstone (three or four manos, some sandstone
metate fragments) were visible on the ground surface, especially towards the west end of the site.
Examination of significant erosional gullies fronting Double Horn Creek over different occasions has
never resulted in locating any significant cultural materials at depths. In fact, these cuts are remarkably
devoid of artifacts.

It seems unlikely that this high terrace, so similar to that which holds 41BT37, directly across the creek,
would have received so little attention prehistorically. The working hypothesis is that a combination of
flood events over the past few hundred or more years has significantly altered the southern terrace,
washing away any accumulated cultural debris. There may be very deeply buried deposits, but they are
not visible at depths approachable by conventional means, and the deep erosional gullies do not lend
support to the concept.

Results of Monitoring

LCRA employs several methods of brush clearing and control. These are dependent upon resource
managers’ decisions as to the extent and nature of required clearing. LCRA Archaeology Services
normally does assessments before the fact, and therefore rarely is able to gauge the actual impacts from
such operations. It was therefore very informative to watch the bulldozer in action. It was found that the
initial clearing was actually relatively non-invasive; trees tended to snap at ground level rather than pull
their root systems with them. The tracked bulldozer certainly pushed soil around, but rarely was there an
impact below about 30 cm. In other words, impacts to the ground below the plow zone were minimal.
Four bulldozer transects were actively monitored on February 12 and 18, 2008. The bulldozer began
work on the south end of the field while Archaeology Services staff commenced shovel testing in the
vicinity of 41BT41 and conducted examinations along the edges of 41BT272. Once it was felt that the
boundaries of 41BT41 were defined, a bulldozer transect was created that established a buffer zone
around the site (Figure 57). Then, two additional bulldozer transects were cut. Each transect paralleled
the bank of Double Horn Creek, and each was approximately 10 m (30 ft) in width and 450 m( 1500 ft) in
length, for a total of about 4 acres, close to 10 percent of the total project. They were spaced at 75 to 150
m intervals.
The only non-modern cultural material that was seen while monitoring was a single piece of burned
limestone. A shovel test (ST 34) placed at this location was negative. Another shovel test (ST 33) was
placed near the center of the terrace where the field is at or near its highest point, and near another shovel
test excavated in 2005 that had recovered a single chert chip and a bone or tooth fragment from between
20 and 40 cm bgs. It was also negative. The single positive shovel test (ST 27) is therefore considered an
anomaly.
A final visit was made to the project area on March 27, 2008. Clearing was about 95 percent complete
(Figure 58), and some preliminary root plowing had taken place (Figure 59) within the deep soils (Figure
60). Two archaeologists walking wandering transects carefully inspected the ground surface for any
evidence of cultural materials and assessed the level of impacts from the clearing operation. Although
soils vary in areas from reddish brown to brown, they are all consistent sandy or silty loams, with
absolutely no rock content. The only cultural material seen was the handle of a salt-glazed mug or jug,
which was near a single link of an old chain and a single very small piece of white stoneware. Two very
small pieces of apparent burned limestone were also seen. No additional shovel tests were attempted.
The areas that had been root plowed were assessed for level of impact. It was seen to be very minor, and
did not exceed about 20 cm in depth.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA Conservation Services conducted clearing operations on 42 acres located in LCRA’s Double Horn
Preserve in Burnet County, Texas, under the supervision of LCRA Archaeology Services. Based on
previous types of projects, especially previous clearing on the north side of the creek (Hixson et al.
2007:156) and knowledge of the nature and extent of cultural deposits at 41BT37, coupled with extensive
shovel testing at known site 41BT41 within the project area, and the fact that the clearing was taking
place in an old agricultural field, it was felt this was the best method for allowing the project to proceed
while maximizing the potential for finding previously unrecorded archaeological sites.
Site 41BT41 was flagged for avoidance after additional testing was conducted to confirm its boundaries.
A total of 31 shovel tests was excavated within the site, with recovery sporadic and sparse at depths down
to 100 cm.
The monitoring determined that subsurface impacts were minimal, rarely exceeding 30 cm in depth, and
that follow up root plowing had no appreciable additional impact.
As a result of the monitoring and the consolidation of shovel test information it is now felt that 41BT41
does not contain significant research potential and is not eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It is therefore
recommended that the portion of the project area which has been marked for avoidance be cleared for
mechanical brush removal. It is also requested that the Texas Historical Commission make a
determination of “No Effect” on the remainder of the clearing project.

An Intensive Cultural Resource Survey of a Rerouted Section of the Proposed LCRA Medina Lake
Transmission Line through Prehistoric Quarry 41ME193

Management Summary
LCRA is in the process of designing a new transmission line that will run from the existing Medina Lake
substation south and then east for a distance of about 9 miles to a point where it will tie in to a line being
built by CPS Energy of San Antonio. The line runs around the east side of Medina Lake and then east,
largely following SH 1283. It crosses the Medina/Bandera County line about one-third of the way from
the north end (Figure 61).
The line was surveyed for cultural resources by LCRA Archaeology Services staff during the fall of 2007,
and nine previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented (Malof 2007). The sites (41BN104
and 41BN105, 41ME192-198) were both historic and prehistoric, and included trash scatters, stock
management areas, lithic scatters, a large quarry and two open camp sites. Two sites were recommended
for avoidance or additional work if avoidance was not possible. Site 41ME192 is an open camp in a
highly disturbed environment that appears to contain a small area of intact, subsurface burned rock. Site
41ME193 is a large lithic procurement area, a quarry where abundant Edwards formation chert was
extensively exploited for early stage tool production.
For logistical purposes, LCRA Transmission services determined that the portion of the line that runs
through 41ME193 required a substantial realignment, and the proposed line was redesigned 100 feet to
the east (Figure 62, 63). The reroute provided an opportunity to reinvestigate 41ME193 at a greater level
of detail and intensity than had been possible previously. As a result of these investigations it is now felt
that 41ME193 is fully documented, and that substantial additional information that would make the site
potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark is lacking. It is therefore
recommended that the transmission line be allowed to proceed to construction without additional
archaeological investigations.
These recommendations are for 41ME193 only, and do not impact or affect other parts of the
transmission line already reviewed and agreed upon by THC, including 41ME192, where avoidance
measures are still recommended and are being planned for.
An extensive background section was prepared for the initial survey report, so the following report only
covers the specifics of 41ME1933. There was no collection of artifacts during this project, so there is no
need of curation.

Research Design and Methodology
The original survey recommended 41ME193 for avoidance or testing based on the premise that at the
time, insufficient data had been recovered to allow a firm recommendation for or against eligibility for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places. Time constraints and other permitting needs required the report be submitted prior to what would
have been a preferred more intensive survey. The result was the recommendation for avoidance or
testing.
Because the realignment placed the potential impacts almost entirely within a previously unsurveyed area,
it was felt that a reinvestigation was appropriate. Because of the relatively short length of new alignment
(about 180 m within the site), it was possible to address more rigorously a series of questions that were
unanswered following the first survey.
Lithic procurement sites are rarely given in-depth attention. It is usually assumed that beyond locational
information they can provide little additional data on past technologies or settlement patterning. Site

41ME193 seemed to potentially be able to go beyond this basic assumption. One of the most striking
aspects of the site were very large flakes, up to 30 cm in diameter, which were struck from rounded
nodules of good to fair quality chert eroding from the surrounding limestone bedrock (Figure 64). There
also was observed buried cultural material in a single shovel test near the south end of the site that
reached about 30 cm before hitting bedrock.

Figure 64. Partially reduced cobble at 41ME193.
In order to determine formal State Archeological Landmark potential a series of questions were asked.
Are there intact buried deposits? Are time diagnostic artifacts present, and if so, can they be linked
differing technological aspects of the site? Is there spatial segregation of activity areas that could inform
on specific aspects of reduction? Is there evidence of activities other than lithic procurement?
On February 29, 2008, two LCRA staff archaeologists spent the day addressing these questions. This was
accomplished by a thorough examination of the ground surface, shovel testing in selected locations, and
additional intensive data recording at four locations identified in the field where there appeared to be an
increase in artifact density and/or patterning.

Results of Investigation
Six shovel tests were excavated along the realignment; two within each of Scatters (discussed below) 1
(STs 5 and 6) and 4 (STs 1 and 2) and two near a bottle and within a mounded area (STs 3 and 4) (Figure
65). Shovel Test 1 was excavated through 20 cm of heavy clay loam to limestone boulders. Recovery
consisted of three 5-cm hard hammer flakes and 17 hard hammer flakes and flake fragments that were
less than 5 cm in any one dimension. Shovel Test 2 had 15 cm of dark brown heavy clay loam overlain
by a narrow organic zone. A single small flake and three small chunks were recovered.

Figure 65. Shovel testing at 41ME193. Environment typical.
Because the early 1900s map showed a structure somewhere on the landform, a shovel test (ST 3) was
placed next to a liquor bottle that appeared to date to the early or middle part of the twentieth century.
This was excavated through 15 cm of limestone rubble and loamy detritus. One core fragment and three
large flakes were recovered, as well as one macro flake, which appeared to be the result of sequential
bipolar or hammer-and-anvil reduction, having the appearance of an orange slice, i.e., it appeared to
represent a round cobble that had been, at minimum, quartered. Shovel Test 4 was placed about 10 m east
of ST 3, within a mounded area suspected to be a bulldozer pushpile. This was quickly confirmed, as
there was no soil nor was there any recovery of artifacts.
Shovel Test 5 was near the edge of the road and within or immediately adjacent to Scatter 1 (Figure 66).
It was excavated through 15-20 cm of heavy, dark grayish brown clay loam. Recovery was much higher
here. There were four cores or core fragments, and 29 hard hammer flakes that were between 5 and 8 cm
along any one axis. Additionally, two apparent burned limestone rocks were recovered.
Shovel Test 6 was placed about 4 m south of ST 5. The profile was the same. Recovery consisted of a
burned macro flake (20 cm), a 15 cm core, three core fragments, eight 10-cm flakes, and 29 relatively
large flakes and flake fragments.

162

Figure 66. Recovery from Shovel Test 5.
This last shovel test was placed about 20 m north of the original test excavated during the original survey,
and referred to on the present site map as ST 7. Shovel Test 7 had a similar profile, one early stage
biface, two flakes and several chunks recovered.
These shovel tests serve to indicate that soils are shallow, the site has suffered severe impacts, and that
subsurface artifacts are representative of what is visible on the surface.
The pedestrian survey identified four areas where there appeared to be in increase in the observed density
of artifacts (Scatters 1-4). Three were clustered fairly close together at the south end of the site, and were
relatively small (32 to 60 square meters), while a fourth was located near the northern end, and was much
larger (about 400 square meters). In order to better quantify the numbers and types of artifacts present, a
series of observation units (OUs) were established in each Scatter. These were either .25 or 1 m units
(informally delineated) in which fairly detailed, but not necessarily consistent, artifact counts and
descriptions were recorded. Scatters 1 and 2 each had one meter OUs, six for Scatter 1 (55 m sq) and 4
for Scatter 2 (32 m sq). Scatter 3 (60 m sq) had five .25 m sq OUs, and Scatter 4 had four .25 m sq OUs.
Material density was variable in each scatter, and so the OUs were placed selectively where artifacts were
present, rather than where they were not. Observations therefore represent maximum counts per scatter,
and the combined figures represent likely maximum counts for the site as a whole. The smaller OUs are
considered to be more accurate than the larger ones, which were less intensively quantified. Combined,
however, they present some useful figures on site use (Table 15).
Within the 12.25 m sq total area (adjusted to 19 m sq) of OUs a total 1,825 artifacts were observed.
Artifact classes that were tabulated were cores or core fragments, macro flakes (greater than 20 cm in any
one dimension), flakes 10-20 cm in size, and flakes less than 10 cm in size. There were 31 cores (1.6
percent), nine macro flakes (0.4 percent), 28 medium flakes (1.5 percent), and 1759 flakes smaller than 10
cm (96 percent). The average artifact density across all OUs was 96 per m sq.

The site is estimated to cover approximately 14,500 m sq (3.6 acres). It therefore has a potential
maximum density of 1.39 million artifacts which would include roughly 23,000 cores, 6,800 macro
flakes, 21,000 medium sized flakes, and 1.34 million flakes smaller than 10 cm.
These numbers allow a gross estimate of the time span involved in creating the assemblage. Some recent
studies (e.g. Varien and Potter 1997, Sullivan 2008) have looked accumulation rates of artifacts using
Schiffer’s (1975, cited in Varien and Potter 1997) discard equation. The equation (TD=S*t/L, where TD
= total discard, S = “systemic number” - the total number of artifacts in use at any time, t = time and L =
the use life of the artifact) allows solving for time, once a series of rather broad assumptions are made.
This equation has apparently been used primarily for ceramic assemblages within relatively short
temporal periods. Despite this, the equation was applied to the lithic assemblage described above, with the
following assumptions.
The artifact class is the core or core fragment. The core use life (L) is one day (hours unspecified).
Assuming targeted, logistical use of the quarry by a group of 10 persons, the systemic number (S) is 10
(one core per person per day). The resulting equation is t = 23,200(1)/10, which results in 2,320 days
(6.35 years) to create the assemblage, if 10 people were working 365 days a year.
Further assuming retooling trips by local groups each lasting two days, the site could have produced the
assemblage in 1160 occasions. If the site was visited four times a year, it could have been created in 290

164

years. Unfortunately, besides a single apparent Late Archaic dart point fragment, it is impossible to
determine which years from the site itself.
Less than a mile from the quarry, however, is 41ME8, which produced a Plainview point (albeit
apparently from a burned rock midden) and Scorpion Cave (41ME107), which appears to represent a
possible discrete Late Prehistoric occupation from which 88 Edwards points were recovered.
The quarry was therefore likely used throughout prehistory, but quite possibly intermittently or
sporadically. It does appear that, at least within the two transects that were surveyed, that the raw nodular
chert was close to exhausted. The hundreds of thousands of pieces of waste debitage, however, would
still be a good resource for various tools, especially items like unifaces and arrow points.
Despite the numerous problems with this very simple analysis, (for example, it does not take into account
the very likely decay in core frequency as they are either completely reduced or removed from the site for
further reduction elsewhere), it creates a basic set of assumptions that potentially can aid in regional
settlement analyses.
One of the apparent very few serious attempts to understand and quantify a large quarry site was at
41BX901 (Potter et al. 1992), located about 30 miles due east of 41ME193. Although operating under
trying conditions (construction of a new school was under way), Potter et al. had the luxury of a large
quarry site grading into a large campsite, and were able to show statistically significant differences in the
types of assemblages between the two locations.
Importantly, for this study, Potter et al. also extrapolated assemblage density, but used weight rather than
counts as the currency. At 41BX901 they determined that there were 423,000 kilograms of lithic material
within an approximate 10 acre (40,470 m sq) area, or roughly 5 kg per square meter.
In order to allow a direct comparison between 41ME193 and 41BX901, Potter et al.’s adjustment factor
of 75 percent (based on observation and assumption of spotty distribution) was applied, and the total lithic
assemblage at 41ME193 was adjusted to 1.042 million pieces. Because weights were not recorded at
41ME193, sample pieces of chert were measured, and an average weight of 100 gm was assigned (these
were all relatively small pieces, no more than 10 cm in any one dimension). Assuming this can be
considered an average weight of all pieces at 41ME193, the total weight would be 104,250 kg for an
average weight of 7.1 kg per m sq. Given the uncertainties in and differing methods between the two
projects, the average weights per square meter between the two sites are tolerably comparable.
There did appear to be evidence of spatial variability. The differences are weak and to some extent the
basis of subjective observation, but are supported at least minimally by data gathered from the four
sample areas.
The most striking was a Scatter 4, where smaller sized flakes (less than 10 cm) made up 99.7 percent of
the observed assemblage (Figure 67). It also had the lowest percentage of cores (0.2 percent). Scatter 4
was located at the far northern end of the site, at about the last bench of limestone before a fairly steep
drop to the drainage below. This can be compared with Scatter 1, with only 88.9 percent of flakes smaller
than 10 cm, and the highest percentage of cores (4 percent), located not far from the southern end of the
site. Scatters 2 and 3 were more similar to Scatter 4 than they were to Scatter 1, both having a high
percentage of the smaller flakes and relatively few cores. Scatter 4 however, “felt” different from the rest.
It is interpreted as a location somewhat removed from the main part of the quarry, one where perhaps
secondary reduction took place.

Scatter 1, meanwhile, represented an area where primary acquisition was occurring more frequently, with
large cobbles being reduced to secondarily sized pieces, perhaps as part of a testing cycle. The large,
rounded cobbles would have required a substantial amount of force to initiate fracturing. It is highly
likely that this often occurred by way of simply throwing the cobbles onto the surrounding limestone
bedrock or against each other. Once split, hard hammer percussion could begin creating pieces suitable
for removal from the site for further reduction. The distinctive “orange slice” from ST 3 seems to
represent a more careful reduction technique, where possible bipolar reduction halved and then quartered
the large cobbles. Shovel Test 5 contained a core fragment that appeared to have been derived from a
similar piece, which had then been split crosswise for further reduction.
The quarry at 41ME193, unlike that at 41BX901, appears to represent a targeted, systematic logistical
operation, rather than a strategy embedded in other activities. There is little to suggest that any large
camps would have been located upon the same landform as the quarry. The nearest such camps would
most likely have been along the Medina River and its tributaries, and it is safe to assume that many are
submerged under the waters of Medina Lake. Such sites can only be addressed indirectly, and the data
gathered on 41ME193 can provide some little bits of information.
In recent years increasing attention has been paid to the role optimization plays in resource acquisition
(see Kelly 1995, for a starting point). Such questions ultimately address the fitness of the individual
(rather than the group) in the adaptive, selective process, and the physical elements of these processes
form in part, the archaeological record. The sometimes conflicting views of behavioral ecology and
selectionist archaeology (neo-Darwinism) overlap, at least at the seams, and literature from both camps is
referenced in the following discussion (Barton and Clark 1997; Torrence 1989a).
Some researchers have applied optimal foraging theory, usually reserved for acquisition of foodstuffs, to
the acquisition of raw material for stone tool production. Many of the same factors come into play,
especially when compared to plant resources (Hayden 1989). Lithic resources have a patchy distribution,
and have time and energy costs associated with search, procurement and processing. Time and effort are

166

essentially functions of distance, and the most efficient and therefore most likely strategy is to use
resources that are concentrated, of high quality and can be readily obtained on an as-needed basis
(Hayden 1989:9-10).
An important part of the equation also includes risk. Bamforth and Bleed (1997) go to great length to
describe what is meant by risk, but argue that, however it is defined, technology helps reduce it, and that
failures of one kind or another result in responses from technology as a mediating agent. Bousman, cited
in Bamforth and Bleed (1997:115) describes risk as “…the probability of economic loss…conceived in
terms of unpredictable environmental variations that influence getting enough food to supply a given
population” (Bousman 1993:64). Bamforth and Bleed appear to distill risk to the “probability of loss,”
with the understanding that the magnitude of the potential loss must factored in. Risk, therefore, is one
way to address basic questions within a “synthetic, conceptual frame work” (Bamforth and Bleed
1997:116).
In terms of lithic procurement, the risk is in not having the materials from which to make tools, or the
tools themselves, when such tools become critical to survival. The costs of acquisition, when balanced
against risk, begin to determine the following production and use strategies. In high cost situations, it is
expected that risk is minimized. In low cost situations, however, risk becomes less of a factor, and
selective pressures are less likely come into play, resulting in a more unpredictable and variable
assemblage (Bamforth and Bleed 1997:126). In lithic procurement activity, least-cost strategies are
expected (Torrence 1989c:64).
Two common currencies in determining costs are time and energy (Torrence 1989b:3). Energy is
commonly used, and makes sense when there is a direct energetic return on the investment (food). If the
return is indirect however, (energy essentially stored within a tool), then time might be a more important
factor: the less time spent gathering raw materials the more time that can spent putting tools to use. If
such is the case, then the distance from camp of the resource becomes increasingly important, especially
as levels of mobility drop, and embedded procurement is less likely to occur (Morrow and Jeffries
1989:29-30). Source materials that are distant become “expensive,” while those that are readily available
can be considered “inexpensive.” A relatively near, abundant source of high quality raw material would
be more heavily used than a less abundant and/or lower quality source, even if that second source was
nearer, as costs associated with more intensive extractive measures or risk associated with using lower
quality materials would increase (Hayden 1989:10).
The quarry at 41ME193 fits well within the above model. The artifact classes are highly variable, with no
apparent preponderance of technology other than generalized core reduction. Biface thinning flakes and
blades are both present, but not in any obvious quantities. And, unlike at some other quarry sites, failed
blanks or early stage bifaces are virtually nonexistent. (This may be the result of sampling error, or
perhaps collection by landowners over time, however this observation was consistent, and is felt to be
valid.)
The raw material, therefore, appears to have been inexpensive within this setting. This indicates
relatively nearby camps, a somewhat limited level of mobility, and long-term familiarity with the
landscape. It is useful to look at the site within its geologic context. The chert-bearing Edwards
Limestone formation begins just a bit west of here, and extends in a northeast trending arc for a distance
of about 85 miles which is some five to ten miles wide, and is cut by both the Medina and Guadalupe
rivers (Figure 68). This formation is also essentially the edge of the Edwards Plateau, and is therefore, if
not an ecotone, a transitional zone between the plateaus and high plains to the west and north and the
timberlands, prairies and low plains to the south and east. In short, it is potentially a highly favorable
environment for prehistoric foragers.

Site 41ME193 is certainly not unique as a quarry, and undoubtedly is one of dozens, if not hundreds,
within this broad zone. As with 41BX901, the magnitude of the assemblage illustrates the importance of
this region for lithic resource acquisition (Potter et al. 1992:11). So, although the site itself can offer little
in the way of new information about discrete periods of time or help differentiate technological variation,
it does provide raw material from which to develop methods that link the artifacts to higher level or
general theory (Camilli 1989:17) and attempt to address larger questions. As Torrence states, “…the
study of lithics could play a much more fundamental part in the general debates about the nature of
human behavior than has traditionally been the case” (Torrence 1989b:6). The availability of raw
material may be the most important part in how stone tool technology is organized (Andrefsky 1994). It
is certainly one part of a mapped system in which people passed collected knowledge through time (Harry
Shafer, personal communication 2008), and helped with the success of succeeding generations.

Summary and Recommendations
An approximate 200 m-long segment of the proposed Medina Lake transmission line will be rerouted
through previously recorded lithic procurement site 41ME193, which had been recommended for
avoidance or additional testing to determine State Archeological Landmark status if avoidance was not
possible. Because the new alignment is almost completely within a previously unsurveyed portion of the
site, a revisit was considered necessary. This more intensive survey was able to address specific
questions left unanswered by the original survey, and the results are considered to be representative of the
site as a whole.

168

A total of seven shovel tests has been excavated within the site. Although artifacts were recovered from
all shovel tests, and in varying quantities, there is nothing in the recovery or profiles to indicate anything
other than a slow accumulation of soil covering the remains of generalized and mixed activities.
Both surface observations and shovel tests also indicate that at least portions of the site, and quite likely
the majority of it, has been severely impacted in recent times. Large limestone slabs were seen sitting on
end, and a mounded area was tested and confirmed to be a bulldozer pushpile. No evidence of a structure
seen plotted on a 1921 map was found.
Four areas were identified as relatively discrete scatters and were subjected to intensive field
observations. These observations were manipulated in the lab and demonstrated that there are potentially
almost 1.4 million artifacts present within the site, including some 23,000 cores and core fragments. The
“macro flake,” defined as being larger than 20 cm, and an item which had in part caused the initial
interest in the site, is predicted to be only 0.4 percent of the assemblage, and seems to represent a
necessary technological method for systematic reduction of large, rounded cobbles (Figure 69).
There was some evidence of differential spatial distribution of artifact classes (smaller flakes v. larger
flakes), with possible secondary reduction taking place nearer the northern portion of the site, and primary
reduction more common towards the south. This may also be a function of the distribution of raw
material by size. Regardless, there is no indication that distinctive or discrete activities, procurement or
otherwise, is archaeologically visible at the site.
No additional time diagnostic artifacts were discovered. The periods of use remain unsubstantiated, other
than an assumption of long-term use over thousands of years.

Figure 69. Unmodified chert cobble from 41ME193.
Site 41ME193 appears to compare well to 41BX901, one of few other quarries systematically sampled
and analyzed. Both are indicative of intensive utilization of locations where high quality raw lithic
material was readily available. At 41ME193 minimal procurement instances could have created the
assemblage in about 290 continuous years. More likely, it was used intermittently throughout prehistory
as human populations fluctuated in density through time. It appears that the site is presently largely
exhausted of easily obtainable unmodified cobbles; however, previously modified pieces are readily
available.

169

The creation of Medina Lake in the early 1900s undoubtedly inundated numerous prehistoric campsites.
These are unavailable for study within the foreseeable future. The “middle range” of data gathered from
41ME193 links, through more generalized theory, to technological and perhaps social aspects of these
sites. When encamped within the Medina Lake area, and quite possibly within much of the broad band of
Edwards Limestone forming this portion of the Balcones Escarpment, people were able to obtain raw
lithic material with relatively little effort. It appears that minimizing time spent at the quarry was more
important than controlling energy costs. The inexpensive nature of the resource allowed energy
investments to be spent more expeditiously on other pursuits.
These investigations demonstrated that such sites can produce information useful to a better
understanding of prehistory. Sites that are better preserved than 41ME193, assuming they are asked the
correct questions, can continue to inform on, and be informed by, both middle range applications such as
statistical approaches, and higher level generalized theory as touched upon here. Other applications, such
as information theory (e.g. Gero 1989) and landscape archaeology (e.g. Ebert 1992) can also be
addressed.
Site 41ME193, however, is considered to now be documented at a level far beyond that at which such
sites are usually accorded. Although it has produced some useful information, its scientific value is
severely limited by both recent artificial impacts and an absence of discernable activity areas and dateable
artifacts. The portion of the site in the vicinity of both surveyed corridors is therefore considered to be
ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places.
It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed within either of the two surveyed corridors or a
reasonable distance from them without additional archaeological investigations. If, however, a drastic
realignment becomes necessary, especially any appreciable distance to the west or east, where the
potential for intact deposits or activity areas remain unknown, than investigations similar to this one are
recommended.

Management Summary
A 318-acre tract located a short distance below Buchan Dam was recently conveyed to the Lower
Colorado River Authority (LCRA) in order to create a security zone along the downstream (southeastern)
side of this facility and to ensure that real estate developers do not attempt to construct new residences in
flood prone areas downstream from the dam’s floodgates (Figures 70 and 71). As an initial step in
managing the new property, LCRA proposes to construct a barbed wire fence around the 3.25-mi
perimeter of the acreage. Preparation work for the installation of the fence will require clearing the
property lines of trees, brush, and other vegetation in some areas. The proposed vegetation clearing will
also create an approximately 8-ft wide corridor that will be utilized in the future for vehicular access and
will serve as a fire break. For most of the vegetation clearing, LCRA is proposing to utilize a sepii
machine that cuts vegetation including trees at ground level and then spreads the shredded remains on the
ground surface. However, a backhoe/front end loader or a small bulldozer will be used to clear vegetation
in some areas of rugged terrain where use of the sepii machine is not possible.
A cultural resource survey was conducted for the proposed fence construction and land clearing project
on April 8 and 9, 2008. The survey included revisit and assessment of three previously recorded cultural
resource sites. Additionally, high probability areas that will be affected by ground-disturbing activities
during the use of the backhoe/front end loader and small bulldozer were also surveyed. In all,
approximately 3 acres were field investigated, including overlapping survey from 2005 and 2007.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.
Study Area
The project is located in western Burnet County immediately downstream from Buchanan Dam and north
of the Colorado River. Within the project area, the land rises steadily from the river towards the
northwest for a distance of 600 meters and then levels out on the crest of a prominent ridge that helps
impound Lake Buchanan. The slope presents a rough topography with frequent outcrops of Precambrianaged Valley Spring gneiss, one of the oldest rock formations in the state (Barnes 1981).
Soils in the project area are defined as the Keese-Rock outcrop association (Dittemore and Allison
1979:Map Plate 20). Relatively small areas with a soil cover can be found amongst the outcrops,
especially on the east side of a small drainage that bisects the southern third of the project area. The
source of this drainage is a seep that emerges from the base of a low cliff and is perhaps kept continuously
charged by the artificially high water table around the lake. Before construction of the lake, this drainage
probably ran only after rainfall. Areas on either side of the drainage are densely forested with ashe
juniper and live oak. The soils throughout the project area belong to the Keese series, which are
composed of thin sandy loams averaging 17 inches in thickness over decomposing gneiss. Other areas of
deep to very deep soils were seen on the northern boundary and in the south-central section of the
property.
Portions of the project area have been altered considerably from their natural state by water released over
the years through three immense gates in the dam on the Burnet County side. (The turn-of-the-century
USGS map shows only one creek in the eastern portion of the property - and no mapped structures). This
release has created wide channels perhaps following natural gullies scoured down to bedrock leading
from the gates and heading in a southwesterly direction to the river. Away from these scoured areas, the
soil and vegetation appear intact. A juniper-oak woodland covers a substantial area between the two
southern dam gates to the north of which are a number of meadows amid high rock outcrops. More
range-like conditions are found in intact areas below the northernmost gate, with a few large trees amid
expanses of dense brush and cactus.

Over 50 years of archaeological investigations in Central Texas have led to a general understanding of the
region’s chronology and prehistoric subsistence patterns (Collins 1995). The region’s chronology was
largely derived from excavations of deeply stratified terrace sites. From at least 11, 500 years ago up
until the Spanish period (circa AD 1700), the Edwards Plateau and much of the rest of Central Texas was
inhabited solely by hunter-gatherers. Even in the Late Prehistoric period (AD 700 – 1650) when native
groups in other parts of what is now Texas were making the transition to an agriculture-based economy,
the Central Texas groups continued to rely completely on wild resources. Much of the archaeological
record relates to subsistence activities, the presence of burned rocks from cooking facilities being a
notable example. At certain locations, burned fragments have accumulated to the point of forming low
topographic features that are known as burned rock middens, or locally as “Indian mounds.”
Texas has traditionally been divided into a number of different archaeological regions, each defined by a
set of shared cultural traits, such as projectile point forms. Many archaeologists today interpret huntergatherer cultures in terms of their adaptation to the natural environment, and one criticism of
archaeological regions is that they often encompass more than one environmental zone and so contain
more than one type of adaptation (Ellis et al. 1995). For example, the Central Texas Archeological Region
includes six natural regions, including the Llano Uplift where Buchanan Dam is located.
Beginning in the 1930s, a series of dams were built along the stretch of the Colorado River upstream from
Austin to control flooding and produce hydroelectric power for rural communities. Buchanan Dam was
the first of these to be completed. A consortium of private business interests initiated the project but the
Depression ended construction in 1932 when only 40 percent of dam had been built (Yarbrough n.d.).
Many of the workers continued to live along the river in the vicinity of the partially built dam in the hope
that the project would eventually resume. Construction on the dam did not begin again until four years
later when the state of Texas created the Lower Colorado River Authority, a non-profit agency which
could receive and administer the federal funds needed to complete the project. Buchanan Dam was
completed in less than a year and began impounding the flow of the Colorado River on May 20, 1937.

Research Design
Prior to the field survey, a cultural resource file search including a review of data on the THC’s digitized
Site Atlas database along with LCRA’s internal cultural resource files was conducted. The file search
showed that there were three previously recorded cultural resource sites along the property perimeter that
might be affected by the fencing and land clearing project. These include sites 41BT380 and 41BT387
which were recorded by LCRA Archaeology Services staff in 2005 for a project involving proposed
maintenance activities for LCRA’s T-108 transmission line (Hixson et al. 2006:335-337). The third site,
41BT424, was recently recorded by LCRA Archaeology Services during the survey of a once-proposed
52-acre land purchase below Buchanan Dam.
For the currently proposed fencing and land clearing project on the perimeter of the larger 318-acre tract,
pedestrian survey work and shovel testing concentrated on high probability areas adjacent to stream
channels. In particular, high probability areas where it is anticipated that heavy machinery will cause
ground-disturbing activities during vegetation clearing were intensively examined.
For the originally proposed 52-acre land purchase, a pedestrian survey was conducted in June, 2007 that
covered 100% of the project area with intact soil, amounting to approximately 30 acres. Areas scoured to
bedrock were not surveyed. Shovel testing was conducted mostly in the southern half of the 52-acre tract
area because it contains the most vegetation and therefore will be impacted more by the proposed clearing
activities. This area also has a higher potential for prehistoric sites because of water sources including the

177

drainage mentioned above as well as numerous potholes or tinajas in the gneiss outcrops. This particular
sale was canceled and so was not reported to THC.
In order to consolidate previous investigations within what is now LCRA land that may become a park,
all known sites within the 318-acre parcel are reported upon, at least briefly. Figure 72 shows the
locations of all known shovel tests.
All sites were recorded on the TexSite database and documented with sketch maps. A no collection
policy was maintained throughout the investigation.

Results
Three previously recorded sites, 41BT380, 41BT387, and 41BT424 were revisited and two new
archeological sites, 41BT433 and 434, were recorded during the survey. These sites are shown in Figure
71. In addition to the locations that have been given site designations, a half dozen or so isolated metal
artifacts probably belonging to the period of dam construction were noted. These include a large hammer,
truck parts including doors, and various metal pipes and scrap metal. Descriptions of sites 41BT381 and
382, along with 41BT419-423, recorded during the original survey of the 52-acre tract are included in this
report, as is a very revisit to 41BT57, although none of these sites will be impacted by the present project.
Project Area Sites
41BT380
Site 41BT380 is a prehistoric lithic scatter with materials exposed on ground surface on both sides of a
gully that was dry at the time of the current investigation (Figure 73). A larger drainage channel is
located about 90 meters west of the west edge of the site, but that drainage may have been formed in
recent times by releases of flood waters from one of the Buchanan Dam floodgates. Cultural materials
were found to extend for a length of 125 meters within the approximately 25 meter transmission line
ROW. Materials observed at the site consist of about 20 pieces of chert debitage and one chert biface
fragment. Almost all of the artifacts were seen on the west side of the gully. A shovel test excavated on
that side of the gully during the LCRA’s previous survey for proposed maintenance activities on the T108 transmission line yielded three pieces of chert debitage in 25 cm thick gravelly sandy loam topsoils.
During the current investigation, ST #6 was excavated to determine if buried artifacts might be present in
the proposed fence corridor in the eastern part of the site. This shovel test indicated that the depth of
gravelly sandy loam deposits was 40 cm. No artifacts were recovered from the shovel test fill.
No evidence of a historic period component that was described on the original site form was seen during
the current survey. It appears that this historic component is actually present at site 41BT381, which was
recorded further westward during the 2005 LCRA survey.

The prehistoric materials observed at 41BT380 are restricted to chert debitage and one tool fragment. No
burned rocks, features, or diagnostic artifacts were found. Because of these factors, the portion of site
41BT380 within the proposed fence construction corridor is assessed as not eligible for the NRHP and not
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.
41BT387
Site 41BT387 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that was also originally recorded during the LCRA’s cultural
resource assessment for maintenance activities on the LCRA T-108 transmission line in 2005 (Figure 74).
The site extends for a length of about 40 m within the transmission line ROW and it is located on the west
side of a small creek that now carries water released from a floodgate of Buchanan Dam. The site
appeared to be a low density prehistoric lithic scatter with thin topsoils. No diagnostic artifacts or burned
rocks were observed.
This site is located on the eastern edge of the project area on the southwest side of an unnamed tributary
of the Colorado River. Site 41BT387 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter that consists of chert
debitage and a core. Overall, about 11 artifacts were observed on ground surface within the proposed
fence corridor and the LCRA T-108 transmission line ROW. These materials were found within an area
that measures about 100 meters on an east-west line by 40 meters on a north-south line. Shovel Tests #1
and 2 along with a previous shovel test excavated during an LCRA survey for proposed maintenance
work on the T-108 corridor were all negative. These shovel tests indicate that the depth of gravelly sandy
loam topsoil ranges from 22 to 27 cm in thickness.
No features, diagnostic artifacts, or burned rocks were observed during the current and previous survey
work. Based of the results of the survey, the portion of the site within the proposed fence construction
corridor is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not eligible for formal designation as an
SAL.
41BT424
This site was recorded by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff in 2007 during an intensive survey of a
smaller 52-acre tract below Buchanan Dam that LCRA originally proposed to purchase rather than the
larger 318-acre tract that LCRA has now secured (Figure 75). The site may represent a small prehistoric
campsite situated on a soil-covered bench midway up a slope and approximately 100 meters south of one
of the dam’s retaining walls. A steep rocky slope rising up towards the retaining wall forms the north site
boundary. On the south side the ground slopes down towards an artificial pond created where a dirt road
crosses the drainage. One flake, a biface fragment, and a burned rock were noted in an eroded area at the
southeast corner of the site. A mussel shell fragment was also noted near the center of the bench proper.
This was only cultural material seen on the surface.
In 2007, three shovel tests were dug in the soil on the bench. The first test was dug to a depth of 20 cm
through sandy loam, recovering five pieces of chert debitage. The second test was dug to a depth of 30
cm before encountering bedrock. Three flakes were recovered in the upper 20 cm of soil and two flakes
between 20 and 30 cm below the surface. The third test only reached a depth of 15 cm before
encountering bedrock and recovered one chert flake.
Although the soil cover on the bench is shallow, it appears to be undisturbed – its location on the slope
would prevent easy access by heavy machinery. The amount of material recovered from the shovel tests
suggests limited use of the area, probably by a small number of people over a relatively short period of
time. It is unlikely that the site contains more than one component. The site is tentatively identified as a
camping area but more testing is needed to verify this interpretation. Based on the small amount of
evidence collected so far, the site is potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for formal listing
as an SAL.

The 2008 revisit consisted of identifying the site’s boundaries, and prominently flagging the site for
avoidance by equipment. The three previously excavated shovel tests were relocated, but no cultural
material was seen on the ground surface. LCRA Archaeology Services will communicate with
construction planners to determine what type of fencing will be placed within the site. There are no
concerns with driving of t-posts, but if postholes are required Archaeology Services may choose to
monitor construction. Vegetation will be hand-cleared.
41BT433
This site is located on the eastern edge of the project area on the northeast side of an unnamed tributary of
the Colorado River (Figure 76). The site is an ephemeral prehistoric lithic scatter that is situated on the
first terrace above the tributary. Cultural materials consist of chert debitage and one projectile point
fragment that appears to be diagnostic of the Late Archaic II Period. Overall, the chert debitage and the
single projectile point fragment seen on ground surface suggest that materials are sparse. Additionally,
the two positive shovel tests (ST #3 and 4) each yielded only one chert chip in sandy loam deposits that
ranged from 20 to 37 cm in thickness.
Based on the pedestrian survey and shovel testing, the site is estimated to extend for a distance of
approximately 20 meters on a northeast to southwest line along the proposed boundary fenceline.
Additional survey work is needed to determine the full horizontal extent of the site to the north and south
of the fence corridor. It should be noted that prehistoric site 41BT383 is recorded on the T-108
transmission line about 100 m further southeastward, and future survey work may show that these two
sites are actually one continuous lithic scatter.
The current survey investigation indicates that the portion of 41BT433 within the proposed fence
construction corridor is not eligible for SAL or NR listing. This assessment is based on the lack of
features and the low volume and low diversity of cultural materials.
41BT434
Site 41BT434 is a low density lithic scatter with a small amount of mussel shell and a possible burned
rock recovered from a shovel test (Figure 77). It is located in an area with deep to very deep sandy loams.
The vegetation is primarily tall grasses with prickly pear, bee brush and tassijillo and a few large oak
trees. The land form slopes moderately downward from north to south as the Colorado River is
approached. Mapped stream channels to the east and west are the result of tailraces of Buchanan Dam
having scoured soils down to bare granite bedrock. South of the site, the first terrace of the river appears
to have been dramatically altered, and the lagoons that are present are most likely the result of borrow pits
for dam construction.
The site was located through shovel testing following the observation of two clusters of chert debitage,
one with about five flakes in an eroded area at the south end of the site, and two seen on the ground
surface at about the site center. Five shovel tests were excavated along the proposed fenceline, only one
of which (ST 14) was positive. This test had a tertiary flake and a mussel shell fragment in the upper 20
cm, and two tertiary flakes, a mid-stage biface fragment, and one possible burned rock in the second 20
cm. The test was excavated through 60 cm of light brown to brown sandy loam before decomposing
granite was encountered. Elsewhere, soils ranged from 45 cm in depth at the southern end of the site to
over 1 m as higher elevations were reached towards the north.
Site 41BT434 is considered to be fully investigated within the project area, and to be ineligible for formal
state or federal listings. The contour break running east/west through the center of the site does appear to
be favorable for additional site development, especially towards the west where it becomes a lobe
overlooking the river to the south. It is also possible it is a continuation of, or links into, 41BT381, a

lithic scatter located about 200 m of the west along the transmission line. Any future intensive ground
disturbing projects should have this area evaluated before proceeding.

Other Sites
These are sites that are within the new LCRA holding that were previously recorded and so are part of
LCRA’s inventory. They will not be impacted by the present project, but are included here for future ease
of reference.
41BT57
This site was first recorded by Daymond Crawford in 1965. Only a key site card is available. Reported
were an unknown number of Nolan points and a possible Gower point, along with manos. The revisit
found a light but extensive flake scatter beginning at the north end of a cement curb along a dirt road.
Also seen were one mano and a middle stage biface. Soils appears intact for a distance of about 20 m east
of the road towards the creek and more substantially to the west of the road, where a fairly discrete trash
scatter suggests a building was once present, probably associated with the improved road and dating to
the period of dam construction. When the site can be more clearly defined and shovel tested, a new
TexSite form will be completed.
41BT381
This site was revisited briefly, and it was confirmed that this is the location with the light historic trash
scatter, essentially a few pieces of whiteware and some metal. Flakes were common and widespread, and
it is assumed that the unifaces on the site form were actually present. It appears that the site form for
41BT380 that is on file at TARL was incorrectly filled out and confused with 41BT381. Given the
uncertainty and lack of documentation, additional investigations are warranted here.
41BT382
Based on the sketch map of this site, it appears it was a very low density lithic scatter. It was not
discussed in the transmission line maintenance document, so it appears that no avoidance was considered
necessary within the transmission line ROW. However, since previous work was restricted to the ROW,
and LCRA now owns this property, a larger reinvestigation of this site is warranted, especially prior to
ground disturbing activities.
41BT419
Site 41BT419 represents the remains of a historic structure consisting of a stone chimney/fireplace and
concrete building piers with a nearby tin can trash heap (Figure 78). The location of this structure is
unusual in that it was constructed over a wash in a low spot between gneiss outcrops. Runoff from rains
has created a channel between the chimney and one of the piers. The chimney was built of undressed
local boulders cemented together, perhaps originally with lime mortar but with extensive repairs of
Portland cement. The piers were molded from concrete and appear more recent than the chimney, at least
in a technological sense. No household trash was noted in the vicinity except for the tin can trash heap
located 20 feet northwest of the chimney.
The previous land owner was told by “old timers” that the fireplace was part of a kitchen used to feed
dam workers in the 1930s. Although the fireplace/chimney appears older, the lack of household debris
and the tin can dump would support such an interpretation.

187

Figure 78. Sketch of 41BT419.

188

41BT420
This site represents a small surface lithic scatter bordered on the west side by the main drainage through
the project area and on the east side by a low granite ledge (Figure 79). The ground in between is covered
by sparse grasses and forbs with an open canopy of juniper trees.
The cultural material consists entirely of chert debitage. Approximately one dozen flakes and chips were
observed with a slight concentration near the southern limits of the site area where minor sheet erosion
has occurred. One possibly burned quartz rock was also noted on the surface.
41BT421
This site is very similar in size and composition to Site 2. It is located approximately 100 meters to the
north of 41BT420 on the east side of the same drainage. Approximately one dozen flakes were noted on
the surface but no burned rocks.
41BT422
This site is located along the dirt road that runs along the east side of the project area. Cultural material
was mainly seen in the road where visibility is good giving the impression that the site is long and narrow
along a northeast to southwest line. The blading of the dirt road may have carried some of the cultural
material along the road increasing its length somewhat.

41BT423
This consists of a prehistoric lithic scatter located towards the middle of the project area immediately
south of one the largest areas of bedrock exposed by water released from the dam (Figure 80). The
northeastern half of the site area is covered by numerous low granite outcrops stunted live oak trees, the
southwestern half has a thin soil cover and more open vegetation. A dirt road skirts the southeastern edge
of the site. Cultural material consists of chert debitage, several bifaces, and one triangular dart point
resembling the Early Triangular type.
Other Areas
Shovel Test 10 was placed near the river’s edge at the southwestern portion of the property. This test
found about 10 cm of organic topsoil over clay and gravel. Much of the fence will be routed through
standing or intermittently standing water. The ca. 1900 USGS map shows an island in this location, and
remnants of it may exist. Although scattered artifacts were seen on the river terrace south of 41BT434,
the land appeared very irregular, and the large ponds are very clearly artificial. So although there may be
portions of the river terrace that are relatively undisturbed, most is probably destroyed by presumed
borrow an quarry operations for dam construction.
The granite or gneiss outcrops west and north of 41BT423 had occasional flakes visible around their
edges. Shovel test 12 was placed in this area, and found 60 cm of spoil, likely pocketed. No artifacts
were recovered. More intensive survey actually found fewer flakes, so this previously surveyed area was
not recorded as a site or possible extension of 41BT423.
It is also in this general area that very large, impressive boulders overlooking significant viewsheds are
present on sloping bedrock, reminiscent of those seen at Enchanted Rock. Tongue-in-cheek references to
“places of power” need not be fully discounted, especially if a landscape-based interpretative design is
developed.

189

The two mapped drainages along FM 690 were investigated. Visibility was fair and there was no
evidence of cultural material. Elsewhere there appears to be a low probability for intact archaeological
sites along this existing fenceline.
Shovel Test 13 was placed in pocketed soils near where a single chip had been seen during pedestrian
survey. It found about 35 cm of sandy loam soils. Further examination found two additional flakes in the
general vicinity. These were not considered to be present in sufficient density to warrant site designation,
but future work should more closely examine this general area, which is bordered to the west by the one,
true creek.
This creek, presently unnamed on USGS maps, but referred to by Daymond Crawford as named in
reference to a nearby physiographic feature from which it originates could certainly use intensive survey.
Site 41BT57, 383, 387, as well as 41BT58, located outside LCRA property are all o or near this creek.
The drainage that originates from the easternmost floodgates or spillway was also investigated. Soils here
were in excess of one meter deep, as evidenced by the scoured drainage. No artifacts were seen, but
intensive ground disturbing activities should be investigated before proceeding in this area.
Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to construct an approximate 3.25 mi perimeter fence around a newly-acquired 318-acre
tract located immediately below Buchanan Dam in western Burnet County, Texas. An 8-foot wide
corridor will be mechanically cleared along this boundary.
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services that incorporated
two previous investigations with targeted survey and site revisits. Three previously recorded sites,
41BT380, 387 and 424, and two previously unrecorded sites, 41BT433 and 434, will be impacted by the
project. A total of 13 sites are mentioned in this report in order to consolidate data and more easily enable
any future investigations.
Three of the four sites recorded during transmission line investigations within the tract, 41BT380, 382
and 387, four of the six sites recorded during the original 52-acre survey, 41BT420-423, and the two new
sites 41BT433 and 41BT434, recorded during the present project, contain surface or superficially buried
deposits consisting of debitage and an occasional stone tool. These deposits are likely disturbed and
temporally mixed. The lack of evidence for activities other than stone tool making and repair also limits
the research value of these sites. Therefore, the investigated portions of these sites are not SAL-eligible
and do not have to be avoided during the project.
Site 41BT381 was previously recommended for avoidance. It was not intensively reinvestigated during
the present project, although the cursory examination suggest significant research yield would be low
within the transmission line corridor. Regardless, for the time being, those recommendations remain in
effect.
Site 41BT424, on the other hand, contains buried deposits relating to cooking activities in addition to the
stone tool manufacturing and maintenance. The small size of the site and low artifact density suggest that
it was occupied by a small number people over a brief period of time – such as during a period of group
fission when larger bands split up when food resources were scarce. A winter season camp seems likely,
especially since the site is well-sheltered from the elements. This site has potential for research involving
land use patterns, composition of fissioned groups, and activities conducted by small groups during
winter months. Therefore avoidance of the site is recommended during the clearing activities associated

190

with this project. If the area cannot be avoided, all vegetation including trees must be cut by hand in
order to avoid any ground disturbances. The site has been prominently flagged to facilitate avoidance.
Site 41BT419 is the only historic site recorded during the survey. Its location within a draw has resulted
in damage to the structure by rainwater runoff, including dislocation of its piers and removal of any
archeological deposits under and around the structure. A small tin can dump is located nearby but
extensive buried cultural deposits are not possible in the shallow soils. The site contains little additional
information other than what has already been recorded. Still, the chimney and the one in situ pier are part
of the history of the dam building and should be preserved. The site is not within the present project area,
but any future projects will be recommended for avoidance.
This property is topographically unique among LCRA landholdings. Possible future use as a park will
enable additional investigations. For the purposes of the present project, it is recommended that the
clearing and fence construction be allowed to proceed as described, with the exception of the flagged site
41BT424, where hand clearing and limiting of fence construction to t-posts is recommended. If this is not
possible, then additional testing is warranted and will be considered, along with potential monitoring of
any small postholes necessary for fence construction. More intensive impacts will have any further
investigations coordinated through the Texas Historical Commission.

Abstract
During the period from May to July 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive
cultural resource survey for the LCRA’s proposed Rim Rock to Jack Furman Transmission Line and
Substation Project in Kerr County, Texas. As a result of the investigation, 10 new prehistoric sites
consisting of 41KR662-41KR671 were recorded and assessed. One previously recorded prehistoric site,
41KR649, was also revisited and assessed. These 11 sites can be classified as 3 burned rock midden sites
(41KR649, 41KR663, and 41KR666), 6 lithic scatters (41KR664, and 41KR667-41KR671), and 2 lithic
scatter/lithic procurement sites (41KR662 and 41KR665).
Cultural deposits associated with a burned rock midden feature at the south end of site 41KR649 were
assessed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and potentially
worthy of formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Avoidance of this portion of site
41KR649 is recommended during project construction.
The portions of the other 10 sites that are located within the project area are assessed as not eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and not meriting formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks. The assessments for these 10 sites are based on various factors including
previous disturbances to cultural deposits, absence of depth of deposits, sparseness of cultural materials,
and the lack of discrete components, features, diagnostic artifacts, and dateable materials.

Aside from the avoidance measures at site 41KR649, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends
that construction of the Rim Rock to Jack Furman Transmission Line and Substation Project be allowed
to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations. As always, standard emergency discovery
provisions are applicable to this project.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct the new Rim Rock to Jack
Furman Transmission Line and Substation Project in Kerr County, Texas. The project consists of the
construction of the new Jack Furman electrical substation along with about 6.6 linear miles of electrical
transmission line. The project area is situated west and southwest of Kerrville, Texas and will extend
from the LCRA’s existing Rim Rock Substation generally northward to connect to LCRA’s existing T368 transmission line (Figure 81). The transmission line will generally have an 80 foot wide corridor with
exceptions being a 140 foot wide corridor where the transmission structures are spaced at longer intervals
at the Guadalupe River crossing and on several steep slopes extending from upland ridges to canyon
bottomlands. The new substation will cover a rectangular area of approximately 4 acres near the north
end of the project.
During the period from May to July 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive
cultural resource survey for this project. The survey consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing of a
previously recorded archaeological site and high probability areas for unrecorded sites. Personnel who
conducted the fieldwork consisted of LCRA staff members Daniel Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and
contracted archaeologists Glenn Goode, Chuck Hixson, and Cody Kiker. The investigation was
conducted under TAC Blanket Permit #4779, which was issued to the LCRA by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) for Calendar Year 2008. The survey investigation was also designed to meet the
requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. All work was completed
in accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas Council of
Archeologists (1992).

Environmental Background
The project area is located on the Edwards Plateau within the southern edge of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Raisz 1957; Fenneman 1938). The transmission line corridor crosses the
Guadalupe River and several of its tributaries. Vegetation on the Guadalupe River floodplain consists of
live oak-mesquite-ashe juniper parkland while the uplands are live oak-ashe juniper woodland (McMahan
et al. 1984). It appears that extensive tree and brush clearing has occurred in upland areas in and around
the project area in recent years since many upland areas depicted as wooded on the current USGS map are
now predominantly grasslands (Figure 82).
In upland areas, the surface geology consists of the Glen Rose Limestone and the Fort Terrett member of
the Edwards Limestone (Barnes 1981). Importantly, the Fort Terrett member contains large amounts of
high quality chert that were an important resource to Native American peoples. Within the transmission
line corridor, low terrace deposits of either Holocene or Pleistocene age are present on the floodplains of
the Guadalupe River and its tributary, Bear Creek. These terrace deposits include some alluvium along
with large amounts of gravel.
Soils on upland parts of the project area mostly consist of the Eckrant-Kerrville Rock Outcrop
Association (Dittemore and Coburn 1984). These are mostly shallow clayey to loamy soils of 5 to 20 cm
thickness that contain limestone cobbles and gravels. These soils occur on landforms ranging from gently
undulating to those that are hilly and steep. A few upland areas at the south end of the project area have
topsoils of the Tarpley-Eckrant-Rough Creek Association. These are shallow to very shallow loamy and
clayey soils that contain limestone cobbles.
Nuvalde-Oakalla-Boerne soils are present on terraces and bottom lands adjacent to the Guadalupe River
and Bear Creek. These soils are loamy and clayey soils that occur on level to gently

substation location, and the areas surveyed.

sloping surfaces. These soils are relatively deep and can as thick as 4 meters in some areas. At the
Gatlin Site (41KR621), which is located about 2 miles downstream on the south side of the Guadalupe
River, prehistoric archaeological materials were found as deep as 1.2 meters below ground surface in a
Nuvalde silty clay deposit (Miller: Personal Communication 2008). Within the project area, an alluvial
terrace deposit is present on the north bank of the river but is absent on the south bank of the river. A 2.5
meter deep bulldozer cut for a low water river crossing on the north bank just upstream from the
transmission line corridor shows the terrace deposit has only a 30 to 50 cm thick topsoil with the deeper
part of the profile being a mostly a gravelly matrix (Figure 83).

Culture History
The project area lies on the boundary between the Central Texas (Prewitt 1981) and South Texas (Hester
2004) archeological regions. Archaeological materials from both regions have typically been divided into
four main subdivisions, Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These subdivisions
combine to begin to describe the 12,000 or more years of human occupation. A longstanding, detailed
chronology for Central Texas that was proposed by Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been revised by
Johnson and Goode (1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and
geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with the research of Collins
(1995), who indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those described by
Johnson and Goode. The ultimate goal of many modern archaeologists is to transcend the culture history
of an area and attempt to explain why change occurred in various cultures and regions. To this end
carefully revised chronologies are to be expected and encouraged.
Native American archaeological site types in Kerr County consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts,
interments, cemeteries, kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins
1995:363). The area is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the
Edwards Plateau. Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger
streams and rivers (cf. Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was
occupied for at least 12,000 years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout
these millennia, Native American peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the
landscape exploiting seasonally available plant and animal resources.
Kerr County was first settled in 1846 by Joshua D. Brown and a group of shingle makers who settled at
the location of present day Kerrville (Odintz 1997). This soon became a community and was named
Brownsborough in 1848. In 1856 Brownsborough was renamed Kerrville. Indian raids were problematic
through 1878, and as a result, Camp Verde was established in 1855. The Civil War saw high levels of
violence between anti-secessionist German settlers and Confederate sympathizers. Ranching became
increasingly important in the area, and in 1880 the Y O Ranch was established by Charles A. Schreiner.
The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway reached Kerrville in 1887, which provided additional
economic benefits. By the 1920’s, production of mohair was a thriving industry. Tourism began in the
early part of the twentieth century as Kerr County acquired a reputation for a healthful climate.
Numerous camps, resorts, and health facilities were established, and remain an important part of the local
economy.

Previous Investigations
According the Texas Historic Sites Atlas, Kerr County presently has over 660 recorded archaeological
sites. Some sites in the Kerrville vicinity have been recorded by avocational archaeologists and many
other others were recorded any archaeological projects have been related to road or highway construction.
An example of more intensive work includes the Shep Site and the Wounded Eye Site (41KR109 and
41KR107) excavated during the improvements to State Highway 16 (Luke 1980). These were both
burned rock middens that contained primarily Middle Archaic projectile points with seemingly intrusive
materials of both earlier and later periods. Analysis was confined to the lithic assemblage, with the
principal conclusion suggesting that reduction activities were centered on biface manufacture and
expedient tool technology. These two sites may contain important data based on the preponderance of
Early Triangular points with lesser numbers of Travis and Nolan points suggesting a relatively short-lived
occupation during a the Middle Archaic period.

200

The Camp Pearl Wheat Site (Collins et al. 1990) was an Early/Middle Archaic camp with Martindale,
Uvalde, and Bell points. Of particular interest were archaeomagnetic and organic residue studies that
were conducted. This led to detailed conclusions regarding burned rock feature construction and use
sequences.
Many other previously recorded sites are burned rock middens that suggest abundance of substantial
Middle Archaic occupation areas during a time of relatively harsh and dry conditions (Collins 1995) when
persons may have retreated to the edge of the Plateau where water sources were more predictable, based
on the large numbers of springs that are present. Drier conditions may also have led to the beginning of
the burned rock midden phenomenon, when xeric adapted plants, in particular stool, began to expand their
range and become a more obvious food choice (Johnson 1995). Gaining a fuller understanding of the
Middle and Late Archaic Periods may be one of the most valuable research opportunities this part of the
Hill Country will provide.

Methodology
Prior to the survey, a files search was conducted to check for previously recorded archaeological sites
within and near the ROW corridor and determine high probability areas for unrecorded archaeological
sites. According to the THC’s Site Atlas there were no previously recorded archaeological sites within
the project area. The file search showed that there are numerous previously recorded archaeological sites
in the vicinity of the project area. The major prehistoric campsites and some of the burned rock midden
sites were located on the lower terraces of the Guadalupe River and larger creeks. Other burned rock
midden sites appeared to be located not only adjacent to smaller creeks but also on upland ridges near the
heads of tributary creeks, which seemed to imply that spring vents are present at heads of these creeks.
Prehistoric lithic scatters were also noted to be fairly common on the edges of upland ridges overlooking
stream channels. Based on the results of the files search, high probability areas for prehistoric sites were
then determined and these areas were plotted on the modern Kerrville, Texas 7.5’ USGS map for field
survey (see Figure 81).
An attempt was also made to determine high probability areas for historic period sites. An early
1:125,000 scale Kerrville, Texas USGS map was found on the University of Texas library system’s
website. This map was printed in 1885 and reprinted in 1920. Unfortunately, individual rural house sites
are not shown on this map. This map did show that no communities or former communities would be
crossed by the transmission line. No other USGS topographic maps were found for the era between the
reprinted 1920 map and the modern 7.5’ Kerrville, Texas USGS that was first published in 1964 and then
photorevised in 1982. Importantly, this 7.5’ map indicated that there are no standing structures within the
ROW corridor.
Field survey methods used during the project consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey of all
high probability areas as described above along with shovel testing. Pedestrian survey methods for high
probability areas consisted of walking the transmission line corridor in zig-zag transects while intensively
inspecting bare and eroded patches of ground surface. Additionally, the walls of cutbanks and gullies
were examined for evidences of buried cultural materials. During the pedestrian survey shovel tests,
which consisted of small 35 to 40 cm (13.5 to 15 inch) diameter holes excavated to maximum depths of
100 cm (39 inches) or to the top of the bedrock/B horizon, were judgmentally placed in areas of high
probability having poor ground surface visibility and also to help determine the boundaries of any
archeological sites. All shovel tests were carefully backfilled immediately after excavation to restore the
ground surface to its original appearance. Further, no artifacts were removed from the property of any of
the landowners. Any artifacts observed on the ground surface or found in the shovel tests were examined,

201

analyzed, and photographed in the field, as necessary, and then placed back in their original locations.
Appendix 1 provides lists the soil descriptions from each shovel test.

Survey Results
Approximately 3.6 linear miles of the 6.6 mile long transmission line ROW were intensively surveyed
(see Figure 81). Ground surface visibility was generally fair due to the fact that shallow, stony topsoils
cover the ground surface in many areas. Also, in some upland areas, limestone bedrock is present on
ground surface. Additionally, because of extended drought conditions, vegetation was less dense than
under normal conditions (Figure 84). These factors reduced the need for shovel testing so that a total of
33 shovel tests were excavated rather than the 58 shovel tests that would typically meet the THC’s
minimum requirements.

vegetation due to drought conditions.
As a result of the field survey, 10 new cultural resource sites, 41KR662-671, and 1 previously recorded
site, 41KR649, were recorded and assessed. Descriptions of these sites are provided in the following
paragraphs according to their locations within Survey Areas 1-3.
Survey Area A
This survey area consists of the northern one-third of the proposed transmission line corridor and the
proposed new Jack Furman Substation. High probability areas targeted for survey in Area A include the
terraces on either side of the Guadalupe River and the head of a small tributary creek northeast of the
substation tract (Figure 85). The proposed substation area was also investigated because the chert-bearing
Fort Terrett limestone occurs in that area. One additional high probability area adjacent to a tributary
creek at the far north end of the transmission line route where it will tie-in with the LCRA’s existing T202

368 transmission was not checked because it had been previously surveyed with negative results during
the LCRA’s survey of the T-368 corridor (Hixson et al. 2004). The five archaeological sites recorded in
Area A are described below.

This prehistoric lithic scatter/lithic procurement site is located in the northern part of the project area. The
site lies south and east of Goat Creek Cut-Off Road and will be impacted both by the construction of the
transmission line and the new Jack Furman Substation (Figure 86). Because areas north and west of the
final substation location were originally considered as possible locations for the substation, the surveyors
were able to determine that the site covers an area measuring about 195 meters north-south by 115 meters
east-west. It is situated at the base of a moderately steep hill and about 420 to 580 meters southwest of an
intermittent creek. The western part of the site has been disturbed by former usage as a house trailer park.
The site has a diffuse surface scatter of artifacts consisting flint chipping debris, tool fragments, test chert
cobbles, and cores. Approximately 10 chert flakes, one core, one scraper, two biface performs, and a
finished biface fragment were observed. Several rounded chert cobbles with one to three flake removals
were also seen on ground surface as were some thinner, tabular chert cobbles of 2.5 to 5.0 cm thickness
that showed signs of initial flaking.

The only subsurface artifact found at 41KR662 was a biface fragment which seen eroding out of ditch
that had been cut along a fenceline. The biface was found about 20 cm below ground surface on the
boundary between the grayish-brown gravelly clay loam topsoil and the underlying limestone bedrock.
Close inspection of the adjacent banks of the ditch, however, revealed no other artifacts. Additionally,
Shovel Test # 21 which was excavated in undisturbed soil near the location of the biface was negative.
Four other Shovel Tests (ST# 17-20) which were excavated within other parts of the site were also
negative.
Based on the low density of artifacts, the lack of features and diagnostic artifacts, the portion of site
41KR662 within the proposed electrical substation and associated transmission line ROW is assessed as
not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and not meriting formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
41KR663
This prehistoric burned rock midden site is located on the first terrace overlooking the north bank
Guadalupe River and, overall, the site appears to extend for a length of 95 meters on a north-south line
within the transmission line ROW (Figure 87). The site extends across the entire 24 meter (80 ft) width
of the transmission line ROW on an east-west line. The site is also known to extend at least 20 meters
further eastward and 40 meters further westward. A Late Archaic projectile point of the Marcos or
Castroville type was seen during a brief reconnaissance of that area west of the transmission ROW.
A broad surface scatter of burned rocks covering an area about 25 meters north-south line by 30 meters
east-west at the north end of the site is interpreted as representing the scattered remains of a former
burned rock midden feature (Figure 88). This portion of the site is a formerly cultivated field, and
plowing appears to have flattened the midden feature and spread the burned rocks and chert chipping
debris across the field. Although the burned rock does not approach the normal density of a burned rock
midden, the rocks are slightly denser in the central part of the scatter. Shovel Test #11 was excavated in
that central area to determine if any buried cultural remains are present. The shovel test produced 29
chert flakes and chips, 1 chert unificial tool fragment, and 12 burned rock fragments. However, almost all
of these artifacts came from the upper 10 cm of shovel test within the former plow zone. The overall
depth of gravelly clay loam topsoil in that area is 31 cm.
Shovel Test #16 was then excavated about 15 meters east of Shovel Test #11 in an area where the burned
rock scatter was less dense on ground surface. The artifact recovery consisted of only three chert flakes
and chips, with all of these found in the upper 10 cm of soil deposits. The shovel test was terminated
when a very dense gravel lens was encountered at 30 cm below ground surface.
Beyond the burned rock scatter, there are extremely few artifacts on ground surface. Shovel Tests #9 and
10 were excavated south of the burned rock scatter to determine if buried cultural deposits might be
present in areas closer to the river channel where deeper topsoils are present. Shovel Test #10 was placed
just 5 meters south of the south edge of the burned rock scatter. Recovery from Levels 1 and 2 consisted
of just one chert chip in each level. A solid gravel deposit was struck at 36 cm below ground surface
(bgs) and the shovel test was ended at 50 cm without reaching the bottom of the gravel deposit. Shovel
Test #9 was excavated about 55 meters south of the burned rock scatter at the location of proposed
Transmission Pole Structure #37 (see Figure 87). A few flakes and a tested cobble were found in Levels
1 and 3. Excavation of this shovel test ended at 1 meter below ground surface.

205

Figure 87. Map of site 41KR663.

206

Figure 88. View of northern part of site 41KR663 with shovel testing in progress within the burned rock
scatter.
Since much of the area between Shovel Tests #9 and 10 has been heavily disturbed by the construction of
a gravel road, no further shovel testing was attempted in the area south of the burned rock scatter. Shovel
Tests #12 and 13 were then dug north of the burned rock scatter. Immediately north of the burned rock
scatter, Shovel Test #12, located just 5 meters north of the scatter, was sterile while Shovel Test #13,
which was excavated about 30 meters north of the burned rock scatter, produced just one flake.
The survey results indicate that the burned rock midden feature at 41KR663 has been heavily damaged by
cultivation and land clearing. The vast majority of artifacts associated with this feature lay within the
plow zone. Beyond the horizontal limits of the midden scatter, artifact
density is low and there is little diversity of materials. With the exception of Shovel Test #9, dense
gravels were encountered at an average depth of 33 cm below ground surface. Shovel
testing provided no evidence of buried features and only one diagnostic, a Late Archaic dart point, was
found. Based on these factors, the portion of the site within the transmission line is assessed as not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not eligible for formal listing as an SAL.
41KR664
Site 41KR664 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that is located about 400 meters north of the Guadalupe River
on the outer edge of first terrace above the river channel (see Figure 85). Archaeological materials were
observed on the east side of a north-south running fenceline in an open field that is currently being
bulldozed to reshape the landscape for the upcoming construction of a large gas (Figure 89). This
fenceline marks the western edge of the transmission
line ROW, and most artifacts were observed in the backdirt of a one meter deep ditch that parallels the
fenceline (Figure 90). Other artifacts were observed in the vicinity of a separate 15

207

Figure 89. Map of site 41KR664.
ft high backdirt pile that lies about 15 meters east of the east edge of the transmission line ROW. This
backdirt pile appears to be the spoil material from a large pit that has been excavated further east of the
transmission line ROW.
The portion of 41KR664 within the transmission line ROW appears to be a low density prehistoric lithic
scatter. Approximately 12 pieces of chert chipping debris are spread across the disturbed backdirt of the
ditch for a length 90 meters. The only burned rocks found consisted of four specimens scattered over
10x10 meter area on the slopes of the ditch in the central part of the site. Additionally, an Ensor point
fragment was seen at the base of the larger backdirt pile east of the transmission line ROW.

208

Since the one meter deep ditch that extends on a north-south line down the length of the transmission line
corridor, inspection of the walls of the ditch were used in lieu of some of the shovel testing. The depth of
grayish-brown silty clay topsoil in the ditch was observed to range from 10 to 50 cm. A yellowish-brown
clay subsoil lay beneath this deposit.
Shovel Test #15 was excavated on the centerline of the ROW corridor east of the area where the burned
rocks were seen. This shovel test yielded no artifacts. Shovel Test #16 was placed at the proposed
location of Structure #38, the nearest proposed transmission line pole, to determine if the site extended
south of the materials exposed in the ditch. This shovel test was also negative.
Overall, the site appears to have widely scattered, diffuse remains that have little potential for further
investigation. The site is assessed as not eligible for the NRHP and no meriting formal designation as an
SAL.

209

41KR670
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located on a high upland ridge overlooking the south side of the
Guadalupe River channel basin (see Figure 85). While the main river channel is actually 200 meters
north of the site, an overflow slough associated with the river is just 110 meters north of the site.
Within the transmission line ROW, there is a very diffuse scatter of chert flakes and chips with most of
them being located near the proposed location of Transmission Structure #36 (Figure 91). Despite an
extensive search and good ground surface visibility in some areas, only five pieces of chert debitage were
found within the transmission line corridor.
Since the landowner accompanied the crew during the field investigation, he allowed the crew to briefly
survey adjacent areas outside of the transmission line ROW. Much denser cultural materials were found
at distances 10 to 15 meters west of the west edge of the transmission line ROW on the central part of a
topographic projection of the upland terrace. Among the materials found outside of the ROW were a
projectile point fragment possibly of the Angostura type and a biface fragment. Shovel Test #34 was
excavated within the transmission line corridor at a spot as close as possible to these finds outside the
corridor. That shovel test was negative. Another shovel test, #35, was excavated at the north end of the
site where Transmission Structure #36 will be placed. It, likewise, was negative.
Overall, the known part of the site covers an area measuring about 50 meters on a northeast-southwest
line by 22 meters on a northwest-southeast line. Although areas of interest may lie west of the
transmission line corridor, the portion of the site within the corridor does not have buried deposits,
features, or any density of materials to warrant any additional investigation. The portion of site 41KR670
that lies within the transmission line ROW is assessed as not worthy of formal designation as an SAL and
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
41KR671
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located in a cleared field about 60 meters south of site 41KR670. The site
lies of the same upland ridge system as 41KR670, but further south of the Guadalupe River floodplain.
The diffuse scatter of artifacts observed on ground surface at this site consists of one chert projectile point
fragment of unknown type, a chert scraper, about 40 pieces of chert debitage, and 5 to 10 burned rock
fragments. These artifacts are spread over an area measuring about 180 meters north-south by 22 meters
east-west. Although the artifact scatter is not dense, higher numbers of artifacts were noted at both the
north and southwest ends of the site. Burned rock fragments are present only at the north end. An
additional artifact of interest is an isolated bullet of apparent 19th century age that was found on ground
surface in the southern part of the site.
Ground surface visibility at this site is good due to recent land clearing and the fact that the southern half
of the site has limestone bedrock exposed on ground surface in many areas. Because the only area with
any apparent soil depth was at the far north end of the site, Shovel Test #36 was excavated in that area
near several of the burned rocks seen at the site. The shovel test showed that the depth of soil deposits
above limestone bedrock was only 18 cm. No artifacts were found in the shovel test matrix.
The site appears to be a diffuse lithic scatter with the few burned rocks also suggesting the usage of
cooking or heating features. The shallow deposits have been damaged by land clearing and slope wash.
No intact features or dateable diagnostic artifacts were seen. The portion of site 41KR671 within the
transmission line ROW is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no meriting formal
designation as an SAL.

Area B
High probability areas that were surveyed in Area B, the central part of the project area include the
floodplain and low terraces where the transmission line will cross Bear Creek and two of its tributaries
(Figure 92). This includes one fairly long segment where the transmission line will be placed within the
narrow valley of a steep canyon in central and southern parts of Area B. In that area, the transmission line
ROW will extend more or less parallel to one of the tributaries.

211

Figure 92. Section of the Kerrville, Texas 7.5’ USGS map showing areas surveyed in Area B and the
locations of archaeological sites that were recorded.
41KR666
This burned rock midden site is located on the left (north) terrace of Bear Creek approximately a mile and
a half from its confluence with the Guadalupe River. The steep terrace slope, 70 meters north of the creek
channel and rising 20 feet, forms the southern boundary of the site. Cultural material becomes scarce
approximately 80 meters north of the terrace edge and ends 10 meters or more south of Bear Creek Road.

212

The area between the creek and the road is mostly covered by thick woods of ashe juniper and oak except
for a 10 meter-wide strip running perpendicular to the creek and road that has been cleared for use as a
water pipeline and electrical distribution line (Figure 93). The eastern half of the proposed transmission
line ROW mostly consists of this cleared utility distribution line corridor.
During initial survey work to locate the boundaries of the transmission line ROW, the west edge of a
small burned rock midden was observed. It was quickly determined that this feature is about 11 meters
east of the transmission line ROW corridor’s boundary (Figure 94). The midden appeared to be about 10
meters in diameter but size and plan uncertain because of rocks strewn out of a pit dug in the approximate
center by relic hunters. This feature should not be affected by the transmission line project. Cultural
material observed on the surface within the proposed ROW consists nearly entirely of chert debitage with
only one tool noted during the survey, a modified flake. Since much of the project area has been cleared
and is apparently frequented by relic hunters, many projectile points and other obvious tools may have
probably already been removed from the site.
Shovel Test #26 was excavated immediately adjacent to the proposed location of Transmission Structure
#30. The soil profile showed a 17 cm thick grayish-brown stony loam above limestone bedrock. Artifact
recovery consisted of three small tertiary flakes. Shovel Test #27 was excavated about 25 meters further
northward on the centerline of the transmission corridor in a heavily wooded area. It revealed a 21 cm
brown stony loam that lay on limestone bedrock. No artifacts were found in the screening of the fill.
The portion of the site within the proposed ROW contains mainly surface cultural material that is
disturbed and probably temporally mixed. The artifact scatter appears to be related to a burned rock
midden feature is located east of the transmission line corridor. The portion of the site within the
transmission line corridor is not considered NRHP or SAL eligible.

213

Figure 94. Site map for 41KR666.
41KR667
This prehistoric lithic scatter is situated within a steep-sided canyon in the upper reaches of a tributary of
Bear Creek (Figure 95). The site is located at the base of steep upland slope along the east side of a
deeply incised steam channel. The ground surface is partially covered with limestone cobbles and there is
little vegetation present in areas containing topsoil (see Figure 84).

214

Figure 95. Map of site 41KR667
The cultural material consists of a light surface scatter of chert debitage and one biface fragment with
these artifacts being spread over an area measuring 25 meters east-west by 20 meters north-south. No
burned rocks, bone, or other artifact categories are evident. In all, only about 10 artifacts were noted on
ground surface.
Shovel Test #32 was excavated on the east edge of the site where soil deposits appear to be thickest. It
failed to recover any artifacts and encountered solid limestone at 15 cm below ground surface. However,
given the topography, the site could continue further eastward outside of the transmission line ROW.

215

The creek channel along the west edge of the site has downcut about three meters into the canyon floor,
its east wall profile showing a thin soil cover over talus and bedrock. No artifacts were seen in the
cutbank.
This site contains a small amount of chipping debris and at least one tool that may represent a brief
episode of use as a knapping station at some unassigned period in the past, perhaps using material from a
nearby chert source. Since the portion of the site within the ROW corridor appears to have no potential
for useful further investigation, it is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not meriting
formal designation as an SAL.
41KR668
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located approximately 250 meters downstream from 41KR667 (see Figure
92). The site is situated on a small terrace in canyon bottomland on the east bank of a tributary channel to
Bear Creek (Figure 96). The terrace area has recently been cleared of cedar

Figure 96. Map of Site 41KR668.

216

trees and brush with several large piles of tree trunks and limbs present within and around the
transmission line corridor.
Several chert flakes and a thin biface fragment with a beveled edge were first seen on the western edge of
the transmission line ROW on an eroded terrace edge overlooking the creek channel. A close inspection
of the rising ground east of the creek channel found only a single flake. Shovel Test #33 was placed
about midway between this find and the location of proposed Transmission Structure #21. The shovel
test recovered no artifacts and struck limestone rubble at 15 cm below the surface.
Because of the thin soils shown in the shovel test and the churned nature of soils deposits in the cleared
field, no further shovel testing was deemed necessary. After further surface inspection, it was concluded
that the site consisted of approximately seven chert flakes and one biface fragment that were spread over
an area of about 35x15 meters in the western half of the transmission line ROW. The site may extend
outside the transmission line ROW northwestward along the terrace paralleling the creek channel. No
burned rock fragments, other artifact categories, or features were seen.
The portion of the site within the transmission line ROW is a diffuse, surficial lithic scatter that lacks of
features and diagnostic artifacts. The portion of the site within the transmission line ROW is assessed as
not eligible for NRHP or SAL designation.
41KR669
This prehistoric lithic scatter is situated on a terrace slope about 100 meters northeast of a tributary of
Bear Creek (Figure 97). The site consists of light scatter of chert cores, flakes, and tool fragments. These
materials cover a 40 meter length of the transmission line ROW. The artifacts were found across the 24
meter width of the ROW and the site should extend both northeast and southwest of the ROW. Most of
the artifacts were found on the western part of the site on the terrace edge overlooking the valley of the
tributary creek.
Ground surface visibility was variable within the site boundaries. Limestone bedrock and boulders were
visible in many cleared spots. Elsewhere, cleared spots on terrace slopes at the head of gully showed that
the overall depth of topsoil was in the range of 10 to 15 cm. A total of 10 chert flakes, 2 chert cores, and
1 projectile point fragment of the Ensor type were found.
The site has probably been damaged from previous land clearing and fence construction. The site appears
to have little depth of cultural deposits and no features were apparent. For these reasons, the site is
assessed as no meriting formal designation as an SAL and not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Area C
This area covers the southeast end of the project area (Figure 98). A previously recorded burned rock
midden site, 41KR649, is located on the transmission line route in a high upland area. This area would
not have been predicted as a likely location for a site of this type. Given this fact, additional similar
topographic areas were added to the list of areas to be surveyed. Other high probability areas surveyed
consist of sections of several tributary creeks located in canyon bottomlands.

217

Figure 97. Map of site 41KR669.
41KR649
At the beginning of the transmission line project, LCRA learned from one of landowners, Mr. John
Redden, that an archaeological site was located on his property within the transmission line ROW. A
search of the Site Atlas indicated that site 41KR649 had been recorded in 2007 by Kay and Woody
Woodward and Bryant Saner on the Redden property. However, the plotting of the site on the maps at
TARL placed the site’s location far outside of the transmission line corridor on the neighboring property
rather than Mr. Redden’s property. The site was described as having two burned rock middens,
designated as BRM “A” and BRM “B”. The site area was described as covering an area of 78 meters on a
north-south line by 50 meters on an east-west line.

218

Figure 98. Survey Area C showing areas surveyed and locations of archaeological sites.

The LCRA archaeological staff then visited Mr. and Mrs. Redden at the start of the field survey. Mr.
Redden showed the field crew a copy of a brief report written by the Woodwards and Saner on site
41KR649. That report describes Mr. Redden’s surface collection from site 41KR649 as consisting of 11
Edwards arrowpoints, 2 Scallorn arrowpoints, 1 Edgewood dart point, and 1 Angostura-like dart point.
The field crew was also able to view these artifacts and verify their identifications at the Redden home.
Mr. Redden then guided the crew to the site, and the TARL sketch map was found to match to location of
two burned rock middens located in the vicinity of an angled turn in the transmission line ROW (Figure
99). It was determined that the site in the proposed transmission line ROW is indeed 41KR649, and that
the original plotting of the site at TARL is incorrect. It is possible that faulty GPS readings listed on the
original site form are the cause of the misplotting at TARL 600 meters further eastward.
Initial pedestrian survey by LCRA Archaeology Services staff at 41KR649 showed that ground surface
visibility was good in some areas due to previous brush clearing and because limestone bedrock was
exposed on ground surface in some areas. Other areas covered with thick grasses
had poor visibility. The walk-over indicated that although both burned rock midden features lay just
outside of the proposed transmission line ROW, a light scatter of chert chipping debris and
occasional burned rocks are present on ground surface within the transmission line ROW. Also, Mr.
Redden indicated that some of the arrowpoints in his collection had been found within the transmission
line ROW.

220

Shovel Tests #1-4 and 6 were then excavated to better assess the potential for buried cultural deposits
within the ROW, especially in areas with poor ground surface visibility. All of these shovel tests showed
that only 15 to 22 cm of grayish-brown gravelly loam is present above limestone bedrock. Artifact yield
was very sparse with the highest numbers of artifacts coming from Shovel Test #2 where two chert flakes
and a burned rock fragment were recovered.
With the permission of the landowner the burned rock middens located outside the ROW corridor were
then examined more closely. Based a very slight rise in elevation and the presence of a surface scatter of
burned rocks, BRM"A" measures about 10 m north-south by 11 m east-west. The western edge of this
midden is situated just 2 meters outside of the transmission line corridor. It is located immediately north
of a dirt road in an area where brush was bulldozed, piled, and burned is past years. Parts of the midden
appear to have been gouged and pushed into piles by a bulldozer or front-end loader machine. Overall, it
appears that BRM “A” has been badly damaged by these activities. Shovel Test #8 was dug into the
approximate center of BRM "A". This shovel test showed a 9 cm thick surface accumulation of burned
wood and blackened dirt that apparently is a bulldozed pile of recently burned brush. Deeper, a 24 cm
thick deposit of burned rocks and chert debitage was found. These artifacts consisted of about 25 burned
rock fragments, 3 chert chips, and 1 chert chunk, and 3 pieces of burned chert shatter.
Shovel Test #7 was dug just seven meters southeast of Shovel Test #8 at a location just outside of the
boundary of BRM “A”. It produced 3 chert flakes but only 6 burned rock fragments.
BRM"B" is situated on a higher terrace surface about 50 to 60 meters south of BRM"A". The north edge
of BRM"B" lies just 2 meters south of the outer edge of the transmission line ROW. Although there are
several holes in this midden from either previous uprooting of trees or from pothunter activities, this
midden does not appear to have been damaged from bulldozing and other brush clearing activities.
BRM"B" is about 12 meters in diameter, and Shovel Test #5 which was placed in the northern part of the
burned rock accumulation showed a 15 cm thick soil above limestone bedrock. Much of the soil matrix
was a black-colored midden zone. Four chert flakes and two chert chips were recovered. Importantly,
Shovel Test #5 produced a much higher density of burned rocks than the shovel test in BRM “A”.
Overall, the shovel testing indicated that artifact density within the two midden features is much higher
than in areas outside of the midden features, even in locations just beyond the edges of the middens. A
similar trend was observed during the survey and shovel testing at site 41KR663 where shovel tests
outside of the burned rock midden proper, likewise, revealed hardly any artifacts. It appears, then, that
the immediate burned rock midden feature areas at site 41KR649 are the principal areas of concern. Both
burned rock middens are situated just outside of the transmission line ROW, and BRM “A” has been
damaged by previous tree and brush clearing, piling, and burning to the extent that the integrity of
deposits is low. BRM “B” appears to be more intact, has a higher burned rock density, and has a
definable, dark midden zone. Thus, BRM “B” is assessed as potentially NR and SAL eligible. Although
shovel testing in areas within the transmission line ROW adjacent to BRM “B” showed no evidence of
features and yielded few artifacts, additional caution seems prudent. A 10-meter wide buffer zone that
extends into the transmission line ROW is recommended around the northern half of the BRM “B”
feature to ensure that activities related to construction of the transmission line do not damage the feature.
Orange plastic fencing will be erected to mark the buffer zone boundaries. No ground-disturbing
activities or vehicular traffic should be allowed within the buffer zone. Any vegetation removal within the
buffer zone will need to be accomplished without damaging subsurface deposits. Aside from the
restrictions involving the buffer zone, it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed within
other parts of 41KR649.

221

41KR665
Site 41KR665 is a prehistoric lithic scatter and lithic procurement area located on an upland ridge
between the canyon heads of two tributaries of Camp Meeting Creek (Figure 100). Cultural material
noted on the surface during the survey included approximately a dozen pieces of chert debitage, one Stage
2 biface, and one unifacial tool. These artifacts were spread across a 220 meter length of the transmission
line ROW without any particular area of concentration. Artifact density is extremely low, being
somewhere on the order of one artifact per 650 m2. The low

Figure 100. Map of site 41KR665

222

artifact density can be partly explained by the fact that limestone outcrops over a considerable area of the
site and artifacts were mainly observed in areas with soil cover. The soil is no more than a few
centimeters thick above the limestone bedrock, and according to the landowner, not long before the
survey was conducted, the entire site area was cleared of dense woody vegetation by bulldozer, leaving
dislodged boulders and burned brush piles. The lack of depth of soil and the previous disturbances made
shovel testing at this site unnecessary.
With the permission of the landowner, who was present with the survey crew, additional areas up to 40
meters beyond the existing width of the ROW corridor were surveyed to determine if any denser artifact
clusters or features were present. Additional occasional chert flakes were seen, but no artifact
concentrations or features were found. The site probably extends southwards to the canyon edge and
northwards for some undetermined distance.
The chert debitage and biface within the transmission ROW probably represent the leftovers of lithic
procurement activities and early stage biface reduction that took place where chert nodules were exposed
on the surface along the canyon edge. These chert deposits are not substantial and the cultural material
appears to reflect infrequent and light use as a lithic source. This site has little reach potential because of
the lack of discrete components or activity areas and is not considered eligible for NRHP or SAL
designation.

Summary and Recommendations
During the period from May through July 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an
intensive cultural resource survey of the Rim Rock to Jack Furman transmission line project.
Approximately 3.6 linear miles of 6.6 miles of new transmission line corridor was surveyed as was a four
acre electrical substation tract located near the north end of the proposed transmission line corridor. As a
result of the investigation, 10 new prehistoric archaeological sites, 41KR662-41KR671were recorded and
assessed. One previously recorded prehistoric site, 41KR649, was also revisited and assessed. The sites
can be classified as three burned rock midden sites (41KR649, 41KR663, and 41KR666), six lithic
scatters (41KR664 and 41KR667-41KR671), and two lithic scatter/lithic procurement sites (41KR662
and 41KR665).
Although three sites are classified as burned rock middens, site 41KR663 is only one having a burned
rock midden feature within the actual project construction area. The midden feature at 41KR663 appears
to have been heavily damaged by previous cultivation and land clearing. The vast majority of artifacts
were found within the upper 10 cm of soil deposits in disturbed contexts. No other features were found
and the only diagnostic artifact noted is a Late Archaic dart point. Because of the extensive damage from
previous cultivation, the portion of the site that will be affected by the transmission construction is
assessed as not NRHP or SAL eligible.
At 41KR666, the actual burned rock midden feature was noted about 11 meters east of the outside edge of
the transmission line corridor. It will not be affected by proposed construction. Cultural materials within
the transmission corridor at 41KR666 are mainly surficial and probably temporally mixed. An
approximately 5 meter wide linear strip within the east edge of the transmission line corridor is a
previously disturbed existing utility line corridor. The portion of site 41KR666 within the transmission
line ROW is also assessed as not NRHP or SAL eligible.
A third burned rock midden site, 41KR649, has two burned rock midden features that lay just outside of
the transmission line corridor. These are shallow 15 to 25 cm thick middens, and the landowner’s artifact
collection suggests that they are of Late Prehistoric age. Cultural deposits within the actual transmission

223

line corridor at this site are sparse and deposits are shallow. The northern midden, which is called BRM
“A”, has been heavily damaged by brush clearing, piling, and burning to the extent that further
investigations would not be fruitful. However, potentially significant cultural deposits that may be NRHP
and SAL eligible are present at 41KR649’s southern midden, which has been designated as BRM “B”. A
10-meter wide buffer zone has been recommended around the northern perimeter of BRM “B” as a
precaution to ensure that the feature is not damaged by project activities including vegetation clearing and
vehicular traffic associated with the construction of the transmission line and a nearby transmission tower.
Aside from this buffer zone area, it is recommended that all other construction be allowed to proceed at
41KR649.
Six sites consisting of 41KR664, and 41KR667-41KR671 are prehistoric lithic scatters. Artifacts at these
sites lack diversity and are sparse in numbers. Other than single Ensor type dart points found at site
41KR664 and 41KR669, these sites lack diagnostic artifacts. No features were seen at any of these sites,
and soil deposits are consistently shallow. For all of these reasons, the portions of these sites within the
transmission line corridor are assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not meriting formal
designation as SALs.
The last two sites, 41KR662 and 41KR665 are lithic scatter/lithic procurement sites. In addition to chert
chipping debris and early stage tools, these sites include chert cores and tested chert cobbles obtained
from chert gravels present at the sites. However, artifact density at these sites is low and cultural deposits
are surficial. Both sites have been previously damaged by land clearing. The portions of both of these
sites within the project area are assessed as not NRHP or SAL eligible.
Aside from the need for the buffer zone around BRM “B” feature at site 41KR649, it is recommended all
other project construction be allowed to proceed, as currently planned. As always, standard emergency
discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the construction personnel uncover any
presently unknown buried archeological features during construction work, then work should cease in the
immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation,
work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA proposes to rebuild the existing T-186 transmission line that runs for approximately 7.2 mi within
a 100-ft easement between the Plum and Winchester substations in western Fayette County, Texas
(Figure 101). A portion of the line that runs between the Plum substation and the new Piney Creek
switching station will be renamed T-535. The line crosses the Colorado River about 1.6 km north of the
Plum substation. Total project acreage is about 87.3 acres. The project will consist of removing existing
wooden H-frame and metal lattice structures and installing new metal or concrete single pole structures
that will be reconductored with higher capacity wire. In some cases the new structures will be placed at
or very near the exact locations of the present structures, but the majority will be in new locations.
The transmission line was surveyed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff in 2004, prior to regularly
scheduled ROW maintenance activities. This appears to have been the first cultural resources survey of
the line. Three previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological sites, 41FY540-41FY542, were recorded
at that time. Site 41FY540 was a buried lithic scatter located on the second or third terrace south of the
Colorado River. Site 41FY541 was an open camp located on a high ridge overlooking the floodplain
terrace of the river to the south. Site 41FY542 was a lithic procurement site, really more of a locality,
located on ancient terraces towards the north end of the project area. Sites 41FY540 and 41FY541 were
both considered to be documented at a level that precluded assessments of eligibility for state or federal
registers or lists. Site 41F542 was considered to be fully documented and was considered ineligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.
One new archaeological site, 41FY551, was recorded during the present project, which was conducted by
LCRA Archaeology Services staff on May 12 and 13, 2008. This site is an ephemeral historic trash
scatter consisting of both clear and solarized glass, a few square nails, and a metal bar. The site is
considered to be fully documented and ineligible for formal state or federal listings.
LCRA conducts archaeological investigations for transmission line maintenance at a level commensurate
with expected impacts, which typically are low. Site eligibility recommendations are not typically
definitive, as site avoidance is usually easily accomplished.
For T-186, the initial survey created a set of expectations regarding the nature of soils along the
transmission line route. Shovel testing in the alluvial terraces and floodplains indicated that soils and/or
sediments were in excess of 1 m in depth in many places. After reviewing geologic maps and soil
surveys, it was decided to use mechanical augering to systematically sample soils at new structure
locations. A 30-cm diameter skid steer-mounted auger was able to quickly sample at depths of up to 1.7
m. When necessary, additional vertical control was achieved by placing hand-excavated shovel tests in
areas of interest.
A total of 20 auger tests was excavated. Additionally, six shovel tests were added to the 24 excavated
during the maintenance survey, for a combined number of 50 subsurface tests. This averages to about
seven tests per mile, well below suggested minimum survey standards. However, approximately 4.2 mi
of the line was considered to be of low probability for containing buried cultural materials, and the
emphasis on the floodplain is considered to be justified, where the subsurface testing rate averaged
approximately 17 tests per mile, which meets suggested minimum survey standards.
All four recorded archaeological sites, 41FY540-542, and 41FY551, are considered to be fully
documented within the portions of the project area that would directly impact them. No additional work
is considered necessary within the recorded portions of these sites.

The results of augering, however, indicated that there are portions of the northern terrace/floodplain that
may have the potential for archaeological deposits at depths greater than what can be seen by standard
testing methods. Monitoring of selected structure excavation is recommended.
No artifacts were collected during this project, and no curation will be necessary.

Environmental Background
The project area is located between the towns of Smithville and La Grange in Fayette County, and runs
northward from very near the community of Plum after which it crosses the Colorado River and continues
northward to the community of Winchester. It is within the broad Coastal Plain region of Texas, and
more specifically within a portion of the Post Oak, Mesquite and Grassland belt that is dominated by
sandy and clayey soils over sediments (Woodruff 1979). At the Plum substation the project is within late
Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits, but quickly drops into Holocene-aged alluvium within the
Colorado River valley. Proceeding northward it climbs out of the 2.4 mi-wide Holocene-aged valley,
once again crossing old terrace deposits before entering the much earlier Eocene-aged Yegua formation,
which is primarily sandstone, clay and lignite, with chert and quartz cobbles not uncommon (Barnes
1974). This last formation accounts for about the northern one-third of the project area. In addition to the
Colorado River, the project crosses or comes very near Criswell Creek at its junction with the river, an
abandoned channel (oxbow) of the river, Spring Branch, which feeds the oxbow, and Shiloh Branch,
which along with Millers Creek feed the Colorado River further downstream.
Additional research on the lower Colorado River portion of the Gulf Coastal plain (Blum and Valastro
1994) produced a data set for late Quaternary sedimentation rates and preliminary dates for a series of
recognized allostratigraphic units (Figure 102) consisting of a number of named allomembers or
formations, which in the study area consist of, from oldest to youngest: tertiary bedrock or older
Pleistocene; the Montopolis Terrace; Eagle Lake Alloformation (ELA); Columbus Bend 1 and 2 (CB 1
and 2); and Columbus Bend 3 (CB 3). A series of dates were obtained from buried soils and organic
materials, including from near West Point, where the CB 3 was as recent as 250 years old (and dated
generally elsewhere as no more than 600 years old), the CB 2 (undifferentiated from CB 1 on
distributional figures) at about 5,000 to 1,000 years old, the CB 1 developing during very the end of the
Pleistocene and into the middle part f the Holocene, and the ELA forming between about 18,000 and
10,000 years ago. The Montopolis terrace predated the study period, and along with the bedrock
members was included largely for reference purposes. Despite the problems associated with the dating
methods (Frederick 2002; Blum 2008, personal communication), the study of the formations creates at
minimum a relative sequence of deposition, and until a better set of time markers can be determined,
provides a baseline geomorphological chronology that aids in shaping research goals and objectives.

Cultural Background
The prehistory of Central Texas has recently been reviewed by several archeologists including Johnson
(1994) and Collins (1995). These papers build upon the previous work of Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981,
1985) that established a detailed cultural chronology and cultural history for the region. Importantly,
Johnson’s paper includes new data on past climates in Central Texas while Collins discusses past and
present research theories and trends in prehistoric archeological research in Central Texas. The reader is
referred to these works for in-depth discussions of Central Texas prehistory.

Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers in
nearby areas. Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 11,500
years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these millennia, prehistoric
peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting seasonally available
plant and animal resources.
The region now known as Fayette County was first crossed by the Spanish in the early eighteenth century
(Garrett 2001). Stephen F. Austin’s colonists arrived in 1822 and initiated settlement, particularly near an
important road crossing located near present day La Grange. In 1837 the county of Fayette was
established, named after the Marquis de Lafayette, with La Grange made the county seat. Early industry
was based on farms and plantations, which focused on production of corn, tobacco, wool and cotton.
Slavery became a mainstay of the economy, even as the county voted against secession. After the civil
war the plantation economy collapsed, and share cropping became common. German and Slavic
immigrants increased during the decades surrounding the 1870s, and former plantation owners sold large
plots which were subsequently subdivided to newcomers. Germans and Czechs became strong social
forces around the turn of the century. Cotton was the predominant cash crop through the Depression, but
by the end of World War II cattle became more important. Oil was discovered in the county in 1943,
which led to a new shift in industry. The LCRA’s coal-fired Fayette Power Project is now the largest
employer in the county.
The communities of Plum and West Point, south of the river, and Winchester, north of the river, were all
settled between 1831 and 1888 (Carroll 2002 a, b, c). Plum was originally known as Plum Grove, and
was the second oldest community in Fayette County, and the Plum Church now Hopewell, was the first
Baptist church west of the Colorado River (Carroll 2002a.). One of the original settlers of the West Point
area apparently established a fort in the vicinity, although the actual community was formed around the
junction of three railroads (Carroll 2002 b). Winchester was also at least partially dependent on railroads,
and served as a shipping point. These town have all seen population declines over the past several
decades, but as of 2000 maintained a relatively stable combined population of about 350 persons.
Previous Investigations

The line was previously surveyed by LCRA Archaeology Services Staff in 2004 prior to standard
maintenance and clearing activities. Three prehistoric sites, 41FY540 – 41FY452 were recorded at that
time (Figures 103, 104, 105). Sites 41FY540, a buried lithic scatter, and 41FY541, a high terrace open
camp, were both considered potentially eligible for formal listings. Site 41FY542, described as more a
locale than a site, was a widely distributed lithic procurement zone located in surficial, upland gravels.
The Texas Historic Sites Atlas indicates that a number of sites have been recorded in the general vicinity,
many of these in association with construction or expansion of SH 71. The vast majority of these sites are
described as open camps, and they are generally located along the edge of the Pleistocene ridge
overlooking the Colorado River valley to the north.
Less work has been conducted north of the river, but the general pattern of occupation sites outside the
Colorado River floodplain appears to hold. A series of open camps within the floodplain of Rabbs Creek
initially recorded by TxDOT personnel could not be relocated during later investigations prompted by a

widening of FM 153. At least one site, 41FY53, produced an apparent Clovis point from a depth of about
1 m.
Other large survey projects in the general area include LCRA’s Fayette Power Project (FPP), the
Cummins Creek prospect, and work at Lake Bastrop and Camp Swift. Numerous historic and prehistoric
sites have been recorded as a result of these projects.

Research Design
The archaeological investigations were structured so as to relocate previously recorded archaeological
sites, identify any previously undiscovered sites, and to assess their research or other potential as
qualifying them for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. Data recovered during cultural resource investigations by LCRA
Archaeology Services in 2004 was combined with information from soils and geologic maps to determine
areas where there was a higher probability for buried prehistoric sites. Appropriate historic maps were
referenced in order to determine the potential for the presence of historic resources.
The previous subsurface investigations indicated that the majority of the approximate 2.4 mi wide
Colorado River floodplain had soils and/or sediments that were deeper than standard shovel testing
methods could penetrate. A skid steer mounted auger was therefore used to efficiently test at depths of up
to 170 cm across this floodplain (Figures 106, 107). Tests were placed at or very near planned new
structure locations. When necessary, hand excavated shovel tests were placed adjacent to auger tests in
order to improve vertical control. All matrix from auger and shovel tests was screened through ¼ in wire
mesh. In addition, geotechnical bores were monitored at each of three locations within the lower
floodplain terraces, which provided gross-level information on deposits at depth of up to 30 ft. Other
moderate probability land forms were examined with standard pedestrian survey and shovel testing.
Proposed new structures were located with coordinate information uploaded into a GPS unit. Aerial
imagery, modern USGS maps, and georeferenced historic USGS maps were used for ground orientation.
A no collection policy was maintained throughout the project.
Results of Investigations
2004 – 41FY540, 41FY541, 41F542
The 2004 survey was initiated near the Plum substation. The high probability area adjacent to the
Colorado River was the focus of the investigations in this area. A total of seven shovel tests was
excavated across a 600 m distance beginning at a small tributary creek and proceeding southwards. Six
shovel tests were placed at approximately 50 m intervals, and a seventh was placed approximately 200 m
further south from these. The tests were designed to sample the soils and determine if buried
archaeological deposits were present. There were no artifacts visible on the ground surface. These seven
tests found soils that were sandy loams and sandy clay loams grading to clay loams and loamy clays at
depths of 70 to 100 cm or more. Three of these tests, numbers 3, 5 and 6, found sparse to very sparse
lithic materials at depths of 40-80 cm, with the majority apparently present at approximately 60 cm.
Materials were found both above and below a contour break of approximately 10 ft that signals a shift
between the third and fourth terraces above the Colorado River. The site (41FY540) is interpreted as a
buried lithic scatter indicative of tool production or maintenance. Some of the material was burned,
suggesting that food processing or camping activities were conducted here as well. The location along
the river supports this contention. Although the materials were very sparse (a total of seven pieces from

three shovel tests), it is possible that additional buried deposits are present within or near the transmission
line corridor.
Four shovel tests, numbers 8 - 11, were excavated on the north side of the Colorado River. These tests
were excavated in very deep sands and sandy loams. Two tests were positive for cultural materials,
including relatively dense burned rock and lithic materials. These were immediately adjacent to a
transmission structure (STR 7/1). All material was less than 30 cm in depth, and some was visible across
the surface. One test found three large bones at a depth of 30 cm. No cultural material was associated at
this elevation, although a flake tool was recovered from above 20 cm. The cultural materials that were
present were suggestive of an intensively utilized open campsite. However, the materials were very
localized in both horizontal and vertical extents. It was determined the most likely explanation for these
materials was that they had been imported as fill material or road base either during transmission line
construction or by the landowner. This conclusion is supported by two nearby gas pipeline access points
where bare ground that had been churned by drilling activities was closely examined for cultural
materials. None was noted.
The next area considered to be of high probability for cultural materials was adjacent to an oxbow lake
located 2 km north of the Colorado River. Seven shovel tests, numbers 12 – 18, were excavated in this
area. The first (ST 13) was placed immediately below (south of) a ridge that runs E/W across the north
edge of the oxbow lake and continues westward to the present Colorado River. This ridge probably
represents an ancestral bank of the Colorado River. This shovel test was negative. The ridge is
approximately 30 ft higher than the valley floor. On top of this ridge accumulations of burned chert and
quartzite, chert debitage and stone tools were apparent across the land surface. Six shovel tests found
reddish-brown sandy loams at an average thickness of 50 cm over reddish brown and red sandy clays.
Cultural materials are moderate to dense and included burned rock, chert debitage, and at least one
projectile point base, which was most likely Late Archaic (4000-1200 years old) in age. Another
untypeable tool was found in the same test. On the surface was found an apparent Guadalupe tool or
adze. This is suggestive of Early Archaic (ca 6000-8000 years old) occupations. The shovel tests
indicated that cultural material extended from the edge of the remnant riverbank northwards for a distance
of at least 300 m, although material dropped in density towards the north. Another shovel test (ST 20)
was placed on the same elevation at the north end of the large open pasture. This shovel test also found a
small amount of cultural material. So although there is a gap of approximately 450 m between ST20 and
ST17, the final test on the south end of the pasture, the site is considered to extend across the entire
pasture. A shovel test placed just south of Shiloh Branch found dense gray clays and no cultural
materials. The site is therefore not considered to continue past the contour break at the north end of the
pasture.
This site (41FY541) is interpreted as an open campsite which was most likely along the bank of the active
Colorado River when inhabited. Burned rock and functional and time diagnostic tools are present. The
site was therefore felt to contain potential for additional information yield, and as such, should have
impacts minimized during maintenance activities.
An attempt was made to access the north bank of Spring Branch. An extremely rough pasture ended at an
artificially enhanced drainage that forms an apparent slough. The north bank of Spring Branch was
therefore not examined. Topographically, it appears the Spring Branch may also represent an ancestral
channel of the Colorado River. If this is the case, and an assumption (probably correct) is made that the
river has been migrating southward, then the possibility exists that the north bank of the creek may
contain cultural materials similar to, and most likely older than, those found at 41FY540.
The area on either side of Shiloh Branch was investigated. Within the transmission line corridor there
was excellent visibility within the deeply exposed cutbanks of the creek. Several other nearby exposures

241

were also examined. There was no evidence of cultural materials. Due to the high level of visibility no
shovel tests were excavated. There were no maintenance-related recommendations for this portion of the
transmission line.
Beginning at FM 153 approximately 1.8 mi of transmission line was alternately walked or subjected to
windshield survey. This upland area consisted of approximately 2000 linear m of dense gravels within
shallow soils and clays which gave way towards the north to relatively shallow sands over gravels and
clay. Within this area was seen occasional evidence of lithic procurement activity consisting of widely
scattered large flakes and tested cobbles. This is really more of a locale than a true archaeological site, as
there are no activity loci or any evidence of activities other than random and informal raw material
processing. This site was designated as 41FY542. There were no maintenance related issues for this
section of the transmission line.
The final 1300 m was considered to be of low probability for cultural resource sites. The setting was
generally similar to that seen within the surveyed uplands to the south. This final section was not
surveyed, and there were no recommendation regarding clearing activities.
2008
Geotechnical Monitoring
The first phase of the 2008 investigations consisted of monitoring geotechnical borings that were
scheduled for placement within the Holocene floodplain. These 10 cm diameter bores were excavated to
depths of 30-50 ft. The first ten feet are sampled at 2 ft intervals, and the remainder of the column is
sampled as the last two feet of every 5 ft interval (i.e. 13-15 ft, 18-20 ft, etc.). Monitoring results in gross
level soils information, which is helpful on the deep river terraces, but adds no relevant information on
shallow upland surfaces, where geotechnical bores were not monitored.
The first bore was immediately north of the Plum substation, very near the juncture of the late Pleistocene
fluviatile terrace deposits and the more recent river valley fill. It is just south of the mapped edge of
Blum’s Eagle Lake alloformation (ELA), although widely varying map scales might well be adjusted to
include this location. Soils are mapped as Smithville series, with a 16 in A horizon, a B horizon that
grades to clays and carbonates at 30-50 in, and a BCk horizon below 50 inches. The bore encountered 2
ft of yellowish brown sandy loam over varying clays to a depth of 6 ft, followed by varying degrees of
sand, gravels and clays, with the water table at about 28 ft.
The second bore was located at the last structure south of the river (Figure 108), within Blum’s Columbus
Bend 3 (CB 3) alloformation. Soils are mapped as Coarsewood silt loams, which have a B horizon
described to a depth of 48 in, and two successive C horizons to depths of 80 in. These soils are notable
for buried A horizons consisting of silt loams or silty clay loams in the upper 60 in. The bore produced 6
ft of yellowish brown silty or fine silty loams, and a brown clayey loam was encountered at about 5 ft.
This was interpreted as a possible buried soil, although various past disturbances (animals, roots etc) may
have created it as well. Below 6 ft the silts graded to clays and then mottled clays, with the water table
again encountered at about 28 ft.
The final bore that was monitored was located about midway across the northern river terrace within
Blum’s Columbus Bend 1 and 2 alloformation, in an area with mapped Gad series soils. These are
described as having formed in “Recent” sandy alluvium. They have a shallow, 11 in A horizon which
rests immediately upon a C1 and C2, at a final depth of 80 in. The bore encountered 2 ft of brown silty
loam followed by 4 ft of dark brown clay loam, then brown clay over light brown silty loam, then brown
silty and sandy clays before encountering wet sand, clayey sand and pebbles below 15 ft. The monitoring
ended at 25 ft, prior to encountering the water table.

Mechanical Augering
A total of 20 auger tests was excavated. Thirteen were north of the river, and seven south, all within the
“bedrock-confined” river valley (Blum and Valastro 1994), and all but the southernmost two within
Blum’s ELA, CBA 3 and CBA 1-2 (from south to north). Auger locations were determined by proposed
structure coordinate data uploaded into a GPS receiver, which was used to navigate to the correct
locations. Additional auger tests and/or shovel tests were excavated at locations where recovery was
ambiguous or additional information was felt to be necessary. Auger results are discussed in varying
detail below; a full list of auger data is included as an appendix.
Augering commenced (Auger Test [AT] 1) at the first structure north of the river, the location of shovel
tests (STs) 9-11 in 2004. This was also the location of the third geotechnical bore, and it was here that a
small amount of cultural materials was interpreted as being the result of introduced fill. The auger
recovered one possible flake fragment in the first 40 cm, and one tertiary flake in the second. The profile
was generally a yellowish brown sandy or fine sandy loam, although an 8 cm thick zone of grayish-brown
sandy loam was encountered between 30 and 38 cm. Below 90 cm a light tan sand was encountered. The
Gad series soils are consistent with this description, except for the buried soil lens. The combined
information suggests that the bottom of recent sediments has not been thoroughly explored here, and
despite the ambiguity of the cultural material, monitoring of construction activities is warranted.
AT 2 encountered large carbonate nodules at 80 cm, and this location is considered fully explored. AT 3,
however, did not demonstrably breach Holocene sediments, and is within the Coarsewood series soils that
may contain buried A horizons. Monitoring of construction activities is warranted. These first three
augers were within Blum’s recent CB 3 alloformation.

243

AT 4, located in Gad soils, encountered grayish-brown mottled clay below 80 cm. This was also the first
auger within Blum’s CB 1-2 alloformation (all the rest on the north side of the river were also in this
member). This area is considered fully explored.
AT 5 had very distinctive recovery, which prompted it to be bracketed by ATs 6 and 7. Over 1 m of
yellowish-brown fine sandy loam was followed abruptly by, and perhaps rested unconformably on, at
least 40 cm of yellowish-brown silty loam that was notable for very high quantities of land snails, and
even more remarkably, numerous pieces of charcoal, some exceeding 1-2 cm in diameter. AT 6, about 20
m to the south, had a similar profile, while AT 7, about 15 m north, had no snail or charcoal, and below
150 cm, a red, mottled and probably gleyed clay was encountered. AT 8, 265 m north at the next
structure location, likewise had some small amounts of charcoal below 90 cm. The recent age of the
mapped Gad soils do not appear to correlate well with the earlier CB 1-2 formation, and it is possible that
the more recent soils lap over the earlier formation, which would then be assumed to contain the snail and
charcoal. It may also be that a highly active floodplain laid drift deposits carrying organic material
including snail and charcoal, and later covered these with additional sediments.
While excavating ATs 5-7, we were approached by the landowner’s representative or ranch foreman.
When asked about flooding, he stated that the entirety of the terrace, other than a few high points, had
been underwater in both the 1991 and 1998 floods. He further stated that during the 1998 floods, a
channel some 15 ft deep opened across the field (probably where a low contour can be seen on the USGS
map, and that the scoured sediment accumulated around the base of an oil pump pad. They replaced the
soil within the erosional feature by bulldozer, and they have kept the fields planted in Coastal Bermuda,
rather than corn or other crops, since. A geodatabase of high water marks from 1998 shows an elevation
of 274.3 ft, taken just south of the angle structure, which illustrates that the majority of the terrace on the
north side of the river was indeed inundated at that time. South of the river, however, a long ridge
containing most of the transmission line route would have remained above water, with only the final 200
m or so being covered by water.
This consultant (informant), also stated that his father used to fish in the oxbow as a child, and indicated
that it had been the actual river at that time. He appeared to be in his 60s or 70s, and placed a date of
approximately 80 years ago on the story. Turn-of-the-century maps do not support this, and show an
apparently well entrenched river at essentially the present location. These same maps do indicate that the
oxbow flowed at least intermittently into the Colorado River. So, although it is remotely possible the
river had an extreme channel migration just prior to about 1900, it appears to be highly unlikely.
Although no artifacts were recovered in any of these four auger locations, construction monitoring at the
associated structures is warranted.
AT 9 had alternating zones of yellowish-brown fine sandy loam and grayish brown clay loams. Some
fairly substantial bone fragments were recovered at the contact between the upper 36 cm of yellowishbrown loam and grayish-brown loam. ST 25 was placed within a meter of this auger, and excavated to a
depth of 50 cm, through the grayish-brown zone. No more bone or any artifacts were recovered. Despite
this, there is no conclusive evidence the pre-Holocene deposits were encountered, and construction
monitoring is warranted.
AT 10 is at the last structure location on the lower floodplain. Its profile consisted of yellowish-brown
fine sandy loam to 70 cm over grayish-brown clayey loam. Construction monitoring should be
considered here as well.
ATs 11, 12, and 13 were placed on the broad pasture between the angle structure marking the southern
edge of 41FY541 and Spring Branch. Previous (2004) shovel tests found a light scatter of buried

244

chipping debris in this portion of the site although shovel testing indicated soils might be deep in places.
The auger tests all encountered red clays or heavily carbonated reddish silts between 55 and 80 cm.
There was some limited recovery of chert debitage, but nothing to suggest that any additional wok is
warranted in this area.
The remainder of the auger tests was placed south of the river. The first two, ATs 14 and 15, were within
previously identified site 41FY540, a light scatter of buried lithic debitage. Recovery was consistent with
previous findings, and consisted of a few flakes and flake fragments, some burned, as well as a small (3
cm) flake tool, or edge modified flake. The profile consisted of brown to yellowish-brown fine sandy
loam, and in AT 4, carbonate nodules below 80 cm. The combination of carbonate nodules and limited
recovery indicate research potential for the portion of the site within the ROW is low. No additional work
is considered necessary.
AT 16 was placed near the last structure south of the river, near the location of the second geotechnical
bore. Although there was no recovery of artifacts, it cannot be demonstrated that pre-Holocene deposits
were encountered, and hints of a buried soil horizon in the geotechnical bore warrant monitoring of
construction at this location.
The remaining four ATs, 17-20, were placed between 41FY540 and the Plum substation. All tests
encountered color, texture, or carbonate frequencies at depths below 65 cm or more, indicating preHolocene deposits. No artifacts were encountered.
Other Areas
An angle structure is currently located on the edge of the ridge overlooking the Colorado River valley
next to the oxbow channel. The structure consists of three wooden poles and numerous guy wires. It will
be replaced with a single cement or metal structure which will require a foundation excavation 8-10 ft in
diameter. This is the highest artifact density portion of 41FY541. Burned rock (quartzite and chert)
debitage, small amounts of mussel shell, bone of unknown origin, and at least three tools – a gouge, a dart
point base, and a thin biface/knife – have been seen or recovered here. A total of six shovel tests have
been excavated in this portion of the site, including one, ST 27, within or very near the footprint of the
proposed new foundation. These tests all show that soils are relatively shallow – no more than 50 cm on
average – before encountering reddish sandy clays (Figure 109). Although artifact recovery is moderately
high, it appears compressed and is almost certainly mixed, at least at the location of the structure. No
additional work is considered necessary at this location.
STs 22-24 were placed on the broad divide north of Spring Branch, on the broad divide which previously
had been unapproachable. These tests, (more accurately described as probes), all encountered sandy or
silty loams over reddish-brown loams or clays. No cultural material was seen in any of them, and closer
examination of the land form suggested it was of low probability for containing substantial prehistoric
materials.
The Shiloh Branch area was revisited. This is the location of 41FY551 (Figure 110). The site consists of
a sparse scatter of glass, nails, and a metal bar. All materials were present on the ground surface between
an old barbed fence and a new chainlink high game fence. The two fences run parallel on an east-west
line with an approximately 30 cm gap between the fences. There is good ground surface visibility in the
small gap between the two fences suggesting that some sort of herbicide may have been applied to the
ground during the construction of the newer fence. Ten of the 20 pieces of glass are solarized glass of
purple to pinkish color. One of four brown colored glass fragments is a jar base appears to be a snuff jar
of a type that was still being utilized as recently as the late 1960s. Three other glass fragments are clear
transparent glass. Three square metal nails were also observed. These may be nails from an older version

245

of the barbed wire fence or may have been trash dump material like the glass. The last observed artifact
is a corroded metal bar of about 12 inches length.
The area immediately north of the fences has very good ground surface visibility due to several cattle
trails, gullies, and eroded slopes that descend to the Shiloh Branch channel. Despite an intensive search
of these areas, no additional artifacts were found. The area south of the fences is overgrown with grasses
and weeds. A shovel test (ST 30) was placed in this area about 1.5 meters south of the fences. No
artifacts were recovered in the shovel test. Surface inspection further southward on a terrace knoll
showed reasonably good ground surface visibility, but no artifacts or evidences of a former house site
were seen.

Figure 109. Exposure at 41FY541, outside of ROW. Artifacts rest on or in the light zone about 30 cm
below ground surface. Oxbow is behind distribution pole in background.
The site is interpreted as a trash dump that may be a single event with a mixture of late 19th to early 20th
century artifacts. The presence of the square nails may be fortuitious - i. e. these are nails used for a
former boundary fence. The site could extend westward outside of the transmission line ROW. Overall,
the portion of the site within the transmission line ROW is assessed as not significant.
There appeared to be the possibility for historic sites to be located in the Winchester area, based on the
georeferenced Bastrop USGS quad from 1899. Various map discrepancies are apparent, however, and the
1948 USGS quad for the same area clearly shows the line does not cross the same set of structures from
the 1899 map (Figure 111).
The only other portion of the line suspected to possibly contain historic sites was at 41FY541. Between
at the angle structure and Spring Branch a minimum of three structures were present near the alignment.
The only artifacts present were the small amounts of bottle glass in shovel test associated with 41FY541,
and a single square nail seen in the dirt road near the angle structure.

A set of barns north of the line most likely represents structures mapped in that general location (Figure
112), and two structures west of the line appear to correspond with other mapped structures (Figure 113).
No artifact concentrations, other than at 41FY551, or other indications of historic sites were found within
the transmission line ROW.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to rebuild and enhance an existing transmission line between the Plum and Winchester
substations in western Fayette County, Texas. The line is approximately 7.2 mi long within an existing
100-ft wide ROW. The line was surveyed for archaeological resources in 2004, and then more
intensively in 2008 by LCRA Archaeology Services staff.
Four archaeological sites, prehistoric sites 41FY540-542, and historic site 41FY551, were recorded as a
result of these investigations. The sites consist of a buried lithic scatter (41FY540), an open camp
(41FY541), a lithic procurement locale or zone (41FY542), and an historic trash scatter (41FY551).
These sites are all considered to be fully investigated within the transmission line ROW, and are not
considered to be eligible for formal listing as State Archaeological Landmarks or nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Extensive mechanical augering within the floodplain and lower terraces of the Colorado River valley
indicate that in places soils and relatively recent sediments exceed 1.5 m in depth. A depositional model
proposed by Blum and Valastro (1994) indicates that such deposits are of recent enough age to contain
cultural materials, conceivably within C horizons, although portions of the northern terrace (CB 3) where
construction is scheduled may actually be too young. Elsewhere, the CB 1 and 2 formations may be
mantled with younger deposits. The ELA formation, dated to before 10,000 B.P., makes up the majority
of the southern terraces, and reddish subsoils are consistent with Blum and Valastro’s descriptions
suggesting widespread removal of upland soils by late Holocene times. Additionally, up to three
structures within the CB 3 formation are within a soil series described as having the potential for buried A
horizons at depths of up to 5 ft. Of particular note were a set of augers on the north bank of the river that
found soils or sediments containing large numbers of land snails and fairly dense accumulations of wood
charcoal. This may be the result of extensive, recent reworking of terrace deposits, although the
possibility exists that recent sediments have covered, and perhaps sealed, older, mid-Holocene deposits.
The large oxbow located north of the river is described by Blum and Valastro as belong to the CB 3
formation (Blum and Valastro 1994: 1009, Fig. 6b). Associated dates from West Point are as recent as
250 years B.P., and a local consultant indicates the river changed course, moving out of the oxbow, as
recently as 80 years ago. Although it is highly likely he is mistaken, the possibility remains that the
movement occurred late in the 19th century, which does not completely negate the hypothesis put forward
in 2004 (Hixson et al. 2006) that site 41FY541 was once riverfront property. However, it is more likely
that the Late Archaic dart point is representative of that time, rather than the apparent Early Archaic
gouge.
A total of six proposed structures (numbers 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45) were at locations where soils or
recent sediments exceeded the depth of mechanical testing. Because there was no indication that
archaeological sites are present at these locations, additional subsurface testing (such as backhoe
trenching) was not attempted. Additionally, such testing is out of scale with proposed impacts, and would
damage a similar volume of archaeological matrix as the actual construction. It is therefore recommended
that monitoring of construction take place in these locations (Figure 114). If archaeological materials are
encountered, they will be noted, but construction will not cease unless they are of an outstanding nature.
Instead, the results of monitoring will be reported to THC, and any potential additional investigations will
be discussed at that time.

Abstract
In May 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey of the LCRA’s
proposed Natural Gas Compressor Plant Project in Bastrop County, Texas. As a result of the fieldwork,
one new cultural resource site, 41BP838, was recorded and assessed. Site 41BP838 is a prehistoric
campsite that covers 70x100 meter area in the northcentral and northwest parts of the project area. Shovel
testing data indicates that the vast majority of the prehistoric materials occur within the upper 40 to 50 cm
of topsoil including the 15 to 20 cm thick former plow zone. Shovel testing and soil probing with metal
rods yielded no evidence of intact burned rock features in the fine sandy loam deposits that range from 10
to 90 cm in thickness. Additionally, no diagnostic artifacts, chipped stone tool fragments, bone, or wood
charcoal were found despite intensive work.
Overall, it appears the natural impacts of bioturbation as well as historic human activities including
previous land clearing and cultivation have heavily damaged the contextual integrity of the deposits.
Based on these facts, the site is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places and not meriting formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark. The LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed construction of the natural gas compressor plant be allowed
to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct a new natural gas compressor
plant in far eastern Bastrop County, Texas (Figure 115). The proposed four-acre sized project area is
situated at the intersection of two existing natural gas pipelines, and project will involve the transfer of
natural gas from one pipeline to the other. The principal construction element will be a small building
that will house two gas compressor units. The building, which measures 70x35 ft in plan view, will be
placed in the approximate center of the project area. Each of the two gas compressor units will be set on
an individual five-foot thick foundation slab within the building. Various piping and metering equipment
and an electrical transformer box will also be placed within and around the building. Several electrical
distribution poles will be erected on the north perimeter of the tract. A gravel-covered driveway will
extend northward from an adjacent county to loop around the building and then proceed eastward to exit
on the county road adjacent to the east boundary of the tract. Other portions of the project area will be
used as equipment laydown areas during construction.
On May 13 and 19, 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services conducted an intensive cultural resource
survey of the area to be affected by the proposed construction of the new gas compressor plant. LCRA
personnel involved in the fieldwork, analyses, and reporting were Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal
Investigator) and Andrew F. Malof along with contract archaeologists Cody Kiker and Glenn Goode. The
work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #4779 in compliance with the State Antiquities Code
as amended and in accordance with methods for field work and reporting as proposed by the Texas
Council of Archeologists (1992).

Environmental Background
The project area is within the West Gulf section of the Coastal Plains physiographic province (Fenneman
1938:100-103) and within the Oak-Hickory Forest vegetation region of Texas (Arbingast et al. 1976:13).
Surface geology consists of Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits which in this vicinity contain lag chert
and quartzite gravels (Barnes 1974). Topsoils consist of the Axtell and Tabor fine sandy loams (Baker
1979:Map Plate 39). The soil profiles of these two soils typically consist of a 13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inch)
thick surface layer of brown to pale brown fine sandy loam above a yellowish-red to yellowish-brown
sandy clay B horizon. Shovel testing at the project area, however, showed that the fine sandy loam
topsoil is 55 to 85 cm (25 to 33 inches) thick on the crest of a small knoll in the north-central part of the
project area.
The project area was formerly cleared and under cultivation with the principal crop being corn. The tract
is currently pastureland that has been cleared of brush in recent months (Figure 116). Prior to the advent
of historic land clearing and cultivation, the project area would have fallen within a region described by
McMahon et al. (1984) as containing a mix of post oak woods and forest, with some grassland mosaic.

Cultural Background
The project area is located on the eastern edge of the Central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al.
1995). The Central Texas archeological record has typically been divided into four main subdivisions.
These periods, in chronological order from most ancient to most recent are: the Paleoindian, the Archaic,
the Late Prehistoric, and the Historic periods. These periods are differentiated mostly by broadly defined
subsistence patterns. The prehistoric part of this chronology has been subdivided further into phases
based largely on changes in material culture,

265

especially projectile point styles. Combined, this information begins to describe the 13,000 year history
of human occupation in Central Texas.
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf.

266

Peter et al. 1982; Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied
for at least 13,000 years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these
millennia, prehistoric peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting
seasonally available plant and animal resources.
A total of 15 archaeological sites have been previously recorded within a five-mile radius of the project
area (TARL: Bastrop, Fayette, and Lee County files). Seven of these sites have been recorded by
avocational archaeologists. These sites include 41FY53-55, and 41FY104 which were recorded by
Joseph Wilson, and 41LE32 and 41LE40 which were recorded by Jim Wolf with the assistance of Dr.
Dee Story of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Although there is little available
information on these sites, most of them appear to be prehistoric campsites situated on small to mediumsized creeks similar to the tributary creek that lies 100 to 250 meters west of the current project area.
More detailed data is available on site 41BP78, which was recorded by avocational archaeologist Paul
Duke. This site which is located about 4.5 miles northwest of the project area yielded 7 Clear Fork tools
suggestive of Early to Middle Archaic age along with 27 projectile points of various types.
The other eight known archaeological sites in the vicinity of the project area were recorded by
professional archaeologists. Perhaps the most interesting of these is 41BP282, which was recorded by
Robinson (1987) during the Bastrop County Historical Commission’s Sesquicentennial Project. This site
is located about 5 miles west of the project area on a terrace overlooking the Colorado River floodplain.
In addition to large amounts of prehistoric campsite debris, approximately 50 prehistoric burials have
been recovered at 41BP282. Artifacts suggest that these burials date to the Middle and Late Archaic
periods.
The other noteworthy project conducted by professional archaeologists in the project vicinity is the LCRA
staff’s investigation of the LCRA T-186 transmission line southeast of the project area prior to
maintenance activities within the line corridor (Hixson et al. 2004). Three sites, 41FY540-542, were
recorded during that investigation. Sites 41FY540 and 41FY542 are prehistoric lithic scatters with
41FY540 being noteworthy for buried materials at depths of 40 to 80 cm below ground surface. Site
41FY541 is a large prehistoric campsite on the first terrace above the Colorado River floodplain with
artifacts from the Early and Late Archaic periods. Additional investigation of these three sites by the
LCRA staff is currently in progress for the proposed rebuilding of this transmission line.
The project area immediately south of a rural dispersed community called Center Union. Although there
is little readily available information about Center Union, it appears to have consisted of a school, two
churches, and several scattered residences in the late 19th to early 20th centuries (Smyrl 2002). In 1905,
it had a one-teacher school for about eighty black students. That school closed in the early 1960s, but still
serves as a community center building. Inspection of the 1948 Smithville, Texas 15’ USGS map does not
show any structures that might be related to Center Union community within the project area.
The project area is also located about four miles northwest of Winchester, Texas. During the historic
period, the first known settlers in the Winchester area were the John Ingram family who came to this area
in 1827 (Carroll 2002). The town of Winchester was platted in 1857 and became a stop on the Southern
Pacific Railroad. By 1900, the town had 18 businesses which served a wide area of prosperous farms. By
the 1950s, the number of businesses and the population of Winchester had greatly decreased due to
improved roads and the decline of cotton farming. Presently, much of the former farmland in and around
Center Union and Winchester is used as pastureland for cattle. Some additional revenues come from oil
production.
Overall the review of known archaeological sites in the project vicinity suggests that prehistoric sites are
frequently located on the sandy terraces adjacent to creek channels in the project vicinity. Such sites

267

range from lithic scatters to campsites. Some of these locations were also later the locations of 19th and
early 20th century historic house sites on rural farms. Much larger prehistoric campsites appear to occur
on the terraces overlooking the Colorado River floodplain, and at one known site, 41BP282, a prehistoric
cemetery is also present.

Research Design and Survey Methodology
The purpose of the cultural resource survey was to record and assess the State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) status of all cultural resource sites that may be
affected by the proposed project. The field survey methodology involved pedestrian survey, shovel
testing, and probing of topsoil deposits with steel rods. During the pedestrian survey, the project area was
walked by two archaeologists on 30 m wide zig-zag transects. Ground surface visibility was found to vary
from good to poor. Bare and eroded patches of ground surface were inspected as was disturbed soil along
the two existing pipeline corridors and in areas where trees and brush had been cleared in the recent past.
In areas with poor ground surface visibility shovel testing was employed in areas thought to have
possibilities for cultural materials and also to investigate the depth of subsurface deposits at the one
archaeological site that was discovered. The shovel tests were excavated in 20 cm increments with all
fill being screened through ¼ inch wire mesh. A total of 14 shovel tests were excavated. Appendix 1
provides a description of the soils from the shovel tests while Appendix 2 provides a tally of recovered
artifacts from these tests.
For additional assessment of the one archaeological site that was found, two metal soil probing rods were
utilized to probe the sandy topsoil deposits for concentrations of rocks that might represent the remains of
burned rock features. The two transects selected for the probing were in areas where previous shovel
testing had indicated the densest prehistoric deposits. A total of 135 such soil probes were made using the
probing rods. Three additional shovel tests were then excavated at spots where the probes indicated that
buried burned rock concentrations might be present.

Survey Results
An intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing and soil probing with metal rods was completed. One
new archaeological site, 41BP838, was recorded and assessed during the investigation. Site 41BP838 is a
prehistoric campsite that covers the northcentral and northwest parts of the project area (Figures 116 and
117). The site also appears to extend northward outside of the project area although the area northward
was not investigated. The site is situated on a terrace with the center of the known part of the site being
about 200 meters east of an unnamed tributary of Pin Oak Creek. The site area was formerly under
cultivation and is presently mostly a cleared field with a few yaupon, oak, and cedar trees present,
especially on the south and east edges adjacent to a county road.
The densest cultural materials were found on a slight rise or knoll at the eastern end of the site where the
fine sandy loam topsoil averages 50 to 60 cm in thickness. In that area, some artifacts
consisting of chert chipping debris and burned rocks are visible on ground surface, especially

268

Figure 116. Sketch map of Project Area with 41BP838 site boundaries in red, soil probing transects in

on the knoll top. These surface materials appear to be randomly scattered with no visible concentrations
of materials. In areas south and west of the knoll, artifacts are much less numerous both on ground
surface and within the thinner fine sandy loam topsoil. Interestingly, no artifacts are visible in the
formerly disturbed soils of the two pipeline corridors located immediately south of the knoll. Sandy
topsoil is mostly absent in these corridors with clay subsoil present on ground surface.
A total of 14 shovel tests were excavated to sample the subsurface contents of soils in the project area
with no artifacts being found in Shovel Tests (ST) #4-7 (see Figure 116). A tally of artifacts recovered
from the other shovel tests is presented in the Appendix 2 table. The only artifact classes recovered in
shovel testing are chert chipping debris and burned rocks. Artifact density from the shovel testing was
highest in ST #1, 9, 10, 13, and 14. Shovel Tests #1 and 10 were placed on the crest of the knoll where
cultural deposits appear to be about 53 cm thick while ST #9, 13, and 14 are clustered at the southeast
edge of the knoll where the cultural deposits average 72 cm in thickness. Chert debitage and burned
rocks recovered during the shovel testing were sorted into four sizes by maximum artifact length with size
data provided by shovel test level on the Appendix 2 table. The size categories for both artifact classes
shown on that table are as follows: Small (S) 1-20 mm, Medium (M) 20-40 mm, Large (L)40-50 mm, and
Very Large (VL) 51 mm and up.
The burned rock fragments present at site 41BP838 are almost exclusively burned chert, with the source
of the material being the Pleistocene-era terrace deposits that are mapped on the geologic atlas sheet as
being present in this vicinity. Several pieces of burned quartzite were also noted, but none of the typical
burned limestone or sandstone rocks were present. The burned rock totals provided in the Appendix 2
table indicate moderately high numbers of small burned rock fragments in Size Category 1 (1-20 mm).
269

Very small burned chert fragments less than 10 mm in maximum length actually make up the majority of
these specimens. The small size of these specimens may be due to the fact that chert cobbles fracture
more rapidly under heat than limestone or sandstone. It should be pointed out, too, that some of the small
burned chert fragments may be chipping debris shatter that later was incidentally burned in hearth
features or was burned during historic land clearing operations. The numbers of larger burned rocks,
which are useful in identifying burned rock features, are smaller.
Chert debris resulting from the chipping of cobbles for the production of stone tools is lower in volume
and averages 8 pieces of debitage per level. Chert debitage totals are highest in Level 1 of Shovel Tests
#1 and 2. Although 14 shovel tests were dug, no chert tool fragments or edge modified flakes were
observed among the materials recovered.
During the first day of field investigation, no intact burned rock features were found on ground surface or
in shovel testing. Nor was any bone or charcoal evident. On a second day of fieldwork, two metal probe
rods were used to probe subsurface deposits in the central and southeast parts of the site to further
determine whether buried intact burned rock features might still be present. The soil probing transects are
marked by dotted blue lines on Figure 116. Approximately 135 probes were made. Three areas where
the probing seemed to indicate possible buried burned rock clusters were then shovel tested. These three
shovel tests are labeled as ST #10, 13, and 14 on Figure 116. As with previous shovel tests that had been
dug on the knoll top, individual burned rock fragments were found at various depths but no clusters that
might be features were encountered.

The absence of any evidences of intact features is most likely due to bioturbation of the fine sandy topsoil
deposits. According to the landowner, the site area was also formerly under cultivation for corn
production, and clearing of yaupon and brush after the area was converted to pastureland has occurred in
recent years. The previous plowing and land clearing have undoubtedly also contributed to the
disturbance of the cultural deposits.

Summary and Recommendations
The LCRA is proposing to construct a new natural gas compressor plant on a four acre tract in far eastern
Bastrop County, Texas. The center of project area is located on a terrace about 200 meters east of an
unnamed tributary of Pin Oak Creek. Because a file search indicated that the area had a moderate to high
potential for unrecorded archaeological sites, an intensive cultural resource survey was conducted by the
LCRA Archaeology Services staff in May 2008.
As a result of the field survey, one new prehistoric archaeological site, 41BP838, was recorded and
assessed. Site 41BP838 is a prehistoric campsite that covers 70x100 meter area in the northcentral and
northwest parts of the project area. The site also appears to extend northward outside of the project area
an unknown distance. Shovel testing data indicates that the vast majority of the prehistoric materials
occur within the upper 40 to 50 cm of topsoil including the 15 to 20 cm thick former plow zone. Shovel
testing and soil probing with metal rods yielded no evidence of intact burned rock features in the fine
sandy loam deposits that range from 10 to 90 cm in thickness. Additionally, no diagnostic artifacts,
chipped stone tool fragments, bone, or wood charcoal were found despite intensive work.
Overall, it appears the natural impacts of bioturbation as well as historic human activities including
previous land clearing and cultivation have heavily damaged the contextual integrity of the deposits.
Based on these facts, the site is assessed as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places and not meriting formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark. The LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed construction of the natural gas compressor plant be allowed
to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations. However, should any presently unknown
cultural features such as rock-lined hearths or human burials be uncovered during construction, then work
should cease in the immediate area of the discovery, and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff and the
Archeology Division at the Texas Historical Commission should be contacted so that the finds can be
assessed.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of LCRA’s Proposed Buckner Boys Ranch Substation Project

By Andrew F. Malof
Principal Investigator

TAC Permit # 4779
Interim Report No. 10.98
Parks and Resource Conservation
Lower Colorado River Authority
June 2008

277

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA proposes to construct a new substation on approximately 3.2 acres of land near the community of
Kingsland in western Burnet County, Texas (Figure 118). The substation will be located at the
intersection of FM 2342 and CR 135.
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on June 2,
2008. The survey consisted of both random and controlled pedestrian transects along with shovel testing.
A total of eight shovel tests was excavated, meeting minimum survey standards (Figure 119).
No archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the investigations, and there was no collection of
artifacts and therefore nothing to curate.

Environmental Background
The project area is within the Llano Uplift region of Central Texas. Soils are of the Click series, which
are described as deep, excessively drained sandy loams formed in granite. It is about 250 m south of
Williams Creek (named Powdermill Creek on the 1909 USGS quad) and somewhat less than a kilometer
east of the Colorado River. Vegetation consists primarily of mesquite and juniper with some scattered
oak, as well as prickly pear, tassjillo and beebrush and other forbs and grasses.

Cultural Background
The project area is within the Central Texas archaeological region, well-described by Collins (1995) and
many others. Prehistorically, hunter-gatherers exploited a wide range of plant and animal resources and
maintained a semi- to highly nomadic lifeway.
The modern history of Burnet County begins in about the 1830s, but did not stabilize until perhaps the
1850s, especially after the establishment of Fort Croghan. According to the Handbook of Texas Online,
by the 1880s the nearby community of Kingsland had been established. Hoover’s Valley, which lies
between Kingsland and Burnet, was settled in the 1850s, and had an independent school system until the
1940s. The Buckner Children’s Baptist Home established Buckner Boys Ranch at about the same time.

Research Design

The survey was designed to identify any archaeological sites present within the project area by means of
files and records searches combined with standard on-the-ground survey methods. If any sites were
identified they would be assessed for potential eligibility for formal listings as State Archeological
landmarks and/or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Field investigations combined
pedestrian survey with formal shovel testing. A no collection policy was maintained.

Results of Investigations

No archaeological sites were re corded as a result of the investigations. The 3.2 acre tract had varying
degrees of visibility – excellent where a series of dirt roads had been maintained, and poor to none where

there was dense vegetation. The survey began with pedestrian survey which closely examined the banked
soil along the roadways as well as other exposures. One burned piece of burned chert was seen in a road,
as were two possible cores; however, a gravel quarry located just off the tract to the north could well have
produced the “cores,” and there was nothing else to associated the burned chert with, including from a
shovel test very near its location. A total of eight shovel tests was excavated. These tests all found brown
or light brown granitic sandy loams at depth of 15 to 40 cm over decaying granite. They were placed in
areas with poor visibility and/or in order to ensure adequate subsurface testing was accomplished. No
cultural material was found in any of the tests. There were at least two rusted pieces of sheet metal or tin
seen on the ground surface, but no other historic material was seen. The 1909 Burnet USGS quad map
showed no structures within or near the project area.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 3.2 acre
proposed Buckner Boys Ranch substation location. No intact cultural resources were coated as a result of
the investigation. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed with standard emergency
discovery procedure in place.

Intensive Cultural resources Survey of LCRA’s Proposed Revision of the Gloster Bend Redevelopment
Project, Travis County, Texas

By Andrew F. Malof
Principal Investigator

TAC Permit No. 4779
Interim Report 11.08
Parks and Resource Conservation

September, 2008

Management Summary
LCRA proposes to develop a portion of its Gloster Bend Recreational Area located in western Travis
County on the north shore of Lake Travis. Components will include both day use and overnight camping
facilities. In January of 2008, a report summarizing an intensive archaeological and historic survey of the
property was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission for review (Malof et. al 2008, Malof and
Prikryl 2008). The archaeological investigations focused on an approximate 170-acre portion of the park
conceptualized for immediate development, while the historic research, which included investigating deed
and other records, as well as an oral history interview with a long time resident of the area, was
comprehensive for the entire property. The THC concurred with all recommendations within the report.
Following consultation with a firm specializing in designing and developing parks, it was determined an
additional area totaling approximately 38 acres, located generally north of the previously surveyed area,
should be considered for development as well, primarily for RV pads and multi-use campgrounds (Figure
120). Impacts could include creating camp loops and pads, as well as providing appropriate utilities.
This additional acreage was surveyed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff during three days in August,
2008. Survey consisted of controlled pedestrian transects and both systematically and judiciously placed
shovel tests. A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated in the project area, which meets the minimum
survey standards as suggested by the Texas Historical Commission (Figure 121).
As a result of the investigations, one previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological site, 41V2305 was
recorded. This site is a diffuse lithic scatter with apparent burned limestone. It is highly disturbed from
past clearing activities, and is not felt to contain information beyond that already obtained through its
recording. It is not considered to be eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Due to the extensive background section of the previous report, the short format report as suggested by
Council of Texas Archeologist guidelines is used here. No artifacts were collected for this project, so no
curation will be necessary.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed.
Study Area
The project area is within Glen Rose formation limestone and a transitional zone of between the lowland
floodplain of the Colorado River and the uplands to the north. It is on a relatively flat divide between 740
and 760 ft amsl. The point of land that comprises Gloster Bend is incised by a number of drainages,
indicating ground water was once more plentiful then at present. Soils consist of the Pedernales (Alfisol)
and Altoga (Inceptisol) series, both of which indicate relatively high moisture availability during soil
formation. At present there are thirty-one recorded archaeological sites at Gloster Bend, both historic and
prehistoric. Prehistoric sites include river-side camps, upland camps, lithic scatters, and lithic
procurement areas. Some of the upland campsites are distinctive in that there appears to have been fairly
intensive occupation at locations removed from immediate water sources.
Historically, the land was used for farming and ranching activities by members of the extended Singleton
family. Past clearing activities within the project area have resulted in a dense monoculture of juniper of
uniform size. The nearby Singleton Cemetery (previously Post Oak Cemetery) has numerous burials
dating to the 1870s, and some as early as the 1850s. A number of house sites have been recorded, most of
which correspond to locations seen on turn-of-the-century topographic maps, and on which additional
information was gathered from local long-time resident Mr. Vernon Hollingsworth.

In general, the study area was considered to be of relatively low potential for intact prehistoric sites, and
there was no archival evidence of historic sites within the study area boundaries. However, as it was
unclear what, if any, investigations had been conducted previously, it was felt that it would be prudent to
conduct a cultural resource investigation prior to intensive development.

Research Design and Methods
The survey was designed simply to identify archaeological sites and, if present, to assess their potential as
formal State Archeological Landmarks. This was accomplished by teams of two to four archaeologists
walking generally parallel transects centered approximately 30 m apart. The transects wandered as a
result of dense vegetation, and as a means of surveying as thoroughly as possible. Shovel tests were
placed both systematically and judiciously. Survey standards adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission suggest a minimum of 19 shovel tests for a project of this size. Nineteen shovel tests were
excavated, mostly to depths of between 30 and 40 cm. This level of testing is felt to be adequate, as the
landform is not conducive to aggradation, and because soil profiles were suggestive of long-term
formation.

Results of Investigations
One previously unrecorded archaeological site, 41TV2305, was recorded as a result of the investigation.
No other indications of cultural resource sites were seen within the rest of the project area.
Site 41TV2305
Site 41TV2305 was recorded while conducting standardized transects (Figure 122). The site consists of a
diffuse scatter of flakes, cores, and apparent burned rock, both limestone and quartzite, located in sandy
clays. No lag gravel deposits are present. Flakes are primarily decorticate and thin. Site documentation
was hampered by dense to extremely dense juniper woods, although overall ground visibility was decent.
Two shovel tests were excavated within the site, both through hard clay soils, and neither with any
subsurface recovery. Topographically, the site is located across a low ridge located about 250 m
equidistant from two drainage systems to the east and west. The current channel of the Colorado River is
over a kilometer away in a generally southerly direction. The ground has been heavily impacted by past
clearing activities. The wooded area to the south was once a demonstration plot where two-way chaining
was conducted in 1987. This may explain why the site does not seem to extend in that direction. At
present it is unknown what clearing took place in the site area, although the juniper is of uniform size and
consistent in size with that seen to the south. The site may also be an extension of 41TV475, which is
located immediately to the north. That site was originally recorded as a hearth field, and apparent heaths
and burned rock scatters are still present. Other lithic (chert) artifacts seem uncommon, although the site
has not yet been intensively reinvestigated.
Gloster Bend is unusual, and possibly unique, given the apparent amount of fairly intensive upland
resource processing. Site 41TV477, 483, 1836, 2269 and 2267 all have similar indications. Site
41TV2305 appears to fall within this category as well. The cores that are present were brought from
elsewhere, presumably for expedient production of flakes at the processing or acquisition locale. Because
of the highly disturbed nature of the site, little else can be said, and its interpretive potential is considered
to be exhausted through its recording. The site is not considered to be eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to include an approximate 38-acre section of land to its proposed Gloster Bend Park
development project. The remainder of the primary development area was surveyed in 2007 and has been
reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission. This project is an addendum to that, and in no way
changes the results or recommendations form that project. Additionally, this project does not address any
potential development in other areas. Future modifications to development designs remain subject to
agreed-upon avoidance and/or additional testing measures, while development such as trails and
secondary entry stations will require separate assessment and review.
As a result of the survey of the 38-acre section, one new prehistoric archaeological site, 41TV2305, was
recorded. This is a diffuse scatter of chert chipping debris and burned and fire-cracked rock of possible
cultural origin. The site is felt to be fully recorded and ineligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. LCRA therefore
recommends that development be allowed to take place within this defined area without further oversight,
with the understanding that standard emergency discovery procedure will be in place.

Management Summary
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct a new switchyard on its existing
Red Creek to Comanche Switch Transmission Line (T-424) in McCulloch County to serve as a
interconnect to the RES Rattlesnake Wind Farm (Figure 123). Construction will entail clearing and
grading an 800 by 700 ft (approximately 13 acre) area prior to the laying of an insulating gravel bed for
the circuit breakers and other switchyard equipment (Figure 124). The LCRA also plans to buy land
adjacent to the north and south sides of the proposed switchyard. The area to the north will be cleared for
the towers supporting the connections to the existing T-424 Transmission Line and will also serve as an
equipment laydown area for construction equipment and supplies. The area to the south of the proposed
switchyard will be set aside for future additions and connection projects. In all, the project area covers 30
acres.
LCRA Archeology Services surveyed the project area on September 11 and 12, 2008 during which one
new prehistoric archeological site, 41MK46, was recorded. The site contains evidence primarily relating
to lithic procurement activities. The deposits are shallow with a high likelihood of being temporally
mixed and disturbed by land clearing. Therefore, the site is not recommended for Stare Archeological
Landmark designation. Several other isolated artifacts were also found elsewhere in areas where chert
cobbles are exposed on the surface. To a limited degree, lithic procurement obviously took place over a
very wide area within the bounds of the proposed project.

Environmental Background
Geology
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, much of the project area is covered by recent or Pleistoceneage deposits made up of gravels, caliche, sand, and clay (Barnes 1976). The gravels range in size from
small chert and quartz pebbles to boulders of Cretaceous and Paleozoic limestone. These deposits were
laid down as alluvial fans from Cretaceous formations creating a great outwash plain between the Brady
Mountains and the Colorado River. These deposits incline to the north and are currently eroding along
the northern edge of the project area exposing Permian age sedimentary mudstones and limestones.
Soils
Two soils and one soil association have been mapped within the project area (Bynum and Coker 1974) as
shown on Figure 124. They are all considered upland soils whose parent material is the old alluvium that
covers much of the area. The Sagerton clay loam soil is found in the northwest corner of the project area
adjacent to a small dry tributary of the Colorado River. This is a deep soil derived from shaly clay
consisting of clay loam throughout its profile. None of the shovel tests dug during the current project
encountered this soil type and in actuality might not extend into the project area.
Mareta clay loam is found in the southeast corner of the project area where the ground is nearly level.
This is a shallow soil of dark clay loam over a thick bed of caliche. Two of the shovel tests (ST 14 and
15) encountered this soil although neither was dug deep enough to reach the caliche zone.
Most of the project area is covered by soils belonging to the Cho-Mereta association. These are shallow
soils consisting of loams over caliche. Shovel testing found considerable variation in soil thickness,
ranging from 16 cm to over 50 cm and usually encountering what in the field was thought to be limestone
bedrock. This material could be an extremely hard caliche although it was sometimes found to have chert
nodules embedded in it.

Physiography and Landforms
The project area is located on the southern end of the North Central Plains physiographic region (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1977), a region also known as the Rolling Plains and Mesquite Plains (Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs 1978). This region and the adjacent Edwards Plateau represent the
southernmost extension of the midgrass Great Plains grassland (Diamond 2008).
At a smaller scale, the project area rests at the north end of an extensive outwash plain originating along
the north edge of the Brady Mountains to the south and dissected by the Colorado River immediately to
the north. A shallow drainage dissects the northeastern end of the project area, eventually opening out
onto the Colorado River floodplain. This drainage has been dammed, creating a large stock pond
immediately west of the project area. A series of low, discontinuous terrace-like ridges or scarps run
northeast to southwest following the contours.
Vegetation
The project area lies in the southern portion of the natural subregion of Texas known as the Mesquite
Plains. The landscape has a plains like-appearance with large expanses of open grassland and few trees
other than mesquite brush. Much of the surrounding flat areas are under cultivation, while the project
area, itself, and continuing northwards to the floodplain of the Colorado River, is covered with mesquite
thickets (Figure 125) and small savanna-like clearings (Figure 126). Agarita is common shrub and
prickly Pair carpets small areas. Some recent brush clearing with heavy machinery has occurred with
brush piles present in a few parts of the project area.
Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the northwest corner of the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by
Prewitt (1981). The concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when
most Texas archaeologists held the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits.
In part of Texas where hunter-gatherers were though to have lived, the traits that concerned archaeologists
most were projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later, in the 1960s and
1970s, many processual archaeologists argued that culture operated as a system that allowed a population
to adapt to its environment. Since Central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many different
cultural systems must have operated in the past. The population in the Mesquite Plains would have had a
different adaptation than one that included the Balcones Canyonlands in their interactive sphere. With
little ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent decades has focused
on cultural ecology and the materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology (e.g. Goode in Malof
et al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Derring in Collins et al. 1997),
which can to see degree be understood using branches of the “hard” sciences.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most prevalently in use being that of Johnson and Goode (1992). As with all such frameworks for the
region, projectile point forms are used as time markers to recognize various time periods and subperiods.

Historic Background
The first written accounts concerning the area that would become McCulloch County were left by
explorer Jose Mares, who passed through in 1788 while seeking a route between San Antonio and Santa
Fe. In 1847, John O. Meusebach signed a treaty with the Comanche on the San Saba River at a site that
would later be called Camp San Saba (Smyrl 2008). McCulloch County was formed from the Bexar
District by the Texas Legislature in 1856 but Anglo settlement of the area only began in the late 1850s
after southern Comanche groups moved north to join other Comanche bands or to enter reservations.
Early population centers included Camp San Saba, Voca, and Lost Creek along or close to the San Saba
River and Millburn, which was located further northward near the Colorado River. More extensive
settlement occurred in the 1870s and about this the township of Brady was established on the creek of the
same name. The town was chosen as the county seat in 1876.
Previous Investigations

The nearest previous archeological investigation was conducted by PBS&J for the LCRA’s Morgan
Creek- Twin Buttes- Red Creek-Comanche Transmission Line. This transmission line borders the north
side of the project area. Although no cultural resource sites were found by PBS&J in the area adjacent to
the current project area, they did record 41MK43 at a location about 1.2 km to the east on a high terrace
on the south side of the Colorado River. This site was identified as a lithic procurement site as well as a
campsite, although the artifact inventory consisted of bifaces, cores, tested cobbles, and debitage. A
similar site, 41MK42, was recorded during this same survey on a knoll overlooking Bois d’ Arc Creek
about 2.5 miles to the west of the project area.
Nearby sites that have been excavated include 41MK8, 41MK9, 41MK10, and 41MK27 along FM 765
east of the current project area. These sites were excavated by TxDOT archaeologists in the late 1970s
due to upcoming impacts from road construction. Sites 41MK8 and 41MK9, known as the Corn Creek
sites, contain Archaic and Late Prehistoric burned rock middens that were reported by Black et al. (1997).
A large reservoir project – the O. H. Ivie Reservoir (previously called Stacy Reservoir) – on the Colorado
River as close as five miles to the project area included archaeological excavations in the 1980s. That
work was reported by Lintz et al. (1993).
Research Design and Methods
The purpose of the field investigation was to locate and record all cultural resource sites in the project
area and assess their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). The
investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey with shovel testing. For the pedestrian survey, two
archaeologists walked transects at 30 meter intervals. Ground surface visibility was found to be variable.
Shovel tests were placed in the vicinity of surface artifact finds to search for buried artifacts and establish
site boundaries. Shovel tests were also placed in areas with poor ground surface visibility. A total of 16
shovel tests were dug during the survey (Figure 127). The survey had a “no collection” policy. Thus,
there are no artifacts to curate for this project.
Results of Investigations
One prehistoric site, 41MK46, was recorded during the survey. It is located in the western part of the
project area (see Figure 127). This site is a diffuse surface scatter of chert debitage – less than one flake
per 100 square meters – and also includes three Stage 1 bifaces, two, and one edge-modified flake.
These materials were spread over an area of approximately 1.5 acres. These artifacts were found spread
over a low, nearly level landform slope leading down to the drainage at the west end of the project area.

298

This area is open grassland with clumps of mesquite brush and small trees. The site was located when
Shovel Test #7 (ST#7) recovered a single flake in the upper 15 cm of topsoil. Four other shovel tests dug
on the cardinal directions at 15 meter distances from ST#7 failed to recover any additional subsurface
artifacts and all but one, ST#8, struck bedrock at depths between 10 and 22 cm. A close inspection of the
ground in this area revealed the other artifacts listed above. This surface scatter was found to extend to
within 40 m of two previous surface finds – a small core and a flake – that were initially considered to be
isolated artifacts. The site area was, therefore, extended eastward to include these two artifacts.
41MK46 lies within a larger area where chert cobbles are exposed by erosion of the old alluvium along
the flanks of drainages. This zone includes the northern and western parts of the project area, where in
addition to 41KM46 two other isolated Stage 1 bifaces were also noted during the pedestrian survey. It
appears that both early stage biface reduction as well as the production of flakes from multi-directional
cores were activities that occurred at this site in prehistoric times. In addition, some limited activity
involving the use of flake tools took place. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed during the
survey.
Of the 16 shovel tests dug during the survey, only the already mentioned ST#7 recovered any
unquestionable artifacts. Shovel profiles for all of these shovel tests are presented in Appendix 1.
Summary and Recommendations
A cultural resource survey of the 30-acre Rockwood Electrical Switchyard Project led to the recording and
assessment of one new prehistoric site, 41MK46. The investigation of this site suggests that the site was
primarily used as a lithic procurement locale. The artifacts at the site are extremely widely scattered, and
although no diagnostic artifacts were found, it is probable that the site was utilized over multiple time
periods by prehistoric peoples. Additionally, the artifacts occur in thin soil deposits that have probably
been disturbed by land clearing episodes in the historic times. The site is considered to be fully recorded,
and it is doubtful that additional investigation would yield any useful information. Thus, site 41MK46 is
assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL. It is recommended that the proposed switchyard
construction be allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with
the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are
present.

Management Summary
The LCRA is planning to build a new electrical substation in Burnet County between Backbone Ridge
and Lake LBJ. Since the proposed substation is located near the Buckner Boy’s Ranch, it will be given
that designation. In May of this year (2008), the LCRA submitted a report on an earlier site location for
this project (Malof 2008) and the THC concurred with our recommendation that the project proceed since
no archeological sites were found. Since then, the location for the new substation has been changed to a
site approximately 600 meters to the north on the opposite (north) side of Williams Creek (Figure 128).
The size of the area at five acres is approximately the same as that of the first location.
LCRA Archeology Services conducted an intensive survey of the project area on September 25, 2008,
finding no archeological sites within its bounds. Therefore it is recommended that the project proceed.

Environmental Background
Geology
Nearly all the project area is covered by Pleistocene-age sediments (Barnes 1981). Shovel testing during
the current field investigation found these sediments to be composed primarily of silts. PreCambrian
granite has been mapped along the northern margins of the project, however on-the-ground inspection
found only limestone outcropping on the slope adjoining the sediments.
Soils
Weswood silt loam covers approximately 95% of the project area having developed on the Pleistocene
sediments. These are deep soils consisting of zones of brown silty loam. Some Weswood soils have a
surface horizon of loam or sandy loam (probably encountered in Shovel Test 5). Within the Weswood
mapping unit are bands of Oakalla soils, dark grayish brown with lower horizons of clay loam (probably
encountered in Shovel Test 3).
Voca soils have been mapped along the northern edge of the project area. The soils form on granite or
gneiss, rocks not found to outcrop within the project area. Probably Voca soils can be found a short
distance to the north or west.
Physiography and Landforms
The substation project is located in the eastern part of the Central Texas Uplift (Llano Uplift, Central
Texas Mineral Region) at the interface between the rolling granite hills and the Paleozoic sedimentary
rocks that ring the region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The substation will be built on a low, flat
strip of land adjacent to Williams Creek that blends seamlessly into an extensive flood plain of the
Colorado River. A low limestone escarpment borders this strip of land to the north.
Vegetation
The flat area is presently covered by dense thickets of whitebrush (Aloysia gratissima), small mesquite
trees, persimmon, a few ashe junipers, and a single large live oak (Figure 129). Movement by foot is only
possible through a network of trails have been blazed through the thicket to permit line-of-sight for deer
hunting. Because most of the sunlight is blocked by the time it reaches the surface, ground cover is
generally sparse. Immediately outside the project bounds to the north on the limestone slope grow fairly
large live oaks and junipers (Figure 130).

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the northwest corner of the central Texas archeological region, as defined by
Prewitt (1981). The concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 60s) when most
Texas archeologists held the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits. In
parts of Texas where hunter gatherers were thought to have lived, the traits that concerned archeologists
most were projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later in the 1960s and 70s,
many processual archeologists argued that culture functioned as a system that allowed a population to
adapt to its environment. Since central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many different
cultural systems must have operated in the past. The groups residing in the Llano Uplift would have had
a different adaptation than one who included the Blackland Prairies in their interactive sphere. With little
ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent decades has focused on
cultural ecology and other materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology (e.g. Goode in Prikryl
et al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Dering in Collins et al. 1997).
Chronological frameworks for central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, the one
most prevalently in use is that of Johnson and Goode (1992). As with all such frameworks for the region,
projectile point forms are used as time markers to recognize various periods and subperiods.
Historic Background
Although parts of what is now Burnet County were included in colonizing contracts with the Mexican
government before 1836, actual settlement did not occur until the mid-1840s. Soon after Texas was
annexed by the United States, federal money financed a ranger station on Hamilton Creek to help defend
the frontier. This station and surrounding land was purchased one year later by Samuel E. Holland, who
built the area’s first permanent residence (Smyrl 1999). Fort Croghan was established in 1848, and by the
1850s such settlers as the Smithwicks, Vandeveers, and Kerrs, as well as Lyman Wight’s group of
Mormans moved into the region. In 1852 Burnet was officially designated a county. The area
contributed to the Confederate cause during the Civil War, although dissension between factions resulted
in several premature deaths, especially for Union sympathizers. Perhaps a carryover from these times, the
1860s and 1870s remained a violent and lawless period, exacerbated by an economic depression during
Reconstruction. Recovery came as ranching, agricultural, and mining operations increased.
In 1877 the land at the junction of the Llano with the Colorado River was purchased by Martin D. King
and J. M. Trussell (Greene 2001). Eventually the town of Kingsville began to grow at this location,
which soon had a cotton gin and trading post. When the railroad was extended to Llano in 1892,
Kingsville became a stop along the way. Railroad interests built a large hotel called the Antlers which
encouraged tourist to visit the spot by rail. By 1901 the town had been renamed Kingsland.
The area was hard hit by the Depression, and the Works Progress Administration put many people to
work, as did the dam building projects overseen by the Lower Colorado River Authority. The dams were
built along the Hill Country stretch of the Colorado River to control flooding and produce hydroelectric
power for rural communities. Buchanan Dam was the first of these to be completed. It had originally
been started by private companies but their collapse during the Depression ended construction in 1932
when only 40 percent of dam had been built (Yarbrough 1990?). Many of the workers continued to live
at the construction camps along the river in the vicinity of the dam in the hope that the project would

309

310

eventually resume. Construction did not begin again until four years later when the state of Texas created
the Lower Colorado River Authority, a non-profit agency which could receive and administer the federal
funds needed to complete the project. Buchanan Dam was completed in less than a year and began
impounding the flow of the Colorado River on May 20, 1937. Wirtz Dam was begun in 1948 and
completed four years later, creating Lake Granite Shoals. The name was changed in 1965 to Lake
Lyndon B. Johnson.

Previous Investigations
The majority of the archeological investigations in the eastern half of the Llano Uplift region have taken
place along the Colorado River mostly because of salvage work conduced prior to the impounding of the
artificial lakes. Over 70 sites were recorded in the late 1930s along a 15-mile stretch of the river within
the uplift which was to be inundated by Lake Buchanan. Reconnaissance work was done in the early
1950s by the River Basins Survey of the area affected by the creation of Lake Granite Shoals (now Lake
LBJ), the reservoir less than a mile west of the project area. A large number of sites were located as a
result of the Granite Shoals survey however these were plotted on a large-scale map and their precise
locations are uncertain.
The Texas State Department of highways and Public Transportation excavated a part of 41BT6 in order to
mitigate its destruction by proposed road improvements (Young 1985). The excavations uncovered an
unusual sheet midden composed mostly of granite rocks arranged in a thin layer. The rock in this feature
appeared unburned. Also present were small sandstone hearths outside the sheet midden. Point styles
indicated that the site was used from the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric. A similar
accumulation of granite rocks was uncovered by test excavations conducted by TPWD archeologists at
Inks State Park a few miles north of the current project area (Drake 1996).
Between 1988 and 1990, archeologists from the LCRA conducted three phases of excavation at the
Kingsland site (41BT215), a prehistoric site along the right bank of the Colorado far enough upstream
from Wirtz Dam to escape complete inundation by Lake LBJ (Nash et al. 1995). Prehistoric artifacts
were found in all units indicating the site encompasses the entire LCRA tract and presumably extends
outside on to private land. In the deeper soil close to the lake, cultural material was recovered down to
depths of 240 cm but artifact density was markedly higher in the upper 100 cm of soil than below.
Projectile frequencies indicate frequent use of the area from the Early Archaic (Split Stem and Uvalde)
through the early part of the Late Prehistoric (Scallorn arrow points). Some historic trash material was
also recovered although only seven artifacts were thought to date before 1900. Disturbances of the
deposits, apparently mostly by pedoturbation, prevented identification of stratigraphic components,
however the presence of small, more or less intact burned rock features at the same general elevation
suggests that components of a sort do exist but smaller cultural material has probably been displaced
vertically. The site is now part of the LCRA Nightengale Archaeological Center and regular tours for
school groups and the general public are conducted by LCRA staff and volunteers from the Llano Uplift
Archeological Society.
During a 2006 transmission line maintenance survey, LCRA archeologists recorded 41BT414 on the
south side of Williams Creeks across from the current project area. The survey found a few flakes and
core fragments on the terrace mostly within the transmission line ROW.
Research Design and Methods
The purpose of the field investigation was to locate and record all cultural resources site in the project
area and to assess their eligibility for SAL status. The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey with

311

shovel testing. Shovel tests were placed in the vicinity of any isolated surface artifact, to establish the
boundaries of buried cultural deposits (usually following a positive shovel test). A total of 10 shovel tests
were dug during the survey (Figure 131, see Appendix for soil profiles).

Results of Investigations
No artifacts or cultural features were seen on the surface within the bounds of the project other than a few
pieces of modern trash. Two of the ten shovels tests (ST3 and ST7) placed at opposite corners of the
project area did recover one prehistoric artifact each. In ST3, located at the southwest corner of the
project, a small fragment of chert with regular microflaking along 15 mm of one edge was recovered from
a depth of 65 cm. The test continued to a depth of 80 cm at which point the soil became gravelly and hard
to dig. Tests were placed 15 m to the north and east of this unit with no additional artifact recovery.
In the northeast corner of the project a few meters below the limestone slope, a small flake fragment was
recovered from the upper 25cm of soil. Below 25cm, packed limestone rocks and pebbles were
encountered similar to what was visible on the slope and probably a subsurface extension of it. No other
cultural material was seen on the adjacent slope or ground beneath it.
Considering the distance between these two finds - 180 meters – and that no additional artifacts were
recovered from the eight tests placed in between, they do not seem to belong to single site extending
across the project area. These flakes may belong to unrecorded sites lying outside the project area or
they might represent isolated finds.
Summary and Recommendations
No archeological sites were recorded during the survey. It is therefore recommended that the project
proceed as planned.

Abstract

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) conducted a cultural resource assessment for the proposed
construction of new transmission structures and movement of existing transmission structures within the
boundaries of Austin Energy’s (AE) existing Lytton Springs Substation for the Lytton Springs AutoTransformer Project in August and September 2008. The proposed work will involve work on a small
number of structures on LCRA’s existing T-382 and T-534 transmission lines and on the AE line that
extends from the substation to Slaughter Lane.
As a result of pedestrian survey and shovel testing, one new cultural resource site, 41CW121, was found.
Site 41CW121 is an historic farmstead site associated with two generations of the Booten family. The
site was occupied during the early 20th century, and family’s chief economic pursuit appears to have been
cotton farming. Although the house was dismantled in the late 1970s, several house foundation stones
and the underground portion of a brick-lined cistern are still present in the southwestern half of the site.
Artifacts observed on ground surface and recovered during shovel testing date to early 20th century and
are generally nondescript and lacking in diversity.
The site is considered to have been fully documented, and it is assessed as not meriting formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark and not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places. It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed without any further cultural
resource investigations.
Since no artifacts were collected during the investigation, no curation of artifacts will be needed.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and Austin Energy (AE) are jointly working on the Lytton
Springs Auto-Transformer Project at the AE-owned Lytton Springs Substation in northern Caldwell
County. As a part of this project, the LCRA is proposing to erect six new transmission structures to
connect the LCRA’s existing T-382 and T-534 transmission lines at substation facilities. Four of these
new transmission structures will be constructed within previously undeveloped parts of AE’s Lytton
Springs Substation property that have not ever been surveyed for cultural resource sites. Erection of these
four structures will also require that two of AE’s existing structures be moved to new previously
unsurveyed areas within the substation property.
The intensive cultural resource survey of the previously unsurveyed areas where the four new LCRA
transmission structures will be constructed and the two AE structures will be relocated within the Lytton
Springs Substation was conducted by LCRA’s Archeology Services staff member Daniel J. Prikryl
(Principal Investigator) and Patrick Hatten in August and September 2008 (Figure 132). The
investigation was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee Blanket Permit #4479, which was issued
to the LCRA by the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2008. The survey was also
undertaken in order to meet the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966. Additionally, the work was done in accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as
proposed by the Texas Council of Archeologists (1992). The other two LCRA transmission structures
will be erected within the right-of-way (ROW) of the LCRA’s existing T-534 transmission line east of the
substation. Since that part of the T-534 line was previously surveyed for cultural resources with negative
results by Nightengale (1993), no additional investigation was undertaken of that area for the current
project.

Environmental Background
The project area is situated within the Blackland Prairie geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:13).
The surface geology consists of clays and marls of the Cretaceous-aged Navarro and Marlbrook Marl
(Barnes 1974). Soil mapped by within the project area is the Heiden clay (Lowther and Werchan 1978).
The Heiden clay typically has a 78 cm (24 inch) thick topsoil layer that consists of dark grayish-brown
calcareous clay. The next layer is dark grayish-brown calcareous clay with yellowish-brown mottles that
is also 78 cm (24 inch) thick on average. Deeper, a light brownish-gray to yellowish-brown shaly clay is
present.
According to Arbingast el al. (1976:13), the Blackland Prairie original vegetation commonly consists of
bunch and short grasses. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries much of the prairie was converted
to croplands (McMahan et al. 1984). By the 1970s, production of crops, principally cotton and corn, had
declined with the land becoming pastureland for cattle.

Culture History
The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al. 1995). The Central
Texas archeological record has typically been divided into four main subdivisions. These periods, in
chronological order from most ancient to most recent are: the Paleoindian, the

318

Figure 132. Section of the current Creedmoor, Texas 7.5 USGS map showing the cultural resource
survey area in red.

319

Archaic, the Late Prehistoric, and the Historic periods. These periods are differentiated mostly by broadly
defined subsistence patterns. The prehistoric part of this chronology has been subdivided further into
phases based largely on changes in material culture, especially projectile point styles. Combined, this
information begins to describe the 11,500 year history of human occupation in Central Texas.
A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been revised by Johnson and Goode
(1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and geomorphological
data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins (1995), who indicates climatic
variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and Goode. Though these chronologies
are invaluable to our knowledge base for Central Texas archeology, they must be used as a stepping-stone
to expand our understanding of the cultural history of an area by addressing the question of why changes
occurred in various regions and cultures when they did.
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf.
Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 11,500
years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these millennia, prehistoric
peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting seasonally available
plant and animal resources.
Although the project area is located close to the early Spanish Road known as El Camino Real (State
Highway 21), there are no accounts of activities associated with the road in the early historic period
(McGraw et al. 1991). Just prior to the Texas Revolution, a few individuals associated with DeWitt’s
colony may have settled as close to the project area as Plum Creek which is located about 8 to 10 miles
south of the project area in the vicinity of Lockhart (O’Bannon 1931:43).
The earliest established community in the immediate project vicinity is Lytton Springs, which is located
about 5 miles east of the project area. Settlement began in the 1850s with the community being known as
Albade (Smyrl 2008). A post office was established there in 1859, and the community came to be known
as Lytton Springs in the early 1860s. By the mid-1880s, the community had a steam cotton gin, a Baptist
church, a school, a general store, and about 125 residents. The 1890 census reported that Lytton Springs
had 300 residents. Although livestock ranching was the most important economic pursuit in the early
years, cotton farming became dominant during the period from 1900 to 1930. With the decline in cotton
production, ranching again became important. During the twentieth century, the population declined so
that by 1960, Lytton Springs had only 116 residents. However, in 2000 the population was recorded as
500.
Mendoza is a second community near the project area. It lies just 0.60 miles west of the project area on
U. S. Highway 183. It was named for an early settler and had a post office from 1892 to 1911 (Wagner
2008). The community’s population peaked in the first quarter of the twentieth century when the town
had 200 residents. The 1936 county highway map showed a school, a church, a cemetery, an industrial
site, several businesses, and numerous residences. In 2000, the population was 100.
Previous Investigations
Although there have not ever been any professional cultural resource surveys involving large blocks of
land in the vicinity of the project area, a number of cultural resource sites have been recorded within a 5
kilometer (km) radius. Most of these previously recorded sites were discovered during linear surveys for
roads, electrical transmission lines, and pipelines.

320

The earliest professional cultural resource survey in the project vicinity was the Fayette to Lytton Springs
Transmission Project (Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980). While many archaeological and historic sites were
recorded, the only one within the 5 km radius of the Lytton Springs Substation is 41CW22, which lies
about 3.7 km east of the current project area. This historic period site consisted of a deteriorated barn and
stable which were assessed as insignificant. Another cultural resource site, 41CW52, was recorded
during the State Highway 21 Improvement Project, approximately 5 km northeast of the project area.
This site is a prehistoric lithic scatter which was also assessed as insignificant (TARL: Caldwell County
File).
West of the project area, PBS&J has recently completed an intensive cultural resource survey for the
proposed S.H. 130 highway project. The portion of this new highway adjacent to the project area will be
constructed along and near the existing U.S. Highway 183. Three sites consisting of 41CW74, 41CW76,
and 41CW77 were recorded in the project vicinity (THC Site Atlas 2008). Site 41CW74 is a surficial
prehistoric lithic scatter while 41CW76 and 41CW77 are historic period house sites. All three of these
sites were assessed as insignificant.
Site 41CW108 is one of the more noteworthy previously recorded sites in the vicinity. It is the
Guadalupe-Mendoza cemetery, and it is situated about 1 km west of the project area. This cemetery has
primarily served the local Mexican-American community since the early 20th century. However, earlier
unmarked graves are said to be present as are a few late 19th century Anglo graves. Data on this
cemetery was recently utilized in a Masters Thesis project by Jonathan Jarvis (2007) of St. Edwards
University. It should also be noted that one of the earliest plotted archaeological sites in Caldwell
County, 41CW4, is just north of the cemetery. However, there is no information in the files at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory concerning this site.
A pertinent previous investigation is Nightengale’s (1993) survey of the Mendoza substation which is
situated about 1 km east of the current project area. This investigation also included the T-534
transmission line which was being constructed at that time from this substation to the Lytton Springs
Substation. No cultural resource sites were found during that investigation.
More recently the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey for the
proposed expansion of the Lytton Springs Substation (Prikryl 2008). Areas investigated are located
within the Lytton Springs Substation property in a 1.6 acre area to the north of the current project area.
No cultural resource sites were found.
Overall, the previously recorded sites in the project vicinity are primarily historic period sites that are
former rural house sites. These appear to date from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and are most
probably related to farming and ranching activities. The few prehistoric sites present are lithic scatters
that are located on small drainages and in upland settings where lag gravel deposits are present.

Survey Methodology
The file search conducted for the project suggested that there is a low probability that any prehistoric
archaeological sites to be present in the project area due to the absence of any water sources. In order to
determine the potential for any historic period archaeological sites to be present, historic maps consisting
of the 1910 Austin, Texas 30’ USGS map (field surveyed in 1895-1896), the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’
USGS map, and the 1968 Creedmoor, Texas 7.5’ USGS map were examined to determine if any
buildings had ever been present within or near the project area. While the 1910 map did not indicate any
structures in or near the project area, the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’ USGS map showed a farmhouse

321

that was located within or very near the southwest corner of the property area. That same structure is then
depicted as an abandoned house or barn on the 1968 Creedmoor, Texas 7.5’ USGS map. While a recent
aerial map indicates that the building is no longer present, there appeared to be some potential that
historic period archaeological remains such as building foundations and artifacts could be present within
or near the substation expansion area. For this reason, a cultural resource field survey appeared to be
warranted.
Field survey methods used during the project consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey along
with shovel testing. During the pedestrian survey, the project area was walked on 30 m zig-zag transects.
Bare and eroded patches of ground surface were inspected as was disturbed soil in and around the existing
chainlink fence that surroundings the existing substation facility. Shovel tests, which consisted of small
35 to 40 cm (13.5 to 15 inch) diameter holes were judgmentally placed in areas of high probability having
poor ground surface visibility and also to help determine the boundaries of any archeological sites. Since
the main focus of the investigation was to search for historic period remains, it was assumed that such
remains would be present on ground surface or would be shallowly buried. Therefore, the shovel tests
were generally only dug to depths of 40 to 50 cm below ground surface or to the top of the B horizon
clay. The shovel tests were excavated in 20 cm increments with all fill being screened through ¼ inch
wire mesh. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated within the approximately 2.4 acres that were
examined. This number well exceeds the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum requirements.
All shovel tests were carefully backfilled immediately after excavation to restore the ground surface to its
original appearance. Further, no artifacts were removed from the property of any of the landowners. Any
artifacts observed on the ground surface or found in the shovel tests were examined, analyzed, and
photographed in the field, as necessary, and then placed back in their original locations. Appendix 1
provides lists the soil descriptions from each shovel test, while Appendix 2 provides descriptions of the
artifacts recovered from the shovel tests.

Results of Investigations
One new archaeological site, 41CW121, was recorded and assessed during the survey (Figure 133). This
historic period site is situated at the spot where a house is shown on the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’
USGS map. It is also represented on the 1968 Creedmoor, Texas 7.5’ USGS map as an abandoned house
or barn. Although the structure is no longer present, an approximately 6 ft diameter underground cistern
(Figures 134 and 135) is visible as are two crude foundation stones. The upper part of the cistern
including the collar has been removed, and most of the cistern is filled in with dirt. The two foundation
stones lay about 60 ft apart in at spots 50 to 60 ft to the southwest of the cistern. A pile of wooden
boards, rusted tin sheets, and electrical cables was also noted at the site at a location about 50 ft to the
northeast of the cistern. The trash pile is quite compact as it covers an area of only 8x10 ft. None of the
materials in the trash pile appears to be very old, and the boards have round-headed nails. According to
the former landowner and current lessee, Mr. Archie Roberts (Personal communication 2008), the trash
pile is not related to the former house, but instead, is one of several piles of trash dumped illegally on the
property.

Although much of the area containing the former house features is covered with thick grasses, some good
ground surface visibility was noted in areas 80 to 100 ft north of the cistern along the boundaries of the
chainlink fence that surrounds the existing substation facility. Surface finds in that area consist mainly of
clear glass fragments, but four pieces of purple (solarized) glass were noted there as were two whiteware
ceramic sherds.

324

At the time the site was discovered, two shovel tests (ST#1 and 2) had already been excavated at locations
about 35 meters northeast and north of the cistern, respectively. Neither of these shovel tests produced
any artifacts. The site was found when the surveyors approached the location of the existing AE Structure
#1 on the AE line that extends from the substation to Slaughter Lane. This structure, which lies just 15
meters east of the cistern, will need to be removed and relocated to spot 15 to20 meters southwestward.
Seven additional shovels were then excavated to define the boundaries of 41CW121 and determine if the
relocation of the AE Structure #1 would damage any potentially significant cultural resources.
The excavation of the shovel tests led to the conclusion that 41CW121 extends from the north fence
adjacent to County Road 177 north for a length of 60 meters to the interior southwest edge of the existing
substation facility (See Figure 133). The width of the site was measured at 48 meters on an east-west line
with the west boundary appearing to coincide with an existing dilapidated barbed wire fence.
Appendix 2 provides a listing and description of artifacts recovered from the shovel tests. Artifact yield
(n=44) was highest at ST # 3, which is located adjacent to the chainlink fence where most of the surface
artifacts had been noted. The second highest artifact yield (n=36) came from Shovel Test #8, which is the
approximate new location for the AE Structure #1. Other shovel tests produced much lower number of
artifacts. The artifact inventory from these shovel tests mostly consists of clear glass fragments, roundheaded wire nails, rectangular-headed cut nails, plain whiteware ceramic sherds, and small, deteriorated
pieces of sheet metal.
The next highest number of artifacts came from ST #5, which was dug adjacent to the western foundation
stone. Artifacts from that shovel test included several round-headed nails, two distinctive roofing nails,
several pieces of mortar, a snuff jar rim fragment, a metal knife handle, and a metal rivet along with
several clear glass fragments. Other shovel tests yielded lower numbers of artifacts, with ST #6 and ST #9
on the southeast edge of the site having the lowest numbers. The artifacts from all of the shovel tests came
from the upper 30 cm of soil deposits, with the majority being within 20 cm of ground surface.
Previous disturbance of the topsoils was noted in the soil profiles of Shovel Tests #3 and 7 at the north
end of the site adjacent to the existing substation chainlink fence. Elsewhere, the topsoils did not show
evidences of prior disturbance except at Shovel Test #8, where an introduced gravel layer was lay at
depths from 7 to 18 cm below ground surface. This gravel came may residue from a gravel road that led
from the nearby county road to the house.
The artifacts found at 41CW121 are predominantly early to mid 20th century materials, with a few
possible late 19th century artifacts being represented by the four purple (solarized) glass fragments seen on
the surface at the far north end of the site and several rectangular-headed cut nails found in shovel tests.
Additionally, a single olive green glass fragment that came from Shovel Test #3 may come from a 19th
century wine bottle.
The early to mid 20th century ages of the artifacts fits well with deed/title research, which was conducted
by Utley (see Appendix 3) for this project. Utley’s work shows that the project area lies within the league
of land patented to Sampson Connell in 1847. Connell apparently did not live on this land, but instead
resided in Milam County. In 1886 he sold land that includes the project area to Ewing H. Skaggs.
Skaggs did not reside on this land either. Utley’s research indicates that the first landowners to actually
live on this tract were John and Eliza Booten, who purchased a 192 acre tract from Skaggs in 1889.
Site 41CW121 represents the Booten family farmstead. The exact date of the construction of the house
at 41CW121 is uncertain, but it was probably constructed between 1889 and 1910. John Booten died in
1920, after which the family farmstead transferred to his son Lewis and wife Lea. The 1930 census lists

325

Lewis Booten as a farmer and cotton buyer. Lewis Booten died in 1951, and, subsequently, his wife Lea
and Arthur V. Smith (relationship unknown) divided the property into two equal sized parts in 1963.
In 1977 Clyde Hausmann acquired and further subdivided the property. Mr. Hausmann and his wife,
Betty, held the land for only a few months before selling it to Archie A. and Idell Roberts. The Roberts’
then sold the property to Austin Energy in 1979. In a telephone interview with Archie A. Roberts in
August 2008, Mr. Roberts stated that the house had been uninhabited for some time and was in poor
condition when he purchased the tract. He also said that he dismantled the house, and reused the wood
elsewhere.
Overall, the farm house appears to have been occupied in the early 20th century by the Booten family and
aligns with the era when cotton farming was the predominant economic pursuit. The only remaining
features are the damaged cistern and several foundation stones. The artifacts are consistent with an early
20th century occupation, but are generally nondescript and lacking in diversity. Site 41CW121 is assessed
as insignificant due to the fact that the house is no longer present and because the artifact assemblage does
not have any potential to provide any new and interesting data about the early 20th century lifeways of
cotton farming families who lived on the Blackland Prairie in the Mendoza area.
As previously stated, the existing AE Structure #1 on AE line that extends from the substation to
Slaughter Lane is located within site 41CW121. Current project plans call for moving this structure to a
new location about 15 to 20 meters southwestward. This new location will also be situated within the
boundaries of site 41CW121. The cultural resource survey of other parts of the project area did not reveal
any evidences of other sites. In particular, the areas where LCRA will need to erect four new structures
within the substation grounds as well as the location where AE will need to relocate its Structure #2 on
the line from the substation to Slaughter Lane were intensively inspected and shovel tested with negative
results.

Recommendations
The intensive cultural resource survey for the LCRA and AE transmission structure relocation and
connector project at the Lytton Springs Substation led to the discovery of one new historic period
archaeological site, 41CW121. This investigation of this site indicates that it represents an early 20th
century house site that was owned and constructed by the John Booten family in the very 19th or very
early 20th century. The Booten family was engaged in cotton farming and family member descendents
may have occupied the house into the 1960s. The house was dismantled in the 1970s, and the only
remaining features at the site are several foundation stones and a portion of an underground cistern.
Artifacts found at the site are predominantly nondescript and lack diversity. It is doubtful that further
investigation of the site and its contents could produce any new and interesting data on the Booten family
or the cotton-farming lifeways of the early 20th century. Therefore, the site is assessed as not eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and not meriting formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that all necessary work for removing and relocating the
existing AE Structure #1 within the boundaries of site 41CW121 be allowed to move forward without any
further cultural resource investigations.
Similarly, it is recommended that the work involved with all of the other components of the proposed
project be allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations. However, should any
other presently unknown archaeological sites be uncovered during construction, then work shall cease in
the immediate area of the discovery and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
should be contacted at (512) 463-6096 so that the find can be assessed and a determination can be moved
as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed. In such a situation, work can proceed in
other areas where no archeological materials are present.

Appendix
Deed/Title Research for 41CW121, the Booten Family Farmstead
By
Dan K. Utley

BOOTON FAMILY FARMSTEAD, Caldwell County
The Booton Family Farmstead site is located within a league of land patented to Sampson
Connell in December 1847. The patent listed the property as part of the Bastrop District located
on the south side of the Old San Antonio Road (Caldwell County Deed Records: D/561). The
same year Connell acquired the land, preparations began for a new county that would include
portions of Gonzales and Bastrop counties. Finalized the following year, Caldwell County began
with Lockhart as the county seat. Population initially centered on Lockhart and other small
communities to the south and east, but by the end of the century, settlers were moving to upland
areas farther north as land use in the county shifted from cattle to cotton production and the
advent of local railroad lines made farming more commercially viable. Among the settlements
that developed during that era was Mendoza, the commercial center of a dispersed farming
community. It included a post office, school and businesses, including a cotton gin (The New
Handbook of Texas, Vol. 1, pp. 896-898; The New Handbook of Texas, Vol. 4, p. 619).
Sampson Connell apparently did not live on his land in Caldwell County, as he is listed in
other documents as a resident of Milam County. He began selling off acreage as early as the
1850s, and one of the individuals who eventually acquired considerable holdings within the
Connell League was Ewing H. Skaggs, who owned sizable tracts in other abstracts as well. An
1886 conveyance to A.M. Skaggs that covered portions of several abstracts noted the portion in
the Connell League included 431 acres in prairie and 371 acres in farm “with seven farm houses,
cribs, lots and four tanks 60 acres enclosed pasture and two hundred and thirty to sixty acres in
timber in the Isaac Allen, Story and Sampson Connell Surveys.” The deed also mentioned the
presence of a gin house on a nearby survey. (Caldwell County Deed Records: 3/63) The
description of the cultural landscape, along with the size of the conveyance, indicates Skaggs
managed a sharecropping operation for cotton production, similar no doubt to others in existence
in the area at the time.
In 1889, E.H. Skaggs sold 192 and 3/5 acres to John M. Booton (Caldwell County Deed
Records: 8/64). Born in Virginia in 1840 and married to a Virginia woman named Eliza A.
(surname not noted) in 1873, Booton was a farmer. The year of their marriage, the couple lived
in Missouri, where they soon gave birth to their first child, son Louis Wood Booton. They moved
to Texas by 1879, however, when a second child, daughter Pearla, arrived. (U.S. Census, 1900)
John Booton died sometime prior to 1920, when his widow is shown living with Pearla, by then
Mrs. William Graham Baker. (U.S. Census 1910 and 1920) Following John Booton’s death, the
family farmstead transferred to son Lewis and his wife Lea (also shown as Lea), apparently
without deed. In the 1930 census, Lewis Booton listed his profession as farmer and cotton buyer.

Management Summary
LCRA proposes to upgrade its existing T-216 transmission line, which runs for approximately 28 miles
within a 80-100 ft-wide corridor from the Fayetteville substation in Fayette County eastward through the
Fayette Electric Coop’s Willow Springs substation, then through Colorado County and into Austin
County to the New Bremen substation, jointly owned with San Bernard Electric Coop, to a point referred
to as the Bellville Split, from where it turns northward to end at the Bellville South substation (Figure
136). The upgrade will involve replacing existing conductor and the majority of the mostly wooden Hframe support structures between Fayetteville and the Bellville Split. Between Bellville South and the
Bellville Split existing lattice structures will remain in place, although certain structural elements (e.g.
bolts, crossarms) will need to be replaced.
The portion of line between the Fayetteville Substation and the Bellville Split was partially surveyed in
2004 prior to regularly scheduled maintenance activities. These surveys are structured based on impacts
from maintenance, which often require little more than the shredding of vegetation within previously
cleared corridors, although special attention is paid to areas where stream crossing need to be enhanced or
created. This section was intensively surveyed for the present project.
The portion of line within the Mill Creek floodplain, between the Bellville Split and the Bellville South
substation was surveyed by Hicks and Company in 2003. Fifty-four shovel tests were excavated along
this approximately 3-mile long segment, much of which is a low-lying swamp or marsh. No
archeological sites were found. This section of line, which will not be having structures replaced, was not
resurveyed.
In total, approximately 25 miles was assessed, with an emphasis on high probability areas defined by a
combination of geology, soils, hydrology, topography and historic records. Discounting the previously
intensively surveyed section, approximately 10.3 mi was considered to be of high probability for
containing cultural resources. A total of 45 hand excavated shovel tests and 23 mechanically excavated
auger tests were completed, for about 40 percent of the recommended minimum. This number is felt to
be sufficient based on field observations that included excellent representative subsurface visibility based
on extensive rodent burrowing in many areas and the perceived and previously demonstrated absence of
cultural material within the broad, heavy clay floodplains of the major streams.
As a result of the investigation, nine previously undocumented prehistoric archaeological sites, 41FY552,
41FY554 and 555, and 41AU90-95, and one historic trash scatter, 41FY553, were recorded, and two
previously recorded sites, 41AU83 and 41FY546, were assessed (Figures 137, 138, 139). The new
prehistoric sites are all lithic scatters, some with burned or fire cracked rock, but none in sufficient
quantity to indicate an extensive camp site. Other than 41FY555, they are all within highly turbated
sandy soils, lack evidence of discrete components, have little in the way of diagnostic tools, and no
evidence of clearly associated organic preservation. These sites are considered fully recorded within the
transmission line corridor and are felt to be ineligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Historic trash scatter
41FY553 has sparse materials, some of which may predate 1880 but include later items such as wire
nails. These artifacts are unassociated with any known structures and appear to represent trash disposal
events. This site is not considered eligible for SAL or NRHP status. Previously recorded site 41AU83
was a lithic and historic debris scatter which was previously assessed as ineligible. Site 41FY546 is a pile
of farm implements associated with an old farmstead. The implements were recommended for avoidance.
41FY555 is a deeply buried lithic scatter with a small amount of fire cracked rock located on a levee or
terrace remnant of Cummins Creek. Despite the very small amount of material that was observed, the site

is considered to potentially have additional research potential, and therefore is potentially eligible for
formal listing as an SAL or NRHP placement. It is therefore recommended that this very narrow
landform be excluded from impacts exceeding about 50 cm below the ground surface. If impacts cannot
be avoided, then additional investigations, most likely in the form of backhoe trenching should be
considered.
As for the rest of the project, the survey has produced additional information about prehistoric settlement
practices along what can be considered a random observational transect. This data clearly indicates that
certain prehistoric activities requiring the manufacture or maintenance of stone tools took place in well
drained sandy soils at relatively long distances from water sources, many of which are fairly small, but
probably spring-fed. Such activities were probably based on extraction of local food resources. Larger
campsites are certainly present in the area, so the prehistoric sites that were recorded for this project are
helpful in providing locational information, but can do little to more fully inform on specific aspects of
prehistoric life.

Environmental Background
The project area is situated West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman 1938:100-102).
Surface geology in most of the project area consists of the Miocene-aged Fleming Formation and the
Pleistocene Willis Formation (Barnes 1974). Elsewhere, Recent Alluvium is present on the lower terraces
of Cummins Creek, Mill Creek, and a narrow strip along Sandy Creek. Notably, the only Fluviatile
terrace deposits are crossed at the extreme north/eastern end of the project.
The largest stream channel traversed by the transmission line is Cummins Creek, a major tributary of the
Colorado River. The Cummins Creek crossing and those of several of its tributaries are all located in the
western part of the project area in Fayette County. Eastward, in Austin County, all stream crossings are
creeks that are parts of the Mill Creek drainage system. Mill Creek is a major tributary of the Brazos
River.
During field investigations it was noted that many of the small streams had clear flowing cool water and
hydrophytic vegetation. At least one actual spring was within or very near that transmission line corridor,
as were a number of small pools. This ground water, likely filtered through sandy soils, would have been
major draw for prehistoric people, and certainly factored into pulling them into more upland setting than
might otherwise have been expected.
Soils were analyzed by overlaying NRCS GIS-based SSURGO data on project maps. Over 30 individual
soils are crossed by the line. These soils were evaluated by proximity to water source, and by description.
There were clays (vertisols), loams (mollisols) and sands (alfisols). The most intriguing aspect of the soil
analysis was the presence of alfisols alongside streams in Tertiary sediments that are described as having
the potential for multiple buried A horizons. Informal discussion on the ListServ of the Texas
Archeological Society provided a general consensus that these buried horizons can develop in recent
(Holocene) times, thus creating the potential for buried cultural materials in otherwise unpromising
geologic settings.
The vast majority of the transmission corridor is within the Oak Savanna Vegetation Region with only the
extreme eastern edge falling within a different region, the Oak-Hickory Forest (Arbingast et al. 1976:13).
During the survey, the following observations were made about the vegetation of the project area (Figure
140). Beginning at the far west end of the project area and continuing to the west edge of the Cummins
Creek floodplain, the terrain is a Post Oak Woods, Forest, and Grassland Mosaic as described by
McMahan et al. (1984). Much of the Cummins Creek floodplain appears to have been cleared of its

338

original vegetation and placed in cultivation during the historic period. Currently, those former croplands
are pastureland. East of the Cummins Creek floodplain and continuing about 8 miles to just west of F.M.
109, the clayey topsoils in this area may originally have been mostly prairie grassland. Most of this area
is currently pastureland that was probably once under cultivation. Grasses in this area are a combination
of native and introduced species. Continuing eastward, the vegetation is again a Post Oak Woods, Forest
and Grassland Mosaic with sandy soils until the far eastern edge of the project area where prairie pockets
are absent. McMahan et al. (1984) describe this eastern edge of the project area as Post Oak
Woods/Forest.

Figure 140. View of typical eroded upland drainage.
Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area falls very near the eastern edge of what has traditionally been referred to as the Central
Texas Archaeological Region (Collins 1995, Prewitt 1981). More recent divisions, perhaps based in part
on Ellis et. al’s (1995) criticism of the Central Texas concept, would place the project squarely within a
Timbers and Prairies region (texasbeyondhistory.net) that roughly corresponds with what as been termed
the Post Oak Savannah of East Central Texas (Fields 1995). Fields, however, tosses the project area back
to Central Texas and the upper Texas coast, based on disjunction between the more northeastern groups
he focuses on, and on the relative lack of extensive projects west of the Brazos River, which precludes
making meaningful comparisons (Fields 1995:303).
As noted below in the Previous Investigations section, other researchers have attempted to place the area
centered around La Grange in a transitional zone that saw influence from the northeast and east, the
coastal plain, and Central Texas. Examples include ceramics at a Late Archaic site, Late Prehistoric
period Scallorn points associated with ceramics, and suggestions that persons using locally made pottery
had adopted technical aspects of lower Plains Toyah culture. The most notable difference between the
cultural chronology of Central Texas and the Post Oak savannah is lack of well-documented sites
predating the Late Archaic Period, although there seems to have been low population densities and an

339

emphasis on mobile foraging rather than logistical gathering during those times. Likewise, in the Post
Oak Savannah, Late Archaic period peoples appeared to be a bit more sedentary, and are using cultigens
such as squash, but in general remain highly mobile, albeit in a structured (seasonal) fashion and in
reduced territorial ranges. Late Prehistoric peoples, at least in the earlier part of the period, were more
settled in the (Navasota) river valley and used uplands for logistically structured procurement forays.
Meanwhile, Caddoan ceramics have become common, but it is unclear if they are accompanying Caddoan
speakers as they pass through or are a local adaptation.
Coastal influences within the project area are not uncommon. Some marine shells have been found at
various sites, as has asphaltum. The clear exception is at Allens Creek, where burial goods were
influenced by and derived from coastal sources. Site 41AU1 likewise had burials with marine shell
ornaments.
For the sake of simplicity and to create, in effect, a null hypothesis, it is most useful to associate the
project area with the Central Texas chronological tradition. Should exceptions or anomalies appear, they
can be compared with what is known and surmised about the adjacent regions, and interpretations can be
applied accordingly.
Central Texas prehistory has typically been divided into four main subdivisions, known variably as eras
or periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. These subdivisions combine to begin
to describe 11,500 years of history. A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently
been revised by Johnson and Goode (1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based
on climatic and geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins
(1995), who indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and
Goode. The ultimate goal of many modern archaeologists is to transcend the culture history of an area
and attempt to explain why change occurred in various cultures and regions. To this end carefully revised
chronologies are to be expected and encouraged.
Historic Background
The project falls within Fayette County, a small portion of northern Colorado County, and eastern Austin
County. The area was being settled by Anglos as early as the 1820s, and is primarily associated with
Austin’s Colony. In 1828 the Cummins family had established a mill on Mill Creek (Jackson 2002), and
the Rabbs had built one about the same time in what is now Fayette County (Garrett 2002). San Felipe, in
Austin County, was an early economic center. Due in part to Indian conflicts, Fayette County was a bit
slower to develop, although towns such as La Grange, Fayetteville and Round Top had fully formed
school systems by the 1840s. The area was also deeply involved in the Texas Revolution, with Santa Ana
passing through Austin County and both counties providing soldiers.
German settlement Austin County began in earnest in 1838, when J. Freiderich Ernst established the town
of Industry. Germans had already arrived in Fayette County, where the Biegel Settlement was established
sometime after 1832. The Germans raised corn and cotton, and increasingly, tobacco, with cigar factories
at Industry, New Ulm, and Columbus.
German settlement was easily matched by that from the southern United States, and Czechs began
arriving in the 1850s, founding Dubina in 1856. Slaves came in from the south, and large areas were
cleared and planted, much in cotton. Austin County soon was one of the largest slaveholding counties in
the state, and also one of the wealthiest. The mix of slaveholding southerners and the somewhat poorer
and generally slaveless Germans and Bohemians resulted in friction during the Civil War, with Germans
voting decisively against secession and vigorously protesting requirements to serve in the Confederate

340

Army. Fayette County voted against secession, which was defeated narrowly, while nearby Austin
County voted overwhelmingly in favor of secession.
Reconstruction seemed to mark divergent paths for Austin and Fayette counties. Austin County had
received an influx of Black slaves during the Civil War, which permanently changed the racial makeup of
the county. Fayette County, meanwhile, was seeing increasing immigration of Germans, Czechs and
Wends, who bought large lands from now-destitute plantation owners and proceeded to subdivide these
properties. Czech immigration continued to increase during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and
several communities became established, allowing a distinct Texas Czech cultural identity to become
more fully realized. In eastern Austin County, violence against African Americans became routine, and
few crimes were prosecuted. The Freedman’s Bureau aided somewhat and African American churches
and schools became common.
Cotton and corn were still primary crops, tobacco having fallen from favor with the advent of the
railroads. Truck gardening became increasingly common, especially to the east where produce could
easily sold to Houston markets. Tenant farming remained common, and was comprised of both white and
black tenants. Between 1880 and about 1930 close to 47 percent of Austin County’s population served as
tenants. Increasingly, during the first part of the twentieth century, Mexican workers began arriving, and
in Austin County they were the primary immigrants.
Fluctuations in markets and agricultural conditions caused various industries to wax and wane. Cattle
raising became more important. Oil was discovered in Austin County in 1915, but not exploited until
1927. In Fayette County it was not discovered until 1943, when it became an important commodity.
Both counties saw a boom in oil production in the 1990s.
Many of the small towns that the transmission line project passes near, such as Fayetteville, Industry,
New Ulm, and Cat Spring are fairly well documented. Less information was available on New Bremen,
located in Austin County and only about one-quarter mile north of transmission line, it presently consists
of little more than a couple of house located at a crossroads dominated by an auto salvage yard. West of
there, however, is a sign commemorating the location of the New Bremen Colored School, which was
located about one-half mile distant from the New Bremen School. Adjacent to the Colored School is the
Travis Davis Cemetery, which is assumed to be an African American Cemetery, based on its location. At
a distance of about 2.5 miles by road is a small cluster of homes and a church. These houses appear to
date to the 1920s or 1930s, and have been added on to over time. At least some of the residents are
African American. The church is called The Church of God of Prophecy (Figure 141), presumably the
same Pentecostal church that originated in the Appalachian Mountains as a miracle-based congregation in
the 1880s (http://cogop.org/221595.ihtml). This small community was the only coherent aspect of New
Bremen that was seen, and appears to sit on a small sliver of land between large horse ranches. It is
assumed that these homes housed tenant farmers. The property may be the location of slave quarters, or
possibly a small Freedman’s community on donated land.
It was observed that there was a change in land use between Fayette and Austin counties, at least in the
vicinity of the transmission line. Properties in Fayette County tended to be smaller, and cattle production
was dominant. Austin County, meanwhile, had some very large landholdings that focused on horses. It
was evident that large amounts of capital had been invested in some of these. It is likely this is a result of
the greater fragmentation of properties in Fayette County, and to some extent a holdover of plantation
economies in Austin County, although it is also assumed that most of the horse ranches are new wealth
from the Houston area.

Previous Investigations
According to the Historic Texas Sites Atlas, there are presently approximately 100 previously recorded
archaeological sites within a 5 mile radius of the project. Over 60 percent of these are in Fayette County,
which reflects the large amount of work done there, especially around Lake Fayette. The small portion of
Colorado County crossed by the project only had about seven sites within a five mile radius, while Austin
County had the remaining 25-30 percent.
A number of sites have been recorded during systematic projects, which have been both liner and areal in
nature. Information was available on a variety of transmission line projects. In 1979, a survey was
conducted of LCRA’s Bellville South to Waller transmission line. It began at the eastern end of the
present project and ran generally northeastward for about 15 miles. No sites were located, although
provisions were made for the possibility of sites being missed through the limited testing associated with
the project (Pliska 1979).
Also in 1979, the Fayette to Lytton Spring transmission line was surveyed. This began just west of the
present project area and ran for about 60 miles generally west and south west. Thirty-seven prehistoric
sites and 21 historic sites were recorded (Kenmotsu 1980). Prehistoric site types included lithic scatters,
lithic/burned rock scatters, and quarry stations. The scatters were primarily on open sandy knolls and
terrace edges, and only one was found on a creek floodplain. Only three quarry stations were recorded,
suggesting a relative scarcity of suitable gravel deposits. Twelve sites were recommended for “protective
maintenance,” three of these, 41BP176, 41FY165, and 41FY178 after having been tested.
In 1981 the Fayetteville to Glidden transmission line was surveyed. It ran for about 17 miles southward
from Fayetteville. A total of 10 prehistoric sites was recorded, and two were tested (Kenmotsu 1981).
These sites were all located on “sandy alluvial terraces along the margins of ephemeral upland
watercourses” (Kenmotsu 1981: 13) and were considered to represent short-term camps exploiting
seasonal or intermittent upland resources. Sites 41CD80 and 41CD83 were each tested for additional

342

research potential. Neither site was considered to have significant deposits within the ROW, and
remaining sites were considered too disturbed or ephemeral to warrant any additional work.
In 1982, the Fayette to Salem transmission line was surveyed. This ran northwestward from the west end
of the present project for a distance of 25 miles. Two prehistoric sites were recorded, but only limited
shovel probes were excavated. The two sites, 41AU553 and 41FY213, although not considered
significant at the National Register level, were thought to contribute to an “emerging identification of
pattering in prehistoric settlement which emphasized activities and site locations on stream terraces”
(Robinson 1982:9).
In 1989 additional lines between Fayetteville and Salem were surveyed. This project partially paralleled
the present project on the south for about one-third of the western portion before turning north to Salem, a
total distance of about 23 miles, of which about 12.5 miles was considered high probability and was
surveyed (Kotter 1989). A total of 14 sites was recorded, 13 of which were prehistoric. Four of these
sites, 41AU81, 41FY489, 41FY492 and 41WT60 were considered to be potentially eligible and were
recommended for avoidance. The majority of sites were lithic scatters, and it was noted that there was
pronounced absence of sites in clayey soils and in the broad floodplains of Cummins and Mill creeks. At
least one campsite exploited sandstone outcrops present at the site location. Land use on the minor
tributaries was attributed to either lithic procurement or occupations for a “short period of time for a
specific but unknown purpose” (Kotter 1989:47).
Also in 1989 the Winchester to Salem line was surveyed. This 36-mile line paralleled the present project
some distance to the north. About 23 miles was surveyed as high probability areas. A total of 14 sites
was recorded, 13 of which were prehistoric. Site types included lithic scatters, camp sites, and lithic
procurement sites. Both camps were within 50 m of a water source, one on Cummins Creek and on at
Rabbs Creek (Rogers 1990:34). There were only three lithic scatters, once more associated with
unknown extractive activities. Eight sites were lithic procurement areas, which indicates gravel deposits
were relatively common along this transect. Clay soils were once more blamed for what was considered a
relatively low site density.
In 2003 the Salem to Peters transmission line was surveyed. This approximately 40-mile long line ran
north from the eastern end of the present project, and included a double circuited portion of the present
project that runs from Bellville to appoint just south of Mill Creek. A total of 694 shovel tests failed to
find any archaeological sites (Jarvis and Miller 2003). It was felt that the majority of the project was in
non-aggrading pre-Holocene deposits, and that any sites should have been readily visible in upper soil
zones. The heavy clays of the broad Mill Creek floodplain were considered to be unsuitable for
preservation of intact cultural deposits.
Large areal surveys in the vicinity of the project area include those for cooling lakes (Lake Fayette,
Baylor Creek, Allens Creek), a lignite prospect (Cummins Creek) and a proposed reservoir on the
Colorado River. At Allens Creek, roughly 25 miles south of the eastern end of the project, a large
reservoir was surveyed beginning in 1972, resulting in the discovery of thirty-three prehistoric sites,
fifteen of which were recommended for testing (Hall 1981). The results of the testing led to additional
work at three sites, 41AU36, 41AU37 and 41AU38. At 41AU36 a major prehistoric cemetery was
subsequently discovered, and over 230 burials were recorded, many with burial goods. The other two
sites included substantial habitation debris, and at 41AU37, additional burials. Work at this area allowed
inferences on population trends through time to be developed, and also clearly demonstrated sophisticated
interactions between coastal and more central areas of Texas.
The Fayette Power Project resulted in survey of Lake Fayette and surrounding area, with a focus on the
2400-acre Cedar Creek Lake Fayette portion (Skelton 1977). Approximately 60 sites have been recorded

343

at various times since 1975. Six of these were excavated, including a single event bison kill.
Additionally, archival information was gathered on the Biegel Settlement, a largely German endeavor
started in 1832 (Carter and Ragsdale 1975). This report also documented the impact, through
displacement, the Fayette Power project would have on the local community and descendents of the early
settlers.
Cummins Creek, to the north, was at one time slated to become a lignite coal mine that was to provide
fuel for the Fayette power plant. The 13,000 acres associated with this project resulted in the recording of
56 prehistoric sites and 34 historic sites (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). The general area was
hypothesized as a transitional zone between coastal, eastern and central Texas cultural areas. It was also
suggested that resource availability in part determined site distribution and structure, with longer term
camps along Rabbs Creek and its spring-fed tributaries, and lithic procurement areas associated more
with Cummins Creek, which had more readily available raw lithic resources. These site distributions
would remain constant through time, if the resources themselves remained constant. Twenty prehistoric
sites were recommended for additional work to help address these questions. Various historic resources
were also recommended for National Register evaluation. An additional 77 prehistoric sites were
recorded 1983 during survey of an additional 23,000 acres. Forty-nine of these were recommended for
additional work (Nightengale et. al 1985). A management plant (Kotter et. al 1987) was developed to
further aid in addressing expanded research goals based on limited additional testing and mitigation;
however, the mine project was dropped by LCRA, and the additional work was no longer fundable.
Despite this, it was demonstrated that camp sites in the area trend towards creek side environments,
typically just below the crest of an interfluvial divide. Interesting initial findings, such as sandy paste
pottery at Late Archaic site 41FY326 and an apparent single component Scallorn site with higher quality
ceramics remain unaddressed.
In 1983 a proposed reservoir on the Colorado River at Columbus Bend, downstream from the project
area, was surveyed, resulting in the recording of 96 sites, most of which were prehistoric (Keller and
Campbell 1984), who developed a predictive model of site location. It was determined that the Colorado
floodplain was unlikely to contain near-surface sites, except on topographic ridges and relict features, and
that terraces and ridges near tributary drainages and other water resources at higher elevations were more
likely to contain prehistoric sites.
A pair of sites was excavated in the mid 1970s at the intersection of State Highway 71 and Cedar Creek
very near the western end of the present project. Site 41FY25, the Black Hopper Site, on the south side of
the creek, had mixed deposits and hearths with primarily Archaic-aged tools as well as a small number of
Scallorn points (Fullem 1977). It was suggested that during the Archaic period the site was at a juncture
of central, eastern and coastal peoples, based on characteristic traits of the stone tools, whereas the later
Scallorn occupation was now within a distinct cultural zone. The very small sample size of the Scallorn
assemblage (n=4) was recognized, but the hypothesis coincided with (or shaped) that of other researchers.
It clearly carried over into work at Cummins Creek.
Immediately across Cedar Creek from the Black Hopper Site was the Sandbur Site, 41FY135 (Kalter et.
al 2005). This site included Paleoindian points including an apparent Clovis preform, Folsom, Dalton,
Firstview and others, as well as “Angostura-like” points that have recently been a subject of interest
(TxArch archives) and numerous other Archaic-aged tools. However, it was only the late Prehistoric
Perdiz component that was felt to be intact. The Perdiz points were suggestive of “Classic Toyah,” while
the ceramics seemed to represent a more eastern tradition, with petrographic analysis showing production
on local clays and qualitative characteristics similar to other sites on the Backland Prairie and Coastal
Plains. If the stone toolkit and ceramic assemblage were manufactured by the same people, the argument
appears to be that it was a Toyah stone toolkit that had been adopted by a regionalized group, perhaps

344

including the Sanan, of eastern Texas, rather than plains Toyah people having infiltrated that far east
(Kalter et. al 2005 :219, 220).
Site 41AU1 was located about 1 km downstream from the T-216 crossing of Mill Creek, according to the
online Historic Texas Sites Atlas. Recorded in 1959, it consisted of at least 20, and possibly as many as
26 prehistoric burials associated with marine shell ornaments. Other reported artifacts included Pandale
points, Perdiz points, and ceramic sherds. The site had been heavily damaged and mostly destroyed, and
apparently Mill Creek had been channelized in that area. The site setting was very similar to that of the
upstream transmission line crossing – the junction of a small stream and the larger Mill Creek. As noted
above, survey and shovel tests by Hicks and Co. in 2003 found no sites on that portion of the transmission
line.
Site 41AU83 was recorded in 1995 prior to construction of the New Bremen substation. On the Historic
Texas Sites Atlas it is described as a very light prehistoric lithic scatter and a scatter of historic debris
associated with a house once located upslope. The site was felt to have very low research potential and
no further investigations were recommended. This site was not revisited during the present survey.
In 2004 LCRA Archaeology Services conducted reconnaissance survey for regularly scheduled
maintenance (tree trimming, shredding) along the transmission line (Hixson et. al 2006). Historic site
41FY546, a cluster of farm implements along the edge of the ROW, was recorded at that time. It was
near an old farm complex that could not be recorded due to its location outside the ROW.
Recommendations were for avoidance due to the unknown nature of the remainder of the site. This site
essentially overlaps site 41FY552, recorded during the present survey, but is left separate for management
purposes. Site 41FY546 was not formally revisited, although it was examined and no changes were
noted. Recommendations remain unchanged.
Summary of Previous Investigations
Previous work in the area allows a number of variables to be considered in prospecting unknown territory.
Lithic scatters seem to be quite common, and are often located near fairly small streams. Larger sites that
are clearly camps are much less frequent, while lithic procurement seems to be coincident with the
occurrence of gravels. Procurement gravels may be more common to the north of the project area. A
variety of resources seems to have pushed exploitation zones away from some of the larger streams, such
as Cummins Creek, which despite their size are intermittent and certainly lack the clear spring water seen
on a number of very small streams during the present project. Additionally, previous work is in fairly
close agreement about the preference for sites to be located in sandy soils, and a general lack of sites in
clay soils, regardless of setting. Sandy sites, meanwhile, are subject to disturbances, especially through
the burrowing of rodents, creating problems with site integrity.
Historic sites could date to the 1830s. Very early sites would likely be of German or southern heritage,
and slave activities could be represented. Later sites could exhibit Czech influence. Small farmsteads are
almost as likely to be tenant farms as not.

Research Design and Field Methods
The project was designed to identify sites along the previously unsurveyed portions of the transmission
line and assess the potential of any such sites for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks or
National Register eligibility. In order to facilitate and structure the field work, a map review of
previously recorded sites conducted. Geological maps and soils data was examined, and physiographic
information was extrapolated from topographic maps. From this high probability areas (HPAs) were

345

determined, and a rating system devised to further refine the HPAs. The factors were based primarily on
geology, with Holocene floodplain terraces receiving a high rating; proximity to water sources, with
larger streams adjacent to well-defined terraces or interfluvial divides rated higher; and soils, which when
divided by clays, loams, and sand, were rated from low to high, respectively. Additionally, some soils
were described as having buried A horizons, for which additional points were added. Thus, stream-side
terraces with sandy soils containing buried A horizons would have a very high rating, while upland
divides with clay soils far from water sources would have a very low probability rating. These ratings
were tempered by field observations. As an example, 41FY554 was not within a proposed HPA, due
primarily to shallow mapped soils and distance from a major water source, but when approaching it from
the Cummins Creek HPA, it was obvious this landform needed to be tested, and indeed, a site was located
there. Other exceptions resulted from analysis of historic maps, which were georeferenced with modern
topographic maps and imagery, and the project then overlaid. Due to alignment issues associated with
differing scales, datums, and coordinate systems, structures mapped near the line were considered
candidates for being within the area of effect. In actuality, ground truthing demonstrated that plots from
early maps fell very closely to the modern interpolation, and no structures appear to be within the
transmission line corridor.
Field work was conducted by crews of two to five archaeologists walking meandering transects within the
transmission line ROW. Shovel tests were placed both systematically and judgmentally within proposed
and expanded HPAs. These tests were excavated in arbitrary 20 cm levels and screened through ¼
hardware cloth. The HPA calculations also indicated the single, unsurveyed broad Holocene floodplain at
Cummins Creek would be primarily heavy clay soils with potentially deep horizons. It was anticipated
that the preceding hot, dry summer would make hand testing of this landform impractical, if not
impossible. In this, and a couple of other select settings, a skidsteer mounted with a hydraulic 12 inch (30
cm) auger was employed. Vertical control is more difficult, so it was used mostly for a presence/absence
determination.
All test locations were recorded on GPS and transcribed later to GIS. Records include sketch maps, field
notes, and shovel test records. Ground orientation was by USGS topographic maps and aerial imagery.
All artifacts were analyzed in the field and returned to their findspots. Sites were later documented on the
standardized TexSite database and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research laboratory (TARL)
where permanent trinomials were assigned. This project is reported here as an interim report under the
terms of LCRA TAC Annual Permit No. 4779, and a final report will be included in the year-end report
of investigations submitted to the Texas Historical Commission.

Results of Investigations
Ten previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented as a result of this project. Nine were
prehistoric, and one was a historic trash scatter. These ten sites, as well as two previously recorded sites,
are discussed briefly below. Sketch map figures for each are included at the end of this section.
41FY552 (Figure 142)
Site 41FY552 is an extensive but discontinuous lithic scatter containing chipping debris, burned chert and
quartzite, and at least one tool. It is located in far northeastern Fayette County across a broad interfluvial
lobe between Cliff Creek and another unnamed left bank tributary of Cummins Creek, which is about 700
m to the southeast. It is in Knolle loamy sand that formed on the tertiary Fleming formation, which is
primarily clay and sandstone.
The Willow Springs substation, owned by Fayette Electric Coop, sits on the high point of the divide, and
roughly marks the site center. The densest part of the site is located east of the substation. A shovel test

346

(ST 3) and three auger tests (ATs 21-23) were placed at about 50 m intervals. Only the shovel test had
substantial recovery, with about 120 pieces of chert debitage, mostly interior flakes with a very few pieces
of burned or shattered chert. About one-half of the material was within the upper 20 cm, the remainder in
the 40 cm below. A chert core and a small biface fragment were recovered from between 40 and 60 cm.
The soil profile consisted of about 40 cm of grayish-brown sandy loam that became mottled with orangish
clay below 40 cm, grading to sandy clay below 50 cm. The three auger tests had much less in the way of
recovery, (AT 21 was negative, and the other two had a total of 17 flakes and chips between them).
Profiles were similar, with clay encountered between 20 and 60 cm. Although the area around ST 3
seemed to have darker surface soil, possibly indicating a higher organic content, this entire half of the site
had been subjected to intensive agricultural terracing. Further to the east, the sands gave way to dark
clays along the Cliff Creek terrace, and erosional features in this area and the creek banks showed no
evidence of cultural materials.
To the west of the substation there was less evidence of ground disturbance (terracing), but five auger
tests (ATs 16 - 20) found only five chips, and three of the tests were negative. The sandy soils did not
exceed about 30 cm in depth before clays were encountered. As the western edge of the site was reached
soils disappeared completely, replaced by cobbly clay. A couple of tested cobles and one semi-formal
scaper were seen in this area.
Along the fenced west edge of the substation was a very light scatter of historic materials that consisted of
three or four white ceramics and some thick brown glass. This may be associated with a structure seen on
the 1919 Fayetteville quad, which appears to have been located to the north, out of the ROW. This
historic scatter is considered to be destroyed by substation construction, and so is not considered to be a
formal component to 41FY552. Also, corresponding with the western edge of 41FY552 is previously
recorded 41FY546, a collection of farm implements within the ROW associated with an obviously old
ranch or farmstead (outside the ROW), also present on the 1919 map. This site is kept separate for
management purposes.
Site 41FY552 is a lithic scatter and possible open campsite located on a sandy ridge above a permanent
water source. A small area of higher activity is present on the eastern portion of the site in the vicinity of
ST 3. However, extensive contouring of the landform has resulted in disturbances that would make any
further conclusions highly suspect. The portion of the site within the ROW is considered to be fully
documented and not eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended within the existing transmission
line corridor.

41FY553 (Figure 143)
Site 41FY553 is a light historic trash scatter on the left bank of Cliff Creek, just east of 41FY552. Cliff
Creek is aptly named, as the banks are steep and perhaps 30 ft above the creek channel. Deep erosional
gullies have formed along the bank. Within these gullies and for about 200m eastwards into cleared
pasture is a diffuse scatter of white stoneware, dark green glass, thick dark brown glass, a single piece of
purple glass, and nails, including apparent forged, cut and wire nails. No structures were mapped there in
1919, although there are some within 500 to 1,000 m, and some of these are still on the modern USGS
quad.
This appears to be an incidental trash dump, but there may have once been much more along the noweroded creek banks. The mixture of probable pre-1880s material with that dating much later in time may
represent various disposal events, or a single event associated with cleanup elsewhere. Regardless, there
is little to no interpretive potential at this site, and it is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State

347

Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is
recommended within the existing transmission line corridor.
41FY554 (Figure 144)
Site 41FY554 is a buried lithic and burned rock scatter located on a sandy lobe overlooking the Cummins
Creek floodplain to the east. It is within mapped Straber loamy fine sand on the early Pleistocene Willis
formation, which consists of gravel, sand, silt and clay. The site was defined by four shovel tests (STs 47) and an auger test (AT 2). The three positive tests had no more than 12 flakes each, but up to 90 pieces
of fire fractured chert and quartzite. These were almost exclusively very small, no more than one or two
cm in any one dimension. Soils consisted of about 30 cm of gravelly and sandy loams over sandy clay or
gravels. Within the ROW, the site is about 100 m in length.
The site is interpreted as a probable open campsite located in well-drained sandy soils overlooking the
heavy dark clays of the lower Cummins Creek floodplain. Within the ROW, the lack of soil depth, lack
of temporal or functional diagnostics, and the overall disturbed nature of the open pasture severely limit
the interpretive potential of the site. It is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is
recommended within the existing transmission line corridor.
41FY555 (Figure 145)
Site 41FY555 is a very discrete buried lithic scatter located on an apparent levee formation adjacent to an
overflow (and probable relict) channel of Cummins Creek. It is within Degola loam in recent alluvium.
Degola soils are described as potentially having three sequential A horizons to a depth of about 1 m, with
weathered B horizons extending to a depth of about 2 m.
The broad floodplain where the site is located becomes marshy east of the site, and immediately to the
west is a low swale which is bordered by another apparent (and older) levee. The two formations are
separated by about 140 m. Two auger tests (ATs 7, 8) were placed within the site. Both were sterile until
a depth of 60 cm, when small amounts of lithic debitage and burned shatter were recovered to a final
depth of 130 cm. Greatest recovery was between 80 and 100 cm (although there was only a total of five
chips or flakes and 14 pieces of burned shatter). Notably, the soil profile consists of brown to very dark
gray sandy clay, but at about 80 cm became a gray sandy clay loam, consistent with the NRCS description
of stratified gray to white sandy clay loam lower layers.
No tests were placed in the swale to the west, and an auger test on the next levee (or terrace edge) was
negative. The site is therefore interpreted as a discrete scatter of lithic debitage and burned rock, possibly
marking an open camp that was likely once on a relatively well drained bank of Cummins Creek.
Subsurface materials may be intact, and final depth of soil or cultural material remains unknown. It is
therefore recommended that this narrow (25 m wide) ridge be avoided by any construction activities that
would impact soils below a depth of 50 cm (about 2 ft). In other words, no structure should be placed
here. If that is not possible, then additional subsurface investigations (most likely by backhoe) are
warranted in order to determine if archaeological materials are present that could be eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
41AU90 (Figure 146)
Site 41AU90 is a buried lithic scatter located in a discrete lobe that is part of a ridge system overlooking
Black Walnut Creek to the west. A smallish tributary parallels the site to the south. The site is in the
Tertiary clay and sandstone Fleming formation, and within mapped Catilla loamy fine sands. These
upland soils can be 40 to 70 in thick, and have a subsoil consisting of light yellowish brown to light gray
sandy clay loam.

348

The site was defined by five shovel tests (STs 13-15, 17, 18), four of which were positive. Shovel tests
13, 14, and 15 all had very light recovery, consisting of a total of 12 chip or flakes between them.
However, recovery started at 40 cm and continued to 100. Shovel Test 17 had a single chip in the upper
20 cm, and is not considered to be part of the site. The soil profile within the site was consistent with the
soils description, with yellowish brown sandy loam to light gray loamy sand encountered to the maximum
depth allowed by hand testing. The tests on either side of the site had mottled sandy loams grading to
sandy clays at depths no greater than 50 cm.
The site is interpreted as a lithic scatter and possible open camp that follows an apparent trend of favoring
well-drained sandy ridges overlooking streams rather than lower and generally more clayey stream banks
for active use areas. The relatively small amount of material shows no ready vertical patterning, and the
soils have been highly turbated by animal activities. Additionally, the lack of tools or evidence of
features makes any worthwhile additional investigations at this site highly improbable. 41AU91 is not
considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended within the existing transmission line
corridor.
41AU91 (Figure 147)
Site 41AU91 is a buried lithic scatter located directly west of 41AU90, on the other side of Black Walnut
Creek. It is within the same Catilla fine sandy loam. The site is located on the early Pleistocene Willis
formation, formed of gravel, sand, silt and clay.
The site was defined by seven shovel tests (STs 16 19-21, 36, 37) with the last, ST37, falling outside the
site’s western boundary. The eastern boundary was determined through observation of thinning soils and
erosional exposures towards Black Walnut Creek. Recovery was relatively moderate, with a total of
about 50 flakes and chips and a very few pieces of burned material recovered from the six positive tests
(although only two were recovered from the westernmost, ST36, and ST16, on the center of the lobe in
the eastern portion of the site had about 12 flakes per 20 cm level). Recovery was fairly consistent
throughout the soil column, which ranged from about 60 cm of fine sandy loam over mottled sandy clay
to 100 or 120 cm of fine sandy loam (no subsoil encountered).
The site, like 41AU90, is interpreted as a lithic scatter and possible open camp that follows an apparent
trend of favoring well-drained sandy ridges overlooking streams rather than lower and generally more
clayey stream banks for active use areas. The relatively small amount of material shows no ready vertical
patterning, and the soils have been highly turbated by animal activities. Additionally, the lack of tools or
evidence of features makes any worthwhile additional investigations at this site highly improbable. Site
41AU91 is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended within the existing
transmission line corridor.
41AU92 (Figure 149)
41AU92 is a buried lithic scatter located on a broad sloping terrace between two right bank tributaries of
Sandy Creek, which in this area has formed a narrow Holocene floodplain. The site, however, is in the
early Pleistocene sand, silt gravel and clay Willis formation overlooking the younger floodplain. Soils are
of the Tremona loamy fine sand series, a deep upland soil that can be very gravelly and grade to gray
sandy clays and white sandy clay loam below 20-40 in.
The site was defined by four shovel tests, STs 23-26, with the last outside the site to the west. Further
west, a drainage with excellent visibility in erosional features had no evidence of cultural materials, and
previous testing to the east (ST9), in the vicinity of Sandy Creek found no evidence of cultural material.
Only STs 23 and 24 were positive for cultural material. Shovel Test 23, placed near an isolated surface

349

artifact (a small core) had two chips in Level 1 then no recovery until Levels 4 and 5, where a total of
nine small chips and a small biface edge were covered. Shovel Test 24 had a single chip in Level 1. Soils
were a mottled yellowish-brown fine sandy loam that encountered consolidated orangish clay or heavy
clay mottling at 90, 30, 65, and 70 cm, respectively.
Site 41AU92 is felt to have very limited research potential within the ROW, and is considered fully
investigated. It is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended within the
existing transmission line corridor.
41AU93 (Figure 150)
Site 41AU93 is a buried lithic scatter on the edge of a dissected ridge over looking Sandy Creek to the
west. It is within Straber loamy fine sands that formed in the Willis formation. The site was defined by
three shovel tests (STs 40-41) with ST42 defining the eastern boundary and the sloping landform defining
the western boundary in that direction.
The site appears to be centered on the area where ST 41 was excavated, which is a low rise near the edge
of the lobed ridge. Two chips were recovered from Level 1 and a chunk and a chip from Level 3. Shovel
Test 40 had two flake fragments and a fragment of a crude uniface. Soils were deepest at ST 41, with
light yellowish brown fine sandy loam grading to dark brown fine sandy loam at about 50 cm, and fairly
dense manganese concretions appearing at depth. The other two tests had no more than about 30 cm of
sandy soil over sandy clays.
The site is a discrete occurrence of buried cultural material, however there is little chance of there being
additional research potential within the ROW. 41AU93 is considered fully investigated. It is not
considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended within the existing transmission line
corridor.
41AU94 (Figure 150)
Site 41AU94 is another very isolated lithic scatter located immediately west of 41AU93, on the opposite
side of Sandy Creek. Soils are mapped as Bosque clay loam, although the shovel tests suggest it is more
likely the Newulm loamy fine sand which is found immediately to the west. The site is on the mapped
boundary of the Willis and Fleming formation. The site was defined by two shovel tests (STs 43 –
positive; and 44 – negative) and exposures of Sandy Creek to the east.
Recovery was limited to a single chip in Level 1 and a single chip in Level 2. The profile in both tests
was similar, with about 20 cm of light brown sandy loam transitioning through mottled yellowish-brown
sandy loam that became yellowish brown sandy loam below 40 cm and continued to final depths of 100
cm. Absolute soil depth remains unknown.
This minor lithic scatter is considered fully documented within the ROW. It is not considered eligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places. No further work is recommended within the existing transmission line corridor.
41AU95 (Figure 150)
Site 41AU95 consists of a single secondary flake found in ST 32 and two chips and a small core fragment
found in ST 30. It is within Straber loamy fine sands in the Fleming formation. An additional test placed
to the east (ST31) and examination of the sloping landform and excavation of ST33 to the west failed to
find additional material. The site is located on an extended interfluvial lobe between two short left bank
tributaries of Dry Creek.

350

Shovel Test 32 found the secondary flake at a depth of about 100 cm, resting on sandy clay at the bottom
of light yellowish brown and light brown fine sandy loams. Shovel Test 30 had a chip in Level 1 and
another chip and the core fragment in Level 4. Some weathered bone fragments were recovered from
Levels 1 and 2, but these cannot be assigned to any time period. The soil profile in the three tests on the
lobe consisted of loamy fine sand sands to depths of 70, 50, and 100 cm, respectively. Shovel Test 33,
placed near the westernmost drainage, had only 10 cm of light brown fine sandy loam over mottled
orange and sandy clay.
41AU95 is considered fully documented within the ROW. It is not considered eligible for formal listing
as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No further
work is recommended within the existing transmission line corridor.
Previously Recorded Sites
Site 41AU83 was recorded in 1995 prior to construction of the New Bremen substation. On the Historic
Texas Sites Atlas it is described as a very light prehistoric lithic scatter and a scatter of historic debris
associated with a house once located upslope. The site was felt to have very low research potential and
no further investigations were recommended. This site was not revisited during the present survey.
In 2004 LCRA Archaeology Services conducted reconnaissance survey for regularly scheduled
maintenance (tree trimming, shredding) along the transmission line (Hixson et. al 2006). Historic site
41FY546, a cluster of farm implements along the edge of the ROW, was recorded at that time. It was
near an old farm complex that could not be recorded due to its location outside the ROW.
Recommendations were for avoidance due to the unknown nature of the remainder of the site. This site
essentially overlaps site 41FY552, recorded during the present survey, but is left separate for management
purposes. Site 41FY546 was not formally revisited, although it was examined and no changes were
noted. Recommendations remain unchanged.
Other Areas
Cummins Creek Floodplain
The Cummins Creek floodplain was explored systematically through mechanical augering, although
visual analysis of the general landform indicated that the low lying, heavy clay soils were not conducive
to preservation of cultural resource sites, or prehistoric settlement, for that matter. As noted in the
previous investigations section, other researchers in the area have made similar comments.
Cummins/Mill Creek Divide
This was the most uplandish portion of the project, and was spot checked accordingly. Despite a small
spring seen at Willow Branch (of Poplar Creek) there was no evidence of archaeological materials within
the highly visible soils. The east side of Poplar Creek was low and boggy, and was considered to be of
low probability. These were the last streams on the Cummins Creek side of the divide. The first stream
associated with the Mill Creek drainage was the headwaters of Pastoren Creek. This section was not
surveyed.
Elsewhere, especially in Austin County, extremely fine loamy sands had extensive rodent burrowing
which provided excellent proxy subsurface visibility. At least two sites were located through artifacts
within backdirt piles. However, sites were also located in areas where such backdirt piles had no artifacts,
but these were very minor lithic scatters. Such burrowing remains a good way to locate sites with larger
artifact assemblages.

351

Discussion
A number of previous studies indicated that lithic scatter not associated with raw material procurement
activities are commonly at some distance from water. These distances were not quantified, however. For
the newly recorded prehistoric sites, the distance from water, both linear and elevational, was measured,
using either the site centroid or activity nucleus as the spot from which distances were measured. The
appropriate USGS quad maps were used for elevations, although GIS-based stream data from TexDOT
superseded the USGS map as the nearest water source. The distance and change in elevation allowed an
index to be established, which is equivalent to the percentage of the slope (Table 28).
The average distance from water is 132 m, the average change is elevation is 9 m, and the average slope is
7.2 percent. Although no clear patterns emerge form this comparison, the outlier, 41FY555, does stand
out both for distance from and elevation above water. However, this site probably once fronted Cummins
Creek, and so may be non-representative. Otherwise it is still remarkable that no site was closer than 60
m from a water source. Post depositional factors such as floods may account for this, but also past
environmental conditions, such was vegetation and perhaps mosquitoes may also play a role.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA propose to rebuild the existing Fayetteville to Bellville South (T-216) transmission line located in
Fayette, Colorado and Austin counties. The 28-mile long line is within an average 85 ft-wide ROW,
resulting in a total of approximately 288 acres. The extreme eastern three miles, between what is referred
to as the Bellville Split and the Bellville South substation was previously surveyed by Hicks and
Company for a similar project. No archeological sites were recorded as a result of that investigation, and
the project was allowed to proceed. This section was not resurveyed.

The remaining 25 miles was assessed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff, with a focus on high
probability areas that were determined by a combination of factors including underlying geology, soils,
terrain, and historic maps tempered by field observations. Just over 10 miles was intensively surveyed.
A total of 68 subsurface tests was excavated, about 40 percent of the recommended minimum for that
length. This number is felt to be sufficient based on large areas of excellent visibility, examination of
exposures such as erosional cuts and especially extensive burrowing by rodents in sandy soils, as well as

352

the demonstrated general lack of sites in broad clay-filled floodplains similar to that encountered at
Cummins Creek.
Ten previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented as a result of the investigation. Two
previously recorded sites were not formally revisited (Table 29).
Sites 41FY552, 554, 555 and 41AU90-95 are all prehistoric lithic scatters with varying amounts of firecracked rock. These are low density scatters, with the exceptions of 41FY552 and 41FY554, which both
contain moderates amounts of materials. All the newly recorded prehistoric sites except for 41FY555 are
in sandy soils and have been highly disturbed and/or contain so little in the way of visible cultural
material as to make additional investigations of little value. These sites are considered fully recorded
within the ROW and ineligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41FY555 appears to be an exception to the sandy site premise. It is located on a low terrace remnant
or levee formation on the south side of Cummins Creek. Cultural materials were recovered from depths
below 60 cm, with the majority of material between 80 and 100 cm. This site may have structural
integrity, and therefore possibly has additional research value. Until such potential can be discounted, it
should be considered potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark and/or
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. This site is recommended for avoidance by deep
soil disturbance (i.e., structure placement). If the site cannot be avoided than additional investigations are
warranted.
Site 41FY553 is an historic trash scatter located in a pasture adjacent to a steep-walled creek. Although
some materials may predate the 1880s, others are clearly from the twentieth century. This ephemeral
dump is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark and/or nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places.

Previously recorded site 41FY546 is a cluster of farm implements associated with a nearby farmstead that
almost certainly predates 1900. The implements themselves are not considered particularly significant,
but their association with the otherwise unknown farmstead is sufficient to warrant their avoidance by
construction impacts. Their location in a group of low oak trees on the extreme edge of the ROW should
not hinder transmission line construction.

353

Previously recorded site 41AU83 was a multicomponent site consisting of a light lithic scatter and
historic trash. This site, which was determined ineligible, was recorded previous to construction of the
New Bremen substation, and is now considered destroyed within the ROW.
This survey was useful in that produced additional, largely confirmative information about prehistoric
settlement in this part of the Colorado and Brazos river valleys. Additional work in the area should
consider the potential for more substantive sites to be located in upland zones that are relatively distant
from major water sources. Such sites, if functional or time diagnostic implements are found, could help
continue to address major research questions that have been previously posed.

Management Summary:
A planned upgrade of a 1.91 mile section of LCRA electrical transmission line between the Verde Creek
and Raymond F. Barker substations, Kerr County, Texas (Figure 151), will involve replacing existing
lattice towers with single cement or metal pole structures. These are placed within holes (direct embed)
or upon cement foundations poured into holes between 4 and 8 ft in diameter and 15 to 25 ft deep. New
structures will be typically placed within 50 ft of existing structures. The modifications will not change
the current 100-ft right-of-way width or alignment. Total project area is approximately 23 acres.
The project area has been previously surveyed. First in 1981 during initial construction (Moncure 1981)
and then in 2003 prior to another upgrade planned at that time (Malof 2003, Malof et. al 2005). Three
sites, 41KR200, 41KR602 and 41KR603 are located within the present project area. Site 41KR200 was
recommended for partial avoidance when recorded in 1981. Sites 41KR602 and 41KR603 were
considered ineligible when recorded in 2003. The present project therefore focused on 41KR200, and on
the broad floodplain south of the Guadalupe River which was not considered to be fully investigated.
Field work was conducted on November 6, 2008, by a crew consisting of LCRA archaeologist Andrew
Malof and subcontractors George Thomas, Christine Gauger, and Patrick Hatten. The crew dug six
shovel tests in all. The tests on site 41 KR 200 were both 50 cm in diameter and controlled by 10 cm.
levels. Elsewhere the tests were approximately 30 cm. in diameter and controlled by 20 cm. levels. Soil
color and texture were recorded for each shovel test profile. Artifacts were recorded by level and
morphology and returned to the shovel tests during backfilling. As no artifacts were collected no curation
will be necessary. Due to the nature and extent of previous investigations and reports the short format
report as suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines is used here.

Study Area
The project area is in eastern Kerr County. The Raymond F. Barker and Verde Creek substations are both
located in Glen Rose Formation limestone north and south, respectively, of the Guadalupe River. The
river at this location has formed a Holocene-aged fluviatile terrace some 1.3 km wide. North of the river
this terrace is in active cultivation. There are some very large sand and gravel operations present a couple
of miles to the west, and a smaller pit is also present immediately west of the transmission line. To the
south of the river the terrace is enclosed by a high game fence. Exotic game is kept on large ranch here.
The pasture was almost certainly once under cultivation as well. Online SSURGO data shows
terrace/floodplain soils as Barbarosa and Oakalla silty clay loam as well as a narrow strip of Boerne fine
sandy loam along the southern river bank.

Research Design
The project required a combination of a review of previous projects and field investigations. The area for
field work was at 41KR200, which because it can no longer be avoided, required additional evaluation,
and across a broad (about 400 m under the transmission line) floodplain terrace south of the Guadalupe
River which does not appear to ever have been shovel tested, although it had been walked over in 2003.
Combined, these areas contain three transmission lattice support structures numbered 104, 105 and 106.
Work was designed to make a definitive decision of the integrity and research value of site 41KR200 and
to identify and evaluate any other previously unrecorded sites on the southern floodplain that might be
affected by the transmission line upgrade project. All other areas were considered to be fully investigated
by previous surveys, and no additional work or revisits to sites 41KR602 and 41KR603 were conducted.

Results
The 1.91 mile section to be upgraded crosses the Guadalupe River approximately one mile upstream
(west) of the town of Center Point. At the crossing location the transmission line bisects previouslyrecorded prehistoric site 41 KR 200 above the north bank on the second terrace (Moncure 1981: 19-20).
The site is impacted by tower structure 106, low-density vehicular traffic, a recently-formed gravel
vehicle trail leading to two warehouse structures, and a borrow pit immediately below.
Shovel testing at and near structure 105, on the south bank terrace of the Guadalupe River, led to the
identification of a new site (41KR674) on the terrace edge and on both sides of the road leading eastward
to Center Point.
Additional shovel testing was conducted at structure 104, located at the southern edge of the broad
southern terrace. No artifacts were recovered.
41KR674
Site 41KR674 is located on the first stable terrace south of the Guadalupe River (Figures 152, 153). It is
covered in dense coastal Bermuda grass, and drops abruptly into the active floodplain of the river just
north of STR 105. Three shovel tests were excavated, the first (ST 3) just south of the structure, the
second (ST 4) at the lattice structure center, and the third (ST 5) in open pasture on the south side of the
road.

terrace edge.
Shovel Test 3 was located at STR 105, south of the Guadalupe River between the structure and the road
leading into the town of Center Point. Here the test passed through 18 cm. of road gravels before
reaching undisturbed, light-brown silty loam, with a deposit of water-rolled gravels at 80 cm. An edgemodified uniface fragment, a chert flake and chert fragments were located between 20 and 40 cm. in
depth. There was no other recovery.
Shovel Test 4 was placed at the center of Structure 105, a short distance north of the road and away from
the modern road gravel deposit. Here several chert chunks and a mussel shell fragment were mingled

375

376

with brown glass sherds in the upper 20 cm. One chunky flake was in the second 20 cm, and a wire nail
was located between 40 and 60 cm. in depth, just above the river gravel layer at 60 cm. Shovel Test 5
was located across the road and south of Shovel Test 4, across a game fence and gate. It yielded two
chert flake fragments between 20 and 40 cm in depth in brown, silty loam overlying river gravels at 70
cm. There was no other recovery.
Elsewhere, a single chert core was seen in disturbed soil along the fence boundary on the south side of the
road. No other artifacts were noted.
41KR674 is a light lithic scatter in disturbed context. It is considered to be to be fully documented and
ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of
Historic places.
41KR200
Special attention was paid to 41KR200, which was recommended for partial avoidance prior to
transmission line construction (Figures 154, 155). Shovel tests were 50 cm in diameter and excavated in
10 cm levels in order to develop a greater level of control than typical 30-40 cm diameter testes excavated
in 20 cm levels. The first test (ST 1) was placed adjacent to the end of the presumed location of the
previous backhoe trench (Moncure 1981: Figure 6). Recovery was moderate, with the greatest recovery
between 30 and 40 cm, where 32 flake fragments were recovered along with two relatively large pieces of
burned limestone. The only tool that was recovered was a burned edge modified flake from Level 1. The
profile was 16 cm of dark yellowish brown heavy clay loam over 7 cm of dark brown heavy clay loam
followed by yellowish brown sandy clay then dense limestone cobbles in sandy clay (Figure 156). The
test was excavated to a final depth of 50 cm. The soils and artifact profile is consistent with the profile
from Moncure’s trench as well as the mapped Barbarosa series soils.
Shovel Test 2 was placed on the edge of the ROW where it was perceived the site may have been more
intact or dense. Level 4 once more had the greatest recovery, with 29 flake fragments, a core fragment,
an edge modified flake, two large hard hammer flakes, and a small amount of burned rock. An apparent
biface fragment was recovered from Level 3, and there were 25 small flake fragments in Level 1. Soils
were once again consistent with the mapped Barbarosa series.
While working at the structure the crew was approached by the new landowner. He was well aware of the
presence of the site, and had been informed that an “Indian mound” had been bulldozed and spread across
the surrounding pasture by the previous owner, accounting for the widespread occurrence of
archaeological materials. He also pointed westward and mentioned a spring where apparently much more
material has been located.
Based on recovery from the shovel tests, the conversation with the landowner and Moncure’s somewhat
ambiguous recommendation that the backhoe trench had “no clear stratigraphic integrity…and [t]he vast
majority of the site [was] located outside the corridor” (Moncure 1981:36) site 41KR200 is considered to
be largely destroyed, at least within the ROW. The portion within the ROW is therefore now considered
to be fully documented and ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places.

Structure 104
Structure 104 s located at the southern edge of a large pasture that forms the same terrace as that which
contains 41KR674. It is located at the base of limestone-based hills that extend for the remainder of the
project in that direction. A single shovel test was excavated within the mapped Oakalla series soil. It had
40 cm of dark brown loam, over another 40 cm of brownish clay or heavy clay loam. The test was
terminated at a depth of 80 cm. No artifacts were recovered. No more work is recommended at this
structure location
Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to rebuild a 1.91 mi section of transmission line between the existing Raymond F. Barker
and Verde Creek substations in eastern Kerr County, Texas. The project will require replacement of

379

existing lattice towers with new single pole structures, typically within 50 ft of the old one. The line has
been surveyed and assessed at various times, most notably during the original construction phase
(Moncure 1981) and then in 2003 as part of a larger rebuild project (Malof 2003, Malof et. al 2005). All
previous work within the presently proposed project area had been cleared, including at sites 41KR602
and 41KR603. Site 41KR200 has been recommended for avoidance during maintenance and upgrade
projects.
Site 41KR200 was reinvestigated with the knowledge that a new transmission line support structure
would be necessary at the location of existing STR 106. Two shovel tests were excavated and compared
with the results of a previous backhoe trench. Although archaeological material is buried to depths of 4050 cm within the ROW, there is little to suggest that additional investigations would yield additional
information. Further, the present landowner states that the majority of the site was bulldozed and
subsequently plowed across the surrounding large agricultural field. Within the ROW, site 41KR200 is
now considered to be lacking in the integrity that would make it eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41KR674 was recorded at the location of STR 105, on the south bank of the Guadalupe River. It is a
light scatter of buried lithic material with a single chert core on the surface. This site is considered fully
recorded and ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Structure 104 is located at the extreme edge of a large pasture south of the Guadalupe River. A single
shovel test found dense clay loams and no artifacts.
It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed with the understanding that new support
structures will be placed within 50 ft of existing structures 104 and 105. Elsewhere, it is recommended
there be no constraints on the placement of such structures. If structures are required outside the proposed
50-ft radius then additional investigations should be considered at those locations.

Projects, and Projects Cleared through File Searches
This section contains the texts of the results of 21 cultural resource assessments for minor LCRA
construction/development projects. Included are the summaries of reports of 15 small cultural resource
field surveys that yielded negative results, and were each less than 2 acres in area, or were previously
agreed-upon monitoring. The AD at the THC has not previously reviewed the results of these 15
investigations. The results of six file searches that indicated that proposed development areas had been
previously surveyed with negative results are also found in this section.
Additionally, the survey reports on 21 LCRA transmission line maintenance and clearing projects are
presented in this section. Five of these required field surveys and 16 were cleared through file searches.
The LCRA Archeology Services staff has continued conducting cultural resource assessments on the
maintenance and clearing projects as in previous years in accordance with the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) in effect since 2005. Information on archeological sites discovered during these
surveys has not previously been reviewed by the AD, so detailed locational data is provided in this
Annual Report, but redacted in versions available to the public.

Camp Balcones Trail and Road Maintenance

Date of Investigations:

January 2008

Camp Balcones Springs has requested they be allowed to conduct road maintenance on existing roads and
create a hiking trail for campers staying at their adjacent private facility, as well as trim branches along an
existing road (not a concern for Archaeology Services) (Figure 1). Road maintenance will consist of
grading and/or placement or replacement of culverts in areas where erosion is threatening road stability or
creating safety concerns. The trail will be created by trimming branches and selectively removing
vegetation by hand in order to create a “path of least resistance” that hikers can follow. Because of the
proximity to previously recorded archaeological sites and the hurried and undefined nature of the 1979
brush control survey, LCRA Archaeology Services conducted a cultural resource assessment of the
project. The assessment was a combination of similar work conducted in 2007, as well as survey of
previously un-assessed portions of the project, including near 100 percent survey of the hiking trail. The
project was evaluated for both direct (construction-related) and indirect (potential for unauthorized
artifact collecting) impacts.
There are seven areas proposed for road maintenance, numbered 1-3 and 5-7, (4 was removed from
consideration in 2007). Numbers 1, 3 and 5 were evaluated in 2007, and recommendations remain the
same, as follows: “Any maintenance activities done to the road will not impact cultural resource sites as
long as all ground disturbing activities are restricted to the roadbed. At Locations #1 and #5, the ground
immediately outside the existing roadbed can be disturbed as long as these disturbances occur within one
meter of the roads edges. At Location #3, all ground disturbances must take place within the roadbed
only and the walls of the existing road cut must not be disturbed. If Camp Balcones wishes to widen the
road at Location #3 by cutting back the existing road cut, then Archeology Services will first need to send
a report to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for a 30-day review. The cultural deposits at
Location #3 do not appear to be significant and the THC would probably concur with our
recommendation that Camp Balcones be allowed to widen the road, but by no more than two feet on
either side.”
The remaining three areas were evaluated on January 4, 2008, by LCRA Archaeology Services staff.
Area 7 is near historic site 41BT155. Examination of deposits showed that culvert replacement would not
impact any cultural materials which had not previously been disturbed. Areas 2 and 6 were likewise
previously disturbed areas with no evidence of cultural deposits. Therefore, road maintenance may
proceed in these areas provided care is taken to minimize impacts to surrounding, possibly undisturbed
soils.
The proposed trail was surveyed on the same day. It is primarily along the rim and edge of an upland
ridge overlooking Hickory Creek to the west. No cultural material was observed, and due to the low
impact nature of the trail construction no additional archaeological work is needed. If, however, it is
determined that any type of equipment will be required to mechanically clear brush or create a trail tread,
then any such areas will need to be separately reassessed.

382

In summary, road maintenance and trail construction activities may proceed without restriction at all areas
except area # 3, where ground disturbance should occur should only take place within the existing road
bed. Otherwise, as long as best management practices are followed, no additional cultural resource
consultation is required at this time.
Note: A hand-dug well located in the floodplain was shown by camp staff, and has been reported to Ryan
Kainer of LCRA. It is considered to be part of site 41BT155

January 2008

LCRA proposes to overhaul transmission line T-253 between the Fayette Power Project and the
Fayetteville substation. Activities will include replacement of specific structures at their existing
locations. An archaeological survey was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on March 7,
2006. The survey consisted of pedestrian investigation of select areas considered to be of high or
moderate potential for containing archaeological sites. These consisted of creek crossings and high creek
terraces.
Two previously recorded archaeological sites, 41FY483 and 41FY484 are located on either side of Camp
Creek near the Fayetteville substation. These were recorded as light, surficial lithic scatters. These two
sites were not revisited. Site 41FY68 was recorded in 1975, and was described as a buried midden with
burned rock and lithic material. It was plotted on the right bank of Cedar Creek approximately 40 m
north of the present transmission line corridor. Within the corridor, two shovel tests were excavated on
either side of STR 19/2 for the 2006 survey.
Shovel Test 1 was located 20 m west of the structure and encountered two flakes and three small burned
chunks in the upper 20 cm of gray clayey sand with increasing clay with depth. Dense clay was found
below 20 cm to a depth of 30 cm, where the test was terminated. Shovel Test 2 was placed 15 m east of
the structure and excavated through 10 cm of sandy light gray clay into dense gray clay below 10 cm. No
artifacts were recovered.
Site 41FY68 is therefore seen to extend southwards into the transmission line corridor between STR 19/2
and Cedar Creek. Care should be exercised in this area. If clearing is necessary it should be
accomplished without disturbing the ground surface, i.e., without mechanical removal. If this is not
possible, additional investigations may be necessary. This area should be considered an “environmentally
sensitive area.” If structure 19/2 requires replacement, it should be approached from the east, and ground
disturbing activities should not occur beyond a distance of 30 ft west of the structure.
Two house or barn structures plotted on USGS quads of the area were not relocated. These were mapped
west of Burnside Road and immediately south of Lake Fayette. A fairly large depression may mark
where a house stood. Further to the north “hog wire” with dimensional lumber (1 x 4) and wire nails
were present. One single tire was also seen nearby. As there was no indication of age greater than 50
years and because any structures had been completely removed, no shovel tests were attempted, as there
is not felt to be sufficient age or integrity left to warrant designation as a site.
Other areas that were investigated showed no evidence of cultural materials.
In summary, three previously recorded archaeological sites, 41FY68, 41FY483 and 41FY484 are within
the T-253 ROW. Only one of these, 41FY68, requires impact minimization. It is recommended that no
ground-disturbing activities take place between Cedar Creek and 30 feet west of STR 19/2. If this is not
possible Archaeology Services should be notified so that any potential additional investigations can be

386

coordinated. Work may proceed in all other areas. Future, more intensive projects (e.g. a rebuild), may
require additional cultural resource investigations.

Date of Investigations:

February 2008

Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural resources
assessment for the proposed septic system replacement within an existing septic drain field at its Max
Starcke Dam facility. The existing drain field is approximately 0.04 acres in area and is located on the
bluff above and to the south of the dam (Figure 1). Due to its upland location this area likely had very
little soil to begin with and most of that soil, along with a sizeable amount of limestone were scraped
away to make room for the adjacent bluff-top substation. The septic drain filed is covered by fill
introduced when the existing septic system was installed years ago.
Field work was conducted by contracted archaeologist Cody M. Kiker on February 12, 2008. Though it
was obvious that the soil consisted of introduced fill, three shovel tests were excavated to test for intact
soils below the fill. No intact soils were encountered below the fill in any of the three shovel tests. The
fill is composed of tan to light brown sand with high concentrations of polished gravels. The fill ranges
from 20-30 cm deep in western part of the project area to 50-60 cm deep in the eastern part. Below this
fill is limestone bedrock.
No artifacts were recovered and due to the fact that the soils in the project area consist of introduced fill
and have zero potential to contain intact cultural deposits the project may proceed as planned.

Date of Investigations:

February 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to construct low
water crossings at two locations on Little Lucy Creek in Lampasas County, Texas in order to facilitate
work on the LCRA T-138 maintenance project (Figure 1). The LCRA Archaeology Services staff had
previously conducted a cultural resource assessment for the T-138 maintenance project. Although staff
did not have time to check the Little Lucy Creek area, staff stated that the Little Lucy Creek area had a
high probability for cultural resource sites and that the maintenance crews should exercise caution in this
area.
Since LCRA’s proposed work for the two stream crossings will include ground-disturbing activities in
areas adjacent to the stream channel, the Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey
of the two areas on February 21, 2008. Fieldwork consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing on
the terrace slopes adjacent to the stream crossings. Ground surface visibility was found to be fair at both
crossings. No evidences of cultural materials were seen on ground surface and cutbank exposures. At the
proposed crossing of Little Lucy Creek between existing transmission structures 56/5 and 56/6 two shovel
tests were also excavated. The soil profiles showed a 17 cm thick dark grayish brown clay loam topsoil
underlain by a gray clay loam. At the other proposed work area further north adjacent to Little Lucy
Creek outside of the transmission line right-of-way in the vicinity of structures 56/8 and 56/9 a shallower
clay loam deposit was found to a depth of 40 cm above a pale yellow clay subsoil.
Based on the results of the field investigation, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the
proposed work to construct the stream crossings on Little Lucy Creek be allowed to proceed. As with all
transmission maintenance projects, our staff will report the results of the investigation at the end of the
year in our Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2008.

Date of Investigations:

February 2008

LCRA proposes to stabilize approximately 500 feet of an existing canal wall by placing large pieces of
concrete along an eroding bank. The concrete will be placed with a trackhoe or similar piece of
equipment that will travel down the canal bed, retrieving concrete that will be brought in along an existing
county road. The equipment will access the canal by way of a small existing drainage located on private
property.
Because of the potential for ground disturbance and the need for a short review period a field
investigation was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on February 26, 2008. The
investigation consisted of a visual examination of the project area. The only portion of the project that
might impact previously undisturbed soils was the point of canal access. The walls of this drainage were
closely examined for evidence of cultural material. None was seen. Because of the excellent visibility
within this drainage no shovel tests were necessary.
As no archaeological sites are present and because the project is less than two acres in size there is no
need for coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) at this time. The results of this
investigation will be reported in the year-end report to THC.
The project may proceed without additional coordination with Archaeology Services. However, if
unexpected archaeological materials are discovered during the course of the project please cease work in
the immediate area of discovery and contact Archaeology Services at ext. 6714 so that any possible
additional investigations can be coordinated.

T-461 Overhaul Project

Type of Investigation(s):

File search

Date of Investigations:

March 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to overhaul
activities on its T-461 transmission line (Figure 1). Portions of this transmission line had been previously
surveyed for cultural resource sites by Espey, Huston & Associates in 1988 as a part of the larger
Lampasas to Goldthwaithe Transmission Line Rebuild Project. On the T-461 portion of the EH&A
survey, sixteen new cultural resource sites (41SS53-58, 41SS63, 41SS64, 41MI147, and 41MI151-156)
were recorded were recorded and one previously recorded site (41SS28) was revisited.
In preparation for maintenance work on the T-461 in 2006, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
revisited all four sites on the T-461 line that EH&A had rated as potentially significant. These sites are
41SS28, 41SS63, 41SS64, and 41MI147. While in the field the LCRA staff also recorded a new site,
41SS163. Staff noted that materials on and near ground surface at all of these sites had been previously
disturbed by plowing. Staff also stated that while there was a potential for buried cultural materials below
the plow zone at sites 41SS28, 41SS63, 41SS64, and 41MI147, it was doubtful that maintenance activities
would have any effect on those deposits.
Existing transmission structures within or near these four archaeological sites are as follows:
Site 41SS28: Structures 1/8, 1/9, and 1/10
Site 41SS63: Structure 2/1 is nearby to the south of the site
Site 41SS64: Structure 2/3
41MI147: Structures 10/3 and 10/4
Although the engineering plans for the current overhaul work do not include the replacement of any
structures, other types of activities such as the replacement of cross arms, the addition of bird guards, and
the bonding of shield wires to towers will require heavy vehicles to pass through the transmission line
right-of-way. LCRA should avoid sending any heavy vehicles through the areas where the Structures
listed in the previous paragraph are located after heavy rainfall events to avoid creating any tire ruts that
go deeper than the 6 to 8 inch deep plow zones. Elsewhere, work can proceed without any restrictions.

Introduction
In September 2007, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff completed a
cultural resource assessment for maintenance work on the portions of the T-130 and T-191/192
transmission lines that extend from the Gillespie Substation to the Eckert Substation. The LCRA
Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct maintenance and clearing activities on the remaining
parts of the T-130 and T-191/192 transmission lines. This second phase of work includes all portions of
these transmission lines extending north and east of the Eckert Substation. The LCRA Archaeology
Services staff has now completed fieldwork on a majority of the high probability areas in the Phase 2
areas. Nine new cultural resource sites were recorded and assessed during the second phase
investigations. Data on the new cultural resource sites are provided in the following paragraphs.
Recommendations are then provided both on these sites and on other high probability areas that could not
be accessed during the field investigation.
Cultural Resource Site Descriptions
41GL393
41GL393 is located on the right (south) bank of Legion Creek, prior to its emergence as a large stream.
In this area the T-130 and T-191/192 lines run parallel to each other within an approximately 200 ft wide
ROW. The area within the ROW is primarily grasses, and appears to have been bulldozed. The T-130
transmission STR 20/1 is located about 30 meters southwest of the south edge of the site.
The site was first seen when a number of flakes were seen within a gravel road leading to the ROW, about
150 m south of the creek. Further inspection found a few flakes and some apparent burned rock, along
with a small gouge Figure 166) in an area with visibility along a fenceline some 60 m north of the road.
Tall grasses made visibility poor. Two shovel tests (STs 4 and 5) were placed near the creek channel, in
areas originally thought to be minimally disturbed. Both found large amounts of recent charcoal in the
upper 20 cm of soil, and both were excavated through fine loams to depths 80 and 50 cm, respectively,
with no artifact recovery in either. Two shovel tests (ST 6 and 7) were placed on either side of the flake
scatter seen within the road. This scatter contained at least one hundred interior flakes of various types
and colors, and was densest within about a 30 m length of road. St 6, just south of the road, had one flake
in Level 1 and two very small chips in Level 2. The test was terminated at 30 cm in reddish brown sandy
loams with high calcium carbonate content and increasing clay. Shovel test 7 had a similar profile, but no
artifacts were recovered. These two tests suggest that the flakes within the road were imported along with
crushed granite road base, as it seems highly unlikely a single road cut would have exposed this amount
of debitage in such an isolated area. The gouge, flakes and burned rock along the fence are likely
representative of an actual site, but it appears that any such site within the ROW as been essentially
destroyed by private land clearing activities. The general paucity of surficial materials indicates that the
site was ephemeral to begin with, and unless there are deeply buried deposits, the site lacks the integrity
for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or nomination to the National Register of

Historic Places (NRHP). Any proposed maintenance activities will not adversely impact the site, and
there is no need for any type of additional work or oversight at this time.

Figure 166. Gouge found at 41GL393.
41GL394 is located immediately across Legion Creek from 41GL393 within the combined T-130 and T191/192 corridor. The T-191/192 STR #117 is located about 15 meters northeast of the north edge of this
site. One biface fragment, an apparent dart point preform (Figure 167), four flakes, and a likely burned
rock were seen within a 30 m diameter area. Two shovel tests (STs 1 and 2) were placed within this area.
Both had a profile of about 15 cm of dark sandy loam over decomposing granite. ST 1 had a single
possible burned piece of sandstone, and ST2 had one small chert chip and two possible burned rocks.
One additional shovel test (ST 3) was placed about 30 north of this area, above an exposed limestone
ledge where it appeared there was potential for soil development. Its profile was similar and no artifacts
were recovered. Disturbance was les severe here then at 41GL393, although a large tock tank had been
constructed underneath the line. Careful examination of the soil around the stock tank failed to find any
significant amounts of artifacts. This site is therefore interpreted as a minor lithic scatter with little
interpretive potential, and ineligible for formal listings. There are no concerns with maintenance
activities at this location.

Figure 167. Dart point preform from 41GL394.

41LL475
The site is located within the LCRA T-130 transmission line right-of-way on a small 6- foot high terrace
projection on the northeast side of a tributary of Byrnes Creek. The site lies 40 to 80 meters southwest of
the T-130 STR 3/2, and STR 3/3 is located on the opposite side of the tributary from the site. The
transmission line corridor has been cleared of trees so that the current vegetation is short grasses, cacti,
and brush. Outside of the transmission line corridor there is a narrow band of live oak trees bordering the
creek channel. Topsoil is a gravelly sandy loam.
The portion of the site within the LCRA T-130 right-of-way appears to be a prehistoric lithic scatter. Of
the approximately 20 artifacts seen at the site, most of the artifacts are small secondary and tertiary flakes
and chips. No definite prehistoric burned rock fragments or other artifact classes were seen. Nor were

400

any features or diagnostic artifacts found within the right-of-way. The soils are rocky and the site
probably has little depth of deposits. The site probably extends eastward outside of the right-of-way
toward a smaller side tributary that has its confluence with the larger tributary about 40 meters southeast
of the transmission line right-of-way. The portion of the site within the transmission line corridor is
assessed as not eligible for the NR or SAL listing.
41GL395
41GL395 is located just north of the T-130 and T-191/192 split on the left (west) bank a broad bend of
Legion Creek at point where the T-130 transmission line runs over the creek bank for a short while. The
ROW is impassable at this point (north of STR 19/3), and the site has to be approached from the north.
The entirety of the known portion of the site is no more than 10 m in diameter. The site is located within
a steep, 2 m cutbank of Legion Creek, at a point where a small gully joins the creek. The cutbank profile
consists of approximately 70 cm fairly coarse granitic loams over very fine grayish brown silts. The
badly decomposed mandible of a large grazing animal, presumed to be bison, is eroding out of the
granitic portion of the cutbank (Figure 168). Scattered about the lower portion of the bank are several
flakes and two edge modified flakes, one of which was made into an informal biface. The medial section
of an untypeable dart point was seen upon the upper portion of the bank, and a single vertebra was within
the cut some 8 m south of the mandible. Some other few bones were also located on the upper portion of
the terrace, and at least some are almost certainly recent. A single shovel test (ST 9) was placed on the
terrace top near the mandible. It was excavated through 90 cm of reddish brown sandy/gravelly loam.
No artifacts were recovered. This site is interpreted as a single-event animal processing location,
although it is possible that the association of the buried mandible and stone artifacts is coincidental. The
site is probably mostly destroyed through natural erosion, although it is possible additional bones and
artifacts remain buried. For this reason the site is considered potentially eligible for formal listing as an
SAL and nomination to the NRHP. It is not expected that there will be any maintenance-related activities
in this area. If any such become scheduled, the site should be avoided, and if it cannot be avoided, then
additional investigations are warranted.

41LL476
41LL476 is located on the T-130 line on a relatively high bluff overlooking a left bank tributary of Hondo
Creek. The T-130 STR 12/1 lies within the northern part of the site. The site consists of flakes and flake
fragments as well as at least two biface fragments and apparent scattered burned rock. The site extends
for a distance of about 100 m north from the edge of the creek. There is some soil development in places,
and a single shovel test (ST 11) was placed at the southern end of the site. It encountered brown sandy

401

loam that graded to pale yellowish brown silty loam over decomposing limestone at about 50 cm. Level 1
had two small decorticate flakes, a piece of chert shatter, and an apparent flake of pure quartz, as well as
seven burned rocks. Level 2 had two flakes and four burned rocks. The site probably lacks the integrity
that would make it significant in the regulatory sense, but would need additional testing before such a
statement could be formalized. Maintenance activities, including potentially improving the existing
stream crossing, are not considered to produce negative impacts. If more intensive impacts (e.g., a
rebuild) are necessary, then additional investigations are warranted prior to ground disturbing activities.
(Note: a lens of possible burned rock was visible in the cutbank opposite 41LL476. No definite cultural
material was visible, however. This area should be looked at more closely if future work included
intensive ground disturbance.)
41LL477
41LL477 is located on the T-130 ROW on two left (east) bank tributaries of Hondo Creek. The site
extends for a total length of 590 meters making it the largest site documented during the survey. The site
area encompasses areas on both sides of the southern tributary and continues northward to the southeast
bank of the northern tributary. T-130’s STRs 11/1 and 10/9 through 10/7 lie within the site area.
The two tributary creeks issue out of the edge of the Riley Mountains, and based on vegetation within
them, appear to be spring fed. The site consists of a scatter of lithic artifacts, primarily flakes, with a
possible disrupted hearth on the south side of the southern tributary. On the north side of this tributary
two arrow points were found, one a Scallorn and the other with a broken base but which is presumed to
also be a Scallorn point (Figure 169). Approximately 120 meters further northward, the distal part of a
dart point was found.

Figure 169. Arrow point fragments seen at 41LL477.
Two shovel tests (STs 12 and 13) were excavated on either side of the southern tributary. Shovel test 12
was placed near the apparent hearth on the south side of the creek. It was found about 30 cm of grayish
brown silty loam over limestone cobbles. One chert chip and one burned chunk were in the upper 20 cm,
and one flake was found in the lower 10 cm. Several angular pieces of limestone and granite were also
recovered, and may be fire-cracked. Shovel test 13 was placed on the north bank of the creek in an area
with apparent soil deposition. It was excavated through 40 cm brown silty loam with high calcium
carbonate content. Final soil depth is unknown. The upper 20 cm had nine small flakes and flake
fragments, and importantly, a mussel shell fragment. The second level two fairly large flakes and six
smaller fragments.
This site is considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark
based on the potential for horizontal and/or vertical separation of components, presence of features, and
preservation of organic material (the mussel shell, the most likely source being either the Colorado or
Llano Rivers). Maintenance activities, however, are not expected to impact previously undisturbed
components of the site. The creek is impassable by vehicle though. Should it be determined that a stream

402

crossing is necessary, additional investigations are warranted, as well as if any future projects impact the
site to greater extent than standard maintenance procedures.
41LL478
41LL478 is located near the north end of the T-130 line with the north end of the site being about 20
meters south of STR 2/1. The site lies on the north bank of a short, unnamed right bank tributary of the
Llano River. The property here is actively managed by a large exotic game ranch, and much of the ROW
has been cleared and root plowed (Figure 170). At the site location the stream crossing has been heavily
modified, and the root plowing extends well upslope towards STR 2/1. Within the plowed field was
found a surprising number of artifacts, given the lack of known readily available chert resources in the
immediate vicinity. It is possible that the Llano River, a little over a mile away to the northwest, provided
sufficient raw materials to explain the relatively causal discard seen at the site. Present were a core with
crushed edges (a crusher), 30 to 40 flakes both corticate and decorticate, a large edge modified blade, a
late stage biface/possible knife, and a broken dart point probably of Late Archaic age (Figure 171). These
were all in an area approximately 40 m in diameter, and clearly decreased in frequency towards the north.
No shovel tests were excavated due to the excellent visibility and the obvious lack of any maintenance
needs. The site is probably destroyed within the ROW, although there is a slight possibility that there are
deeper, undisturbed deposits. The site is significant in that it aids in interpreting the local settlement
patterning, but it is doubtful it is eligible for formal state or national listings. No special restrictions are
needed for the upcoming maintenance activities. However, should a major ground disturbing project
falling under the formal review process become necessary, limited testing to confirm the nature of the
surface deposits is warranted.

41LL479
This prehistoric site extends for a length of 200 meters on the T-130 corridor near the base of the Riley
Mountains on the north and east sides of Bailey Branch. The existing T-130 STR 9/2 is situated within
the southern part of the site and STR 9/1 lies just 13 meters north of the north edge of the site.
Moderately dense prehistoric materials consisting mostly of chert debitage and tool fragments are
exposed on eroded portions of ROW corridor, particularly on the eastern half of the corridor in the central
part of the site. Diagnostic tools that were seen at the site consist of an Ensor point fragment, a Darl point
stem, and an arrow point preform possibly of the Alba type. Several broken biface fragments were also
seen. Some sandstone and limestone rocks present on ground surface have characteristics of burned
rocks, but it is not certain as to whether these are prehistoric hearthstones or result from tree and brush
burning during land clearing activities.
Although no shovel testing was conducted, there appears to be good potential for buried deposits on the
western edges of the transmission corridor in the central and northern parts of the site. Even better
deposits may be present further westward outside the corridor towards the Bailey Branch channel. At the
south end of the site, soils are shallow and rocky at the T-130 crossing of Bailey Branch. Therefore, no
special precautions are needed should this area need to be bladed for an improved low water crossing over
the creek channel. While other standard maintenance level activities should not have any adverse impacts
on the site, additional investigations would be needed in the central and northern parts of the site should
LCRA propose more intensive ground-disturbing activities such as rebuilding the line or widening the
ROW.

41LL480
This prehistoric site is situated on the T-130 corridor on the southwest side of Bailey Branch opposite
41LL479. The site is a prehistoric lithic scatter that consists of chert debitage. A very small number of
burned rocks were also seen, but these may have been burned during recent land clearing operations. No
features or diagnostic artifacts were seen, and artifact density is lower than that at nearby 41LL479.
Overall, the surface exposure of artifacts extends for a length of about 70 meters within the ROW. The
topsoil consists of a sandy deposit of unknown depth. The north end of the site lies 60 meters south of
Bailey Branch with the area between the site and creek being mostly exposed bedrock. No special
conditions are needed for maintenance work within the boundaries of 41LL480.
Recommendations for Maintenance Activities
Special conditions are recommended at 2 of the 9 cultural resource sites that were recorded. At 41GL395,
the maintenance crews need to avoid impacting an area that is a 30 foot diameter area centered about 300
feet north of T-130 STR 19/2. It consists of a gully and cutbank where animal bones are exposed. At
41LL477, should it be determined that ground-disturbing activities are needed to create a low water
crossing on the creek channel that lies about 345 feet north of STR 11/1 on the T-130 line, then additional
cultural resource investigations will be needed before the crossing can be constructed.
Additionally, there are number of high probability areas that could not be investigated due to access and
scheduling problems on the T-191/192 line. These consist of the terrace areas on either side of Coal
Creek, the first two unnamed tributary creeks west of Coal Creek, the first two unnamed tributary creeks
east of Coal Creek, the terraces on both sides of Comanche Creek, the first tributary creek west of
Comanche Creek, the first tributary creek east of Comanche Creek, the terrace of the east side of White
Creek, the first tributary east of White Creek, the terrace of the west side of Walnut Creek. Should the
maintenance work require any low water crossings at any of these areas, then the LCRA Archaeology

404

Services staff should be contacted in advance so that the archaeologists can conduct a field visit to ensure
that no significant or potentially significant cultural resource sites are present in areas that will require
ground-disturbing activities for construction of the low water crossings.

Additional Concerns for Future Projects Such as Rebuilds or Widening the ROW Corridors
There appear to be very deep soils on either side of Sandy Creek. The T-130 line crosses very near
previously recorded 41GL3951LL397, on the south side of Sandy Creek. Two shovel tests in this area
found no artifacts, and there were no visible signs of the site. Any future projects with intensive ground
disturbance would likely require more intensive investigations on either side of this creek.
A few flakes were seen in the vicinity of STR 19/3 on the T-130 line. These were in areas of excellent
visibility and relatively high disturbance. The artifacts were too widely scattered to warrant a site
designation.
A mapped spring near STRs 17/8 and 17/9 on the T-130 was found to feed two large stock tanks. Much
of this area had been bulldozed, and no artifacts were seen. One low spot near the west edge of the ROW,
just north of the stock tank appeared to have intact soils, but it was not tested as no impacts are expected.
This location should be revisited if future work involves intensive ground disturbance.
On the T-130 line, a number of left bank tributaries of Legion Creek were examined, and no sites were
discovered, although seemingly randomly occurring isolated finds of flakes, an early stage biface and the
medial section of a biface were plotted. Future major projects might require at least spot checking of
some of these crossings.
Overall, this project recorded a fairly large number of sites in an area containing few to no chert
resources, but one that probably had a predictable water supply. It appears that some of the tributary
creeks that descend from the slopes of the Riley Mountains are spring-fed, and this fact may account for
greater density of sites than is suggested by the present statewide database. The artifact assemblage at
most of these sites was limited, both in numbers of artifacts and diversity of tool types with 41LL479
being an exception. The actual lithic material used to produce chipped stone tools, however, is quite
diverse, with a wide variety of colors including white from an unknown source, pinks and browns from
lag cobble sources, and black tabular chert similar to that seen in the Lampasas area (e.g. quarry
41GL3951LM44), as well as the quartz flake possibly coming from the Lake Buchanan area (or perhaps
the feature called Quartz Knob further east along Sandy Creek). The small sizes and low counts of the
flakes at the majority of the sites indicate that chert was being used conservatively, as would be expected
when it is difficult to replenish supplies. It also suggests that these sites were short term camps or
resource acquisition locales, with the frequency of the sites indicating fairly extensive use of the wider
landscape at a minimally intensive level.

Date of Investigations:

March 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to upgrade the
T-143 transmission line which is located in Travis County, Texas. Nine existing structures consisting of
Structures # 64, 65, 80, 81, 86, 88, 89, 103, and 104 will be replaced with new structures. Each
replacement structure will be erected within 15 feet of the existing structure. Figure 1 is an aerial map
that shows the numbered locations of the T-143 existing structures.
A files searched conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed the entire T-143
transmission line was previously surveyed for cultural resource sites by Espey, Huston and Associates’
(EH&A) archaeological staff in 1993 for LCRA’s upcoming rebuild of the line at that time. No
significant or potentially significant cultural resource sites were found during that investigation. The
Texas Historical Commission concurred with the results of EH&A’s survey.
Based on the results of on the results of EH&A’s previous investigation, the LCRA Archaeology Services
staff recommends that the proposed T-143 upgrade proceed, as currently planned. As always, standard
emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the construction personnel uncover
any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction work, then work should cease in
the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation,
work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.

Grelle Picnic Table Relocation

Type of Investigation(s):

Monitoring

Date of Investigations:

March 2008

On March 26, 2008, LCRA Archaeology Services staff monitored construction of a 15 x 15 ft pad
designed for placement of a picnic table, part of a series of improved camp sites being constructed at
Grelle Resource Area. Construction involved removing fill from the high side of the slightly sloping land
form and filling in the low side to create a level surface. A cement slab with embedded picnic table will
be placed at that location. A conversation with construction foreman Ed Castro indicated that this would
be the only location that such ground disturbance would take place, and that the remainder of the slabs
will be placed upon existing ground surfaces, and that road and camp parking slots would also be
constructed by placing fill on top of existing ground surfaces. Some slight ground disturbance may take
place when a patch of greenbriars are removed from the main loop near the present bathroom.
The monitoring was recommended because of poorly defined site 41BT160, which possibly extended into
the project area. Based on the monitoring and two additional shovel tests, combined with GPS recording
that was compared against files and records at LCRA and online with the Texas Historical Commission, it
appears that 41BT160 does not extend into the present project area. Because of negative findings of both
present and past work there is no need for additional archaeological investigation for this project as
described and proposed. If there significant changes to the scope of this project or future projects require
significant ground disturbance, additional investigations are warranted.
A visit was also made to the park host/entry station site. This visit confirmed earlier assessments that no
further archaeological work was need in this area.

FM 1431 Pipeline Relocation

Figure References:

Type of Investigation(s):

File search

Date of Investigations:

March 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Water Services staff is proposing to relocate an
approximately 700 foot long section of an existing LCRA waterline in order to accommodate the
realignment of Farm-to-Market Road 1431 by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The
project will involve the subsurface placement of a new section of 30-inch diameter ductile iron pipe as
relocated by the TxDOT project. The location of the new pipeline alignment is shown on the attached
map (see attachment).
A file search for the proposed LCRA project showed that there are no previously recorded cultural
resource sites within the pipeline relocation area. A check of the Texas Historical Commission’s
computerized Site Atlas indicated that the proposed pipeline relocation corridor lies within an area
previously surveyed for cultural resources with negative results. Since the previously surveyed area
closely follows the existing FM 1431 road right-of-way, it appeared that the surveyed area was probably
the new FM 1431 realignment corridor. This fact was verified in a telephone conversation with John
Budd, the TxDOT archaeologist who conducted the cultural resource survey for the FM 1431 realignment
project. Mr. Budd further confirmed that no cultural resource sites were found in the area of LCRA’s
proposed pipeline relocation project.
Based on the results of on the results of the file search and the conversation with Mr. Budd of the TxDOT
staff, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the proposed LCRA waterline relocation
project be allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations. As always, standard
emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the construction personnel uncover
any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction work, then work should cease in
the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation,
work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.

April 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for proposed clearing and maintenance work on Transmission Line T-213, which is
also known as the Bellville South to Waller Transmission Line. Total length of this transmission line is
approximately 15.76 miles. The assessment consisted of a file search of the entire transmission line
corridor.
The file search showed that the Texas Archeological Survey staff conducted an intensive cultural resource
survey of the transmission line corridor for LCRA in 1979 prior to the original construction. The survey
consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. As a result of the survey investigation, no significant
or potentially significant cultural resource sites were found.
The file search also indicated that no cultural resource sites have been recorded within or near the
transmission line corridor since the 1979. Based on the results of the file search, the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed maintenance and clearing activities be allowed to proceed.
However, should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA
Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the LCRA and the
Texas Historical Commission can determine whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Date of Investigations:

April 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to construct a
low water crossing on Salt Creek in Lampasas County, Texas in order to facilitate work on the LCRA T138 Maintenance project (Figure 1). LCRA Archaeology Services staff had previously conducted a
cultural resource assessment for the T-138 Maintenance project and although the Salt Creek area was not
checked, staff stated that the Salt Creek area had a high probability for cultural resource sites and that the
area would need to be surveyed if any ground disturbance was to be done.
LCRA Transmission Serviced proposes to place gravel fill within and adjacent to the creek channel in
order to facilitate crossing. Because this work could potentially include ground-disturbing activities,
Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey of the area on April 8, 2008. Fieldwork
consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing of terraces and slopes on both sides of Salt Creek
(between STRs 70/5 and 70/6). Ground surface visibility was good on the terraces and very good closer
to the creek. Cutbank exposures were also utilized determine subsurface conditions. Gravels were
moderate in the area and very dense closer to the creek. Fossilized shells were observed in cutbanks and
surface gravels. Shovel test 1 (ST) was excavated to depth of 45cm on the south/east side of Salt Creek.
The soil consisted of yellow-brown gravelly sandy clay loam with mottling increasing with depth. Shovel
test 2 was excavated to a depth of 80cm on the north/west side of Salt Creek. This test had 65cm of
brown loamy clay with some gravels above 15cm of brown sandy clay loam with increasing numbers of
gravels. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nodules were found in the lower depths of both shovel tests and
various cutbanks. No cultural material was recovered from either shovel test. A purple glass bottle neck
was observed in the gravels adjacent to the creek, but no other cultural material, either historic or
prehistoric, was observed; this artifact is subsequently considered an isolated find.
Based on the results of the field investigation, LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the
proposed work to construct the crossing on Salt Creek be allowed to proceed. As with all transmission
maintenance projects, out staff will report the results of the investigation at the end of the year in our
Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2008.

Date of Investigations:

May 2008

LCRA proposes to conduct standard maintenance on transmission Line T-50, between the Hallettsville
and Hallettsville City substations. Because the line has not been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, a cultural resource assessment consisting of a map and file review and reconnaissance level
field survey was completed on May 8, 2008, by LCRA Archaeology Services staff.
The field portion of the project consisted of investigations at stream crossings and stream heads. An old
railroad grade that was once the San Antonio and Aransas Pass railroad was also investigated.
No archaeological sites were located during the survey. Archaeology Services has no recommendations
or areas of concerns for this project.
However, future, more intensive projects should receive additional review, and field investigations should
be selectively considered, especially on the high sandy terrace east of the Lavaca River, and also on the
broad terrace west of the railroad grade in the vicinity of STRs 2/13 and 2/14.
If unexpected archaeological materials are discovered during maintenance work, please cease ground
disturbing activities in the area of the discovery and contact Archaeology Services staff so the find can be
evaluated.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Water Services plan to install an elevated water storage
tank on the north slope of Long Mountain in Llano County, Texas. A new buried pipeline will connect
the tank to an existing water pipeline that runs along Hwy 29. This new pipeline will run from the
proposed tank site northwards to the north edge of the existing transmission line ROW, a distance of less
than 100 feet, then eastwards along the north edge of this ROW for a distance of 300 feet, and finally turn
north for a distance of 300 feet to the south edge of Hwy 29. At this point it may tunnel under the
highway to connect with the existing pipeline or, as an alternative route, run to the west along the south
edge of the highway for 700 feet to tie into a section of the existing pipeline on the south side of the
highway. The proposed 30-foot wide easement for this new pipeline runs for 650 feet from the proposed
tank site to the highway, covering 0.45 acre. A permanent service road composed of compacted dirt or
crushed gravel will also be constructed within this easement.
The tank site and nearby portions of the transmission line ROW were previously investigated by LCRA’s
Archaeology Services staff in 2004. However the proposed easement between the transmission ROW and
highway was not. Since the ground within the easement will be disturbed by clearing and pipeline
trenching, impacting any archeological deposits that might be present, a cultural resource survey was
conducted by LCRA’s Archaeology Services staff on June 2, 2008.
The survey consisted of walking the entire route of the proposed pipeline between the transmission line
ROW to Hwy 29, a distance of 300 feet. In addition, the 700-foot alternative route along the south side of
highway was also walked. During the survey, the easement between the highway and transmission line
ROW was found to contain thin rocky soils or rock outcrops on moderately sloping ground. Only a small
area 100 feet south of the highway appeared to have soil depth sufficient to harbor cultural deposits. A
shovel test placed in this area encountered soft sandstone bedrock 15 cm beneath the surface with the soil
above being extremely rocky and containing no artifacts. The 700-foot alternative route was found to run
through land that had been graded and stripped of all natural soil cover by highway construction.
Since the project area is less than two acres in size and no cultural resource sites were found, a report does
not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission at this time for review and comment. Instead, the
proposed construction may proceed at this point, and our staff will report the results of the investigation
later in our Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2008.

Field survey

Date of Investigations:

June 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is considering granting an easement to Grason Volente
Investments, Ltd. for a potable waterline through a portion of the LCRA-owned Wheless tract in Travis
County, Texas. The proposed easement comprises a 50-foot strip of wooded land bordering the western
edge of Lime Creek Road starting from the southeast property line of the Cedar Park Water Treatment
Plant and extending southeastward to end at the southwest property line of the Preserve. The proposed
easement will run for a distance of 1640 feet (500 meters) and cover an area of 1.9 acre.
Should the project proceed, the wooded easement area will have to be cleared using heavy machinery and
a 1640-foot long trench excavated for the waterline. Therefore, considerable ground disturbances are
anticipated, impacting any buried archeological deposits or features that might be present. Since this
portion of the Wheless tract has not received any prior archeological investigation, LCRA’s Archeology
Services conducted a cultural resource survey of the proposed easement area on May 28, 2008.
The survey consisted of walking in a zigzag fashion two transects separated by 5 to 10 meters lengthways
through the proposed easement area. Surface visibility was good with little ground vegetation and,
significantly, topsoils were thin to nonexistent. No cultural material was seen on the surface other than
modern trash. Two shovel tests were dug in areas that appeared to have sufficient soil depth. One test
encountered bedrock at 36 cm below the surface and the other at 16 cm. Neither shovel test recovered
artifacts and the shovel test walls showed a truncated soil profile probably resulting from past land
clearings.
Based on the negative results of the fieldwork, no additional cultural resource investigations are needed.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the proposed easement be granted. As with all
projects of less than two acres without archeological sites, our staff will report the results of this
investigation in our Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2008.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
maintenance work on the T-386 transmission line which is also called the Buttercup to Avery Ranch
Transmission Line. This transmission extends for a total length of 3.76 miles, and it is situated in
southern Williamson County, Texas.
A file search conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed that the eastern part of the
transmission line corridor was surveyed for cultural resource sites by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
archaeologists in 1997 as a part of the Leander Rehabilitation Center project. No cultural resource sites
were found within the area that later was utilized for the eastern half of the transmission line corridor. In
1999, when LCRA proposed to construct the T-386 line, archaeologists from PBS&J performed a cultural
resource survey of the remaining portion of the transmission line corridor that had not previously been
investigated. PBS&J found no cultural resource sites in that part of the right-of-way.
Based on the negative results of the previous field investigations, no additional fieldwork is needed. The
LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the proposed maintenance work proceed. However,
should the maintenance personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery. The LCRA Archaeology Services
staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation
with the Texas Historical Commission, and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance or
mitigation measures are needed.

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

LCRA proposes to conduct standard maintenance on four transmission lines located in the Kendall,
Comfort and Kerrville areas. These lines variously intersect and are double circuited with each other at
various locations. The lines have all be previously surveyed for cultural resources except for T-243 and
the corresponding double-circuited portion of T-123, which makes up approximately 1 mile of line at the
eastern end of the system.
There are a number of previously recorded archaeological sites on the remaining portion of T-123 as well
as on T-122 and T-225. Only four of these, however, require any avoidance. These are sites 41KR200,
41KR593, 41KR595, and 41KR598. Recommendations are discussed below in relation to associated
transmission line structures when available, and other landmarks when no structure information is
available.
Site 41KR200 is an open prehistoric campsite located on T-225 just north of River Road which parallels
the north bank of the Guadalupe River. It is centered around the first lattice structure north of the river
and extends across the plowed fields north where it ends in the vicinity of the first structure north of SH
27. Due to monitoring following a recent rebuild, it is not expected that much clearing will be necessary.
Recommendations are for the access from River Road to the lattice structure to be maintained along the
existing dirt track, and the clearing of vegetation should be accomplished by non-ground disturbing
methods.
Site 41KR593 is located on lines T-122 and T-123 between STRs 24 and 25. This site is recorded as a
lithic scatter consistent with procurement activities. Just outside the transmission line ROW, however, is
a circular mound of large limestone rocks. Because it was outside the ROW it was not investigated
beyond noting its presence. However, it is within an area of potential effect, and could be damaged by
equipment traveling or maneuvering outside the ROW. Therefore, between STRs 24 and 25 vehicular
movement should be restricted to the ROW.
Site 41KR595 is located on lines T-122 and T-123 between Cypress Creek Road and the base of the slope
that is 500 ft west of STR 8. This is a large open camp located within open pasture and at the base of the
slope. Previous monitoring and later investigation by the Llano Uplift Archeological Society (LUAS)
indicated a high potential for intact buried deposits. Existing roads and access points should be used, and
clearing should be accomplished by non-ground disturbing methods, from between Cypress Creek Road
(approximately the location of STR 8) to a point 500 ft west of STR 8.
Site 41KR598 is located on lines T-123 and T-225 at a point 31,500 line ft east of the Kerrville Stadium
substation and 12,000 ft west of the “T” formed by the intersection of lines T-122, T-123 and T-225. It is
within a deep canyon containing a spring-fed stream. The site consists of a water management system
associated with the Faltin family, and apparently is still in use. Because of its location within the steepwalled canyon, no impacts from maintenance are expected. Post-rebuild monitoring showed that clearing
stopped well short of both canyon walls. Such avoidance should be maintained, and no attempts to cross
the canyon floor in vehicles should be made.

425

It does not appear that the final, eastern mile of T-123 that corresponds with T-243 between the Comfort
and Kendall substations has ever been surveyed for cultural resources. This is an area of fairly low
probability for cultural sites, and aerial imagery suggests that the highest probability portion of this
section is within a golf course. It is recommended that best management practices, primarily minimizing
unnecessary disturbances, be followed while conducting maintenance along T-243 and the corresponding
section of T-123.
To summarize:
T-225: Use existing access points and roads, avoid ground disturbance in vicinity of first lattice structure
north of the Guadalupe River
T-122 and T-123: Stay within the ROW between STRs 24 and 25; use existing access points and road,
avoid ground disturbance from STR 8 and Cypress Creek Road west for a distance of 500 ft.
T-123 and T-225: Do not cross steep canyon located 31,500 ft line east of Kerrville Stadium substation
and 12,000 ft west of major “T” transmission line intersection.
T-225 and T-123: Avoid unnecessary ground disturbance between the Kendall and Kerrville substations.
Please note: These recommendations are for maintenance activities only. Potential future projects such
as overhauls and rebuilds should be evaluated based on associated levels of possible impacts.

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

On June 25, 2007, LCRA Archaeology Services staff visited McKinney Roughs (Figure 182) to evaluate
impacts associated with recent firefighting activities and subsequent firebreak construction to
archaeological sites that are formally listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) or those considered
potentially eligible for listing as SALs. There are presently five SALs on McKinney Roughs property –
41BP88, 41BP444, 41BP449, 41BP455 and 41BP463 (Figure 183). Only one of these, 41BP463, was
directly impacted by the fire and firefighting activities. None of these sites will be impacted by firebreak
construction as presently proposed; however, site 41BP681, which is considered potentially eligible for
SAL status, will be subjected to impacts through clearing along the property boundary.
An inspection of 41BP681, located at the most southeasterly corner of the property, found that shredding
of vegetation had already occurred, as per verbal and written communications between Archaeology
Services, Conservation Services and McKinney Roughs staff, and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). Ground disturbance was minimal, but I marked the site boundaries with flagging tape and visited
with the clearing crew informing them of the need to minimize, as much as possible, impacts to that
location. The remainder of the property line scheduled for clearing has been surveyed at various times in
the past. There is no need for additional coordination with Archaeology Services for the remainder of the
clearing as proposed. This recommendation covers fence removal and replacement as well, with the
understanding that the fence will be replaced in kind (i.e. predominantly t-posts). Should the project
scope change and bulldozing or more substantial fence construction be required, then additional
coordination with Archaeology Services will be needed. These recommendations do not cover additional
firebreak construction in the interior of the park, except along existing trails. It was also discovered that
the existing portion of the fence along the N/S axis was about 40 ft too far onto neighboring property.
The new fence will be just inside the actual property line, meaning that L CRA loses a good portion of the
site.
A site visit to 41BP463, located along Bobcat Ridge Trail within the main fire area, found that
firefighting activities had not impacted it, other than for two incidental trails created by light vehicles.
This site should be avoided during firebreak construction if at all possible. If any substantial ground
disturbance becomes necessary here then a consultation process with THC will be necessary.
Site 41BP444, within the loop formed by the northern intersection of Bobcat Ridge Trail and Riverside
Trail, was also visited. This site had not been impacted by either the fire or firefighting activities. Site
41BP88, at the former wetland area, was not examined, as it was not within or near the fire area. Both of
these sites, as well as SALs 41BP449 and 41BP455 (see Figure 1) should also be avoided if at all
possible. If avoidance is not possible, then Archaeology Services should be consulted prior to any
ground-disturbing activities, except for standard maintenance of existing trails. New ground disturbance
may require field investigations and a 30-day review and clearance process through the THC. It is
recommended that fire guards be created by a seppi or similar equipment. Bulldozing is not
recommended and may require additional investigations and possible delays. Other firebreak
construction will need to be evaluated separately.

427

Keith Treadwell also showed an artifact scatter he discovered near the intersection of Ridge and Valley
View trails. This scatter consists of apparent multiple trash disposal events within the past 30 or 40 years.
As such, it is not considered an archaeological site, and no additional measures are necessary at this
location.

T-134 Overhaul

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on the T-134 transmission line which is also called the Flatonia to Yoakum Transmission
Line. This transmission extends for a total length of 28.86 miles, and it is situated in Fayette and Lavaca
counties, Texas.
A file search showed that this transmission line was not surveyed for cultural resource sites prior to its
original construction because that construction predated the enactment of the State Antiquities Code.
However, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource field investigation on this
line prior to proposed maintenance work in August 2006. As a result of that investigation, four cultural
resource sites, 41LC22-25, were recorded and assessed.
Sites 41LC22 and 41LC24 were assessed as insignificant and, thus, no special conditions were needed for
the proposed maintenance work. Site 41LC23 was rated as a potentially significant site, and special
conditions were placed on the proposed maintenance activities in and around this site. The restrictions for
the 41LC23 site area consisted of avoiding damage to subsurface deposits, hand clearing of vegetation,
and restricting vehicular traffic to usage of any existing dirt road. The fourth site, 41LC25, is the historic
St. Paul AME Church building, which appeared to be partially situated within the normal transmission
line corridor. Information in the Special Conditions book for the maintenance project indicated that the
LCRA does not have a formal 100 foot wide easement on the land tract in which the church is located.
Assessment of the significance of the church building was not necessary because it did not appear that
any maintenance work would be needed in the vicinity of the church or its well-maintained grounds.
Based on the review of the cultural resource data, some restrictions are needed for overhaul work in and
around site 41LC23. Existing Structure #19/5 is situated about 50 feet south of the south boundary of
site 41LC23. Should overhaul work be needed on this structure, it is recommended that any new pole(s)
be placed in the holes of the existing H-frame structure. Should the location of this structure need to
slightly moved, then it is recommended that it be moved southward rather than northward. Care should
also be taken to utilize the existing dirt road present within the transmission line corridor, as much as
possible, and avoidance of the portion of the dirt road that lies 50 to 130 feet northeast of the existing
Structure #19/5 during wet weather conditions is recommended.
Review of data on site 41LC25 indicates that existing Structure #8/10 is located just 42 feet southeast of
the southeast corner of the church building. Any needed overhaul work on this structure may proceed
without any special conditions.
Aside from the restrictions recommended in the vicinity of site 41LC23, LCRA Archaeology Services
staff recommends that all other proposed overhaul work proceed as currently planned. However, should
the maintenance personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during work,
then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery. The LCRA Archaeology Services staff
should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the

431

Texas Historical Commission, and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance or
mitigation measures are needed.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on the T-218 transmission line which is also called the Wirtz to Burnet Transmission Line.
This transmission extends for a total length of 16.14 miles, and it is situated in Burnet County, Texas.
A file search showed that this transmission line was not surveyed for cultural resource sites prior to its
original construction because that construction predated the enactment of the State Antiquities Code.
However, in recent years the LCRA Archaeology Services staff has conducted cultural resource field
investigations on this line prior to proposed maintenance work. These investigations consist of field
surveys of the T-108 and T-187 lines which are double circuited with the north and south ends of T-218,
respectively, and the remaining center section of T-218 which was field surveyed in 2007. As a result of
those investigations, two cultural resource sites, 41BT425 and 41BT426, were recorded and assessed.
Site 41BT425 is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter that was assessed as insignificant due to erosion,
gullying, and the more recent impacts from vehicular traffic. Site 41BT426 is a small rockshelter located
in the walls of steep canyon. Potentially significant buried prehistoric deposits were found within the
rockshelter overhang at 41BT426. Traces of historic carvings and graffiti were also found on the walls of
the limestone ledge. Although 41BT426 is a potentially significant site, it will not be affected by any of
the proposed overhaul work due to its location on a steep canyon slope far distant from any of the existing
transmission line structures and access roads.
Based on a review of data from previous cultural resource field investigations, it does not appear that the
proposed overhaul activities have any potential to impact any important cultural resource sites. LCRA
Archaeology Services staff recommends that the proposed T-218 overhaul work be allowed proceed
without any special conditions. However, should the maintenance personnel uncover any presently
unknown buried archaeological materials during work, then work should cease in the immediate area of
the discovery. The LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

LCRA proposes to conduct standard maintenance on transmission line T-153 between the Sim Gideon
and Lockhart substations. Because most of the line had not been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, a cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on June 24-26,
2008. The survey focused on higher probability areas, primarily stream crossings. As it did not appear
that there would be a need for extensive ground disturbance, the survey was conducted largely at a
reconnaissance level. Very few shovel tests were excavated, and of the six newly discovered
archeological sites discovered, most are not documented at a level sufficient to determine State
Archeological Landmark or National Registry status at this time. Future, more intensive projects, such as
a transmission line rebuild, would require additional investigations. The six new archaeological sites are
described below, as are select areas that were not investigated due to lack of clearing needs. The
recommendations in regards to cultural resources are then summarized. Additional information is on file
with Archaeology Services.
41CW117
41CW117 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located for a distance of about 100 m on the lobed edge of a high
ridge overlooking the floodplain valley of Plum Creek to the east. It is within an actively cleared and
managed ranch. Vegetation consists of short grasses and scattered trees. Observed artifacts consisted of
widely scattered pieces of lithic debitage with occasional tested cobbles. The debitage was almost
entirely cortical with characteristics typical of hard hammer, early stage reduction. This is consistent with
the nature of the ridge, which is covered by thin soils overlying a gravel deposit (Queeny gravelly loam).
A single tool was noted near the eastern portion of the site. This was similar to form to a Guadalupe tool,
although there was not a formal bit end.
Although no shovel tests were excavated, the type of site combined with the shallow nature of the soils
indicate the site is fully investigated and that no significant amounts of new information would be present.
The site is not considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places.
41CW118
41CW118 is located on either side and within the channel of a branch of Pecan Branch, a tributary to
Plum Creek which is located about 550 m to the east. Topographically, the series of drainages that
include Pecan Branch appear to represent meanders of Plum Creek. The site is within an actively
managed ranch. The area along the creek is wooded, but there is pasture on either side. The creek
channel is shallow, no more than three feet deep, and broad, perhaps 20 feet wide, with sloping banks.
Cultural materials consist of burned limestone, chert and quartzite, several flakes, a core, and two early
stage bifaces. These are most common within the west bank of the creek, and in the northern half of the
ROW, and extend north out of the ROW. Some less concentrated material was visible along the pasture
fence east of the drainage, and also south of the ROW. There were also several pieces of weathered,
patinated bone, including long bone fragments, a portion of a jaw, and sections of vertebrae, all from a
large mammal, most likely a cow or bison. The patination was similar to that seen in bone from buried
archaeological contexts, but burial in flood silts may also have caused the appearance. These bones were

436

Figure 186. Project 38.08, T-153 Maintenance in Bastrop and Caldwell counties.

437

largely within the creek and within its eastern bank, mostly centered in the ROW. There is some spatial
association of bone, burned rock and debitage. On top of the eastern creek bank there was evidence of
recent rush burning. This was easily distinguishable from the artifacts and burned rock within the creek,
but make assessment of the upper creek bank much more problematic. Because there are no impacts
expected from the maintenance project, no shovel tests were excavated. Possible future projects that
involve subsurface disturbances (e.g. a rebuild, construction of creek crossing) should involve additional
investigations to determine what, if any, additional aspects of the site are present. Eligibility for SAL or
NRHP status remains unknown.
41CW119
41CW119 is located on the end of a low interfluvial lobe between Plum Creek, located about 400 m to the
west, and a minor tributary located about 100 m to the east. The site consists of a widely dispersed scatter
of burned rock (quartzite and chert) and chert debitage, including a few interior flakes and 3-4 larger hard
hammer flakes. The existing dirt ranch road had been recently bladed which had exposed a few discrete
areas of blackened soil. These almost certainly represent recent burning episodes, but there is a remote
chance they could be the remains of earlier cultural activities. The burned rock may also be, at least
partially, the result of recent brush burning, but the flakes and burned rock are typically spatially
associated, and do exhibit clustering. Because no subsurface impacts are expected here, no shovel tests
were excavated. The visible materials with in the dirt road are certainly disturbed, but it is unknown to
what extent the site may extend within the rest of the ROW. Possible future projects that involve
subsurface disturbances (e.g. a rebuild, construction of creek crossing) should involve additional
investigations to determine what, if any, additional aspects of the site are present. Eligibility for SAL or
NRHP status remains unknown.
41CW120
41CW120 is located on the sloping western bank of Dry Creek. It is open pasture in apparent deep, sandy
soils. The site consists of two burned rocks and a flake seen in an exposure about 60 m from the creek
channel. Cow trails within the creek bank were examined and no other cultural material was noted.
Because no impacts of any kind are expected here, no shovel tests were excavated. The site is being
recorded for management purposes. Possible future projects that involve subsurface disturbances (e.g. a
rebuild, construction of creek crossing) should involve additional investigations to determine what, if any,
additional aspects of the site are present. Eligibility for SAL or NRHP status remains unknown.
41BP840
41P840 is located at the edge of a cleared and sometimes plowed field on top of an interfluvial lobe
overlooking Elm Creek located 300 m to the west, at an elevation of 40 ft below the site. The site is a
lithic scatter consisting of the very small (5 mm) patinated edge of a biface and a fractured cobble of
purple quartzite. No other cultural material was seen on the slopes or banks on either side of Elm Creek,
although visibility is often limited by fairly dense young mesquite growth. . Due to the low impact
nature of the project, no shovel tests were excavated. This small scatter is being recorded as an
archaeological site for management purposes. Possible future projects that involve subsurface
disturbances (e.g. a rebuild, construction of creek crossing) should involve additional investigations to
determine what, if any, additional aspects of the site are present. Eligibility for SAL or NRHP status
remains unknown.
41P841
Historic Site Description
This historic site extends from approximately 30 meters northeast of the point at which the transmission
line crosses State Highway 304 to about 110 meters southwest of STR 9/3 for a total length of about 100
meters. Most of the materials observed at the site are located in the eastern half of the transmission line

438

ROW, and it is probable that the site extends further eastward outside of the ROW. Two historic features
– an underground cistern with above ground collar and concrete water trough – are present within the
transmission line corridor along with an artifact scatter.
The collar of the cistern is readily visible in the south-central part of the site as it rises 89 cm above
ground surface directly under the transmission centerline. The cistern appears to be constructed of
cement and the collar has an additional exterior coating of reddish-brown bricks. Inspection of several
bricks that have fallen off the collar walls showed that they have no maker’s marks and that they are
probably of local late 19th century manufacture. The interior opening of the collar has a 55 cm diameter
while the overall outer diameter of the collar is 101 cm. The subsurface interior of the cistern is filled up
to a level of about 3 meters below ground surface with trash debris that seems to consist of items less than
50 years in age.
The concrete trough is situated at the extreme southwestern edge of the site. It measures about 2 meters
in length and 85 cm in width. It is less well-preserved than the cistern, and is probably not as old as the
cistern. The trough probably functioned as a feeding or watering trough for farm animals.
Although no artifacts were noted around the trough, several yellow and reddish-brown bricks were
observed in the ROW corridor east and southeast of the cistern. Two sandstone boulders that may be
foundation stones for a structure were noted at distances 1.5 meters east and 17 meters southeast of the
cistern collar.
Most artifacts, however, were found about 20 to 40 meters northeast of the cistern within and north of the
bed of a dirt road. Artifacts observed in that area include approximately 50 plain whiteware ceramic
sherds, 1 porcelain fragment, 6 pieces of aquamarine colored glass, 4 purple (solarized) glass fragments, 1
clear glass plate rim fragment, 8 rectangular-headed nails, 1 metal wood stove leg fragment, and 1 metal
door or cabinet handle. Also, one whiteware sherd fragment with a portion of a maker’s mark was seen.
The maker’s mark consisted of the letters R JAU in a line above a second line having the numbers and
letters 5 4 N.
About 13 to 20 meters east of the east edge of this artifact scatter, a cluster of small and mostly
rectangular shaped sandstone rocks could be seen on ground surface. Since this area is outside of the
transmission line corridor, it was not intensive inspected. However, these rocks may have been associated
with a former chimney or house foundation.
An examination of the 1902 Bastrop, Texas 1/125,000 USGS map shows a cluster of eight houses at the
approximate location of the site. Numerous other clusters of houses are shown at other nearby locations
on the same terrace system that overlooks the Colorado River floodplain. Additionally, many other
houses are shown along dirt roads on the river floodplain. It is probable that the houses on the terrace and
the floodplain are related to intensive agriculture activities in the area called Hills Prairie.
No house structure is shown on the 1948 Bastrop, Texas 15’ USGS map at the site location. However, a
house is shown on the opposite side of State Hwy. 304 at a distance of 60 meters south of the site. A barn
or abandoned house is also shown about 80 meters south-southwest of the site on the 1982 Bastrop, Texas
7.5’ USGS map.
Plum Creek
Plum Creek has overflow channels that have formed sloughs or wetlands on either side, but most
significantly on the west, where the channel appears to b the actual creek. It was possible to travel around
the south edge of the slough and approach the actual creek channel, which is very deep (15-20 ft) and
heavily wooded except under the transmission line, where it is extremely brushy. Both exposed banks of

439

Plum Creek were examined, but there was no evidence of cultural material. Neither bank appears
conducive to near-surface archaeological sites. Because only shredding appears to be necessary, no
shovel tests were excavated. A representative of the landowner on the east side of Plum Creek mentioned
that “arrowheads” had been found on the west bank of the creek, north of the ROW. If it becomes
necessary to bulldoze an access path to the actual Plum Creek bank, then additional cultural resource
work should be considered, but at present it appears that any such path could be made with minimal
disturbance.
Colorado River – north bank
This was walked, but only one shovel test was excavated. Future ground disturbing projects would
require additional investigations.
Summary of Recommendations
There are only three locations on T-153 that are should be considered for avoidance within the scope of
standard maintenance procedures.
1.
Between Hwy 304 and STR 9/3 is an historic cistern within the center of the ROW. It is located
within an open field, and it does not appear that even mowing is needed at this time. However, crews
should take care not to damage this piece of private property.
2.
Nearer Lockhart, there are two small stream crossings that should not be modified if possible.
The first is Pecan Branch of Plum Creek, and the crossing is located about 150 feet west of STR 15. At
present it is drivable without modification. If it is felt significant earth movement is necessary here,
additional archaeological investigations are warranted.
3.
The second is a somewhat larger stream known as Dry Creek. At present it is not drivable, and it
does not appear to have been crossed by vehicles in the past. It is located immediately west of STR 7. If
it is felt significant earth movement is necessary here, additional archaeological investigations are
warranted.
Elsewhere, there is some concern at Plum Creek, which is flanked on both sides, but significantly so on
the south, by sloughs or wetlands. On the south, the actual bank of Plum Creek, east of STR 14, is
approachable only by going around the slough for some distance on either side of the ROW. If significant
earth movement is necessary to access this area, then additional archaeological investigations are
warranted.
Beginning at STR 12 and continuing for a distance of 300 ft west significant earth movement should be
avoided. It appears that only shredding will be necessary here.

July 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
maintenance and clearing work on the T-467 transmission line which is also called the Highway 36 to
Bellville South Transmission Line. This transmission extends for a total length of 16.14 miles, and it is
situated in Washington and Austin counties, Texas.
A file search showed that this transmission line was surveyed for cultural resources in 2003 by the Hicks
& Company archaeological staff. The cultural resource survey was undertaken due to LCRA’s proposal
to upgrade the line by replacing wooden H-frame structures. Despite intensive field survey efforts along
the entire T-467 line, no cultural resource sites were found during that survey.
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas shows that no new cultural
resource sites have been recorded within or near the T-467 corridor in the years following the Hicks &
Company survey. Based on the negative results of the previous survey work, the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed maintenance work be allowed to proceed as currently
planned. However, should the maintenance personnel uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find
can be assessed in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission, and a determination can be made
as to whether any avoidance or mitigation measures are needed.

As we discussed, for the proposed 318-acre brush clearing project on the newly acquired property below
Buchanan Dam:
The Environmental Checklist states clearing will be done by shredders and/or grinders, and that ground
disturbance will be minimal. At present there are three known cultural resource sites that could be
negatively impacted by heavy machinery - 41BT57, 41BT419 , and 41BT424. These areas are shown
from east to west on the attached figure. Please avoid moving heavy equipment through these three
areas. Hand clearing is acceptable if necessary. We can also visit with you and/or the clearing crews to
further flag or mark these three areas.
Because we have not conducted a complete survey of the property, other sensitive sites may be present.
Please use as much care as possible to avoid ground disturbance.

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

LCRA proposes to enhance existing transmission line T-374 located in Kimble County, Texas. This line
was surveyed for cultural resources by PBS&J in 1999 prior to its construction. Twenty-two prehistoric
archaeological sites were recorded along the line, and an additional nine along access roads. Of these
sites, only two, 41KM169 and 41KM179 appear to have any additional research potential beyond that
already recorded. Ground-disturbing activities should be avoided within these two sites.
Site 41KM169 is an open campsite with burned rock and mussel shell present. PBS&J archaeologists
found no evidence that the site extended into the transmission line ROW. The site is located
approximately midway between STRs 18 and 19. It is therefore recommended that all activities
associated with the project be confined to the ROW between these two structures.
Site 41KM179 is a substantial burned rock midden located along a drainage between STRs 32 and 33.
Recent aerial imagery indicates the ROW was not cleared across this drainage at the time of construction,
and topographic maps suggest a stream crossing is not likely. It is therefore recommended that no ground
disturbance take place within this drainage, located about 530 feet south of STR 32 and 930 feet north of
STR 33.
If these two areas cannot be avoided than Archaeology Services should be contacted so that additional
avoidance measures can be devised or potential additional investigations can be conducted.

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services require approximately 1100 cubic
yards of fill for planned construction at the LCRA’s Wirtz Substation in Burnet County. A site has been
chosen on LCRA property 1000 feet north of the substation for the source of this fill. This particular area
has been used as a source of construction fill in the past, perhaps as far back as the early 1950s when the
dam was constructed. No archeological surveys have been conducted in this area and it is not known if
any cultural resource sites are present or even if intact soil still exists. Since removal of the fill will
damage or destroy any unrecorded archeological sites, LCRA’s Archeology Services conducted a field
survey of the project area on July 31, 2008.
The area of the proposed construction fill source lies along the west edge of an existing borrow pit with
gradually sloping walls. Stream-worn cobbles and gravels are exposed near the top of the walls with
coarse granite sand below. The fill for the upcoming construction project will be removed from along the
upper edge of the existing pit, in effect extending it westwards. The level ground immediately outside the
pit has obviously been bladed at one time, removing any topsoil and leaving Pleistocene gravels exposed
on the surface. Because of its location, any cultural material would only be found on or just below the
surface, and be easily visible since vegetation is sparse.
The ground along the upper edge of the borrow pit was inspected for artifacts and features such as hearths
that might have been shallowly buried prior to the blading. No cultural material was found during the
survey and no archeological site is present in the project area.
Based on the results of the field investigation, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the
project proceed as planned As with all projects of less than two acres without archeological sites, our
staff will report the results of the investigation in our Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission
for Calendar Year 2008.

Date of Investigations:

August 2008

On August 5, 2008, LCRA Archaeology Services staff revisited a prehistoric open campsite located along
a right bank tributary of Plum Creek near the town of Lockhart (Figures 191, 192). The site was recorded
June 24, 2008, by LCRA Archaeology Services staff as part of reconnaissance investigations prior to
standard maintenance activities on the transmission line. As no impacts were expected at the site,
investigations were limited to surface examination, resulting in unknown – and therefore potential –
eligibility for listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places. The revisit consisted of additional subsurface investigations within the transmission line
ROW in order to make a determination of eligibility for that portion of the site.
Four shovel tests (STs) were excavated, two on each side of the creek. Shovel Test 1 was placed on a low
rise near the north edge of the ROW on the east bank of the stream. It was excavated to a depth of 60 cm
through dark gray clay (loam) which graded to yellowish-brown clay (loam). Carbonate lenses were
observed between 20 and 30 cm and between 50 and 60 cm, and vertical cracks were present in the walls
of the test to a depth of 30 cm. Recovery (from 20 cm levels) consisted of one flake and three small
burned rock fragments in Level 1, four chips, three small chunks and one small burned rock in Level 2,
and no recovery from Level 3.
Shovel Test 2 was placed about 25 m south of ST 1, near the south edge of the ROW, in an area
containing a light, diffuse scatter of burned rock and lithic debitage. It was excavated through 50 cm of
gray clay which graded to yellowish-brown clay. Level 1 contained one chert spall and one small bone
sliver, Level 2 contained two chert chips, and there was no recovery from Level 3 (to 50 cm).
Shovel Test 3 was placed on the opposite side of the creek near an existing, recent dirt road crossing at
about the centerline of the ROW. It was excavated through 40 cm of dark yellowish-brown clay. Level 1
contained three flake fragments and two chert chunks, while Level 2 contained two burned spalls in the
upper 5 cm. There was no recovery below 25 cm.
Shovel Test 4 was placed about 15 m northwest of ST 3, near the north edge of the ROW. It was
excavated through 30 cm of dark yellowish-brown clay. No artifacts were recovered from this test.
As a result of these investigations it was determined that the data recovery potential from the portion of
the site within the transmission line ROW is too limited to warrant listing as a State Archeological
Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Site integrity has also been
compromised by extensive land clearing and brush burning, as well as obviously recent bone mixed with
possible prehistoric bone within the ROW. Subsurface aspects of the site remain unknown outside the
ROW. Should future work by LCRA include expanding the ROW then additional investigations,
especially to the north, are suggested.

Type of Investigation(s):

Date of Investigations:

August 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Lytton Springs Auto-Transformer Project will consist of
expansion the electrical substation facilities at Austin Energy’s Lytton Springs Substation and
construction of seven new transmission structures to tie LCRA’s existing T-382 and T-534 transmission
lines into the new substation facilities. This memo covers only the substation portion of the project, with
a separate report for the transmission line work to be issued at a future date.
The proposed substation expansion project is located about 0.70 miles east of the Mendoza community in
northern Caldwell County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed substation additions will include the
construction of two new bays immediately west of the fenced perimeter of the existing substation. These
will cover an area measuring about 75x20 meters and will be constructed in an area not previously
disturbed by the original substation construction. LCRA will also construct a new control house just
outside the substation’s northeast fence in an undisturbed area. Other substation work will occur within
the fence of existing substation in areas heavily disturbed by previous construction.
A file search showed that the original Lytton Springs substation area was not surveyed for cultural
resource sites in 1979 as a part of the Fayette to Lytton Springs Transmission Corridor project by
archaeologists from the University of Texas. No cultural resource sites have ever been recorded at the
location of the substation.
The file search also indicated that there are no previously recorded archaeological sites in the proposed
substation expansion area. Available data suggests that there is a low probability for any unrecorded
Native American archaeological sites to be present in the proposed substation station expansion area. To
assess the potential for historic period archaeological sites, historic maps consisting of the 1910 Austin,
Texas 30’ USGS map (field surveyed in 1895-1896), the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’ USGS map, and the
1968 Creedmoor, Texas 7.5’ USGS map were examined to determine if any buildings had ever been
present within or near the project area. While the 1910 map did not indicate any structures in the project
vicinity, the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’ USGS map showed a farmhouse that was located within the
southwest part of the property area. That same structure is then depicted as an abandoned house or barn
on the 1968 Creedmoor, Texas 7.5’ USGS map. Although a recent aerial map indicates that the building
is no longer present, there appeared to be some potential that historic period archaeological remains such
as building foundations and artifacts could be present within or near the substation expansion area. For
this reason, a cultural resource field survey appeared to be warranted.
The cultural resource field survey of the areas where the new bays and control house will be built was
conducted on August 18, 2008 by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff. Field survey methods used
consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey along with shovel testing. The field survey quickly
indicated that large sections of the area where the new bays will be constructed are covered by thick
grasses. Good ground surface visibility is present though along the outside edges of the existing
substation fence on the eastern edges of the bay construction area. Those areas were intensively
examined. Elsewhere, the archaeologist walked zig-zag transects to find bare and eroded patches of
ground surface that afforded some ground surface visibility. To further evaluate the potential for historic

452

453

period materials, three shovel tests were excavated in areas with poor ground surface visibility. The
shovel tests measured 40 cm in diameter and were excavated in 20 cm increments. All fill from the
shovel tests was either screened through ¼ inch wire mesh or, in the case of dense clays, was broken apart
with shovel and trowel to search for any artifacts. No cultural resource sites were found in the area where
the new bays are to be constructed.
The archaeologist then proceeded to survey the area where the new control house will be constructed.
Some areas with good ground surface visibility were found along the adjacent substation fenceline and in
areas west of an oil containment pond. No cultural resource sites were found in the control house
construction area.
Since the areas examined for the substation work are less than two acres in total size and no cultural
resource sites were found, a report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission at this
time. Instead, the substation construction may proceed at this time and our staff will report the results of
the investigation at the end of the year in our Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for
Calendar Year 2008. Also, as stated in the first paragraph of this memo, a separate investigation report on
the transmission line work associated with this project will be produced at a later date.

Date of Investigations:

August 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the part of the Lytton Springs Auto-Transformer Project that involves work on
transmission line structures. A file search showed that the portion of the T-534 transmission that extends
cross-country from the Lytton Springs Substation to the Mendoza Substation had been previously
surveyed for cultural resources by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff in 1993. No cultural resource
sites were found during that investigation. Given the results of that investigation, no additional fieldwork
is needed for the construction of the two new structures in that right-of-way easement.
The file search also showed that there are no previously recorded sites on the T-382 line between the
Lytton Springs Substation and the Turnersville Substation. Procedures involving in the installation of
new conductor wires on the T-382 line between these two substations indicates that there will be no new
ground disturbance caused by vehicular traffic associated with installation of new conductor. Such work
involving no new ground disturbance is categorically excluded from review by the Texas Historical
Commission under Section 191.0525(e)(2) of the Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resources
Code. Thus, the work on T-382 may proceed.
A cultural resource assessment for other work on transmission lines T-534 and T-382 that will occur
within the boundaries of the Lytton Springs Substation has been previously conducted and a report was
sent to the Texas Historical Commission. That work will involve relocation of some the transmission
structures within the substation boundaries. The cultural resource assessment for that work showed that
no significant cultural resource sites will be affected.

Date of Investigations:

August 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
maintenance work on its existing T-367 transmission line which is also known as the Cedar Hills/
Swiftex/Sim Gideon line. This transmission extends for a total length of 19.88 miles, and it is situated in
Bastrop County, Texas.
A file search showed that the transmission line was surveyed for cultural resource sites in 1995 by
archaeologists from Espey, Huston, & Associates (EH&A) during two separate investigations prior to
LCRA’s rebuilding of the line. As a result of those surveys, a total of 17 cultural resource sites were
recorded and assessed. The file search also showed that three addition cultural resource sites have been
found in more recent years by archaeologists from Texas State University in the portion of the
transmission line right-of-way (ROW) that transverses the Texas Army National Guard’s Camp Swift
training facility.
Review of data generated by EH&A and Texas State University work indicates that 6 of the 20 previously
recorded cultural resource sites on the T-367 transmission line are potentially significant and, thus,
require protection from any damages that might occur during the upcoming maintenance work. These
six sites consist of 41BP197, 41BP386, 41BP387, 41BP388, 41BP389, and 41BP778.
Locational information for these sites is as follows:
41BP197: From 150 ft. north-northeast of STR #276 to 75 ft. north-northeast of STR #277;
41BP386: From STR #188 to 165 ft. south-southeast of STR #188;
41BP387: From 245 ft. north-northwest of STR #187 to 420 ft. south-southeast of STR #187;
41BP388: From 50 ft. south-southwest of STR #264 to 300 ft. north-northeast of STR #264;
41BP389: From 225 ft. north-northwest of STR #192 to 150 ft. south-southeast of STR #192;
41BP778: From STR #219 to 100 ft. south-southeast of STR #219.
Descriptions and maps of these six sites found in previous cultural resource survey reports suggests that
use of a hydro-axe machine would not cause any additional damage to the sites beyond the damages
already caused by the original construction and rebuilding of the transmission line. However, any use of
machinery that causes any subsurface soil disturbance on these five sites is prohibited. Additionally,
since cultural materials at sites 41BP387 and 41BP389 appear to extend to the banks of stream channels,
the LCRA maintenance staff will need to consult with the LCRA archaeological staff prior to constructing
any needed new low water stream crossings adjacent to these two sites.

Date of Investigations:

September, October 2008

LCRA proposed to conduct trenching for oak wilt containment at its Gloster Bend Resource Area in
Travis County. Gloster Bend. Gloster Bend has been surveyed extensively for a previous development
project (Malof and Prikryl 2007). Trenching consisted of using a rocksaw-like piece of equipment that
excavates a trench approximately 10 cm wide and 1.5 m deep. The trench is automatically backfilled as
the trenching progresses. Following a phone conversation with Mark Denton at the Texas Historical
Commission it was determined that trenching would be monitored by LCRA Archaeology Services staff
in areas where archaeological sites were either known to exist or where there was the possibility of
undiscovered site being present. In October, 2008, LCRA Archaeology Services staff monitored
trenching in the northern section of the property. The monitoring was conducted to ensure avoidance at
site 41TV2267 and to more fully evaluate an open field that has not been systematically tested.
As a result of the monitoring it was determined that 41TV2267 was not impacted. It was also discovered
that there are deep soils within the field and as a result extensive ground disturbance should be avoided in
this area until a formal testing procedure cane be completed.

LCRA proposed a series of land and brush management activities at its Gloster Bend Resource Area.
These activities included chemical treatments, hand clearing (limbing up), and some mechanical removal
(by use of a grinder) of vegetation. Much of this activity was planned for an area that extensively
surveyed for ongoing park development projects (Malof and Prikryl 2008). Some other aspects were
planned for sections of the property that have been intensively surveyed (but not necessarily reported on)
lands inventory projects. Following a conversation with Mark Denton at the Texas Historical
Commission, it was determined that LCRA Archaeology Services would coordinate with land
management personnel and use best management practices to ensure appropriate treatment of cultural
resource sites. Following discussions with the project manager, it was determined that all known sites
would be avoided. Other areas that are not well known archaeologically have not yet been subjected to
clearing activities.
LCRA Archaeology Services continues to monitor proposed clearing activities. Due to endangered
species concerns none will occur in areas outside the previously surveyed development area between
March and August of 2009. As specific areas and individual sites are impacted, LCRA Archaeology
Services staff will continue to coordinate with land management staff and the Texas Historical
Commission as necessary.

Date of Investigations:

October 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to build a fence along a portion of the
southeastern boundary of its Double Horn Preserve starting from Lake Travis and running south
southwestwards approximately 900 meters to an existing cross fence. The proposed fence will pass
through three previously recorded archeological sites: 41BT100, 41BT101, and 41BT389. It will also
skirt the south edge of a fourth site, 41BT364. All these sites contain prehistoric components while
41BT389 also contains a Historic component representing a mid 19th century homestead and a later early
20th farmhouse both lying outside LCRA property. With the exception of 41BT364, these sites are
eligible for State Archeological Landmark designation.
On September 23, 2008, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff made a field survey of the proposed fence
route in order to locate any unrecorded sites in areas where substantial impacts – mainly land clearing will likely occur with this project. The survey found that most of the proposed fence route will run
through a corridor that was probably cleared years ago and is now only obstructed by branches from
adjacent trees. Clearing will probably still be needed at the west end of the proposed fence route and
through sites 41BT100 and 41BT389.
No new sites were located during the survey, however shovel testing was not done and buried cultural
deposits could still be present outside of previously recorded site areas. Areas in the vicinity of 41BT101
where the spring emits from the escarpment are particularly sensitive since the limits of this site have not
been established. Possible burned rock was seen on the surface in the thicket south of the springhead.
To avoid impacting these significant sites and any unrecorded sites, it is proposed that the clearing of
trees and other vegetation be done by methods - such as using mechanical shears attached to a skid steer that will not cause below ground disturbances. Shallow ruts of one to two inches will probably not harm
buried archeological deposits and are permissible. If deeper ground disturbances in any particular area
are deemed unavoidable then LCRA Archeology Services will need to conduct testing at that location
prior to clearing.

September 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource file search for the proposed FY09 overhaul and maintenance work on Transmission Line T-263,
which is also known as the La Grange to FPP Transmission Line. The file search consisted of a check of
the Texas Historical Commission’s computized Site Atlas and the LCRA’s internal cultural resource files.
The file search indicated that the LCRA Archaeology Services staff had previously conducted a desktop
review of the T-263 line for proposed maintenance work in FY04. At that time, it was noted that there are
three previously recorded archeological sites, 41FY459, 41FY477, and 41FY518, located within the T263 right-of-way. These archeological sites are all located near the east end of the transmission line
corridor, and all were recorded by LCRA archeologists and contractors in association with the LCRA
Fayette Power Plant project. Current review of the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site
Atlas indicates that no new cultural resource sites have been recorded within or near the T-263 right-ofway (ROW) since the time of the FY04 review memo.
41FY459 is a multi-component archeological site as it contains both prehistoric materials and the
reinterred human remains from the historic Biegel-December cemetery. Although the prehistoric
component clearly extends in the transmission line corridor, the prehistoric materials were assessed as
insignificant by the LCRA archeological staff and the Texas Historical Commission in 1985. Thus, the
presence of the prehistoric materials does not place any special restrictions on the overhaul and
maintenance work. A visit to cemetery area in 2006 during a separate project showed that the reinterred
human remains and their associated gravestones lay well outside of the transmission line ROW. Thus, the
proposed overhaul and maintenance work should not have any negative impacts on the cemetery area.
The second site, 41FY477, is a former Charpentier family historic cemetery. In 1975, the LCRA
exhumed the three known graves and reinterred the remains in a cemetery in DeWitt County at the
request of family descendents. The former cemetery should within or very near the T-263 ROW in the
vicinity of Transmission Structure #16/3. According to Doug Marek of the LCRA Transmission Services
staff, the overhaul work will not include the replacement of Structure #16/3. Care should be taken during
any maintenance work if any ground-disturbing activities are included in the unlikely event that any
unmarked graves might have been overlooked.
The third site, 41FY518, was recorded in 1992 by the LCRA Archeology Services staff during inventory
work on the LCRA’s FPP property. This historic site was a rural farmstead that was settled about 1907
according to archival research. Construction of a newer house in the 1960s on the exact same site as the
older structure essentially destroyed the older site component. The Texas Historical Commission
concurred with the LCRA’s assessment that the site is not significant in 1992. Thus, there are no special
restrictions for the clearing and maintenance work in the area of this archeological site.
Aside from the data on previously recorded archeological sites, review of stream drainage and
topographic data would suggest that the only high probability area for unrecorded significant prehistoric
cultural resource sites would be along the terraces that flank Cedar Creek between Transmission
Structures #9/2 and #9/4 near the west end of the T-263 route. Should the LCRA field personnel involved

in the overhaul and maintenance need to conduct any ground-disturbing activities along stream banks in
the area between Structures #9/2 and #9/4, then the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be notified
so that the area can be investigated in advance of the dirtwork.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are also applicable. Should any presently unknown
buried archeological materials be found, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery
and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714. LCRA staff
will then work with the Texas Historical Commission to assess the emergency discovery finding and
determine if any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed. In such a situation, work can continue in
other areas where no archeological materials are present.

October 2008

The LCRA plans to build a new substation on a 2.4 acre tract owned by PEC near the small community of
Dobyville in Burnet County. Since the LCRA will be funding the project, a cultural resources
investigation is required before construction begins. LCRA’s Archeology Services staff first did a file
search to see if previous archeological investigations have taken place in the project area. We found that
PBS&J had surveyed a portion of the current project area in 2004 as part of an LCRA transmission line
rebuild project. The PBS&J archeologists surveyed within the 100’ ROW of the T-109 transmission line
which bisects the PEC property and covers an area of 0.9 acre within this tract. No sites were recorded in
the T-109 corridor. The remaining 1.5 acre of the property has never been investigated archeologically.
Therefore Archeology Services conducted a field survey on October 14, 2008 to determine if any
archeological sites are present and to assess their eligibility for State Archeological Landmark
designation.
All areas within the PEC property were walked over by Archeology Services staff. Ground visibility was
generally good with thick grass cover encountered only in the northwest corner. The property has been
cleared of trees in recent years and the ground probably bladed. Old burned piles appear to have been
compressed into the ground in places. No cultural material was seen other than that associated with
recent PEC use of the property.
Following the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) guidelines for survey-level investigation, six
shovel tests were dug across the project area (Figure 1) to look for buried cultural material. Each test
involved excavating a 30 cm diameter circular hole and screening the dirt through a ¼” mesh to recover
artifacts. No artifacts were recovered during the shovel testing other than a fragment of a modern Coke
bottle in Shovel Test 6. All the tests encountered limestone bedrock or caliche at various depths, the
deepest being Shovel Test 5 in the southeast corner of the tract where bedrock was struck at 44 cm below
surface. The soil in this area was noticeably more clayey and darker in color with a surface zone of ashy
loam containing scattered charcoal, evidence of the recent clearing operations. The thinnest soil cover
was found in Shovel Test 2 on the north edge of the project area where limestone was found at a depth of
15 cm below the overlying pale yellow loam. To some degree, the soils encountered during testing
conformed with those mapped by the US Soil Conservation Service but the thin loamy Brackett soils
were found to cover a larger area of the PEC tract, approximately the western half, with the clayey Doss
soils covering most of the eastern half of the property.
To summarize, no archeological sites were found in the project area. In accordance with our MOU with
the THC, the agency which oversees compliance with the antiquity protection laws, projects less than two
acres in size where no archeological sites were recorded do not require a report and 30 day review period.
Instead, the substation project can proceed by virtue of this memo. Considering the intensity of the
survey and the previous ground disturbances, it is highly unlikely that any archeological features were
missed during our field investigation. However, if construction crews should uncover unexpected cultural
material, they should cease operations at the location of discovery and contact Archeological Services so
an evaluation can be made.

December 2008

The owner of the Reserve on Lake Travis development wishes to dredge construction fill from three
coves extending into his property; these coves have been designated as Proposed Dredging North Site,
Proposed Dredging South Site 1, and Proposed dredging South Site 2 (Figure 1). While he owns the
portion of these coves above 670’ amsl, the LCRA owns the land below this elevation. All three coves
below 680’ amsl have not been surveyed for archeological sites so the proposed dredging could harm any
unrecorded archeological deposits present on LCRA land. After inspecting a map showing near-shore
contours of the lake bottom, the sides of the North Site cove were found to be steep with little potential
for archeological sites, however the two southern coves were depicted as having gradual inclines that
could harbor archeological deposits. On December 29, 2008, LCRA’s Archeology Services conducted a
cultural resources survey of the two southern coves to locate archeological sites and assess their potential
eligibility for State Archeological Landmark status. The combined area surveyed of both coves was 1.9
acre.
Proposed Dredging South Site 1 – the western and smaller of the two south coves - was found to contain
little or no sediments along its banks, with mostly bare limestone rock and talus visible. The bottom of
the cove is filled with recent sediments of sand and silt intermixed with driftwood and other debris. No
artifacts were found.
Proposed South Site 2, a somewhat larger cove than Site 1, did contain soil on its western bank near the
end of the cove. Shovel testing this area failed to recover any artifacts and the sediments were found to
contain large amounts of detritus (small rocks and organic matter) that indicate disturbance. A burned
rock scatter in the area was shovel tested and found to be shallow and intermixed with substantial
amounts of ash and charcoal but no artifacts. This feature appears to be the remains of a relatively recent
burn pile.
Since the portion of the project on LCRA property covers less than two acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and
the dredging can proceed without further archeological investigation. However, if the work crews should
uncover any presently unknown archeological features, dredging should stop in the immediate area of
discovery and LCRA Archeology Services should be contacted at 1-800-7776-5272, ext. 6714.

A private developer wishes to quarry sediments on Calcasieu Point to be used for construction fill (Figure
1). The area he proposes to dredge includes lake bottom lying between elevations of 670’ and 666’ amsl
which is owned by the LCRA. LCRA Archeology Services conducted a survey of the LCRA portion of
the proposed dredging area on September 30, 2008 to determine if Site 41TV1431, previously recorded
on the adjacent mainland, extends into that area or if other unknown sites are present there.
The entire point was found to be a gravel bar with a thick bed of sand packed with cobbles mostly of chert
and quartz overlying gravelly clay or limestone bedrock. Shovel testing found the cobble bed to be up
three feet thick in areas. These deposits, especially the upper foot, are loose and appear redeposited by
water currents. The only artifact recovered in the three shovel tests placed on the gravel bar was a simple
flaked tool in the upper, loose sediments. The artifact had a slight surface sheen suggesting it has been
pushed around in the sediments by water current and therefore is not in its original context. No true
archeological sites were found.
Since the portion of the project on LCRA property covers less than two acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and
the dredging can proceed without further archeological investigation. However, if the work crews should
uncover any presently unknown archeological features, dredging should stop in the immediate area of

On October 6, 2008, LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a field survey of Llano County’s
proposed boat ramp project on Lake Buchanan. A cultural resource investigation was needed because
most of the construction will take place on LCRA-owned lake bottom. The survey found that more than
half the project area was still under water, the lake level at the time being approximately 1008.1’ amsl and
the proposed boar ramp will be constructed down to an elevation of 1000’ amsl.
The portion the project area above the water level – approximately the west half – was found to be
stripped of its natural soil cover by wave action leaving redeposited sand and gravels over decomposing
granite bedrock. Any archeological deposits that might have existed in the area have now been washed
away. Because the west half of the project area above 1008.1’ does not have archeological deposits,
construction can proceed in that area However, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff will still need to
inspect the portion of the project area below 1008.1’, when the lake level allows, before construction in
that area can proceed.

T-184 Maintenance

Date of Investigations:

October 2008

The LCRA plans routine maintenance on their T-184 transmission line between the Lockhart and Luling
Substations. The portion of the corridor this line shares with T-153, running a distance of approximately
six miles east from Lockhart, was surveyed by LCRA’s Archeology Services staff in June, 2008. In
addition a small area where T-184 crosses Plume Creek was apparently surveyed by TxDOT with no new
sites recorded. The rest of T-184 has not been surveyed for cultural resources and may cross unrecorded
archeological sites. To identify these sites and assess their need for avoidance measures, LCRA’s
Archeology Services staff conducted a field survey on October 7 and 8, 2008. The survey was mostly
restricted to stream crossings where embankment modification by maintenance crews could harm any
archeological deposits that might be present. Areas near water sources also have a higher potential for
prehistoric sites. Three sites were recorded.
41CW122 is a prehistoric quarry site located on an escarpment slope overlooking Sixmile Branch, a small
tributary of Plum Creek. Small cobbles and gravels of flint and quartzite cover two prominent lobes
projecting from the escarpment. Similar gravels cover a large portion of the South Texas Plains and are
often referred to as “Uvalde Gravels.” Scattered amongst these naturally-occurring gravels in moderate
densities are artifacts consisting of flakes and cores, the byproducts of stone tool manufacture. Because
of the absence of diagnostic artifacts, use of this quarry cannot be assigned to any particular time period.
The site is shallow as evidenced by erosion on the side of one of the lobes. Further investigation will add
little additional information about this site and no avoidance procedures are required.
41CW123 consists of a single stone grave marker belonging to G. C. Neill (1820 to 1886) located a short
distance west of FM1322. The grave marker does not appear old and probably was erected by his
descendants, perhaps to replace the original marker which is no longer in evidence. Since the marker lies
within the transmission line ROW, the maintenance crews should be aware of its presence. A small
brushy area immediately south of the marker should also be avoided since it might be the actual grave
site. A large limestone boulder - the original marker? - is visible in the brush.
41CW124 is a lithic procurement locale situated on a slight rise south of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek
where Uvalde gravels are exposed on the surface. Cultural material present is typical of lithic
procurement use and includes flint chipping debris, cores, and at least one early-stage biface. This
material is less dense in the ROW than that at Site 1 and like the first site has little research value.
Therefore, this site does not need to be avoided during maintenance activities.
To summarize, three archeological were recorded during the survey of T-184. One of these sites,
41CW123, consists of a grave marker and a small thicket that could contain the actual grave site. Both
the marker and the thicket need to be avoided during the scheduled maintenance activities. This can

477

478

easily be accomplished since they lie on the east edge of the ROW where clearing is not needed. The
marker lies 20 feet east of the east pole of Structure 34/3 and the thicket is immediately south of the
marker and extends southeastwards outside the ROW. Elsewhere if any unexpected archeological
material is encountered, please cease operations at the find site and contact Archeological Services so an
evaluation can be made.

October 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on its existing T-170 transmission line which is also known as the Winchester to Salem
transmission line. This transmission extends for a total length of 34.74 miles, and it is situated in Fayette
and Washington counties, Texas.
A file search showed that portions of the transmission line were surveyed for cultural resource sites in
1989 by archaeologists from Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. Fourteen archaeological sites were
found by EH&A with three of these, 41FY240, 41FY500, and 41FY504, being recommended for
avoidance and preservation. In 2007, LCRA Archaeology Services staff revisited these three sites prior to
routine maintenance activities in order to assess the potential for the proposed maintenance activities to
impact these sites. At that time the LCRA staff also conducted spot checks at previously unsurveyed
stream crossings and at other areas not previously surveyed that were considered to have moderate to high
probabilities for unrecorded archaeological sites. As a result of that additional work, one new
archaeological site, 41WT72, was recorded and assessed. This new site was recommended for avoidance
and preservation.
During the cultural resource survey for maintenance activities the LCRA staff noted that single
transmission structures are situated within the boundaries of each of the four sites recommended for
avoidance and preservation. The transmission structures associated with each of the archaeological sites
are as follows:
1. STR 7/3 – located within archaeological site 41FY500
2. STR 15/8 – located within archaeological site 41FY504
3. STR 16/2 – located within archaeological site 41FY240
4. STR28/7 – located within archaeological site 41WT72
Although none of the four transmission structures within these archaeological sites will need to be
removed and replaced with a new structure, materials will be replaced or added onto each of the four
structures according to LCRA Transmission Services Engineering staff. Therefore, in each case, one or
two heavy trucks will need to set up adjacent to each pole and utilize outriggers to stabilize the vehicles.
The outriggers could penetrate into the ground, and thus could cause damage to subsurface archaeological
deposits. Our staff recommends that the personnel involved in working on the structures within each site
use 2 or 3 ft square metal sheets or wooden mats on the ground for the outriggers to set on. These metal
sheets/wooden mats are standard safety equipment that operators always have with them in the field. This
should alleviate any damage to subsurface deposits.
Although driving vehicles around these four structures is permissible, it is also recommended that field
personnel try to minimize vehicular traffic as much as possible during work in those areas. The
remainder of the proposed overhaul work may proceed without any restrictions or special conditions.
However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. The emergency discovery
clause states that should the personnel involved in the overhaul work uncover any presently unknown

480

buried archaeological materials or features at other areas, then work should cease in the immediate area of
the discovery. The LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714
so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission, and a
determination can be made as to whether any avoidance or mitigation measures are needed. In such a
situation, work may continue in other areas while the emergency discovery finds are being assessed.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on its existing T-309 transmission line which is also known as the Seguin to Cushman
transmission line. This transmission extends for a total length of only 2.02 miles, and it is located in
urbanized areas of the City of Seguin, Guadalupe County, Texas.
A file search showed that the LCRA Archaeology Services staff had previously conducted a cultural
resource assessment of this transmission line in 2006 when the LCRA purchased the existing transmission
line from the City of Seguin. As a part of the purchase project, LCRA was going to rebuild 12 of the
structures located at the north end of the line. At that time, LCRA was also proposing to conduct some
maintenance work, primarily trimming of tree limbs. The LCRA learned that some of the tree limb
trimming would include a very large oak tree that was considered to have potential historic importance to
some citizens in Seguin. The LCRA Archaeology Services staff researched the issue, and then asked the
Texas Historical Commission for a determination. The THC responded that the tree was not historical
significant and that the maintenance work could proceed.
In that letter to the THC, the LCRA Archaeology Services also provided data on the fact that there were
no previously recorded cultural resource sites elsewhere within the line right-of-way, and that there was a
low probability that any existed given the lack of any stream channels in the immediate vicinity. Further,
the LCRA noted that the vast majority of the ROW lay within previously disturbed areas where city
streets, drainage culverts, buried utility lines, and driveways were present. The THC concurred with the
LCRA’s assessment.
Based on the previous review in 2006, the currently proposed overhaul work may proceed at this time.
However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. The emergency discovery
clause states that should the personnel involved in the overhaul work uncover any presently unknown
buried archaeological materials or features at other areas, then work should cease in the immediate area of

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on its existing T-309 transmission line which is also known as the Plum to La Grange
transmission line. This transmission extends for a total length of 8.39 miles, and it is located in Fayette
County, Texas.
A file search showed that the original T-208 transmission was not served for cultural resource sites prior
to its construction due to the fact that the construction occurred before to the date of the enactment of the
State Antiquities Code. However, in 1980 during a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
cultural resource survey of alternate routes for a proposed rebuilding of State Highway 71, newly
discovered site 41FY195 was found to partially extend into the T-208 right-of-way (ROW). Finds at this
site included hearth features and a Late Prehistoric arrowpoint. TxDOT archaeologists assessed the site
as potentially significant and stated that test excavations would be needed should the site be threatened by
highway construction. However, TxDOT later chose a different route for the highway construction.
In 2004, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource assessment of the T-208
ROW prior to proposed transmission line maintenance work. Site 41FY195 was revisited and one new
archaeological site 41FY539 was recorded during that fieldwork. The LCRA staff found site 41FY195 to
be intact aside from one bulldozed area that had been previously noted in 1980. Cultural materials found
by the LCRA staff included chert chipping debris, burned rocks, and mussel shells. A cutbank exposure
indicated that these types of materials were distributed below ground surface to a depth of 112 cm. The
site was interpreted as a multi-component prehistoric campsite, and the previous assessment of the site’s
potential significance was confirmed. Special restrictions were placed on the maintenance work within
the site boundaries.
The second site investigated by the LCRA staff during the 2004 survey is 41FY539. This site is situated
near State Highway 77 on a high bluff overlooking the east bank of the Colorado River. This site was
determined to be a prehistoric lithic scatter/procurement site with a dense accumulation of chert chipping
debris, cores, and tested cobbles. Depth of cultural deposits was found to be only 30 cm, and no
diagnostic artifacts were found. The LCRA staff assessed the portion of the site within the transmission
line ROW as not significant, but noted that more substantial parts of the site could be present outside of
the transmission line ROW.
The THC concurred with the LCRA’s assessments for 41FY195 and 41FY539. A search of the THC’s
computerized Site Atlas indicates that no additional cultural resource sites have been recorded within the
T-208 ROW since the time of LCRA’s 2004 survey.
As a result of the LCRA’s cultural resource survey for the maintenance project, staff had placed
restrictions on the maintenance work at 41FY195, and had allowed work within the boundaries the second
archaeological site 41FY539 to proceed without any restrictions. Those same recommendations are
applicable for the current overhaul work.

Concerning 41FY195: On the Plan and Profile DWG # 208-C-6-E: Between STA 31200 and Hill Creek,
vehicular traffic should stay on the established access road along the corridor. Additionally, no
bulldozing of vegetation should occur. If Structure 6/6 needs to be replaced, vehicular traffic that leaves
the established road should be kept to the minimum necessary to accomplish the work. If heavy trucks
need to set up adjacent to Structure 6/6 and utilize outriggers, then 2 or 3 ft square metal sheets or wooden
mats should be placed on the ground for the outriggers to set on. All of these actions should alleviate any
damage to subsurface deposits.
Elsewhere, the currently proposed overhaul work may proceed at this time. However, standard

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
overhaul work on its existing T-132 transmission line which is also known as the Flatonia to Hallettsville
transmission line. This transmission extends for a total length of 15.71 miles, and it is situated in Fayette
and Lavaca counties, Texas.
A file search showed that the line was not surveyed for cultural resource sites prior to its original
construction due to the fact that the construction predated the enactment of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. However, portions of the transmission line were surveyed for cultural resource sites in 2007 by the
LCRA Archaeology Services staff in anticipation of maintenance activities. As a result of the LCRA
Archaeology Services staff’s work in 2007, one new archaeological site, 41FY550, was recorded and
assessed. This new site was recommended for avoidance and preservation. Specifically, it was
recommended that the area between existing transmission structure 4/6 and the south bank of Big Rocky
Creek not be subjected to any ground-disturbing activities. That recommendation is applicable for the
current overhaul project.
The memo from the LCRA staff work for the maintenance project also noted that there is a potential for
unrecorded cultural resource sites to exist on the south side floodplain of the Lavaca River and on the
terraces adjacent to Long Branch Creek. On the south side floodplain of the Lavaca River unrecorded
cultural resource sites could be present between transmission structures 11/1 and 11/9. Along Long
Branch Creek, unrecorded cultural resource sites could be present between transmission structures 8/6 and
9/8. These portions of the Lavaca River floodplain and the terraces adjacent to Long Branch Creek were
not investigated by the archaeologists for the maintenance project because it did not appear that any
maintenance activities in those areas would require any ground-disturbing activities. In both of these
stretches of the transmission line, previous cultivation and the previous transmission line construction
activities may have damaged any unrecorded sites. Given this fact, any currently proposed overhaul
work would not further damage such unrecorded sites if it is conducted during dry weather conditions so
that tires of heavy machinery will not create deep ruts in undisturbed subsoils. Therefore, it is
recommended that all proposed overhaul work activities in these two areas be conducted during dry
weather conditions as a precaution to avoid any further impacts to potential sites.
The remainder of the proposed overhaul work may proceed without any restrictions or special conditions.
However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. The emergency discovery
clause states that should the personnel involved in the overhaul work uncover any presently unknown
buried archaeological materials or features at other areas, then work should cease in the immediate area of

situation, work may continue in other areas while the emergency discovery finds are being assessed.

Pedernales Electric Coop proposes to conduct standard maintenance on an approximate 3500 ft-long
distribution line that runs through a portion of LCRA’s Canyon of the Eagles Nature Preserve. They plan
to shred and seppie an average 16 ft width for a total of about 1.3 acres. A few support structures may be
replaced.
LCRA Archaeology Services conducted a cultural resources assessment of the project on September 25,
2008. The assessment consisted of a file and map review. There are no recorded archaeological sites
within the proposed clearing area. Because of the lack of known sites, the limited disturbance and the
relatively small area associated with this project, LCRA Archaeology Services has no objections to the
proposed maintenance work. This investigation will be reported to the Texas Historical Commission in
LCRA’s annual report of investigations.
Future similar projects on LCRA lands should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in order to ensure
LCRA remains in compliance with state antiquities laws.

Part 3. Letters to the THC Requesting Project Clearance through File Searches
In ten cases letters were sent to THC. Six of these requested that no survey was needed, and in all cases
THC agreed. Two others led to additional historical investigations (Project 53.08 - Jarvis Creek Bridge in
Wharton County, Project 57.08 - Landa Mills remediation in New Braunfels), one to detailed recording of
cisterns removed from Muleshoe Bend Park (Project 39.08), and one to emergency recovery of an
apparent Toyah-aged bison kill in Bastrop County (Project 9.08). These are all reported in Part 3 with
additional detailed information for the last three projects reported in Part 4

February 2008

LCRA proposes to enlarge an existing maintenance yard facility located at its South Shore Park on Lake
Bastrop in central Bastrop County, Texas. The existing facility is approximately 0.4 acres in size, and
abuts a septic field. A 35’ x 95’ area to the west of the facility and a 35’ x 100’ area to the south will
have vegetation removed by bulldozer and then covered with compacted roadbase material. Total
proposed impacts total 0.164 acres.
The existing facility and proposed improvements are within previously recorded archaeological site
41BP354, a part of the Camp Swift Demolition Area (Tomka and Crouch 1996). Materials found within
the site included inert land mines and small arms ordnance, along with screw pickets and barbed wire
entanglements. Most of the material and apparent activity area was located in the southern portion of the
site. Recommendations were for additional study, and/or preservation and erosion control.
More recent work in the area has included non-published inventory assessments as well as a trail system
running near the facility (Malof 2006). In addition, an assessment of Camp Swift by the U.S. Army
Corps of engineers included a magnetometer sweep along a transect through the southern improvement
area (Parsons Engineering 2003).
In the opinion of LCRA Archaeology Services staff the scope of the present project is unlikely to impact
any unknown significant archaeological materials. It is therefore recommended that the project be
allowed to proceed as described above.

March 2008

On February 19, 2008, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff provided
information to you by letter concerning a discovery of prehistoric materials associated with site 41BP821
during construction of LCRA’s river access road at River Front Drive in Bastrop County, Texas. That
same day Dan Prikryl of the LCRA staff also discussed the finds with Mark Denton of your staff and
began to construct a remedial plan that would involve either the excavation of a 1x2 meter unit or the
capping of the materials exposed on the slope.
Buried prehistoric materials found during the earlier 2007 cultural resource survey of the project area
included a distinctive Toyah Phase beveled knife. Based on the elevations of subsurface artifacts found in
various cutbanks and backhoe trenches, it also appeared that the materials at 41BP821 might represent a
single Toyah Phase component of 15 to 20 cm thickness. During the initial trip to the site after it was
learned that construction had already started, large bison-sized bone fragments were found among the
cultural materials exposed on the bulldozed slope west of the proposed road bed. Although much dirt had
been removed on the slope, it was assumed that the elevation of the bones corresponded to the same depth
as the previously documented buried component. Because numerous bone fragments were present in a
discrete area covering about 170x70 cm, it seemed possible that the articulated portions of a buffalo
skeleton not removed during butchering could be eroding out of the slope.
Last week, the LCRA staff returned to the site to gather additional data for the remediation plan. Since a
vertical and horizontal datum had been established during the previous 2007 survey investigation, an
engineering transit was used to establish the vertical relationships of the exposed cultural materials to
those previously found. Elevations on the approximately 170x70 cm cluster of bison-sized bones and
several pieces of chert debitage and burned rocks that comprised the bulk of the materials exposed on the
slope showed that the cluster lay about 1.3 meters lower in elevation than that of the previously
documented component. Staff also observed that a very small number of tiny bone fragments, a burned
rock, and a chert flake were exposed further upslope at elevations compatible with the previously
documented component.
Staff also sent some time reassembling bone fragments within the cluster and included other small
fragments that had been pushed further downslope from the main cluster. A very minor amount of dirt
was removed within the bone cluster to more fully expose the bones. As a result of this work, two bisonsized bones were identified. These consist of a scapula and rib fragment. It was also noted that the thin
crusts of dirt adhering directly to the bones were the dark grayish-brown color of the Zone 3 sediment in
which the prehistoric component had been previously documented. However, most of the other soil on
the slope surface in this immediate area is the reddish-brown color of Zones 5 and 6 which were
documented the previous year in profiles as laying deeper than the cultural component. Importantly, too,
it does not appear that any additional bones or bone fragments are eroding out of the terrace slope at this
location.

Our staff concludes that the scapula, rib, and several artifacts near these two bones mostly likely either
moved downslope from their original locations within the buried component back during prehistoric times
or were pushed downslope by the bulldozer during the recent construction activities.
At this point, staff has concluded that if a 1x2 meter unit is excavated, it should be placed upslope from
the main bone cluster in the area where other minor amounts of prehistoric materials are eroding out of
the slope at the same elevation as the previously documented component. However, we feel that if we
excavate a 1x2 meter unit, there would still be an erosion problem in future over an approximately 20
meter wide area where other materials related to the buried component could erode out of the slope.
Further, even if we tap down the backfill in the unit, it would likely come loose and the walls of the
excavation unit could erode.
At this point, it appears that covering the site area with protective material is the best course of action as
opposed to excavation of the 1x2 meter unit. I have spoken with Michael Rainey of the Bastrop County
NRCS (formerly the Soil Conservation Service), Barrie Coburn the Director of the TxDOT Landscape
Design and Enhancement staff, and Jodie Hermes of LCRA’s Parks construction staff about erosion
control materials for soils and slopes like those at the site.
Options considered included the use of Curlex, which is the green colored material that commonly used
on road right-of-way slopes and at new subdivision developments. Curlex is a fabric that eventually
breaks down as vegetation grows and takes root within the mesh. It is normally used to halt erosion of
slopes during the fall and winter months when there is little expected growth of new grass. A second
option examined is a more permanent plastic mesh product such as Enkmat, but Mr. Rainey said that his
experience with those types of products is that rainwater eventually gets under the plastic and starts
erosional channels.
A third option examined is the use of hydromulching, which involves spraying a mix of compost and
wood/paper fibers over the slope surface and then spreading grass seeds on the mix. Hydromulching is
used effectively in the Spring when new grass starts its growth cycle. Based on seasonal conditions,
LCRA proposes the use of hydromulching.
LCRA also proposes to remove the bison scapula and rib that have been pieced back together prior to
laying down the hydromulch, since it does not appear that the non-butchered portion of an articulated
bison skeleton is present. Because the buried component appears to be only 15 to 20 cm thick, LCRA
does not feel that covering the area where the component surfaces on the slope with 6 to 12 inches of fill
material is necessary before laying down the hydromulch material and seeding the slope surface. The
current slope surface has been packed down by bulldozer
Traffic and any loosely packed introduced fill material and the vegetation that would start to grow on it
would probably erode given the sharp 10 to 12 degree angle of the slope. Runoff water on the upslope
side of the hump created by the fill material might also create a runoff channel to the left or right lateral
sides of the hump producing an erosional cut.
LCRA Archaeology Services staff will also monitor the results of the hydromulching to determine its
effectiveness. Should the hydro mulching not halt the erosion, then our staff will consult with you to
determine needed actions. We ask for your concurrence with this assessment and recommendation.

LCRA proposes to construct a new electrical substation south of the community of Zorn, adjacent to State
Highway 123, in northern Guadalupe County, Texas. The substation will be within a 4.85 acre portion of
an agricultural field and will be accessed by a 60-ft wide road that will connect to SH 123. The substation
will tap into existing LCRA transmission line T-203.
LCRA Archaeology Services has conducted a file and map review of the proposed project. The project
area is located on a broad upland divide dissected by tributaries to York Creek, which it overlooks to the
north. It is within the mapped Cretaceous-aged Navarro Groups and Marlbrook Marl, undivided
formation, which consists primarily of marl, clay, sandstone and siltstone. Soils are mapped as Houston
black gravelly clay. There are no structures presently mapped within the project area, nor on the 1911
USGS map.
The adjacent transmission line T-203 was selectively surveyed for cultural resources in 2006 by LCRA
Archaeology Services staff in advance of a proposed maintenance (clearing) project (Hixson et al.
2007:308). Six archaeological sites, 41GU94-41GU99, were recorded at that time. Two of these,
41GU97 and 41GU99, were recorded about 700 m both south and north, respectively, from the project
area. Both were within drainage systems. The following site descriptions are from the internal memo and
2006 Annual Report.
Site 41GU97 is located between STRs 15-17 and also contains both a prehistoric and historic component.
The prehistoric component consisted of a very low density lithic artifact scatter amongst ancient gravels
in the plowed fields to the north and on the hill and plowed field to the south of a York Creek tributary
channel. There is also a low density scatter of burned rock located atop the hill near STR 17.
Considering that plowing likely churned up the upper 30cm of topsoil, part of the site is located on a
hillslope, surface visibility is very good, and that the lithic scatter here was extremely low, no shovel tests
were dug. Due to all these factors this site is assessed as not significant. It is further recommended that
the maintenance and creek crossing repair work be allowed to proceed.
The historic component of Site 41GU97 consists of a large barn constructed of corrugated tin with an
associated trash scatter. The trash scatter consists of some purple glass, whiteware, various metal cans,
and scrap metal. From talking with the landowner’s grandson we learned that his grandparents moved
onto the property in the 40s or 50s and built the barn and what he thought was a house (though it looked
like a long garage and/or carport). The house/garage/carport later blew down in a storm; the barn remains
standing. The barn and remnants of the other structure are outside our ROW and therefore shouldn’t be
impacted by any maintenance-related activities.
Site 41GU99 is a prehistoric camp site located along York Creek approx. 200 m east of the Zorn
cemetery. Numerous flakes, 3-4 early-stage bifaces, and an Ensor-like point base were found at this site.
Three shovel tests were dug at this site. ST 7, located within the ROW, 75 m south of STR 9 and 21 m
north of the York Creek channel, was dug down 50 cm through dark gray clay loam, stopping when the
soil became very clayey. One quarter-sized tertiary flake with heavy patination was recovered from Level

1. ST 8, located within the ROW, 50 m south of the same creek channel (70 m south of ST 7) and 40 m
north of STR 10, was dug down 50 cm through brownish-gray clay loam, again stopping when the soil
became very clayey. One flake and six pieces of burned chert were recovered from Level 1; three pieces
of burned chert were recovered from Level 2, and nothing was recovered from Level 3. ST 9, located
within the ROW, in a plowed field 35 m south of STR 10 (75 m south of ST 8), was dug down 60 cm
through dark gray clay loam, again stopping when the soil became very clayey. Nothing was recovered
from this shovel test. North of Site 41GU99, within the ROW (across the road that leads to the
cemetery), is a plowed field with a low density scatter of lithic debitage and burned rocks. South of Site
41GU99, within the ROW bordering two York Creek tributary channels are more plowed fields
containing ancient gravels and a very low density lithic debitage scatter. Because this site has some
potential for additional diagnostic artifacts it is recommended that no soil removal or subsurface activities
be conducted at this site, otherwise transmission line maintenance may proceed.
Although it cannot be conclusively demonstrated that the transmission line adjacent to the present project
area was surveyed, it is clear that it was considered a low probability area for containing intact
archaeological materials. The present map and files review supports this conclusion, and it is
recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural resource investigations,
with the understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.
LCRA requests concurrence from your office with these recommendations.

Date of Investigations:

March 2008

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to widen U. S. Highway 290 between
Ranch Road 12 and Nutty Brown Road in northern Hays County, Texas. The road widening project will
require the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) to relocate and improve existing waterlines within
the TxDOT right-of-way (ROW). The required work consists of relocation of approximately 300 linear
feet of 8-inch diameter PVC waterline from the existing TxDOT ROW into a newly designated LCRA
waterline easement adjacent and parallel to the existing ROW (see attached map). The wateline
relocation will require the excavation of a backhoe trench to a depth of 4 feet below ground surface for
the subsurface placement of the waterline.
A file search conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed that there are no previously
recorded cultural resource sites within or near the proposed relocation area. A cultural resource
assessment of the original waterline project by PBS&J in 1999 had concluded that the original waterline
easement in this vicinity was a low probability area that did not require a field investigation. The Texas
Historical Commission concurred with that assessment. The currently proposed relocation area is situated
just upslope to the northwest in a similar low probability area. Therefore, the LCRA recommends that the
proposed construction be allowed to proceed without any additional cultural resource investigations. We
request your concurrence with this recommendation, with the understanding that standard emergency
discovery provisions are applicable.

Date of Investigations:

June 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to expand the Wirtz Electrical Substation,
which is located immediately below (east) of Wirtz Dam in Burnet County, Texas. The expansion will
consist of moving the boundary approximately 88 feet northward and as much as 132 feet on the northeast
side. Some new substation equipment will be placed within the expansion area and a new drainage ditch
will be excavated within the outer edges the new north and east boundaries. The ditch, which will be
excavated to variable depths ranging from 6 inches to 8 feet, will channel water from heavy rainfall
events around the substation southeastward into an existing drainage cut into the Colorado River.
Additionally, a new chain link fence will be constructed on the perimeter boundary of the additional
acreage and a section of new road will be constructed on an east-west line into the eastern part of the
expansion area.
A file search conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed that there are no previously
recorded cultural resource sites within the proposed project area. One previously recorded site, 41BT266,
is located about 100 meters south of the existing substation near the north bank of the Colorado River.
This site was recorded in 1993 by Bruce Nightengale of the LCRA staff during a cultural resource survey
for LCRA’s proposed flood damage repair and slope stabilization project. A total of only three flint flakes
were found, and Nightengale stated that the soils had previously been disturbed to such an extent that site
interpretation was impossible. The site was assessed as not significant.
The project area is within the area surveyed by Humphreys (1951) for the construction of the Wirtz Dam.
No cultural resource sites were found in this area by Humphreys. The records review also indicated that
no cultural resource survey had been conducted prior to the original construction of the substation. A
review of photographs at the LCRA Archives office suggests that the project area was heavily disturbed
by the dam construction and is within a refilled borrow pit. Given this fact and the results of
Nightengale’s nearby survey, the LCRA recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to
proceed without any additional cultural resource investigations. We request your concurrence with this
recommendation, with the understanding that standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable.

In 1997, LCRA acquired much of the city of Elgin’s wastewater infrastructure, including existing
underground lines that have since been found to be suffering from infiltration and leakage. As a first
phase of rehabilitating the line, LCRA proposes to take advantage of street work already planned by the
city to replace approximately 3700 ft of line and 18 manholes. The work will be conducted by the city of
Elgin, and LCRA will provide engineering and other oversight. All work will be conducted within
existing roads or road ROWs, and the new pipe will be placed within the previously excavated trenches.
A review of the Historic Sites Atlas shows no recorded archaeological sites within the areas presently
proposed for construction, nor are any recorded within the main part of the city. Given the nature of the
proposed project, LCRA Archaeology Services recommends that no cultural resources survey is
necessary, and further recommends that any modifications and/or future wastewater refurbishment
projects in Elgin that fall under the same general parameters be allowed to proceed without consultation
with your office, as it is felt that it is highly unlikely any archaeological sites eligible for formal listing as
State Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places will be
impacted by any such work.

Muleshoe Bend Cisterns Clean-Up (report on monitoring is in Part 4)

Date of Investigations:

July 2008

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has an ongoing hazardous materials remediation and
removal program for its properties. Program activities proposed for the current fiscal year include
removal of hazardous materials from underground cisterns at historic sites in LCRA’s Muleshoe Bend
Recreation Area. Individual underground cisterns have previously recorded by LCRA archaeologists at
Muleshoe Bend archaeological sites 41BT283, 41TV250, 41TV507, 41TV508, and 41TV1779.
Additionally, two underground cisterns have been previously recorded at Muleshoe Bend archaeological
site 41TV499. Importantly, the remediation/removal project will involve the removal of most of the
underground cisterns and their contents by utilizing a backhoe. The proposed program activities also
include the removal of some potentially hazardous materials at trash dumps associated with sites
41BT283 and 41TV498. These trash dump materials mostly consist of large metal objects such as
barrels, car parts, and wash tubs which are visible on ground surface.
With the exception of site 41BT283, all archaeological sites listed in the previous paragraph were historic
tenant farmer house sites that were components of the Turner Farm. Previously, historian Dan Utley
conducted archival research and oral history work on the history of the Turner Farm and its associated
tenant farmer house sites for LCRA. That work was reported in Utley’s 1995 publication entitled
Through Boundary Waters. Although Utley’s research was not been able to precisely date original
construction of these tenant farm houses, according to one informant at least some of the tenant farm
houses were present by 1881. Artifacts found at these sites range in age from the late 19th through the
early 20th centuries. The tenant farming system operated until LCRA purchased the Turner Farm during
the construction of Marshall Ford Reservoir (now called Lake Travis) in the mid 1930s. LCRA
subsequently used heavy machinery to raze these farm houses, but left the underground cisterns intact.
Site 41BT283 was not a part of the Turner Farm property. Utley noted that a contour map drawn of the
impoundment area of the Marshall Ford Reservoir in 1936 depicts this house and labels it as the Jack
Hays family house. Artifacts ranging of late 19th and early 20th century ages were noted at the site by
LCRA staff archaeologists during subsequent visits to the site.
In late 2007 and early 2008, LCRA archaeologists conducted an intensive cultural resource survey for
LCRA’s proposed Muleshoe Bend Capital Improvements Project. Sites 41TV498, 41TV499, 41TV507,
and 41TV508 were revisited and assessed during that project. As a result of that survey, sites 41TV498,
41TV507, and 41TV508 including their underground cistern features were assessed as not eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and not meriting formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A portion of 41TV499 containing evidences of an early historic
component that may predate the tenant farm house system was assessed as potentially significant, and that
part of the site was recommended for avoidance during the construction of the capital improvements
project. However, the two cistern features at 41TV499 are not located within the portion of site 41TV499
that was assessed as potentially significant. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with
these assessments on February 21, 2008.

509

Based on the THC’s concurrence with these assessments the LCRA proposes to move forward with the
total removal of the cisterns at sites 41TV499 and 41TV508 along with the trash removal at site
41TV498. Since site 41TV507 has an intact house foundation and root cellar pit, and it is located
adjacent to one the hiking trails associated with the Capital Improvements Project, the site has future
interpretative potential. LCRA proposes to excavate into this cistern to remove hazardous materials and
then restore this cistern feature so that it can be used a potential exhibit along one of the future hiking
trails.
Since sites 41BT283, 41TV250, and 41TV1779 are not located within the area surveyed for the Muleshoe
Bend Capital Improvements Project, the NRHP and SAL status of these sites has not been previously
determined. These sites have recently been revisited by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff with
emphasis on gathering additional data on their cistern features. As with many of the other cisterns,
various types of trash debris are visible within the cisterns. It is assumed, however, that the trash debris
dates to the time of the abandonment of the house sites in the mid 1930s and later. Thus, it is doubtful
that the materials within the cisterns have any historic value. Inspection of the mortar on the collars of
these cisterns suggests that it is all of late 19th century date. Based on these data, the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff assesses the cistern features at 41BT283, 41TV250 and 41TV1779 as insignificant. The
LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the removal of the cisterns at 41BT283 and 41TV250
be allowed to proceed. Inspection of the layouts of these sites and the presence of existing nearby gravel
roads indicates that the cistern removal at these two sites can be completed without damaging other
features such as the house foundation remnants. Inspection of the trash scatter located west of the cistern
at 41BT283 revealed several large metal objects such as wash tubs and barrels. Removal of these objects
is also recommended.
The field visit showed that cistern at 41TV1779 still holds water and has an intact above ground collar.
LCRA proposes to attempt to leave this cistern intact as a representative example of the cisterns at the
former tenant farmhouse sites. Remediation work at site 41TV1779 by the LCRA hazardous materials
staff will involve use of a rope with grapple hook to remove a barrel that is floating within the standing
water at the bottom of the cistern. LCRA will also process a sample of the water within the cistern to
ensure that it does not contain any hazardous chemicals. Should the water sample analysis indicate that
harmful chemicals are present and thus necessitate the removal of the cistern, LCRA will further consult
with the THC.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff will also conduct spot monitoring during the excavation and
removal of the other cisterns described above. One purpose of the monitoring will be to ensure that pre1870 era artifacts of significance are not present within some of the cisterns. Further, during the
monitoring the LCRA staff proposes to measure the dimensions of the underground portions of the
cisterns to determine whether they are all one standard size or, instead, are of variable dimensions.
We request your concurrence with these assessments and recommendations for the proposed hazardous
materials remediation and removal at Muleshoe Bend.

Jarvis Creek Bridge

Field survey

Date of Investigations:

September 2008

LCRA proposes to remove an existing wooden bridge that crosses Jarvis Creek just west of the
community of Lane City in southeastern Wharton County, Texas. The bridge is part of a road owned by
LCRA that is used to access LCRA’s Gulf Coast Irrigation Pump Station, which is located on the
Colorado River about one mile west of the bridge. Due to the deteriorating condition of the bridge, it is
no longer a viable means of accessing the pumping plant. A nearby low water crossing is subject to
flooding. LCRA therefore proposes to place two large (ca. 8 ft) culverts and fill at the bridge location to
allow continued access to the pumping plant.
A cultural resources investigation was initiated in late August, 2008, when LCRA Archeology Services
was notified of the project. The investigation consisted of a map and files review combined with historic
research, photo and sketch documentation and assessment of impacts to potential archaeological
resources.
Historic Context
The bridge is located on a former county road (Wharton CR 120) that was originally a spur of the Cane
Belt (later Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe/Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) railroad. The railroad spur
appears to have been built between 1902 and 1919, based on a map of the irrigation system below
Wharton (Taylor 1902:40) and a USGS map from 1919 (revised 1929) (Figure 218), and runs parallel and
about 100 feet south of the primary irrigation canal from the pumping plant. The Cane Belt Railroad
eventually ran from Sealy to Matagorda, and was chartered in 1898 to facilitate sugar cane and other
industries (Reading 2002). The town of Lane City, named after railroad president Jonathan Lane, appears
to have been a true railroad town, and was established in 1901 around a store and post office, and was
soon a commercial and social center (Hudgins 2002a). The Cane Belt Railroad itself was short-lived,
however, and following financial problems was sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe in 1903, which
in turn leased it to the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe in 1905.
The Bay Prairie Irrigation Co, (aka Southern Irrigation Co. and Lane Irrigation Co.) established the
pumping plant near Lane City probably in the 1890s (Hudgins 2002b). In 1904 the plant was described as
the “largest of its kind in the world” (Hudgins 2002a). In 1909 a large storm (probably the fourth
hurricane of that year [Wikipedia Contributers]) destroyed much of Lane City and severely damaged the
pumping plant. This seems a logical time for the railroad spur to have been built, in order to aid in
reconstruction of the plant. The USGS map from 1919/1929 also shows an apparent community called
Hoid at the location of the pumping plant. No additional information on this place name as been located.
About 1940 the railroad spur was removed and a county road was placed upon the rail bed (Hudgins
2002a) (Figure 219).
Present Condition
The bridge is an all-wooden, creosote treated trestle very close to 100 ft in length and 16 ft in width
(Figure 220). It is built upon six sets of three-member piers (pylons) placed approximately 16 ft apart

511

(Figure 221). The bridge has a maximum height of perhaps 30 ft above the channel of Jarvis creek,
which is about 70 ft from the west end. The piers range from about 10 to 16 inches in diameter. Near
each set of piers are the remains of earlier four-member piers (Figure 222). It is unknown when these
were replaced. Upon each set of piers are 10 x 10 in beams (headers) that span the width of the bridge.
The main bridge rails (joists) are 6 x 17 in, and overlap the headers by 2-3 ft. Seven joists are used to
create the primary linear support network. The bridge deck (Figure 223) is composed of tightly spaced
stringers that are about 2.75 x 7.75 in, each about 16 ft in length. Running lengthwise along the bridge
are two treads, each comprised of three parallel boards measuring 3.75 x 13.5 in. These are staggered in
position, and the treads are spaced to accommodate car and truck traffic. Two low rails (parapets)
constructed of the same size material as the stringers are on either edge of the bridge.
The bridge is anchored on the west end by four pylons that also form the bracing for an abutment. The
abutment appears to be a continuation of the bridge tread, in that the lumber is of the same dimension as
the stringers. The abutment is about 10 ft high on the western end of the bridge, and about 3 ft high on
the eastern end. On the west end of the bridge are two wing walls constructed of boards very similar in
dimension to the secondary (linear) bridge tread. Both wing walls are bulging from pressure of the fill
behind them, and the one on the north side has partially collapsed, and on the southern side the pylons
used for support have rotted and collapsed (Figure 224). The east end of the bridge is of similar
construction but lacks the wing walls.
In addition to the new pier arrangements, there are other signs of rebuilding and recycling of materials.
The main joists consistently have visible holes in the overlapping ends (Figure 225), indicating bolts or
other fasteners that are no longer necessary. One of the joists has a large notch mid-span, with a large
galvanized nail, the result of a previous toenail fastening, protruding from it (Figure 226). One of the
piers at the western abutment has remnants of barbed wire and fence staples very near the abutment wall,
at such an angle as to indicate the pier, at minimum, was twisted since placement (Figure 227). It more
likely came from a different location, as the remaining three piers have no similar fasteners. The
secondary linear tread boards (runners) have consistent wide shallow notches near the ends (Figure 228),
suggestive of previous use in another capacity, such as rafters laid across a building header. Metal
fasteners are a combination of galvanized bolts, flat iron brackets, and cast iron washers (Figure 229).
These last have the greatest appearance of age, but are placed in seeming random fashion across the
bridge supports. Felt paper is present on top of the four pier at the western abutment, and is fastened by
tacks that also appear fairly old (Figure 230).

Archaeological Considerations
Because removal of the bridge and the existing low water stream crossing will cause some earth
disturbance, an archaeological investigation was also undertaken. The investigation consisted of a file
review for previously recorded sites (none are present at the bridge location) and a field assessment of
impacts. The bridge removal and subsequent construction of a large culvert crossing will be entirely
within the heavily disturbed and built up railroad bed and stream embankments. Exposures and
disturbances were examined for both prehistoric and historic materials. A single crude iron fastener was
seen on the rail bed past the west abutment (Figure 231). No other types of artifacts, other than remnant
railroad gravel, were seen. The existing low water crossing that will be removed is within a low lying
area of the creek, and does not impinge on higher, more stable banks. No shovel tests were excavated, as
there was no indication of previously undisturbed deposits that might contain historic or prehistoric
materials.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to remove a decaying and dangerous wooden trestle bridge that spans Jarvis Creek near
the community of Lane City in Wharton County. The bridge was built sometime after 1902, with 1909 or
1910 being a possible date of construction. The bridge was built as a spur of the Gulf, Colorado and
Santa Fe (Cane Belt) Railroad, apparently to service the existing pumping station of the Bay Prairie
Irrigation Company. The railroad spur was discontinued about 1940, and served thereafter as a county
road. At some point, possibly after LCRA purchased the irrigation system in the early 1970s, the road
was privatized. The bridge is now only accessible through a series of locked gates.
An examination of the bridge indicates at least one, and quite probably several, rebuilding episodes.
There is widespread evidence of movement and recycling of materials throughout the bridge. A four-pier
support network was replaced by a three-pier system sometime prior to 1985.
Although the bridge was part of a regional system that supported agricultural, industrial and other
economic pursuits during the first half of the twentieth century, it appears to lack the structural integrity
that might otherwise allow it to be determined potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places. LCRA therefore requests a finding of “No Effect” on eligible properties and concurrence
that the bridge can be removed. (The History Programs Division of the Texas Historical Commission and
the National Register Coordinator have conferred and are in agreement that the bridge is not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic places – see attached copy of e-mail).

LCRA continues to own approximately six acres in the city of New Braunfels that was once part of Landa
Industries. The parcel is located north of Fredericksburg Road, south of the Wurstfest grounds, and east
of the old Comal Power Plant (Figure 2). The property was used primarily for power production, and
contained both steam and hydro generation facilities. Structures that remain are the final hydro plant,
constructed in 1928, and the remains of the steam plant, built in 1917. Neither of these structures has
been formally assessed for eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
As part of ongoing, proactive environmental stewardship, LCRA is assessing the property for
contaminated materials. This assessment will include a series of backhoe trenches and core samples
designed to locate buried potentially hazardous materials, primarily the waste byproducts of coal burning
(clinkers). Other assessments may include testing for asbestos, lead, and petroleum products.
The area proposed for backhoe trenches consists of approximately 0.55 acres that is between the present
forebay, Landa Park Drive, and the old steam plant. Backhoe trenches will be excavated to the final
depth of any contaminants, which is not expected to b below 2-3 feet (60-90 cm). The number of
trenches will be at the discretion of the project manager, but is not expected to exceed four of five.
Sampling in other areas will almost certainly be limited to soil cores. Areas that are identified as
contaminated will have the soil removed and disposed of appropriately.
LCRA Archaeology Services has completed a historical review of development in and around the LCRA
property for inclusion in an internal remediation report. This review was based in large part on
examination of Sanborn Fire Insurance Company maps and period photographs. This review indicates
that the area proposed for backhoe trenching has been severely impacted and modified through time. It
considered to be extremely unlikely that intact prehistoric deposits are present, and that historic materials
will be limited to industrial byproducts with little interpretive value.
LCRA Archaeology Services therefore recommends that the backhoe trenching be allowed to proceed,
with the understanding that if unexpected prehistoric or historic materials are discovered during trenching,
then trenching will cease at the location of the discovery until a professional assessment of the discovery
can be made.
A copy of the historical investigation is included for your information.

The LCRA is planning to construct a water storage tank to supply water to an existing pipeline on the
south side of Lake Buchanan in Llano County. The tank will be built on a y.; acre site at the upper end of
the northwest slope of Long Mountain. A private developer will construct the pipe system tying the tank
to the existing waterline on Hwy 29 along a path that the developer has already cleared of vegetation.
A file search showed that no archeological sites have been previously recorded at the location of the
proposed tank. The file search also indicated that the area has a low potential for prehistoric sites because
of the slope and distance from water sources. In any case, the thin soils (Roughcreek-Rock outcrop
complex) and exposed rocks would preclude the presence of intact, buried cultural material. Review of
the 1909 Burnet, Texas 15' USGS map and the current 1967 Kingsland, Texas 7.5' USGS map do not
show any houses or farmsteads at the project area location.
Based on the results of the file search, the project area is assessed as having a low probability for cultural
resource sites. An archaeological survey does not appear to be warranted, and the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed. We ask for your
concurrence with our assessment and recommendation for this project.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct the new Rio Vista river access
site on the Colorado River upstream from their McKinney Roughs Nature Park. This new access point
will be utilized for putting rafts and canoes into the river for guided river excursions provided by
McKinney Roughs staff for school groups and the general public. The project area is located on the south
side of the Colorado River adjacent to River Front Drive in the Pope Bend area (Figure 234). In February
and March 2007, the LCRA Archaeology Services conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the
area to be affected by the proposed construction of the new river access site. The principal grounddisturbing activity is the construction of a road which involves the widening and deepening of an existing
gully that cuts into the first terrace above the Colorado River floodplain (Figure 235). The purpose to the
earth removal is to create a beveled slope from the terrace top down to the active river floodplain. One
new cultural resource site, 41BP821, was recorded and assessed during the investigation (see Figure 235).
A bipointed, beveled knife diagnostic of the Toyah Phase was the only diagnostic artifact recovered at
41BP821 during the survey. The fieldwork did not identify any significant or potentially significant
archaeological deposits associated with 41BP821 that would be affected by any proposed construction.
However, because potentially significant buried cultural deposits at 41BP821 were found in the far east
end of Backhoe Trench #2 approximately seven meters east of a proposed access road, archaeological
monitoring of earth-removing activities was recommended (Prikryl 2007). The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) concurred with that recommendation in March 27, 2007.
On February 18, 2008, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff was informed that earth-moving activities
related to the construction of the access road had started during the week of February 4-8, 2008. It
appeared that the need for archaeological monitoring was overlooked due a change in project managers
for the project. The LCRA Archaeology Services immediately made a field trip to the project area. The
following report describes the results archaeological monitoring that was subsequently conducted by the
LCRA in coordination with the THC. Personnel who conducted the monitoring consisted of LCRA staff
members Daniel Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and Andrew Malof and contracted archaeologist Cody
Kiker. The investigation was conducted under TAC Blanket Permit #4779, which was issued to the
LCRA by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for Calendar Year 2008. All artifacts recovered
during the monitoring along with associated documents will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.

Monitoring Program
An initial field trip to the project area was conducted on February 18, 2008 to make a general assessment
of any impacts to site 41BP821. Since a pause in construction had already been planned for February 18
and 19, there was ease of access to the road construction area and time available to inspect the impacted
areas. The field inspection suggested that cultural materials had been minimally affected on the east flank
of the road construction area where Backhoe Trench #2 had been previously excavated. However,
bulldozer scraping of the western flank of the road construction area had exposed a cluster of large
mammal bones (Figure 235). Several chert flakes and burned rocks lay in and around the bone cluster.
This cluster of prehistoric materials covered an area measuring about 170 cm on a north-south line by 70
cm on an east-west line (Figure 236). The artifact cluster also lay about 3.65 m west of the proposed
access road at an elevation of 80 cm above the current access road bed (Figure 237). Based on a previous
find of a beveled knife characteristic of Late Prehistoric Toyah Phase nearby in the wall of a minor road
cut previously constructed by the former landowner, it was deemed probable that the large mammal bones
were bison bones.

On February 19, 2008, the LCRA staff met with the THC to describe the results of the LCRA’s field trip
to the site. Photographs showing the concentration of cultural materials on the west flank of the access
road and the location of find were provided to the THC during the meeting and later as an e-mail
attachment. Since the cut for the access road was already at an elevation below the archaeological finds,
it was concluded that construction of the narrow road bed area could

area.

proceed with the provision that LCRA Archaeological staff be present to monitor those earth-removing
activities. The THC also concluded during the meeting that LCRA would need to produce a remediation
plan which would involve either the excavation of a 1x2 meter unit at the location of the bone
concentration to gather additional data or provide the THC a preservation plan that would effectively cap
the archaeological materials with 6 to 12 inches of soil and special materials such as geo-textile fabric to
preserve/protect the archaeological materials and ensure that the materials will not be adversely affected
by erosion.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff then conducted the monitoring for the additional scraping and
removal of 20 cm (8 inches) of soil to finish the access road bed on February 20, 2008. Heavy machinery
used by construction personnel for this work consisted of a bulldozer, a front-end loader/backhoe, and a
heavy roller machine to compress the roadbed surface (Figure 238). Soil was removed in one to two inch
increments. The archaeologist watched each pass from a safe distance on the adjacent higher slopes to
determine if any features or artifacts were being exposed as the soil was removed. Additionally, the
archaeologist then walked over each newly exposed surface and also examined the backdirt generated
from each pass of the machinery. No cultural materials were found during the monitoring of the
excavations of the road bed.

Figure 238. View of continuation of construction of the road bed during archaeological monitoring. Note
that gray plastic covers the bone cluster.
The LCRA staff returned to the site on February 26, 2008 to gather additional data for the remediation
plan. Since a vertical and horizontal datum had been established during the previous 2007 survey
investigation, an engineering transit was used to establish the vertical relationships of the newly exposed
cultural materials to those previously found. Elevations on the approximately 170x70 cm cluster of
bison-sized bones and several pieces of chert debitage and burned rocks that comprised the bulk of the

534

materials exposed on the slope showed that the cluster lay about 1.3 meters lower in elevation than that of
the previously documented location of the buried cultural zone (Figure 239).

Figure 239. Cross-section diagram of the terrace slope showing the location of the bone cluster and the
previously documented buried cultural zone based on transit elevation readings.
Staff also sent some time reassembling bone fragments within the cluster and included other small
fragments that had been pushed further downslope from the main cluster. A very minor amount of dirt
was removed within the bone cluster to more fully expose the bones. As a result of this work, it appeared
that the bone cluster consisted of a scapula and one or two rib fragments (Figure 240). Importantly, too, it
did not appear that any additional bones or bone fragments were eroding out of the terrace slope at this
location.
Staff also observed that a very small number of tiny bone fragments, a burned rock, and a chert flake were
exposed further upslope at elevations compatible with the previously documented prehistoric component
(see Figure 239). Staff concluded that the scapula, rib(s), and other associated artifacts near these two
bones may have been moved downslope from their original locations within the buried component back
due to erosion during prehistoric times. Another possibility was that the bones and nearby artifacts were
pushed downslope by the bulldozer during the recent construction activities.
At that point, staff concluded that if a 1x2 meter unit was excavated for the remediation of damages to the
site, it should be placed upslope from the main bone cluster since other minor amounts of prehistoric
materials appeared to be eroding out of the slope both at the same elevation as the previously documented
component and also near ground surface at the top of the

535

center of photo to immediate right of photographic scale.

536

slope. To gather additional data on these possibilities, staff then excavated two additional shovel tests
(ST #2 and 3). Shovel Test #2 was excavated on the terrace top beginning at the original ground surface.
This shovel test was dug to a depth of 90 cm with no prehistoric artifacts being recovered. Shovel Test #3
was excavated about 1.5 m upslope from the artifact labeled as “minor bone fragment” on Figure 239 in
order to determine if any artifacts related to the buried cultural zone would be uncovered. The upper 35
cm of this shovel test consisted of the same very dark grayish brown sandy clay loam in which the buried
cultural materials had been found during the 2007 survey. No artifacts were found, however, in this
deposit during the excavation of the shovel test. Deeper, the shovel test penetrated a reddish brown clay
loam that was also sterile. Shovel Test #3 was terminated at a depth of 60 cm.
Based on the negative results of these shovel tests and the fact that staff was concerned about the erosion
potential that would still exist on the slopes if a 1x2 meter unit was excavated, staff decided to
recommend to the THC that covering the site area with protective material was the best course of action.
To gather information for a plan to cover the site area, the LCRA staff spoke with Michael Rainey of the
Bastrop County NRCS (formerly the Soil Conservation Service), Barrie Coburn the Director of the
TxDOT Landscape Design and Enhancement staff, and Jodie Hermes of LCRA’s Parks construction staff
about erosion control materials for soils and slopes like those at the site.
Options considered included the use of Curlex, which is the green-colored material that commonly used
on road right-of-way slopes and at new subdivision developments. Curlex is a fabric that eventually
breaks down as vegetation grows and takes root within the mesh. It is normally used to halt erosion of
slopes during the fall and winter months when there is little expected growth of new grass. A second
option examined was a more permanent plastic mesh product such as Enkmat, but Mr. Rainey said that
his experience with those types of products is that rainwater eventually gets under the plastic and starts
erosional channels.
A third option examined was the use of hydro mulching, which involves spraying a mix of compost and
wood/paper fibers over the slope surface and then spreading grass seeds on the mix. Hydro mulching is
used effectively in the Spring when new grass starts its growth cycle. Based on seasonal conditions,
LCRA staff proposed a remediation plan that consisted of applying hydro mulch and grass seeds to
stabilize the slopes to halt erosion of archaeological materials.
LCRA then provided a letter with this recommendation to the THC on March 3, 2008. In that letter,
LCRA also proposed to remove the bison scapula and rib that have been pieced back together prior to
laying down the hydro mulch, since it appeared that these were the only bones present. Because the
buried component appeared to be only 15 to 20 cm thick, LCRA stated that it did not feel that covering
the area where the component surfaces on the slope with 6 to 12 inches of fill material was necessary
before laying down the hydro mulch material and seeding the slope surface. The current slope surface
had been packed down by bulldozer traffic and any loosely packed introduced fill material and the
vegetation that would start to grow on it would probably erode given the sharp 10 to 12 degree angle of
the slope. Runoff water on the upslope side of the hump created by the fill material might also create a
runoff channel to the left or right lateral sides of the hump producing an erosional cut.
In the March 3, 2008 letter to the THC, LCRA Archaeology Services staff proposed to monitor the results
of the hydro mulching and seeding to determine its effectiveness. Should the hydro mulching and seeding
not halt the erosion, then our staff would consult with the THC to determine needed actions. On March
27, 2008, the THC concurred with the recommendations as described in the LCRA’s March 3, 2008 letter.
A Final Note on the Research Potential of 41BP821
The LCRA staff subsequently removed the scapula and rib fragment prior to the hydro mulching and
seeding work. Removal of the bones, confirmed that a second rib fragment was present. It is not certain

537

if the two rib fragments are parts of one individual rib or represent two separate ribs. During the removal
of these bones, a utilized chert flake was found near one of the rib fragments. One the same date of the
removal of the bones, staff also found a chert drill fragment on the east bank of the road cut. This artifact
is a unificial tool that can be classified as a flake drill as previously described by Shafer (1977). Flake
drills are frequently found in Toyah Phase components in Central Texas. It should be noted, too, that
during the previous February 26, 2008 visit to the site by LCRA staff, a pottery sherd had been found on
the east slope of the road cut. This sherd is tempered with a calcareous material that may well be shell. If
not shell, then the temper is probably bone. In either case, calcareous-tempered sherds commonly date to
the second half of the Late Prehistoric Period in Central and North-Central Texas.
A visit to the University of Texas Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory to compare the scapula to bison
specimens confirmed that the scapula recovered at 41BP821 is that of a bison. The identification of this
bone fits well with the recovery of Toyah Phase diagnostic artifacts. The absence of any diagnostic
artifacts from other time periods further strengthens the hypothesis that the cultural materials at 41BP821
represent a single component. The cultural materials found on the west flank of the new access road cut
may represent a butchering area with the main campsite area being located on the east flank of the access
road where BHT #2 had previously been excavated in 2007. Overall, site 41BP821 continues to be rated
as a potentially significant cultural resource site.

Results of Monitoring of Cistern Demolition at the LCRA’s Muleshoe Resource Area in
Burnet and Travis Counties, Texas

Introduction
In late October and early November, 2008, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff monitored the partial
demolition of five of the six cisterns (Cisterns A, C, D, E and G) slated for demolition at LCRA’s
Muleshoe tract in Burnet and Travis Counties (Figure 241). Cistern F was scheduled for demolition as
well but was found to be a stone-lined well when its concrete cap was removed. The cap was replaced
and the well left undisturbed.
The Muleshoe cisterns were demolished in order to facilitate removal of trash that had accumulated in
their underground chambers after they went out of use. This trash could contain potentially hazardous
materials that could contaminate the surrounding soil, necessitating its removal. Before the dismantling,
each cistern lay completely underground except for a masonry collar rising up to two feet above the
surface. All excavation was done by a backhoe operated by LCRA personnel.

Methodology
The intent of the monitoring was to record the cross-section of each cistern in order to learn construction
methods and depositional history of their contents.
The demolition and recording procedures were generally the same for each cistern. First a wide trench
was excavated along one side of the cistern, exposing the exterior walls from ground level down to the
base. After photos were taken, the backhoe bucket was used to break open the exposed wall and remove
it in large chunks, more or less bisecting the cistern from top to bottom but not removing the contents.
Photos were again taken and a profile drawn of the walls and contents. Fairly accurate measurements
were made of the collar and depth of the cistern chamber as well as for the wall thicknesses from the
pieces that were removed. Because staff could not enter the excavation pit for safety reasons, only
approximate measurements could be made for the width of each cistern’s chamber.
The cistern’s contents were then taken out in backhoe bucketfuls and placed on plastic tarps laid out on
the ground outside the excavation area. A brief description of the contents and their approximate depth
was then recorded. Where soil sediments were removed, and if deemed nonhazardous, a large sample
would be screened for artifacts.

Results
Cistern A
Cistern A (Figure 242) was different in construction from the other four that were dismantled, in that (1)
the chamber was excavated out of solid bedrock, (2) the chamber had a substantially different profile and
dimensions, (4) the walls had a different type of interior coating or sealant, and (5) the collar was of
masonry instead of brick Figure 243.

Collar
The above-ground portion of the collar prior to excavation consisted of two rows of roughly hewn
limestone rocks laid in a lime mortar and rising eight inches above the ground surface. The collar’s inside
diameter was 28 inches (72 cm) and outside diameter varied depending in the width of the rocks,
averaging around 47 inches (120cm). Several courses of the collar are probably missing. A rock slablined drain enters the cistern through a rectangular hole two inches underground. Outside the collar, this
drain is still intact for at least several feet, heading in south southwest direction presumably towards
where the house once stood.
The masonry collar continues underground for 18 inches (40cm) apparently intended to retain the sandy
loam soil that overlies the limestone bedrock. This opening extended straight down another two feet
through solid rock before it began to widen out.
Substructure
The below ground chamber of the cistern forms a giant teardrop-shaped void 16 feet (5 meters) deep and
12 feet (3.5 meters) deep at its widest point three-quarters of the way down. The bottom is slightly
concave. Except for the upper 18 inches of soil the entire cistern was carved into solid limestone bedrock.
Plaster
The interior surface of the cistern is coated with two layers of plaster plus a thin outer coating of a black
substance, possibly asphalt. The first layer of plaster applied to the bare rock appears to be lime mortar
light brown in color. Over this a second coat of pale gray mortar was applied and over that the black
material. Together they form a lining that varies from 1.5 to 3 cm thick on the walls and up to 5cm thick
on the bottom.
Contents
Only the bottom 60 to 70 cm contained trash. The bulk was made up of rubber hoses associated with
illicit copper smelting that occurred in the area in recent years. In addition there were moderate amounts
of household trash (glass and plastic bottles). All items appear to be mid 20th century or later. A small
amount of sediment was present in the very bottom of the cistern; this was screened and found to contain
similar household trash.
Cistern C
Cistern C, as well as Cisterns D, E, and G were constructed in a similar fashion with a brick dome used to
constrict the upper portion of the subterranean chamber merging seamlessly into an above-ground brick
collar completely coated in concrete (Figures 244, 245, 246). These cisterns only differed slightly in their
depth. In addition, all were excavated into the cobbly clay sediments that form the high terraces along
this stretch of the Colorado River. The interior walls coated with concrete and plaster.
These cisterns were probably constructed by digging a large circular pit down into the clay sediments. A
narrow shelf was dug into the wall of each pit approximately 2/3s the way up from the bottom to serve as
the foundation for the brick dome. Once the bricks were laid in concrete to form the dome and collar, the
interior walls and floor of the cistern were coated with a layer of concrete and then sealed with a second
layer of white plaster. The space above the dome was then filled in with backdirt to make it level with the
surrounding ground surface.
Collar
The above-ground portion of the collar of Cistern C was completely intact prior to excavation. It was
constructed of approximately six courses of yellow bricks laid in concrete - Portland concrete and sand to form an open cylinder-shape two feet high (60cm) with an opening 52cm wide. All surfaces of the

544

collar were coated with the concrete as well, obscuring any trace of the brick interior. There is no drain
opening so presumably the rain water flowed through a gutter straight into the cistern. This collar was
removed in one piece and hidden nearby so it could eventually be displayed at another, more intact,
homestead site (that of Cistern D).
Substructure
Immediately below ground the cistern begins to flare outwards for a depth of one meter, reaching a
diameter of 170cm. This upper part of the substructure was constructed of courses of yellow bricks laid
in concrete to form a dome. Below the brick dome the cistern descends another 2.5 meters into clay
sediments, widening slightly to its maximum diameter of 2.3 meters just above the slightly concave floor.
The upper 30 to 40 cm of the cistern was excavated through gravelly, sandy loam, the rest excavated
through cobbly clay.
Plaster
The interior walls of the cistern - the brick dome and the clay walls below - were coated with concrete
over which a thin layer of white plaster was applied. The thickness of both coating together ranged from
two to four centimeters.
Contents
This cistern was nearly full with trash, all from the 1970s and 1980s, most of it household trash consisting
of bottles and plastic containers. A half dozen or so large pesticide bottles were present. Half of a Ford
Model T ford hood was mixed in with the trash – the other half was seen lying on the ground outside the
collar prior to demolition.

Cistern D
This cistern was constructed in a similar manner and using similar materials as Cistern C. The collar was
nearly intact except for some missing concrete coating on the rim. The width of the reservoir was the
same as Cistern C but its depth at three meters below the surface was somewhat less. The lower third of
its interior was filled with 1970s and 1980s household trash.
Cistern E
This cistern’s chamber has the same depth as Cistern D but is perhaps slightly narrower with an interior
width of approximately two meters. It also appears more cylindrical in shape. The collar was completely
missing and it had been capped with concrete by LCRA personnel in the early 1990s. This cistern was
filled nearly to the top with baling wire over 1980s-era household trash.
Cistern G
Like Cistern D, Cistern F appeared somewhat more cylindrical than Cisterns A and C. Its chamber was
slightly more than 3 meters in depth and slightly more than 2 meters in maximum width near the base.
The collar was missing several courses of bricks on its north side. The chamber was filled about a third
of the way up with mostly old metal sign posts, some recent household trash, and a water heater. The
entire brick dome with what is left of the collar was removed in one piece by the backhoe and still rests
upright at the site (Figure 247).

Introduction
The area surrounding present-day Landa Park, in the vicinity of the Comal Springs at the edge of the
Balcones Escarpment in central Comal County, has been a major attraction and resource base for
thousands of years. American Indian peoples camped around the springs for at least 12,000 years, leaving
evidence of their activities in the form of stone tools, food remains, and cooking debris (Malof et. al
2007). Early Spanish explorers passed through, remarking on the fresh water and abundant resources.
German immigrants settled the area permanently in 1845, and by 1847 William Meriwether was
harnessing the flow of the springs for milling operations (Utley 1995). A channel dug by slaves provided
the necessary motive force, and this canal eventually became commonly known as the Comal River.
Joseph and Helena Landa purchased the operation in 1860 and began (slowly) expanding the operations
(Foster and Victor 1999). A flour mill was constructed in 1875, and by 1891 an additional warehouse
was added. Contrary to some sources, documentary evidence shows that electric generation was not
started until 1895, a direct result of the management of the property by Joseph Landa’s son, Harry, who
took over after his two brothers, Isadore and Morris, lost interest during the 1880s. Harry began acquiring
additional property along the river, and by 1902 had expanded operations into the property now owned by
LCRA. His original light and power plant, located next to the flour mill south of the property, apparently
provided electrical power for at least portions of the city. A much smaller water turbine and dynamo
system, located very near the present hydro plant, appears to have been dedicated to providing power to
the new cotton processing plant, which emphasized the extraction of cotton oil.
Harry Landa continued making improvements and reconfiguring his holdings, adding a steam plant and
increasing hydro production. The original light and power plant was eventually shut down, and primary
production was moved north, onto LCRA property. Coal was used to fire the boilers for the steam plant
(which was short-lived), and diesel engines were brought in to augment production at the hydro plant.
The diesel engines appear to have been fueled by railroad tanker cars parked on nearby sidings, and later
by underground piping from the Comal Power Plant (Gene Lopanec, personal communication 2008).
There is no evidence of underground fuel storage.
Sources vary on when Harry Landa sold the property. Local historian David Hartmann’s is the most
authoritative (Hartmann, in preparation). Harry’s mother, Helena, had stipulated that all the Landa
properties be sold exactly 10 years after her death, which occurred in 1922. Apparently Harry had an
option to buy, but chose not to, due to potential conflicts with his siblings. The properties were purchased
by investors in San Antonio (later San Antonio Public Service Company, or San Antonio Power and
Light). This group went bankrupt, and the properties went to an insurance company, which likewise went
bankrupt in 1929. The properties, including the park, were fenced off from the public until 1936, when
Peter Nowotny, representing the City of New Braunfels completed a purchase. The public facilities were
reopened shortly thereafter.
In the 1940s, the Comal Power Plant was leased to LCRA, although in 1949 the hydro plant area was still
shown as being owned by San Antonio Public Service Company, even though the actual owner was the
City of San Antonio. Hydro plant operations continued until about 1950, when the plant was mothballed
(Foster and Victor 1999:4). In 1971 LCRA purchased the Comal Power Plant, and presumably the hydro
plant area as well. It was at this time that the earlier brick hydro plant was dismantled. In 1978 New
Braunfels Utilities began rehabilitating the facility (Brune 1981). The diesel generators had been
removed, reportedly sold to interests in Mexico. The plant, now known as the Ruppel Hydro Plant,
remained in operation for about 10 years (Gene Lopanec, personal communication, 2008).

Chronology
Much of the following chronology has been obtained through close examination of Sanborn Fire
Insurance Company maps, available online through library systems and on file at the Center for American
History in Austin, Texas. The Sanborn maps offer line drawings of structures and other details along with
keys and occasional notes providing additional information. The available Sanborn maps for New
Braunfels range in dates from 1877 to 1949. Relevant information is summarized below, and Figures
248-250 illustrate periods of early development and the following improvements (and abandonments)
during the critical years between 1912 and 1930. Other sources of information are sparse to nonexistent,
with inquires at LCRA, New Braunfels Utilities, Comal County, the City of New Braunfels and San
Antonio City Public Service resulting in little additional information.
1877 – This single page map shows only the central portion of New Braunfels. The original Landa mill
was present at this time, and the fact it is not represented indicates perhaps both its distance from the main
city and it relative insignificance.
1885 – In 1885 the area is marked as J. Landa’s Flour Mill. The tail race has been constructed, and there
appear to be two connected structures, one of stone and one of frame construction. Portions of the mill
are marked as being under repair. Power is from water, there is no heat, and lights are from kerosene
lanterns.
1891 – By 1891 the frame buildings are covered by corrugated iron and an additional warehouse has been
constructed. Heat is now provided by stoves, lights are described as closed lanterns, and a fire pump has
been added. A rail line spur has been brought in to service the mill.
1896 – There are now two dynamos (generators) shown next to the water wheel or turbine and north of
the tail race, which provide the power for the now electric lights. The “electric power plant” is under
construction to the south of the mill – the foundation is present, but the remainder is “to be as shown,”
including a “tunnel for shaft” that extends to the tail race (Power House No. 1).
1902 – Between 1896 and 1902 there is major expansion of the Landa enterprises. J. Landa’s Flour Mill
is now referred to as Landa Roller Mills, Landa Electric Light and Power Company (Figure 251), Landa
Elevator, and Landa Ice Factory. The Landa Ice Factory and Elevator are new components. Power is still
water, lights are electric, fuel is coal and there is steam heat. The electric plant and ice factory are of
brick construction, while the new elevator is a frame building.
It is during this time that Harry Landa began his expansion east of what is called the Comal River, into
what is now LCRA property and Wurstfest grounds. The Comal River (actually canal) is reconfigured to
create a “mill pond” (forebay) which is channeled through a mill race to a turbine that appears to be
contained within a minimal (if any) structure (future Power House No. 2). The forebay and turbine
discharge flow into a new, two-pronged tail race that feeds the true Comal River. The turbine appears to
be dedicated for electrical production for the new and extensive Landa Cotton Oil Company, which is fed
through an “iron clad power wire shed.” Portions of this enterprise are on LCRA property, notably a
small room labeled as a “lint press.” A substantial water closet (bathroom) is on the northern edge of
LCRA property. The rail road spur has been extended to the cotton oil plant, and crosses between the
forebay and the tail race. All buildings associated with the oil plant are of frame construction. The oil
plant has electric lights, uses coal for fuel, includes boilers for cooking (presumably oil processing) and
oil pumps. Water remains the power source. A set of brick-lined double boilers is mapped along the
canal in line with the wire shed, and includes a 50 foot tall iron chimney.

551

1907 – There are few changes between 1902 and 1907, however the ice factory is enlarged significantly.
A small frame structure is added to the turbine portion of the oil plant, and a third boiler was added to the
pair present in 1902, but by this time it is already out of commission. The original two boilers are still in
operation.
1912 – A grain storage building was added next to the elevator in the original mill area. There is
additional information available on the Electric Light Plant, which has a 200 kW dynamo, two 22 kW
dynamos, a 75 kW dynamo and a 30 kW dynamo, for a total of 349 kW in available production. This is
still known as the Landa Electric Light and Power Company. The cotton oil plant turbine area (future
Power House No. 2) now has a more substantial frame building, and contains a 200 kW dynamo. A
building containing shakers has been added to the LCRA property, as has a 100 horsepower engine, the
function of which is unclear. Another gasoline engine is located just past the northwest corner of LCRA
property, and is associated with the elevator at that location. This may be a backup power source for fire
pumps. Most notably, a new single boiler with a 40 foot iron chimney has been added to the north of the
turbine area. This location coincides closely with the location of later steam plant (future Power House
No. 3). The third boiler that was mapped in 1907 is no longer shown. Power in this area is now
described as both water and steam, with the steam derived from coal fuel. There is no indication that the
power production in this area is other than for the oil plant. The large bathroom is not shown on this or
subsequent maps.
1922 – The ten years between 1912 and 1922 saw significant alterations in what is now referred to as
Landa Industries. The emphasis has shifted away from the original flour mill location and towards the
area by the cotton oil plant. The ice factory is no longer present, and the buildings have been converted to
flour storage warehouses. A light plant is still present, but appears secondary to the enlarged system to
the north. The flour mill is still using water power, and the elevator is operated electrically. There is no
longer heat available in this complex.
Within the LCRA property there have been substantial improvements. The original small turbine area has
been reconfigured, with a vastly enlarged tail race serving the large brick building (Power House No. 2)
that is now referred to as a “Light and Power Plant” (Figures 252, 253). This enlarged tail race section
required a rerouting of railroad track in that area. The turbines (Figure 254) are augmented by two 300
horsepower oil engines, and there are three 250 kW dynamos. A large warehouse is located immediately
northwest of the power house. The cotton oil plant is described as being powered by the enlarged steam
plant (Figures 255, 256), suggesting dedicated use. The steam plant, built of both cement and brick,
contains three brick encased boilers and the tall cement chimney (Utley 1995) is now present. The
cement portion was built in 1917, according to a notation on the 1930 map. It is assumed the brick
portion was built about the same time. The boilers use oil for fuel and power a turbine that operates a 50
kW dynamo. The turbine and dynamo are in the southeast quadrant of the building, and an office is in the
southwest quadrant. The cotton processing rooms and the gasoline engines are no longer present,
replaced by two offices and an auto shop.
1930 – The original flour mill is still present, but the light plant has been converted to a warehouse. What
appears to be sweet (molasses enriched) feed mill has been added. Importantly, the tail race is now gone,
and the mill is run entirely by electricity. The entire cotton processing plant is now out of commission,
and the steam plant is no longer used. Although still mapped as Landa Industries, the hydro and steam
plant areas, as well as the recently completed Comal Power Plant are owned and operated San Antonio
Public Service Company. The brick power house is now described as a “Lecture Hall,” (and elsewhere as
a Club Room”). A new three-story cement structure has been placed immediately to the east – this is the
new hydro plant, and according to the map was completed in 1928 (Figures 257, 258). This is the same
date as the Comal Power Plant extension project, which created what was essentially a millrace from a
large tunnel that extended from the 1927 Comal Power Plant under the Comal canal (Figures 259, 260).

552

This fed the feature now referred to as the “well.” The generator is powered by both water turbines and
oil engines. Numbers of engines, their horsepower ratings and final electrical output are not stated. The
new building has gas heat. Movement of the hydro plant eastward once more required reconfiguration of
the forebay. It is channeled more directly into the new plant, and the large tailrace is now underground.
The railroad spurs were also adjusted, and one spur came to a termination directly behind the new plant.
Another spur appears to service the auto shop, although that building is no longer designated as such.
1949 – The 1930 map was revised in 1949. There are few changes. The flour mill is now the Dittlinger
Roller Mill and has been expanded in size. The hydro plant appears to still be in operation, and is still
owned by San Antonio Public Service, although by now the Comal Power Plant is shown to be operated
by LCRA.

Summary
The Landa enterprises, begun in the 1870s, continued as viable economic pursuits for several decades.
The favorable setting near constant-flowing, constant-temperature spring vents created opportunities for
major development of additional power sources during the 1920s. Hydro generation continued
intermittently through the 1980s (Figures 261, 262), actually outliving the larger and more modern gasfired Comal Power Plant. At present, all industrial use of the old Landa properties has ceased, replaced
by recreational and residential activities (Figure 263).
