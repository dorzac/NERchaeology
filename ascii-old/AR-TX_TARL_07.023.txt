ABSTRACT
An archeological survey and assessment of Floodwater
Retarding Structure 6A, Southwest Laterals of the Colorado
River Watershed, McCulloch County, Texas, was conducted in
October 1977 by the Texas Archeological Survey under terms
of a purchase order issued by the Soil Conservation Service,
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Temple, Texas.
The results
of this survey and assessment are reported herein.
Thirteen archeological sites were found to exist within
the project area and which will be affected by construction
of the structure.
In general, the sites have been affected
to some degree by modern agricultural practices; however,
apparently intact deposits were identified at many of the
sites.
Each site is evaluated on its apparent integrity and
its apparent information yield potential.
Ten of the sites
were found to be of sufficient integrity to warrant nomina­
tion to the National Register of Historic Places; these are:
4lMK14, 4lMK16, 4lMK17, 41MK18, 41MK19, 4lMK20, 4lMK2l,
4lMK22, 41MK24, and 4lMK25.
The 3 sites considered to be
ineligible for nomination are:
4lMK13, 4lMK15, and 4lMK23.
A set of alternatives to avoid or lessen the conflicts
of the proposed structure with the identified archeological
resources is presented.
Alternative 1 suggests moving the
location of the structure to avoid conflict with any archeol­
ogical resource.
Alternative 2 suggests mitigation of the
potential loss of the resources through extensive sampling
at 5 sites (4lMK14, 4lMK16, 4lMK17, 4lMK19, and 41MK24),
limited sampling at 5 sites (4lMK18, 41MK20, 41MK2l, 4lMK22,
and 41MK25), and no further work at 3 sites (41MK13, 41MK15,
and 4lMK23).
It is felt that either alternative will
adequately resolve the conflicts of the project with identi­
fied archeological resources.

INTRODUCTION
The results of an archeological survey and assessment
of areas to be affected by Floodwater Retarding Structure
No. 6A in the Southwest Laterals of the Colorado River are
herein reported.
The investigations were conducted by the
Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin, under terms of a purchase order issued by the Soil
Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Temple,
Texas.
Staff members of the Survey spent two days examining
surficially visible archeological resources within the desig­
nated project area during October, 1977.
Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 6A is located on the
upper reaches of Salt Creek, northwestern McCulloch County,
in the western part of central Texas.
Salt Creek is an
intermittent right bank tributary of the Colorado River; the
course of the creek trends in a north to northeasterly
direction and enters the Colorado River approximately 8 km.
northeast of the community of Doole.
Heading near the
drainage divide between the Colorado River and a major right
bank tributary system - the San Saba River - Salt Creek
follows a course through Salt Gap in the Brady Mountains.
The Brady Mountains are an erosional feature represent­
ing the right margin of the mainstem Colorado River valley.
Geologically, the project area is situated at the surficial
contact between various Permian age formations to the north­
northwest and Cretaceous age formations to the south.
Thin
limestones overlying sandstone are visible adjacent to the
project area in the exposed sides of the Brady Mountains;
these formations are probably lower members of the Cretaceous
age Comanche series (Oetking and Feray 1963; Sellards, Adkins
and Plummer 1932: 272-283).
Physiographically, the Brady Mountains represent the
north-facing escarpment of the northern edge of the Edwards
Plateau.
The project area is thus situated directly on the
boundary between the Edwards Plateau to the south and the
Lowland along the Colorado River to the north (Fenneman
1931: 9, 50-60, and Fig. 4).
Likewise, the project area is
located on the boundary between two major biotic provinces.
The Kansan extends to the north and the Balconian (coinciding
with the Edwards Plateau) extends to the south (Blair

INTRODUCTION

1950: 109-115, and Fig. 1). Th~ soils in the vicinity of
Floodwater Retarding Structure 6A are calciustolls of the
red-brown Tarrant-Kavett-Rowena series; these occasionally
deep soils are formed on areas of outwash plains or old
stream terraces (Godfrey, McKee and Oakes 1973).
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The general region around the Salt Creek vicinity has a
long (though erratic) history of afcheological investigation
by both professional and amateur workers.
Burned rock ring
middens near Brownwood (Brown County) and near Paint Rock
(Concho County) were investigated by J.E. Pearce of The
University of Texas as early as 1919 (Barnard 1939: 80;
Campbell 1952; Pearce N.d.; and Prewitt N.d.).
The biology
class at Lohn High School reported excavating an historic
burial in 1933; metal and flint arrow points, ceramic beads,
and other artifacts were discovered with a human skeleton in
the Brady Mountains about 19 km. north of Brady (TARL N.d.).
A cairn burial was partially excavated by Mr. Jesse
Henton on his ranch about 4 km. east of Salt Gap; this site
(4lMK2) was re-excavated by A.M. Woolsey of The University
of Texas in 1936.
The cairn burial apparently contained 3
individuals and was prehistoric in age.
At the same time,
Mr. Henton led Woolsey to a second cairn which was then ex­
cavated.
This site, 4lMK26, was located on the bluffs over­
looking Salt Gap on a ranch owned by Mrs. William Snyder and
her son, K.L. Snyder (the present landowner).
This cairn
yielded the remains of 2 individuals, one young adult and
one child, which were apparently prehistoric in age although
as at 4lMK2 no diagnostic artifacts were found in associa­
tion.
Pictographs were reported near 4lMK26, but these could
not be found by Woolsey (TARL N.d.).
Other work in the immediate vicinity has been limited
primarily to individual unpublished site survey (TARL N.d.).
Two sites investigated on a limited basis in San Saba
County and survey activities on Richland Springs Creek have
been reported by Green (Green 1970; Green 1971; Green and
Hester 1975). Recent professional work in the region
includes a series of investigations at Soil Conservation
Service projects conducted by Texas A&M University

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

(Baxter and Shafer 1974, 1975; Shafer 1975; Shafer and
Baxter 1974, 1976; Shafer~ Baxter and Dering 1975a, 1975b;
and Shafer, Baxter and Stearns 1976) as well as other limited
investigations in nearby areas by Southern Methodist Univer­
sity (Kirby and Moir 1976) and the Texas Archeological Sur­
vey (Dibble 1978).
Work specifically concerned with the Salt Creek drain­
age includes an initial reconnaissance by Green (1974) and
assessments by Southern Methodist University (Skinner and
Mahoney 1974; Bruseth 1975). A partial survey of Floodwater
Retarding Structure 6A was made by the Soil Conservation
Service (Warren 1977).
While not concerned with the immediate Salt Creek
vicinity, there are a number of studies which contribute to
the general background knowledge of the area.
Some of these
include reports by Wilson (1930), Sayles (1935), Jackson
(1939), Jackson and Woolsey (1938), Kelley and Campbell
(1942), Kelley (1948, 1959), Field (1956), Suhm (1960),
Johnson, Suhm and Tunnell (1962), Shafer, Suhm and Scurlock
(1964), Crawford (1965), Story and Shafer (1965), Johnson
(1967), Kirkland and Newcomb (1967), Sorrow, Shafer and Ross
(1967), Sorrow (1969), Shafer (1967, 1969, 1971a, 1971b),
Jarvis and Crawford (1974), Weir (1976), Prewitt (1964, 1974,
1976, N.d.), and Gunn and Mahula (1977)~
Based on the information derived from these sources, it
was expected that the area encompassed by Floodwater Retard­
ing Structure 6A could conceivably contain evidence of up to
10,000 years of human history and prehistory. The types of
sites expected include lithic scatters, hearth scatters,
burned rock middens, ring middens, human burials, rock art
localities, and small rockshelters.
SURVEY TECHNIQUES
The survey team examined the entire area to be affected
by Floodwater Retarding Structure 6A in a systematic manner.
The project area was divided into 3 parcels; the first par­
cel consisted of all the area included in the Snyder property
(e.g., all the project area south of the Snyder-Corder fence­
line), the second consisted of all the area on the Corder

5

SURVEY TECHNIQUES

property on the right (east) side of Salt Creek, and the
third included all the area on the Corder property on the
left (west) side of Salt Creek.
The strategy was to first walk over an entire parcel
to locate areas of prehistoric debris.
When this was com­
pleted, each locality noted was revisited and survey forms
were completed for each identified site.
Photographs and
other notes were made as needed to demonstrate the setting
or specific features in various sites.
This procedure of
initial examination, then revisit and record pertinent data
was used at each of the 3 parcels. Minor subsurface probes
were made of some sites to obtain general information on
potential depth of the cultural deposits.
Portions of the project area had been examined by James
E. Warren of the Soil Conservation Service in September 1977.
Seven sites (4lMK13 - 4lMK19) were recorded by Warren (1977:
14).
Each of these was revisited and additional notes were
taken; in some cases, Warrens' observations on site extent
and location were modified slightly (for example, the ori­
ginal plotting of the ring midden of 4lMKl9 was slightly
further upstream than our observations indicated).
Artifact collections were kept to a minimum.
Several
representative specimens had been collected by Warren (1977:
19-22); these are included in the artifact descriptions
which form a part of the present report.
Occasional time
diagnostic projectile points were collected from sites not
previously recorded by Warren.
However, it was felt that
possible future controlled surface collections would yield
more significant information than simple random collections.
All site numbers used in this report have been assigned
by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The
University of Texas at Austin and represent a continuation
of their system of trinomial site designations.
The number
41 indicates Texas in the alphabetical order of the first 48
states; MK is the abbreviation for McCulloch County; and the
number 13 (for example) indicates that is the thirteenth site
recorded within the county.
The few artifacts collected (including those collected
by Warren) were processed at the Survey facilities in the
Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin.

SURVEY TECHNIQUES

All notes, photographs, maps, and other documents are filed
at the Survey; the permanent repository for both the speci­
mens and the documents will be the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory which is also housed in the Balcones
Research Center.

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
The current investigations at Floodwater Retarding
Structure 6A have documented the existence of 13 archeo­
logical sites wholly or partially within the project bound­
ary.
As Warren aptly noted (1977: 14), the entire project
area could be considered as a single large archeological
site.
However, concentrations of debris were identifiable,
and these are assigned individual site numbers for ease in
reference and recording.
Minor problems encountered during the survey include
patches of extremely dense brush (all thorny) which were
nearly impenetrable. A more serious problem was posed by
recent brush clearing operations.
It appears that at least
two episodes of clearing have occurred in the project area
(this does not include modifications associated with the
01dfie1ds).
In each episode, the brush was either chained
or otherwise uprooted by heavy machinery; the brush was then
pushed or dragged into piles and burned.
Numerous stones,
both unburned and prehistorically burned, were included in
the soil matrix displaced along with the brush.
The piles
of rubble which remain following the burning closely re­
semble small prehistoric middens of both the mounded and
ring types.
Unsuspecting observers could easily misinter­
pret these features since many of them contain cultural
debris which was transported during the mechanical modifica­
tions.
A number of these recent burned brush piles were
noted during the course of the survey.
Special care was
taken to distinguish between these modern features and the
prehistoric middens.
Four basic categories of archeological sites were en­
countered within the project area.
These categories include:
1) burned rock middens, 2) stone hearths, 3) burned rock
scatters, and 4) lithic debris scatters.
Sites may consist
of only one of these categories, or they may include combina­
tions of all the above categories of debris.
Two distinct varieties of burned rock middens were
observed:
ring middens and non-ring middens.
Ring middens
are circular accumulations of fire-cracked stones and may
rise nearly a meter above the surrounding ground surface.
The accumulations exhibit a depression in the center which

is devoid of burned rocks and the exposed fill is gray and
ashy.
The diameter of the ring middens may vary from about
10 to 20 meters; the central depressions vary in size
according to the overall size of the middens. Non-ring
middens are low mounded accumulations of fire-cracked stones
and which lack a central depression.
The diameter of these
features is generally about the same as the smaller examples
of ring middens.
Stone hearths are small clusterings of burned rocks;
the hearths are generally circular in shape.
Burned rock
scatters are areas of dispersed fire-cracked stones which
may represent debris from disrupted hearths.
The intensity
of occurrence of burned rocks may vary from dense to sparse
on a horizontal basis.
Lithic debris scatters are similar
in nature to burned rock scatters; however, in this case the
dispersed materials consist of waste flint chipping debris
and broken or discarded stone tools.
The thirteen sites recorded during the survey are
distributed along both sides of Salt Creek throughout the
project area.
There are generally two recognizable terraces
within the creek valley; four of the sites are located on
the lower terrace while the other nine are located on the
second or slightly higher terrace.
As a rule, the sites are
situated in areas of brown loamy soil; however, 2 sites
(MK23 and MK24) are partially within areas with surface ex­
posures of gravelly soil.
A total of 25 artifacts were collected during the
reconnaissance of Structure 6A; most of these were collected
by Warren during his initial survey, but a few additional
specimens were collected by the Survey in order to provide
minimal documentation of time depth expectable within the
area.
It appears from the diverse projectile point types
collected that a large span of the Archaic Stage is repre~
sented in the prehistoric usage of the area.
No materials
attributable to the Paleo-Indian or Post-Archaic stages were
observed.
A significant facet of the diagnostic specimens relates
not only to the chronology indicated, but to areal relation­
ships.
The early Archaic Nolan and TraviS-like points are
generally associated with the Clear Fork Phase in Central
Texas while the early Archaic Pandale point is diagnostic of

11

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY

the Eagle Nest Phase in the Lower Pecos region.
The middle
Archaic Bulverde point is diagnostic of the early Round Rock
Phase in Central Texas and is generally not associated with
the Lower Pecos assemblages.
The late Archaic points,
Williams-like, Ensor, and Frio, are known to be more wide­
spread and have been documented in all areas surrounding
McCulloch County.
Correlations of the ages of the various named phases
in Central Texas and the Lower Pecos region indicate they
are not necessarily coeval at any given time.
While the
general sequence of point types compares favorably with both
areas, this precludes assignment of the McCulloch County
materials to either set of phase designations.
Conceivably,
this area of western Central Texas may represent a conver­
gence of the two distinct adjacent cultural regions and
reflect peripheral activities related to each region.
This
is not to say that there is no in situ development of
adaptations within western Central Texas; the information
needed to ascertain such a development is simply not avail­
able at the present state of knowledge of the region.
The
remains documented within the confines of Floodwater Retard­
ing Structure 6A, then, assume significance in interpreta­
tions not only in relation to the question of in situ cul­
tural adaptations, but relative to interactions between
adjacent cultures as well.
.

12

ASSESSMENT OF ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
It has been shown in a previous section that substantive
knowledge of prehistoric activities within the immediate
project area is generally lacking.
On a broad scale~ a
large body of information exists for adjacent regions; how­
ever, specific adaptations within the Southwest Laterals of
the Colorado River Watershed remain basically unstudied.
The cultural remains documented during the present survey
assume importance in the sense that they constitute a source
of information which is important to understanding human
adaptation to the area on both a local and a regional scale.
Of course, the specific importance of any site is con­
tingent upon the continued integrity of relationships among
its components.
The sites recorded at Structure 6A were
critically evaluated upon apparent integrity and upon
apparent information yield potential.
These evaluations are
presented for each site recorded and include assessments of
eligibility for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
Only 3 of the sites are considered
not to be eligible for NRHP nomination; these are:
41MK13~
41MK15, and 41MK23.
SITE 41MK13
Evaluation:
The integrity of this site appears to have
been disrupted by modern agricultural practices; the sparsely
scattered debris appears not to represent an area of signifi­
cant information yield potential.
Assessment:
This site is not considered to be eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMKl4
Evaluation:
The integrity of this site does not appear
to have been damaged to the extent that intact deposits are
not expectable; the intact portions of the midden and some of
the surrounding debris scatter appear to retain significant
information yield potential.

ASSESSMENT

Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 41MK15
Evaluation:
It appears this site has been subjected to
the same disruptive practices as 41MK13; the information
yield potential appears not to be significant.
Assessment:
This site is
for nomination to the NRHP.

considered to be eligible

SITE 4lMK16
Evaluation: Portions of this site appear to have been
disrupted while other portions appear relatively intact; the
information yield potential appears to be good in the unplowed
area and to an extent appears to be good in the partially
disturbed midden area.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK17
Evaluation:
Although it has been affected to some ex­
tent by recent agricultural practices, the ring midden and
portions of the debris scatter appear to be relatively intact;
the information yield potential appears to be good.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 41MK18
Evaluation:
This large site is apparently partially
disrupted, but portions of it were observed to contain
apparently intact buried deposits; the information yield
potential appears good, particularly in the buried portions.

ASSESSMENT

Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMKl9
Evaluation:
The ring midden portion of this site in
particular appears to be undisturbed even though the sur­
rounding debris scatter may be deflated in places; the
information yield potential appears to be good.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK20
Evaluation:
Portions of this site appear to be disrupted,
but other portions may contain intact shallowly buried hearth
features as well as debris scatter; the information yield
potential appears to be relatively good.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK21
Evaluation:
Although slightly eroded, this small site
is relatively intact and may contain shallowly buried hearth
features; the information yield potential appears good,
particularly in light of the apparent relatively early age
of the site.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK22
Evaluation:
A large portion of this site has been
damaged by recent agricultural use, but portions of the south
end appear to be relatively intact; the information yield
potential in the more intact portions appears to be good.

15

ASSESSMENT

Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 41MK23
Evaluation:
The integrity of this site is questionable
since it may consist entirely of redeposited materials; the
information yield potential of this site does not appear to
be good.
Assessment:
This site is not considered to be eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK24
Evaluation:
Although portions of this large site have
been damaged by recent agricultural activities, the midden
appears undisturbed, hearth features are identifiable, the
vertical extent is perhaps the greatest of any of the sites
in the project area (excluding the middens), and concentra­
tions of artifacts (particularly a cluster of 3 end scrapers)
are present.
The information yield potential of this site
appears to be substantial.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE 4lMK25
Evaluation:
This small non-ring midden site appears to
be undisturbed; the information yield potential appears to
be good.
Assessment:
This site is considered to be eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The archeological resources recorded within Floodwater
Retarding Structure 6A, Southwest Laterals of the Colorado
River, are felt to be significant to the understanding of
the prehistory of the area in both a'lo~aland regional
sense. With this in mind, two sets of alternative recommenda­
tions are suggested as follows:
1:
Reposition the structure to avoid con­
flict with any archeological resources.
Conceivably, the
original position of the structure (designated Structure 6)
may be preferable to that of Structure 6A since no archeol­
ogical resources were reported at the former location.
Alternativ~

Alternative 2: Mitigate the loss of or further damage
to the archeological resources through a program of inten­
sive investigation of the sites described and reported here­
in.
A summary of work felt to be necessary to accomplish
this is tabulated by category as follows:
No Further Work
4lMK13
4lMK15
4lMK23

Limited Sampling
4lMK18
41MK20
4lMK21
4lMK22
4lMK25

Extensive Sampling
4lMK14
4lMK16
4lMK17
4lMK19
4lMK24

Complete excavation (100% of a site) is considered to
be neither feasible nor desirable, and is not recommended.
If Alternative 2 is selected as a course of action at
Structure 6A, it is suggested that the research design be
oriented toward understanding the nature and function of the
sites, the specific chronology within and between the sites,
and to examining the regional implications of the distribu­
tions and uses of burned rock middens.
It is felt that either alternative will resolve the
presently identified conflicts of the project with the known
archeological resources contained therein.

THE SITES
SITE 4lMK13
Location:

On centerline of dam structure
on the east side of Salt Creek.

Description:

This site consists of a sparse
scatter of burned rock and
lithic debris over an area of
approximately 1.5 hectare of
cleared pasture land.
Slight
clusterings of burned lime­
stone may represent scattered
individual hearths.
The area
has been largely cleared of
brush and has been utilized in
an agricultural/ranching ca~
pacity.
These activities may
be attributed for an unknown
amount of damage to the site.
A small portion of the site
extends to the north of the
fence line into a presently
uncleared area.
This rela­
tively small area may not have
suffered as much damage as the
cleared field.

Remarks:

A small subsurface probe demon­
strated that the sandy loam
soil extends into a brown clay
at approximately 25 cm. below
the surface. No artifacts were
observed in the subsurface
probe.

Recommendations:

No further work.

THE SITES

Description:

Site consists of a burned rock
ring midden and an associated
scatter of burned rock and
lithic debris over an area of
approximately 1 hectare.
The
ring midden is approximately
20 meters in diameter and is
situated in dense brush ad­
jacent to the cleared field
and a field road.
The thicket
extending along the east side
of the creek does not appear
to have been previously cleared.
The road has caused some dis­
turbance to the northern por­
tion of the midden and has
scattered burned rocks and
lithic debris westward to the
creek bank.

Remarks:

The depth and character of the
midden and scatter is unknown;
however, the ring midden ap­
pears to rise approximately 1
meter above the general ground
surface.
The area of the site
extending into the cleared
field probably has suffered
some damage from modern activi­
ties.

Recommendations:

E.xitensive sampling

SITE 4lMKl5
Location:

(UTM

44456010)

East side of Salt Creek approxi­
mately 50 meters east of the
burned rock midden component of

MKI4.
Description:

This thin scatter with small
concentrations of burned lime­
stone and lithic debris covers

19

THE SITES
an area of approximately 1
hectare in an open field.
The
slight concentrations of burned
rocks may represent an extreme­
ly damaged burned rock midden
or several scattered individual
hearths.
Remarks:

The vertical distribution of
material is unknown, but this
site has most likely suffered
the same surface and subsur­
face disturbances as MK13.

Recommendations:

No further work.

SITE 4lMK16

(UTM

44355990)

Location:

Approximately 75 meters south
of site MK14 on east (right)
bank of Salt Creek.

Description:

Site consists of one burned
rock ring midden, a dense con­
centration of burned rocks,
and a sparse to dense scatter
of burned limestone and lithic
debris over an area of approxi­
mately 1.5 hectares.
The
burned rock midden is located
in the cleared field, but ap­
parently has been spared from
extensive plow damage.
The
concentration of burned rock
is located in the brush and it
is difficult to ascertain the
nature of this feature.
The
protection of the dense brush
may have preserved this portion
of the site better than the
cleared area.

Remarks:

The vertical context of this
site is unknown, but the

20

THE SITES

covered area may contain
significant information.
The
disturbed midden in the cleared
field may also retain substan­
tial integrity within the
lower portions.

SITE 4lMKl7

Extensiv&lsampling

(UTN.439 0 597 4)

Location:

On west side of Salt Creek
south of fence line.

Description:

Approximately 1 hectare area
of burned limestone and lithic
debris scatter with a burned
rock ring midden situated on
the first terrace west of the
creek.
The ring midden is
approximately 15 meters in
diameter with an approximate 2
meter diameter central depres­
sion which contains gray ashy
fill.
Very few pieces of
lithic debris were observed in
the area of the midden.
Other
burned rock concentrations
within the site may represent
individual hearths.
Portions
of the site may have been
damaged from previous clearing
and burning of brush.

Remarks:

No subsurface probing was con­
ducted; however, the ring
midden appears to have approxi­
mately 1 meter of depth.

Recommendations:

Extensive sampling

THE SITES

SITE 4lMK18

(DTM 43835957)

Location:

On west side of Salt Creek,
adjacent to .~d south of Site
MK17.

Description:

Large area of approximately 2
hectares of burned rock scat­
ter (with occasional concen­
trations) and lithic scatter
over small hummocks.
Material
appears to be eroding from the
tops and sides of the small
hummocks.
On the extreme
southern end of the site,
burned rocks were observed
approximately 50 cm. below the
surface in a cut bank on the
north side of the creek.
A
small concentration of burned
bone was noticed on the sur­
face near this area.

Remarks:

One subsurface probe placed in
the northern portion of this
site revealed very little depth
to the sandy loam soil and
artifact density.
The portion
of the site close to the creek
does display some vertical con­
text.

Recommendations:

Limited sampling

SITE 41MK19

(DTM 43935957)

Location:

West side (left bank) of Salt
Creek, east of site MK18.

Description:

Site consists of a burned rock
ring midden with an associated
lithic debris and burned rock
scatter.
The site is separated
from MK18 by a small drainage.

22

THE SITES

The ring midden is approximately
10 meters in diameter with an
approximately 2.5 meter cen­
tral depression.
The midden
appears to have a depth of
about 1.5 meters.
Lithic
debris scatter is to the west
of the midden on a low ridge.
Portions of the site have been
previously cleared; however,
the ring midden is apparently
well preserved in a dense
thicket of whitebrush.
Remarks:

No subsurface probing was con­
ducted in this area, therefore
the depth and nature of the
deposits are unknown.

Recommendations:

Extensive sampling

SITE 4lMK20

(UTM 44205966)

Location:

East side (right bank) of Salt
Creek; across the creek from
sites MK17 and MKl9.

Description:

Large area of approximately 4
hectares of sparse to concen­
trated scatters of burned
limestone and lithic debris.
Concentrations of burned rock
may represent individual
hearths.
The site is located
on the second terrace from the
creek and extends into a dense
brush thicket north of fence.
The site does not extend into
an area of gravels which are
present in an area surrounding
a small drainage that runs
northward into Salt Creek.

23

THE SITES

Remarks:

The vertical extent of this
site is undetermined.
Concen­
trations of artifacts are
eroding from the terrace and
eroded areas qver~the extent_
of the site.

Recommendations:

SITE 41MK21

(UTM 44245990)

Location:

East side (right bank) of Salt
Creek, between creek and small
drainage; west of site MKI6.

Description:

A small area of approximately
.5 hectare which displays small
clusterings of burned rocks
and lithic debris; burned rock
clusters may represent individ­
ual hearths.
The site is situ­
ated in dense brush between an
outcrop of gravel by a small
drainage and Salt Creek.

Remarks:

This small site appears to be
in an area which has never
been cleared of brush; even
though the deposits appear to
be shallow in vertical extent,
the site integrity appears to
be good.

Recommendations:

Limited sampling

SITE 4lMK22

(UTM 44085996)

Location:

West side of Salt Creek, west
of site MK21.

Description:

Sparse scatter of burned rock
and lithic debris with a con­
centration of material in the

24

THE SITES

northeast portion of the site.
This may represent a thin
burned rock midden.
The site
extends over an area of about
3.5 hectares. Most of the
site area is in an old cleared
field bordered on all sides by
dense brush.
Remarks:

Site may have suffered an un­
known amount of damage due to
clearing operations.
The
depth of cultural bearing
deposits is undetermined.

Recommendations:

SITE 4lMK23

(UTM 44206010)

Location:

West side (left bank) of Salt
Creek, approximately 75 meters
north of MK22.

Description:

Site consists of a small con­
centration of burned rock and
lithic debris mixed with coarse
gravel.
It extends over an
area of about .03 hectare.
The site is situated on a low
ridge in the Salt Creek flood­
plain.
The site may be an
extension of site MK22 or MK24,
but is separated from each by
a shallow overflow channel.

Remarks:

The vertical extent of this
site is unknown; it appears
this small concentration may
be redeposited materials.

Recommendations:

THE SITES

SITE 4lMK24

(UTM 44106020)

Location:

West side (left bank) of Salt
Creek, approximately 100 meters
north of site MK23.

Description:

Site consists of a burned rock
ring midden and a sparse to
dense lithic debris and burned
limestone scatter over an area
estimated to be about 4 hect­
ares.
The burned rock ring
midden is covered by a dense
brush thicket and appears to
be well preserved.
In a small
area 25 meters southwest of
the ring midden, a lithic scat­
ter was observed to contain a
relatively high frequency of
end scrapers.
The site appears
to have reasonable depth since
cultural material was observed
in the road cut and in other
eroded areas.
Distinct indi­
vidual hearths were also noted
within the site.

Remarks:

Subsurface probes were limited
to a single cleaned face along
an erosional cut; dark gray
soil and cultural debris were
observed to extend at least 30
cm. below surface.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
The artifacts collected by Warren during the initial
reconnaissance of Floodwater Retarding Structure 6A and
those collected by Survey personnel are described below.
The 25 specimens are all lithic and include chipped, bat­
tered, and abraded stones.
Chipped stone projectile points
(all dart points) comprise the largest category of items
collected (11 specimens); this was intentional and was based
on 2 premises:
1) projectile points are the most frequently
collected items removed by relic hunters, and 2) projectile
points have been repeatedly demonstrated to be sensitive
time markers within the general region.
Samples of other
functionally diverse artifacts were collected by Warren to
demonstrate varying tasks which may be assumed to have been
conducted on the sites.
Measurements given below are in centimeters and follow
current general descriptive practices.
A~ asterisk (*)
indicates an incomplete measurement or measurement not
possible.

names used below, see Suhm and Jelks;1962.
