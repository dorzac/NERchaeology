Stress and Survival: Models of Adaptive Success in
the Texas Late Prehistoric
Joseph F. PoweH

ABSTRACT
This paper reports investigations of the adaptive success of Late Prehistoric
hunter-gatherer groups in the central and coastal areas of Texas. A spacially
stratified skeletal series was drawn from 12 Late Prehistoric sites from the
Texas coast, coastal plain, and Edwards Plateau border areas. Individuals were
examined for pathologies associated with various types of stress such as
infectious disease, metabolic disruption of growth, and nutritional deficiencies. These pathologies were used in the creation of indices that gauge the level
of biocultural stress and relative health of the populations. Models of adaptive
success inbuffering these stressors are presented and statistically tested against
these data, and an overview of adaptive success is presented in regional
perspective.

INTRODUCTION
Although myriad subsistence and behavioral adaptation models for
hunter-gatherer societies are described in the archeological literature (Winterhatder
1981, Cohen 1977a, 1977b, Bettinger 1982, Jochim 1976, Keene 1979), only a few
attempt to determine the biological success of such adaptive behaviors (Cook and
Buikstra 1979, Rose 1983). In this study, an attempt is made to test the success of
environmental adaptation in central and coastal Texas during the Late Prehistoric
period, from A.D. 600 to 1750 (Prewitt 1985:223) Skeletal pathologies from
hunter-gatherer populations are used to test a set of explanatory models of adaptive
success. These pathologies are general indicators of the reaction of the population
to a variety of environmental and cultural pressures known as stress.
For the purposes of this paper, stress is defined as "the physiological disruption
of an organism resulting from an environmental perturbation" (Huss-Ashmore et
a!. 1982:396). The perturbation may be caused by nutritional, climatic, cultural,
epidemiological, parasitic, or demographic factors, or a combination of these. All
of these variables decrease the individual’s ability to cope with the stressor.
Bone abnormalities can be seen as a general function of the impact of
environmental stress (Huss-Ashmore et al. 1982:398, Martin et al. 1985:231, Stini
t985:192). The stress factors that lead to particular pathologies are difficult to sort
out because they act synergistically and cumulatively in the production of lesions
(Huss-Ashmore et al. 1982:399, Stini 1985: 215, Steinbock 1976:237-238, Ortner
and Puschar 1981:270). For this reason, stress pathologies, or those skeletal
abnormalities caused by environmental perturbation, will be used only as general
indices of populations’ reactions to stress.

Response to Stress

Skeletal tissue is one of the last tissues to be sacrificed in the maintenance of
homeostasis during stress. (McLean and Urist 1968, Hancox 1972); it is most
susceptible to stress during growth and development. Only those pathologies that
are severe, but not so severe as to kill the host immediately, are manifested in
skeletal material. Therefore, most stress pathologies indicate long-term exposure
to the stressor.
The Armelegos, Goodman, and Bickerton (1980) ecological model of stress
is useful for illustrating how stress pathologies are acquired. In this model the
resistance of the host, together with cultural buffers, plays an important role in
reducing or augmenting the degree of lesionous expression. When such factors
favor the stressor rather than the host, a downward spiral of stress resistance begins,
contributing to the death of the individual. These kinds of maladaptive biocultural
responses are seen in skeletal series as active stress lesions at death. On the other
hand, a positive biocultural adaptation will be evidenced by healed lesions or no
lesions at all (Leiban 1977:13).
METHODOLOGY
Sampling Methods
The data for this study come from a set of Late Prehistoric skeletal populations
housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas
at Austin. Although sites 41BL3 and 41CV14 do have earlier components, an
attempt was made to use individuals from upper excavation levels, most of whom
were buried in semiflexed or flexed positions. A stratified sample was selected from
12 sites (containing 348 individuals) in the Brazos and Colorado drainages, using
three physiographic strata: the Inner Coastal Plain, the Outer Coastal Plain, and the
margin of the Edwards Plateau (Figure 1).
The stratified sample size necessary for a population of 348 with a 7 percent
bound of error was 86 individuals. The sample was allocated to each strata using
a weighted Neiman Allocation method. A set of four sites per strata was used to
obtain the base population size (Table 1); the use of different sites in each region
was an attempt to control for between-group cultural variation in each stratum. The
most complete individuals from each regional stratum were then sampled. Age and
sex variation was controlled by using an equal number of males and females and a
nearly equal number of adults and subadults from each stratum.
Three of the sites included in the sample have questionable Late Prehistoric
affiliations. The Crestmont site,41WH39, has some artifactual material indicative
of a Late Archaic population, but an exact temporal affiliation for this population
is as yet uncertain. Additionally, Ranney Creek Shelter (41CV14) and Owl Creek
Shelter (41BL3) have diagnostic artifacts that span several time periods, including
the Late Prehistoric. Because the site notes do not describe the association of
specific artifact types with individual burials, only the burials from the upper site
strata were included in the sample. As a precaution, the sites in question were
removed from the sample and the models were tested again. Examination of the

results both with and without these sites revealed that the inclusion of possible Late
Archaic sites did not significantly alter the test conclusions, so these sites have been
incorporated in the analysis results presented below.
Pathologies
Individuals were examined for gross pathologies using a low-powered (10x)
microscope. Pathologies were recorded on score sheets by location, degree of
involvement, and remodeling of each lesion type. The use of active and remodeled
classes of lesions is useful for determining the recovery rate from stress (Martin et
al. 1985:267-269). All of this information was then used in a differential diagnosis
to determine the probable cause of the lesion. Differential diagnosis is a method by
which the etiology of pathological agents is compared. The combination and distribution of pathologies in individuals and populations and age distributions of the
possible causes are compared and eliminated until the most likely cause is found.

Several pathologies that indicate environmental stress were recorded. For ease
of description, the stress pathologies can be classified as either deficiency or
infectious pathologies.
Porotic Hyperostosis is a pathology often associated with a nutrient deficiency
(Steinbock 1976:236-237, Ortner and Putschar 1981:257), although other stressors
such as parasites have been known to cause it. This lesion is generally confined to
the cranium and is evidenced by expanded cranial diploe, a thin and eroded outer
vault, and exposed trabecular bone (Steinbock 1976:231). This pathology can
appear in several forms, from finely pitted (seen in most of the cases below) to
porous and sievelike. Lesions were recorded as either active or remodeled at death.
Cribra Orbitalia is a similar erosional lesion, also associated with a deficiency
of some kind (Steinbock 1976:244-248). It takes the form of porous, eroded,
spongy lesions on the roofs of the orbits (Martin et al. 1985: 266, Steinbock 1976:
239-240, Ortner and Putschar 1981: 258). This lesion was also recorded as active
or remodeled.
EnamelHypoplasia is a dental pathology that can be used to measure responses
to stress during growth and development. The pathology develops when the host
is exposed to a short-term period of high stress, such as inadequate diet or disease.
With the reestablishment of homeostasis comes an overproduction of tooth enamel
that produces a visible transverse line in the tooth. Multiple lines sometimes have
been associated with recurrent, or seasonal, stress (Martin et al. 1985), but this
relationship is not a conclusive one.
For the populations studied, overall health status was gauged by the prevalence
of osteomyelitis (Leiban 1977:15, Rose 1983:240-241). Acute osteomyelitis is "a

Powell J Stress and Survival

253

destructive invasion of bone caused by pyogenic bacteria" (Steinbock 1976:61).
Evidence includes cortical thickening, subperiosteal bone apposition, woven (primitive) bone, cloaccae for suppuration, and in severe cases, complete necrosis of the
bone and formation of an involucrum (Steinbock 1976:62). Acute osteomyelitis is
associated with individuals who have reduced resistance to infection or have had
bacteria directly introduced to the bone by trauma.
Chronic osteomyelitis is associated with long-term, recurring infection that
may flare only when resistance is reduced (Steinbock 1976:74). Symptoms include
minor periostitis, striated bone apposition, partially or totally filled cloaccae, and
localized cortical thickening.
From these pathologies, two indices of stress response were created. First, the
sum of all deficiency pathologies (porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia, and enamel
hypoplasia) was calculated for each individual. This index was called STRESS. A
second index, GENERAL STRESS, combined the sums of deficiency pathologies
with the sum of osteomyelitis for each individual.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The environmental analysis presented below is only a general overview rather
than an in-depth discussion. Generalizing the biotic zones in the region tends to
overlook the diversity of the areas, but it is useful for constructing a basic framework
for analyzing human adaptations in a varied environment.
The study area has been divided into physiographic regions with widely varied
resources. These have been analyzed by Net Primary Productivity (NPP) (Figure
1) as well as by biotic zones (Figure 2). However, data on the NPP available for
human consumption in each region was unavailable.
Net Primary Productivity is "the material actually available for decomposition
by the soil flora and fauna or their aquatic equivalent" (Simmons 1979:85). It is
measured in tons of dry matter per hectare (t/ha) cycled through aH ecosystems.
Each sampling stratum was analyzed for environmental sources of variability.
Inner Coastal Plain
This region is composed of Coastal Plain Prairie (Figure 2) with a large number
ofestuarine and riverine areas (Blair 1950:102). Forests include mixed oak-hickory
in small isolates, with other shrubs and grasses intermingled. Shellfish, freshwater
fish, and marine fish are noted in the archeological record at 41GV66, together with
opossum, raccoon, cottontail, mouse, rat, skunk, deer, and alligator (Yates 1979:76).
This area has been characterized as having fewer habitats and a lower biomass
than other parts of the state (Kotter et al. 1987:14). However, the coastal region has
an NPP of more than 50 t/ha, the highest productivity value possible (Rodin et al.
1977, Whittaker and Likens 1975). For archeological populations, this should be
a highly productive environment even though the exploitable microhabitats appear
to be fewer than in other regions.

Outer Coastal Plain
This region contains parts of the Coast~ Plain and Post Oak zones (Figure 2)
with gently rolling terrain (Chambers 1948). Vegetation includes post oak savannah (Gould 1975:3) which is composed of post oak, blackjack oak, and hickory,
together with little bluestem, Indian grass, and other grasses. Common mammals
include opossum, badger, fox, skunk, raccoon, ringtail, gopher, rat, mouse, squirrel,
and deer (Blair 1950:101, Davis 1978). Prehistoric resources also included a wide
variety ofriverine products such as shellfish, fish, reptiles, deer, and small mammals
(Lord 1981:421-432).
The Outer Coastal Plain region has an NPP of 15 to 30 t/ha (Figure 1). Although
this is lower than the coastal NPP, the region still has an abundance of resources and
is comparable in productivity to the subtropical forests of Southeast Asia and
Central Africa (Rodin et al. 1977). The potential for adequate resources is very high;
Aten (1983:66) believes that if they consumed 100 percent of the NPP available for
humans, dense native populations could be supported.
Plateau
This area is a mix of grasslands of the High and Low Plains (Figure 2), including
the Blackland Prairie (Chamber 1948, Blair 1950:101). Juniper/oak woodlands are

Powell ~ Stress and Survival

255

scattered among the grasslands. A wide variety of fauna are available, including
opossum, skunk, raccoon, squirrel, shellfish, fox, and deer. Most of the resources
are concentrated along river drainages (Kotter et al. 1987:16).
The NPP for the Plateau region is 10 to 15 t/ha Figure 1), which is low
compared to the coast; however, the NPP of the plateau is similar to other
environments known to be very productive, such as the woodlands of eastern
Europe (Rodin et al. 1977). Prehistoric hunter-gatherers would have had quite
adequate resources for exploitation even if only a part of the NPP was available for
human consumption.
ADAPTIVE MODELS

From the data presented above, it is apparent that there is an abundance of
resources in all physiographic regions in the study area, although the productivity
of the coast differs from that in other areas. Ethnographic research among
hunter-gatherer groups shows that the positive adaptations of these groups to their
environments results in minimal stress to individuals (Lee 1968:45), even in
marginal environments, as long as the necessary .05 to 5 percent consumption of the
NPP is provided (Casteel 1972:21-22).
So far we have assumed that Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherers stayed within the
physiographic borders of the study area. It is much more probable that most of the
populations in this study had wide territorial ranges that crosscut the physiographic
areas. Evidence has been found for the existence of trade or direct contact between
the plateau and coastal groups in the Late Archaic period (Prewitt 1982:218, Hall
1981:291-296). Ethnohistoric accounts from the Madames of South Texas describe
80-mile trips to and from seasonal resources (Campbell 1983:349), with an
estimated territory of 1000 square miles (Campbell 1983:353,356). Such information certainly suggests that the Late Prehistoric populations in this study exploited
resources outside of their cemetery areas. But even assuming that there was no
movement outside of their physiographic area, the resources there should have been
more than adequate to provide a relatively nonstressful environment.
Model Definitions
Assuming that the areas of lowest NPP contain enough available resources to
prevent environmental stress, it is possible to define a set of explanatory models of
subsistence success.
Model 1
Adaptive strategies suited to the environment and cultural interactions will
have succeeded in providing adequate buffers against stress. Successful adaptations will result in good health and high resistance to stress.
Expectations. Low rates of STRESS and other stress pathologies, with a high
degree of healing. Low rates of bone infection indicate high resistance; most bony
infections are chronic.
STRESS Rate. 0 to 5 percent involvement.

256

Texas Archeologieal Society
Model 2

Strategies adapted to seasonal exploitation of abundant resources will be
moderately successful in providing buffers against stress. However, occasional
deficiencies could occur, depending on the fluctuation of seasonal resources. Seasonal stress would then result, causing yearly variations in resistance.
Expectations. A moderate rate of STRESS; enamel hypoplasia will be higher than
in Models 1 and 3. Other lesions will evidence remodeling. Infection rates will be
moderate; most or all infections will be chronic.
STRESS Rate. At or near 20 percent involvement
Model 3
Adaptive strategies poorly suited to the environmental and cultural factors will
be unsuccessful in providing buffers against stress. Such adaptation will result in
profound stress and little or no resistance to infection.
Expectations. High rates of all stress pathologies, especially STRESS and GENERAL STRESS. Most stress lesions will be active, as will bony infections, due to
low resistance.
STRESS Rate. At or above 50 percent involvement
The estimated rates of STRESS involvement are derived from modern data on
nutritional deficiency and infection from nonindustrial countries (Schaefer
1966:1091, Lowenberg et al. 1968:295), and from prehistoric incidence rates of
similar lesions (Steinbock 1976:242, Carlson et al. 1974:408). Using these values,
it will be possible to test the proportions of stress lesions in the three geographic
samples.

ANALYSIS OF DATA
The data were analyzed using a variety of nonparametric tests for discrete
variables. Nonparametrics were favored because the underlying population distribution is unknown. Tests included contingency table analysis, Kendall’s Tau-b
correlation coefficient, and binomial probability tests (Large Sample Approximations). The results of these analyses are presented below.
Overall, the percentages of both STRESS and GENERAL STRESS
(STRESS+infection) are very high (Table 2); thepercentages increase with distance
from the coast ~igure 3). Along the coast, infection appears to contribute nearly
equally with other lesions. Levels of STRESS and GENERAL STRESS increase
dramatically away from the coast.
Correlation coefficients show a positive correlation between STRESS and
distance from the coast (Table 3). These values are significant at p<.02. In addition,
chi-square values for GENERAL STRESS indicate that the level of environmental
stress depends on the geographic location of the population (p<.05). There does not
appear to be any relationship between stress and sex or stress and age in any of the
populations studied.
Rates of osteomyelitis have a similar pattern of distribution. Chronic infection

only in the Plateau groups (Figure 4). There is a positive correlation between
infection and distance from the coast, with the highest rates farther inland (Table 3).
TRENDS
Several trends are present in the data.
1) There is a significant difference among regions in STRESS-associated
pathologies, which is unexpected, since all of the environments were assumed to
have sufficient resources to support hunter-gatherer populations.
2) There tends to be less STRESS along the coast, with a linear increase in the
inland areas. Infection accounts for fewer of the lesions in the Outer Coastal Plain
and Plateau groups (Figure 3)
3) STRESS pathologies affect all age and sex groups equally in all of the
populations studied.

porotic hyperostosis also increases ~igure 4)
If stress had been adequately buffered in all populations, trends such as these
would not have occurred. Since all of the regions have resource bases adequate to
support hunter-gatherers, and all were exposed to similar STRESS, the occurrence
of STRESS in some groups indicates that in the affected ones an ineffective cultural
buffering mechanism was at work.
TESTING THE MODELS
To test the models of adaptive success, nonparametric binomial probability
tests were employed. (The Large Sample Approximation is abinomial approximation of a normal distribution. The statistic,
Bi - Ni (p^)
B* =

q i(p^) (1 - p^))

has an approximate standard normal distribution, where Bi is the number of
stress-affected individuals in stratum i, p^ is the hypothesized value of STRES S rate
from the model, and Ni is the size of stratum i.) The binomial test compares the
proportion of STRESS found in each region to the various hypothesized stress rates
presented in the models. One-tailed tests at alpha=.01 were used.
In the coastal groups, stress was found in 4 of 27 individuals (14.8 percent).
This was then tested against Model 1 (STRESS= 5 percent) and Model 2 (STRESS=
20 percent). Similar tests were conducted for the Outer Coastal Plain and Plateau
sample, using Models 2 and 3 (STRESS= 50 percent) (Table 4).

The adaptive success of the coastal sample shows that this population was
moderately successfulin adapting to environmental stress. Model 1 does not appear
to fit the coastal data exactly; however, Model 2 appears to be too severe (Table 4).
The coastal groups show an adaptive behavior to stress that might be attributable to seasonality. Stress pathologies are present but most are healed (Table 2;
Figure 4). Enamel hypoplasia is, however, low, indicating that periodic or seasonal

Powell ~ Stress and Survival

261

stress may have occurred less often among coastal groups than in other regions.
Chronic infection is found in subadults and young adults, which is another expectation of Model 2. Overall, the coastal data appear to resemble more closely the
expectations of the seasonal stress model.
The Outer Coastal Plain groups have a STRESS value that places them somewhere between Models 2 and 3 (Table 4). This sample has a moderate rate of stress,
with very high rates of chronic infection (Table 2). As noted previously, chronic
infections can be activated by periods of reduced resistance; these periods can be,
but are not necessarily, seasonal in nature. There is a higher percentage ofnonhealed
lesions in the Outer Coastal Plain groups than on the coast. These data indicate that
the Outer Coastal Plain populations may have had much more severe periods of
stress or that they may have had a greater number of stressors in their environment,
combined with periods of"punctated" deficiency.
The test of the Plateau STRESS rate shows that the data fit Model 3. An
apparently unsuccessful adaptation to stress resulted in the high number of stress
lesions, high infection rate, reduced resistance, and unhealed lesions. These results
were expected under the Model 3 assumptions.
Interestingly, when sites of doubtful Late Prehistoric affiliation were removed
from the sample, the statistical tests did not significantly differ from the results
presented above. This suggests that the pattern of adaptation to stress is fairly consistent, not only for the Late Prehistoric period, but for earlier time periods as well.
INTERPRETATIONS
The exact types and origins of the stressors experienced by these populations
is unknown. Causes can only be inferred from the available biological and archeological data. Completely different stressors, i.e., nutritional stress, demographic
stress, etc., could be experienced by the three regions, and, too, relative population
densities may enhance or diminish the effects of stress factors. Understanding the
cause of the stress is not as important as understanding whether the biocultural
adaptation is effective in protecting the population from it. The main purpose of this
report has been to assess, from biological evidence, the adaptive success of populations.
POSSIBLE CAUSES OF STRESS
Hypothesizing the causes of stress in the Late Prehistoric groups in Texas can
be somewhat helpful in understanding some of the suggested changes in the Late
Prehistoric period.
In the coastal groups we have noted that the adaptations to stress were moderately successful, although not totally so. One possible explanation for the low levels
of stress in these populations is competition for resources with neighboring groups
or encroachment into the population’s home range by migrating groups, Aten
(1983:42) has suggested that the displacement of indigenous groups on the Texas
coast occurred during the Historic period. This displacement certainly created
stress for native groups at that time (Aten 1983: 60-64); prehistoric displacements
may have been a factor in the adaptations of earlier populations in this area. The

262

Texas Archeological Society

resulting migratory stress might have been responsible for the low levels of stress
pathologies seen in the inner coastal populations.
The Inner Coastal pathologies also may be the result of a cultural activity
associated with seasonality--aggregation of smaller hunter-gatherer groups.
Jackson, Boone, and Hennenberg (1986), noting that some coastal hunter-gatherers
have treponemal lesions, have hypothesized that this contagious disease was
transmitted during seasonal aggregation of hunter-gatherers. If seasonal transhumance (See Ricklis, Hamilton, and Prewitt and Paine, herein) was an adaptation of
the coastal groups sampled in this study, the resultant pathologies might include
elevated infection rates (from contagious diseases affecting all tissues) as compared
to populations with no intergroup contact. Although very tentative, this coastal
stress data might fit the aggregational model proposed by Jackson, Boone, and
Henneberg (1986).
For the populations farther north there is evidence of less successful adaptation
to stress, as presented above. Encroachment by Plains groups is evident during the
Historic period (Campbell 1986:9), an event that could account for the higher stress
rates in the Outer Coastal Plain and Plateau groups. Evidence of intergroup conflict
has been noted in the Late Archaic (Hall 1981:303) and Late Prehistoric ~ewitt
1981:176) in these regions. Cultural systems not adapted to intergroup competition
can be seen as unsuccessful ones; in them, inadequate stress buffering would be
manifested in the skeletal populations.
Inefficient subsistence strategies could be another stress factor. Since human
populations usually need only between .05 and 5 percent of the NPP of an area for
survival (Castee11972:21-22), any stress from inadequate diet would be a factor of
a cultural adaptation (rather than lack of resources) that prohibited optimal exploitation of the environment (Winterhalder 1981:86-88). This stressor could, in turn,
be the result of competition for resources.
Whatever the cause, this study has shown that the groups studied have to some
degree been unsuccessful in preventing stress from impacting the biological
systems of these populations.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a case was made for the interrelationship of biology and culture.
An analysis of stress pathologies provided data to be tested against a set of models
describing a group’s success in preventing environmental stress from affecting its
members. From the tests, it appears that the Inner and Outer Coastal Plain groups
have moderate success in buffering stress, although they may experience it during
seasonal or random intervals. The Plateau groups apparently were unsuccessful in
nullifying the effects of stress in their populations.
The models of adaptive success presented here are only a rudimentary effort to
connect the biological and cultural systems at work in hunter-gather cultures.
Several of the limitations that have become apparent probably can be overcome by
further research. Detailed investigations concerning the interactive roles of
prehistoric diet, demography, and material culture will be necessary for models
such as this to be fully useful for research.
