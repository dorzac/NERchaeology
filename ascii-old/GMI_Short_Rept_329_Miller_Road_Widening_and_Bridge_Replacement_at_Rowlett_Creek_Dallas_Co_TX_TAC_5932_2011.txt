ABSTRACT

In April 2011, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., for Civil Consulting
Group, PLLC and Dallas County Public Works, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
in support of a Section 404 permit for the proposed widening of Miller Road and replacement of
two bridge structures at Miller Road and Rowlett Creek between Centerville Road and Dexham
Road in northeast Dallas County. Impacts will occur along the main channel of Rowlett Creek
extending approximately 250 feet (ft) upstream and downstream from the centerline of Miller
Road, and impacts to the creek will extend approximately 20 ft below existing grade measured
along the top of the bank. The archaeological field investigation involved an intensive
archaeological survey with trackhoe trenching within the Rowlett Creek floodplain. Seven
trackhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. Construction fill, consisting of historic
and modern refuse, was encountered at depths to 2.7 meters (m; 8.9 ft) below surface cmbs within
the trenches. A buried A-Bk profile was consistently noted directly below the fill layers and was
interpreted as the original ground surface prior to construction activities along Miller Road. No
archaeological materials or additional buried surfaces were encountered below the original
ground surface during trenching, and there is a low potential that future construction activities
would encounter intact cultural materials within depths to be impacted by the proposed project.
As a result, no further archaeological investigations are recommended for the presently defined
project area. All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.
(Geo-Marine Project No. 30561.01.07), under subcontract to Civil Associates, Inc., for Civil
Consulting Group, PLLC and Dallas County Public Works. The project consists of a 0.5-mile
archaeological intensive survey along Miller Road within the Rowlett Creek floodplain in support
of a Section 404 permit (Figures 1 and 2). The project is located in the cities of Garland, Dallas,
and Rowlett in northeast Dallas County. The project area begins approximately 0.25 miles east of
Centerville Road and extends eastward approximately 0.5 mile to Dexham Road. Miller Road
will be reconstructed from a two-lane rural roadway to a four-lane divided urban arterial. In
addition, two small bridges will be replaced with one larger structure. Impacts will occur along
the main channel of Rowlett Creek extending approximately 250 feet (ft) upstream and
downstream from the centerline of Miller Road. Impacts to the creek will extend approximately
20 ft below existing grade measured along the top of the bank. The area of potential effects
(APE) encompasses the entire footprint of the proposed impacts.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE is to conduct an inventory or
determine the presence/absence of archaeological resources (as defined by 36 CFR 800.4) and to
evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, or as a designated State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). Fieldwork was performed by Ben Fullerton and Lindsey Skelton
of Geo-Marine on April 21, 2011. Melissa Green, also of Geo-Marine, served as the Principal
Investigator.
All notes, field forms, photographs, and profile drawings generated from this project will be
permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project corridor falls in the floodplain of Rowlett Creek where the creek empties into Lake
Ray Hubbard. The general area is still somewhat rural, though urban expansion is rapidly
encroaching. The underlying geology is Holocene Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1987). The project area falls within the Trinity-Frio soil association, which comprises deep,
nearly level, clayey soils on floodplains (Coffee et al. 1980). The specific soils mapped in the
project area are Frio silty clay, frequently flooded along the creek, and Lewisville silty clay, 3 to
5 percent slopes on the terrace edges on each side of the creek. Frio silty clay, frequently flooded
is a deep, well-drained, nearly level soil. A typical profile is a dark grayish brown silty clay
about 17.8 centimeters (cm; 7 inches [in]) thick underlain by a very dark grayish brown silty clay
about 99 cm (39 in) thick, with the underlying layer a brown silty clay loam to about 188 cm (74
in) below the surface (Coffee et al. 1980:25). Lewisville silty clay, 3 to 5 percents slopes, is a
deep, well-drained, gently sloping soil on old stream bed terraces. A typical profile is a grayish
brown silty clay about 58 cm (23 in) thick that overlays about 46 cm (18 in) of light yellowish
brown silty clay. This is underlain by about 33 cm (13 in) of light grayish brown silty clay that
has fine brownish mottles, and the profile ends with about 53 cm (21 in) of light yellowish brown
silty clay with gray and brown mottles (Coffee et al. 1980:28).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Prikryl (1987, 1990) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods
for the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown
(1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake, but it
closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. Detailed synopses of the prehistoric
chronology of the area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

The general historic chronological framework for Northcentral Texas is presented in Table 2 and
is briefly discussed below. The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have
occurred in 1542 when the remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de
Alvarado, entered the area in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers
believe that the expedition crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although
others place the route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman
1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the
region did not occur until the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move
west along the Red River. The area remained largely unsettled until 1841 when people, primarily
from the upper southern states, were drawn by a land grant known as the Peters Colony. The
establishment of railroads in Dallas County by the 1870s resulted in the continued expansion of
the countyâs large-scale crop production. The town of Garland was established in 1887 when a
post office was established between the railroad towns of Duck Creek and Embree (Maxwell
2010). By the mid-twentieth century, Garland had become a major residential and light industrial
community.

METHODS AND RESULTS
Archaeological Investigations
Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission was consulted to determine if any previously recorded cultural properties
or cultural resources management projects have occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6 mile [mi])
radius of the project area. The review indicates that there have been several small surveys and a
very large survey within 1 km of the survey area. The large survey was conducted in 1963 by the
National Park Service in conjunction with the construction of Lake Ray Hubbard. Though sites
were identified during this survey within the lake flood pool, none occurs within the project
review radius. Small linear surveys conducted in 1983 for the EPA were also noted. In 2005, the
LopezGarcia Group conducted a survey for the proposed Duck Creek Wastewater pipeline
(Sundermeyer and Cliff 2005). An ineligible historic scatter (41DL437) was identified, but that
site is outside of the review radius of this project. A single recorded site, 41DL369, is found
within the review radius, but no information was available on the Sites Atlas.
On April 21, 2011, seven trackhoe trenches were excavated within the project area in areas to be
impacted by the widening of Miller Road and the replacement of two bridge structures. Six of the
trenches were located on city-owned public property within the Rowlett Creek floodplain, and
one trench was excavated on private property at the toe of a terrace at the southwestern extent of
the project area. Numerous wetland areas were present throughout the project area (see Figure 2)
and were avoided during trenching. Buried utilities parallel the southern portion of Miller Road
were also avoided (see Figure 2). The majority of the trenches were placed in proximity to the
current channel of Rowlett Creek as physical access for the trackhoe became progressively more
limited east and west of Rowlett Creek. All trenches were oriented parallel with Miller Road,
were a single bucket width (1.2 m [3.9 ft]), and were approximately 6â7 m (19.7â23 ft) in length
at the surface. Originally, all trenches were to be excavated to a depth of 4.5 m (14.8 ft) below
the ground surface; however, each of the trenches was terminated prior to this depth due to either
contact with sterile clay subsoil or due to contact with water or other intrusive subsurface objects
(e.g., dense modern trash deposits or impenetrable riprap). The trench walls were inspected from
the surface, photographed, and approximate depths of specific stratigraphic zones were recorded.
The physical properties of the deposits were described in general accordance with Schoeneberger
et al. (2002) and Birkeland (1999). Trenches were not to be entered unless cultural materials
were observed within the trench walls or within the backfill dirt. As a result, the profile walls
were not cleaned with a shovel or trowel prior to their recording. Accordingly, the specific
vertical extent and boundary conditions of each zone are considered approximate values.
5

The stratigraphic results of the trenches revealed a significant amount of disturbance within the
upper 1â2.7 m (3.3â8.9 ft) across the project area (Table 3). Numerous layers of fill were
consistently noted within this depth, although the composition and depth of the fill deposits
varied between the trenches. Trench 1, excavated northwest of the intersection of Miller Road
and Rowlett Creek, consisted of at least four layers of fill extending to approximately 270
centimeters below surface (cmbs) (Figure 3). The fill layers consisted of alternating colors and
textures that are inconsistent with natural soil formation and were often separated by abrupt
boundaries. The upper 50 cm (20 in) of fill contained several limestone boulders that may have
been used as erosion control during previous construction along Miller Road. Below the fill
layers at approximately 270 cmbs (106.3 inches below surface [inbs]), a very dark gray (10YR
3/1) silty clay A horizon was encountered. This horizon extended to approximately 350 cmbs
(138 inbs) and was underlain by a Bk horizon and a gradual boundary at the A-Bk interface. The
Bk horizon continued to 420 cmbs and consisted of a brown (10YR 4/2) clay with brown (10YR
5/4) mottles and calcium carbonate threads and nodules in increasing quantities with depth. The
A-Bk horizonation is typical of the floodplain soils mapped along Rowlett Creek, and the
presence of fill directly on top of this profile indicates that this A horizon was likely the natural
surface prior to construction activities along this portion of Miller Road. The profile of Trench 6,
excavated approximately 100-m (39 ft) west of Trench 1, was nearly identical to Trench 1 and
generally confirmed this interpretation (Figure 4). No archaeological materials were recovered in
either trench. The units were terminated at 420 cmbs (165 inbs) and 380 cmbs (150 inbs),
respectively, as no additional buried surfaces were encountered below the âpre-constructionâ
natural surface.
Trench 2, excavated northeast of the intersection of Miller Road and Rowlett Creek, also
encountered fill layers to at least 2 m (6.6 ft) below surface but was terminated at this depth due
to contact with impenetrable limestone boulders (Figure 5). The dense concentration of boulders
is consistent with riprap and was likely associated with previous channel stabilization attempts.
A deer size bone shaft fragment was recovered at approximately 50 cmbs (20 inbs) but was found
along with numerous modern trash items (e.g., iron fragments, plastic, and modern ceramic tile
fragments). As several of these items were found at depths to 200 cmbs (79 inbs), it is clear that
the bone is of relatively recent age and is not archaeological.
Because Trench 2 was terminated prior to excavating below fill deposits, an additional trench
(Trench 3) was placed approximately 40 m (131 ft) east of Trench 2 in a similar setting. The fill
encountered in the upper 185 cmbs (73 inbs) was similar to the uppermost Trench 2 profile, but
did not contain limestone boulders. Items recovered from within the upper 60 cmbs (24 inbs) of
the fill include a modern amber glass bottle base, a corn chip bag, and a body fragment of a
ceramic container. The sherd exhibits a natural clay slip interior and a Bristol exterior. The
decoration and general form of the sherd suggests a date of ca. 1890â1915. Unfortunately, it is
clear that the historic sherd was recovered out of context, as a modern rubber shoe sole was
subsequently found at 150 cmbs (59 inbs). Below the fill, a series of dark brown (10YR 3/2) to
dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay A horizons extended between 185 and 280 cmbs (73 and 110
inbs). As in Trench 1, the A horizon was then underlain by a Bk horizon with a gradual boundary
at the interface. The unit was terminated at 360 cmbs (142 inbs), as the Bt horizon became more
developed with depth and no additional buried surfaces were encountered.
Trench 4, excavated on the south side of Miller Road at about the same distance east of Rowlett
Creek as Trench 3, exhibited an almost identical profile to Trench 3 (Figure 6). Again, modern
trash items were found at depths beyond 100 cmbs (39 inbs). For example, a Coca-Cola can with

Trench 5 was excavated near the eastern end of the project area south of Miller Road (Figure 8).
Again, fill was encountered until approximately 185 cmbs (73 inbs) and contained asphalt at
approximately 80 cmbs (32 inbs) and limestone fragments throughout the upper 185 cmbs. The
A horizon, representing the original ground surface, was once again encountered directly below
the fill. The A horizon consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay grading to dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) clay with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles. The mottling is consistent with
redoximorphic features and suggests that sediments at depths of 2 m (6.6 ft) within this area are
exposed to sustained periods of saturation, a setting that is not conducive to the preservation of
archaeological materials. Water was then encountered directly below 2 m, preventing further
excavation of the trench. The results suggest that areas within and immediately adjacent to
wetlands within the project area have a low probability of containing intact deposits.
Lastly, Trench 7 was excavated near the southwestern extent of the project area at the toe of the
terrace flanking the western floodplain. The profile encountered consisted of a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay between 0 and 70 cmbs (28 inbs) underlain abruptly by a light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay between 70 and 200 cmbs (79 inbs). These layers were
recognized as fill as numerous modern items such as plastic and recent machine-cut ceramic tile
were found scattered throughout the upper 200 cmbs. At 200 cmbs, a dense trash deposit was
then encountered (Figure 9). The items within the trash pile, such as a Charmin toilet paper
wrapper, were clearly recent in age and indicate that the area was likely used as a dump prior to
significant construction activities along Miller Road. The unit was terminated once it became
clear that the trash deposits extended well below 200 cmbs.

Architectural Evaluation
An architectural evaluation was required for all structures and buildings within the project area.
An architectural historian who meets the Secretary of the Interiorâs professional qualification
standards conducted the fieldwork for historic-age resources on April 1, 2011. Resources
evaluated for National Register eligibility typically must be at least 50 years of age, making 1961
the latest possible date of construction for resources in the project area to be evaluated for
eligibility.
Buildings 50 years or older may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP based on four criteria
presented in 36 CFR Part 60.4 [a--d]. These four criteria are applied following the identification
of relevant historic themes or patterns. In brief, a resource may possess significance for:
(a) its association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of history; or
(b) its association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) its illustration of a type, period, or method of construction, or for its aesthetic values, or
its representation of the work of a master, or if it represents a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) its ability or potential to yield information important in prehistory or history.
Not only must a resource possess significance in order to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it
must also maintain a certain level of integrity. The National Register defines seven aspects of
integrity: (1) location, (2) setting, (3) design, (4) materials, (5) workmanship, (6) feeling, and (7)
association. Although not all seven aspects of integrity must be present for the resource to be
eligible, the resource must retain, overall, the defining features and characteristics that were
present during the propertyâs period of significance.
A survey of the project area resulted in the identification of three structures associated with the
Rowlett Creek drainage system: one culvert and two bridges (Figure 10). Through the review of
historic aerials, the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database, and onsite observation, it has been
determined that all three structures are not of historic age (constructed 1961 or earlier). As such,
they do not meet NRHP criteria for historic-age structures, and thus were not evaluated for NRHP
eligibility.

Culvert
Located on Miller Road approximately .43 miles east of Centerville Road is am 18-inch
reinforced concrete pipe outfall constructed ca. 1970 (United States Geological Survey 1968)
(Figures 11 and 12). The culvert is not of historic age; therefore, it was not evaluated for NRHP
eligibility.

Bridge 1
Bridge 1 (NBI # 1805709M6140024) is located on Miller Road approximately 1.4 miles west of
Rowlett Road. The structure is a concrete, three-span girder bridge with metal railing constructed
in 1970 (Figure 13) (NBI 2011a). The bridge is supported by two concrete pier bents. Bridge 1
is not of historic-age; therefore, it was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

Figure 13. Bridge 1, looking southeast.

Bridge 2
Bridge 2 (NBI # 1805709M6140017) is located on Miller Road approximately 1.2 miles west of
Rowlett Road. Constructed in 1969, this structure is a 12-span concrete girder bridge supported
by eleven bents (Figure 14) (NBI 2011b). Bridge 2 is not of historic age; therefore, it was not
evaluated for NRHP eligibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of the intensive archaeological survey with trackhoe trenching conducted along Miller
Road at Rowlett Creek in northeast Dallas County did not encounter any cultural materials and
indicated that the majority of the project area has been significantly impacted by previous
construction activities. The results of the trenching indicate that approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) of fill
have been deposited within the project area in association with construction along Miller Road.
A buried A-Bk profile was consistently noted below the fill, but did not contain archaeological
materials. The profile is consistent with soils mapped within the Rowlett Creek floodplain
indicating that the buried surfaces likely represent relatively recent alluvium. No additional
buried surfaces were encountered below the Bk horizon during trenching.
The architectural reconnaissance of the Miller Road project area confirmed that three structures
exist in the APE but are not of historic age (1960 or earlier). Also, none possesses association
with significant events (Criterion A), nor is associated with a person of significance in our past
15

Figure 14. Bridge 2, looking southwest.

(Criterion B), nor represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or embodies the
distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction (Criterion C), nor is likely
to yield information important in our prehistory or history (Criterion D). Therefore, all of the
historic-age resources within the project area fail to meet the requirements for listing in the
NRHP.
No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13
TAC 26.8 were identified during the archaeological investigation of the current project APE.
Therefore, based on the results of this cultural resources survey, there is low to no potential for
deposits containing archaeological materials within the current or proposed ROW. In accordance
with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently,
it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. If archaeological deposits are
encountered during construction, work should cease and the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified.
