ABSTRACT
On 15 September 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Prairie Creek Skilled Nursing
Facility and road in Lindale, Texas with funds provide by a Texas Department of
Agriculture Grant and a Community Development Block Grant. Total project area was
roughly 2.4 hectare (5.8 acres). The pedestrian survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7413 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The visual examination found the road
will be constructed along the backslope of two upland ridges and span Prairie Creek. The
facility will be built on the summit of a narrow upland ridge. An abandoned railroad
grade was observed along the east side of the survey area. The summit of the ridge was
cleared for logging in the past 25 years and a small sand quarry pit was excavated on the
summit. Shovel testing found deep loamy sand on the summit and shallower loamy sand
on the backslopes. Beyond the pit and the railroad bed, no cultural features were
observed. No cultural material was observed on the surface or in shovel tests; therefore,
no artifacts were curated. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of
“no effect” to State Archaeological Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places
eligible properties for the proposed project.

INTRODUCTION
On 15 September 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Prairie Creek Skilled Nursing
Facility and road in Lindale, Texas (Texas Capital Fund Project #7215002) (Figure 1).
The survey was conducted at the request of the City of Lindale in compliance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Texas Antiquities Code.
The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under Section 106
and Texas Antiquities Permit #7413.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The visual inspection found an abandoned
railroad grade on the east side of the survey area and a sand quarry pit in the project area.
The railroad grade is a remnant from the Great Northern Railroad which was built
through Lindale in 1875. The sand quarry was excavated between 2010 and 2011. No
other cultural features or artifacts were observed on the surface. No artifacts were found
in shovel tests; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a
determination of “no effect” to National Register of Historic Places eligible or State
Archaeological Landmarks cultural resources for the proposed trail.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area includes a 2.2 hectare (5.5 acre) site for the proposed nursing
facility and construction of a new street with associated utilities in a right-of-way 18.3
meters (m) (60 feet (ft)) wide and roughly 186 m (610 ft) between Hwy 69 and the
northwest corner of the Company Building Site. The road will continue around the north
and east sides of the building site (Figure 2). Total project area is roughly 2.4 ha (5.8 ac).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Smith County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The large area investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northwest
and Lake Palestine (e.g., Keith 1971) to the south. Large linear surveys were conducted
for new roads around Tyler and Lindale (e.g., Campbell et al. 2008). The smaller surveys
were typically for road and water system improvements (e.g., Nelson and Perttula 2012).
These investigations found, tested, and conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of
historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the surveys mentioned above focused on low lands
and areas adjacent to perennial streams and well developed floodplains. The numerous
small surveys in the area include both upland and lowland settings. The investigations
that documented archaeological sites found that prehistoric and early historic sites were
found adjacent to stream channels in the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe
slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region.
Initially, D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) describe the prehistoric
cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain from southwest Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. The
Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a
particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407)
describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the
south.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic

4

(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks the expulsion of native populations and the
progression of the American immigrants as they established farms, towns, and counties.
The earliest American settler was Elijah Lindsey who founded Lindseydale in 1871
(Smallwood 1999:161). The town name changed in 1874 to Lindale shortly before the
railroad arrived in 1875. Cotton and fruit were the major crops grown in the area. The J.S.
Ogburn and Company Canning Factory was established in 1895 (McCroskey 2010). The
turn of the century saw the arrival of Lindale Reporter newspaper and the Brazelton Prior
Lumber Company (McCroskey 2010). The town continued to expand throughout the
twentieth century as the population of Tyler grew and more people traveled along
Interstate 20.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA
and the Texas Antiquities Code following survey standards described by the Texas
Historic Commission (2015) and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The
purpose of these investigations was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources
within the project area, delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make
a preliminary evaluation of each site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological
Landmark (SAL) designation and/or National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP)
eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics standards of the Texas
Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys,
archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records
show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded
sites. Online records were examined to include the 1917 Smith County soils map and
Google Earth imagery from 1996 to 2015.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
visual examination and shovel testing to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Areas with steep slopes (more than 10%) and areas with exposed
ground surface (e.g., trails and erosional features) were visually inspected. Shovel testing
included excavating an area approximately 30 centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in)
levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in). According to the THC guidelines, the
pedestrian survey included a minimum of 12 shovel tests in the 2.2 ha (5.5 ac) area.
Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter postprocessing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The project area includes a 2.2 hectare (5.5 acre) site for the proposed nursing
facility and construction of a new street with associated utilities in a right-of-way 18.3
meters (m) (60 feet (ft)) wide and roughly 186 m (610 ft) between Hwy 69 and the
northwest corner of the Company Building Site. Topographically, the road will begin on
the backslope of an upland ridge, cross Prairie Creek, and continue on the backslope of
an isolated ridge. The nursing facility will be built on the summit of the isolated ridge.
Vegetation along the road includes pasture grasses west of Prairie Creek and mixed hard
and soft wood trees with an understory of various bushes and vines and a leaf litter
ground cover on the backslope of the eastern ridge. Vegetation on the ridge summit is
mostly shrubs, bushes, and vines with scattered trees. Examination of the 1996 to 2015
images at Google Earth (2015) shows the agricultural terraces in a pasture on the west
side of the road near Hwy 69. The proposed building site appears to have been logged
and is regrowing in the 1996 image. Regrowth is evident in the 2005 image. The 2009
image shows the construction of a sewer line west of the building site and the hill summit
in the building site is cleared. The 2010 image is unchanged. The 2011 image shows a
sand quarry pit on the ridge summit and trails crossing the building site. The 2013 image
shows a sewer line west of Prairie Creek as new construction.
Soils are Wolfpen (WoE) on the backslopes of both ridges, Mantachie (Ma) along
the Prairie Creek stream channel, and Pickton (PkC) on the ridge summit (NRCS 2015).
Wolfpen series soils include A and E horizons 50 to 65 cm (20 to 27 in) deep of loamy
fine sand over a sandy clay Bt horizon. Mantachie series soils have an A horizon of fine
sandy loam over a poorly defined B horizon of grayish brown loam which formed in
loamy alluvium. Gley colors become more prominent with depth. Pickton series soils
are loamy fine sand roughly 137 cm (54 in) deep over sandy clay loam in Eocene-age
Queen City and Wilcox Group sediments. Of the three soil series, the Pickton soils are
most likely to contain cultural resources because of their location on the landscape, but
their deep loose nature is not conducive for retaining cultural features.
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2015) found no archaeological investigation or recorded archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of the project area. The closest documented archaeological

7

investigation was for the Lindale Community Park roughly 2.6 km (1.6 mi) north of the
project area; no sites were recorded (Galan 2014). The next closest archaeological survey
was for a water well and pipeline roughly 2.6 km (1.6 mi) to the northeast. Perttula and
Nelson (2012) did not record any archaeological sites. The closest research that recorded
archaeological sites was for a Loop around Lindale roughly 3.4 km (2.1 mi) west of the
project area (Campbell et al. 2008).

Five archaeological sites were found in two

alternative routes of which one site, 41SM388, was part of a testing effort (Haefner et al.
2012). No cultural features were found in the backhoe trenching or 1x1m test units on
41SM388 within the proposed right-of-way. There is one historical marker in the Lindale
city limits for the Whisenhunt-Kinzie House (Marker 15545) near the center of town.
Finally, examination of the 1917 soils map shows the Great Northern Railroad (PTH
2015) passing along the eastern edge of the project area; but, no buildings or other
structures are shown on the map near the area. Based on the previous investigations, the
best potential for finding cultural features is on the summit of the ridge in the proposed
building area because of it similarity to 41SM388.
Surface inspection of the project area confirmed the analysis of the Google Earth
images (Figure 3). The west end of the road was in pasture with agricultural terraces
visible on the slope. Two sewer line right-of-ways were observed flanking Prairie Creek.
Prairie Creek was a shallow stream in a deeply incised channel with cutbanks roughly 3
m (10 ft) high. The backslopes of the ridge were steep. Visual inspection of the trails
and examining the wooded area between the trails did not find any cultural material
beyond modern trash left by people using the 4-wheeler trails. The ridge east of Prairie
Creek was wooded in mixed hardwood and softwood trees and the ridge summit was
cleared of large trees. The sand quarry pit and fill material was observed near the eastern
boundary of the project area. The pit is roughly 4m (13 ft) deep and 20 m (65 ft) in
diameter. The walls of the pit showed a profile of loamy sand roughly 1.5 m (4 ft) deep
over mottled sandy clay. The Great Northern Railroad bed was a level, linear cut surface
with gravel along the eastern boundary of the project area. The northern and southern
ends of the railroad cut ended where fill material was used to maintain the grade over
drainages (Figure 4).

A total of 17 shovel tests were excavated across the project area with an emphasis
on ridge summit (Figure 4 and Table 1). Fewer tests were excavated in sloped and
disturbed areas adjacent to the sewer lines and on the steep backslopes of the ridge. Two
tests (ST1 and2) were excavated on the western ridge backslope. Both tests found loose
light brown loamy sand between agricultural terraces. Pebble size quartzite and petrified
wood gravels were common close to the B horizon. The remaining 15 shovel tests (ST317) were excavated on the summit and shoulder of the eastern ridge. These tests found
light brown loamy sand ranging in depth from more than 90 cm (36 in) deep near the
summit to 20 cm (8 in) deep on the ridge shoulder. No cultural material was found in the
shovel tests. Well rounded quartzite and petrified wood pebbles were few to common in
shovel tests. None of the pebbles were fractured with predictable patterns.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Lindale, Texas will use Texas Capital Fund Project #7215002 to build
a street to the proposed Prairie Creek Skilled Nursing Facility on a 2.2 ha (5.4 ac) lot.
The total APE is 2.4 ha (5.8 ac). The project was reviewed under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas.

The

archaeological survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #7413.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The visual inspection found an abandoned
railroad grade on the east side of the survey area and a sand quarry pit in the project area.
The railroad grade is a remnant from the Great Northern Railroad which was built
through Lindale in 1875. The sand quarry was excavated between 2010 and 2011. No
other cultural features or artifacts were observed on the surface. No artifacts were found
in shovel tests; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
Based on the shovel test results, the visual examination, and the disturbance, there
is little chance of encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the
project area; however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials
are discovered during construction, then the project activity will cease in the immediate
area and DETAC shall be notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by
the National Historic Preservation Act and SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of
Texas.
