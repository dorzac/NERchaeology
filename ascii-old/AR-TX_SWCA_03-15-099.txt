ABSTRACT
On February 12 and 18, 2015, at the request of Sedgwick, LLP and on behalf of Leander Independent
School District (LISD), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural
resources investigation of a proposed 5,400-foot long access road to the LISD Vandergrift High School
and Four Points Middle School campus (LISD campus) in the City of Austin, Travis County, Texas. The
project involves the construction, use, and maintenance of an access road to the existing LISD campus
near the intersection of Ranch-to-Market 2222 and McNeil Drive in northwest Austin. Additional project
elements include two construction staging areas, a bridge spanning the headwaters of Bull Creek, a
sidewalk, stormwater and water quality controls, drives from the access road into the LISD campus,
fencing, signage, and lighting.
The proposed road and its related facilities would be constructed on the LISD campus, as well as partially
within an existing infrastructure corridor through adjacent Travis County preserve lands of the Balcones
Canyonlands Conservation Plan, and on adjacent private properties. The 420-foot wide infrastructure
corridor currently contains four electric transmission lines operated by the City of Austin or the Lower
Colorado River Authority and other buried utilities. LISD would construct the proposed access road
within a 100-foot wide permanent right-of-way through the infrastructure corridor and adjacent private
property. The area of potential effects (APE) for archaeology is defined as all direct disturbance areas on
LISD property, within the larger infrastructure corridor and on the adjacent private properties. SWCA’s
survey corridor expanded to a maximum width of 200 feet as necessary to capture associated project
facilities, such as the construction staging areas, stormwater and water quality ponds, and the temporary
bridge construction access and work areas. As such, the APE for archaeology measured approximately
5,400 feet long and up to 200 feet wide; encompassing approximately 21.2 acres. With the exception of
bridge footings that will have disturbances extending approximately 50 feet below ground surface, project
area disturbances will extend to depths ranging from approximately 0.5 to 5.0 feet.
Archaeological investigations were conducted to comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) as the
project falls within property owned or controlled by LISD and Travis County, political subdivisions of the
State of Texas. Additionally, as the proposed project may require an incidental take permit from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service under Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, portions of the
project are subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The goal of the work was to
locate all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites within the proposed survey area, establish vertical
and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site
recorded for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The investigations were initiated with a background review of previous
work, historic map review, and an archival review of the APE parcels. The background review determined
that a portion of the APE has been previously surveyed and that three archaeological sites (41TV2120–
2122) are within or adjacent to the APE. Two of these sites, 41TV2121 and 41TV2122, extend into the
21.2-acre direct disturbance zone. When originally recorded, all three sites were recommended as not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Historic maps revealed no possible
historic-age structures within or adjacent to the property.
Fieldwork was conducted on February 12 and 18, 2015, during which time a total of 20 shovel tests were
systematically excavated across the survey area. No new archaeological sites were documented. Areas
adjacent to previously recorded sites 41TV2121 and 41TV2122 were revisited. SWCA’s survey
investigations adjacent to 41TV2121 revealed that a small part (e.g., very low-density scatter consisting
of prehistoric debitage and one crude biface) of the site extends north and west into the current project
area. Based on the low-density surface scatter, lack of a buried component, lack of temporal diagnostics,
and geologic and soil conditions within the impact area that are not conducive to preserving intact buried
cultural deposits, SWCA recommends that the part of 41TV2121 that extends into the current project area

i

is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. SWCA’s investigation found no
traces of 41TV2120 or 41TV2122 within the current project area.
In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA, on behalf of LISD, made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources within the survey area for direct
disturbances. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP, according to
36 CFR 60.4, or for designation as an SAL, according to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26.12, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources investigations are warranted and the project should be allowed
to proceed as planned.

stormwater and water quality ponds, and the
temporary bridge construction access and work
areas. Given these parameters, the APE for
archaeology measured approximately 5,400 feet
long and up to 200 feet wide; and encompassed
approximately 21.2 acres. With the exception of
bridge footings that will have disturbances
extending approximately 50 feet below ground
surface, the majority of project area disturbances
will extend to depths ranging from approximately
0.5 to 5.0 feet. LISD proposes to avoid, to the
maximum extent practicable, the use of surface
grading or subsurface excavation to construct the
road. Instead, grade for the road will be
established with the placement of fill, using
retaining walls where necessary to contain the fill.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Leander Independent School District
(LISD), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources
investigation of a proposed 5,400-foot access road
for LISD’s Vandergrift High School and Four
Points Middle School campus (LISD campus) in
northwest City of Austin, Travis County, Texas
(Figure 1). The project involves the construction,
use, and maintenance of the access road to the
existing LISD campus near the intersection of
Ranch-to-Market (RM) 2222 and McNeil Drive.
The western terminus of the proposed road is 740
feet southeast of the intersection of Four Points
Drive and River Place Boulevard at Tech Trail
(Figure 2). The proposed access road extends
roughly 5,400 feet east-northeast before
terminating at the LISD campus. Other project
elements include a bridge spanning the headwaters
of Bull Creek, a sidewalk, storm water and water
quality controls, access drives from the road into
the LISD campus, fencing, signage, and lighting.

Archaeological investigations examined 100
percent of the proposed access road and associated
facilities within the direct disturbance areas on
both public (e.g., LISD and Travis County) and
private (e.g., TPG-Four Points and 3M Company)
properties. The survey was performed to comply
with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), as the
project includes public property owned or
controlled (or lands that will be owned) by LISD
and Travis County, political subdivisions of the
state. Additionally, as the proposed project may
require an incidental take permit from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under Section
10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA),
portions of the project are subject to Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

The proposed road and its related facilities would
be constructed on the LISD campus, partially
within an existing 420-foot-wide infrastructure
corridor through Travis County’s adjacent Sam
Hamilton Memorial Reserve East and Ribelin
tracts of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation
Plan (BCCP), as well as on adjacent private
properties belonging to 3M and TPG-Four Points
(see Figure 2). The 420-foot-wide infrastructure
corridor currently contains four electric
transmission lines operated by the City of Austin
or the Lower Colorado River Authority and other
buried utilities. LISD would construct the
proposed access road within a 100-foot-wide
permanent right-of-way (ROW).

The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in
the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the APE,
and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any
site recorded within the APE for inclusion to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). Mercedes Cody served as Project
Archaeologist, conducting survey investigations
with Field Technicians Alamea Young and
Melissa Garcia on February 12 and 18, 2015.

The area of potential effects (APE) for
archaeology was defined as all direct disturbance
areas within the larger infrastructure corridor and
adjacent private properties. SWCA’s survey
corridor expanded to a maximum width of 200 feet
as necessary to capture associated project
facilities, such as the construction staging areas,

location of the proposed project (see Figure 2).
Vegetation
The project area is on the Edwards Plateau, which
is described as rough, rocky areas with a tall to
mid-grass understory and a mixed overstory of
oaks, juniper, and mesquite that blends into other
vegetative regions along its northern and western
boundaries.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geology
The survey area is mapped as Lower Cretaceousage Key Valley Marl of the Fredericksburg Group
(Fisher 1974). Keys Valley Marl consists of soft,
white marl (e.g., a lime-rich mud or mudstone)
with various marine fossils (e.g., Exogyra texana
and pelecypods) and is approximately 40 feet
thick. Given the age, which predates known
human occupation in Texas, and nature of this
formation, it has little to no potential to contain
buried archaeological material.

Vegetation within the APE is classified mainly as
Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department [TPWD] 1984). This
vegetation type consists primarily of mixed
juniper-oak woodlands with smaller sections of
broadleaf evergreen woodlands, grassland, and
evergreen shrublands. Species associated with the
woodlands and shrublands may include Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), plateau live oak
(Quercus fusiformis), Texas oak (Q. buckleyi),
shin oak (Q. sinuate var. breviloba), cedar elm
(Ulmus crassifolia), evergreen sumac (Rhus
virens), escarpment cherry (Prunus serotina),
elbowbush (Forestiera angustifolia), and twistleaf
yucca (Yucca pallida). Species associated with the
grassland
may
include

(Schizachyrium scoparium), Texas wintergrass
(Nassella leucotricha), Texas grama (Bouteloua
rigidiseta), meadow dropseed (Sporobolus
drummondii),
and
cedar
sedge
(Carex
planostachys).

Soils
There are four soil units mapped within the
property that, in order of predominance, include
Tarrant and Speck soils (0–2 percent slopes),
Tarrant-rock outcrop complex (18–50 percent
slopes), Speck Stony clay loam (1–5 percent
slopes), and Volente silty clay loam (1–8 percent
slopes). The Tarrant and Speck soils are mapped
as covering the western half of the APE and along
the eastern edge of the APE and are characterized
as occupying ridges and are composed of Tarrant
soils (63 percent), Speck soils (33 percent), and
clay (4 percent). Tarrant soils have a 10-inch-thick
surface layer composed of dark, grayish brown
clay with common limestone fragments overlying
limestone (Natural Resource Conservation Service
[NRCS] 2015; Werchan et al. 1974). The Speck
soils have a 14-inch surface layer composed of
reddish-brown clay loam overlying gravelly clay.

2008:Figure 13.2). This unstemmed type cooccurs with Bell and Andice points, which are
basally notched, stemmed point forms (Mahoney
et al. 2003; Sorrow et al. 1967). Wyckoff’s (1995)
research suggests that Bell and Andice points (also
known as Calf Creek points) are intrinsically
linked to bison hunting. Their appearance at the
beginning of the Middle Archaic is presumably
related to the return of bison to the area ca. 5000
B.P. Nolan and La Jita points, which have square
to rectangular stems with weak, rounded, or abrupt
shoulders, appear in the Central Texas
archaeological record ca. 4800 B.P. and persist into
the beginning of the Late Archaic (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2).

The Middle Archaic is commonly dated to ca.
6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 2004:120). During the
beginning of the Middle Archaic, from
approximately 5750–5250 B.P., Johnson and
Goode (1994:73) contend that a brief warm and
dry period arose. Hudler (2000) also documents a
major climatic shift towards warmer and drier
conditions ca. 5300 B.P., followed by a very brief
wet interval. Johnson and Goode (1994:73) also
believe this dry period was followed by a short
period of climatic amelioration between 5250–
4600 B.P. with moderately wet and cool
conditions.
The Middle Archaic is marked by a significant
increase in archaeological sites on the Edwards
Plateau. It is difficult to determine if this increase
is due to a larger, denser population or an increase
in residential mobility (Turpin 2004). In either
case, there is abundant evidence that settlement
and subsistence became more regionally
specialized during this time. Burned rock hearths,

SITE EVALUATIONS

A cultural resources investigation was conducted
within the current project area in 2004 and 2014
by archaeologists from the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA). The survey was conducted
within high probability areas within the
transmission line corridor that bisects the current
project area roughly east to west. Three cultural
resource sites (41TV2120–2122) were recorded
within the infrastructure corridor during this
investigation. Site 41TV2120 is approximately
523 feet east of the nearest direct disturbance area
(and would not be impacted by the proposed
construction), while a small portion of site
41TV2121 may extend into the eastern half of the
direct disturbance zone. Site 41TV2122 is near the
center of the APE west of Bull Creek, and a small
portion of the site appears to extend into the direct
disturbance zone. Atlas (2015) indicates that these
three sites are ineligible for inclusion on the
NRHP, however, no other information pertaining
to these surveys or sites can be found.

Each reevaluated or newly recorded prehistoric
and/or historic archaeological site was assessed for
eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP according to
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.4., or
for designation as an SAL according to 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26.8 of the Rules of
Practice and Procedure. Assessments considered
both the archaeological aspects of sites and any
standing structures. NRHP eligibility assessed the
following criteria:
(a) associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics
of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of
a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to
yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

In addition to three sites described above, 35
archaeological sites have been identified within 1
mile of the proposed project area (Table 1). Of
these sites, two are considered eligible for the
NRHP, while the remaining 33 sites are
considered unevaluated or ineligible. Site

Exposed bedrock is prevalent throughout the APE
(Figure 7). Additionally, the ground surface is
littered with limestone cobbles and boulders as
well as degraded fragments of limestone bedrock.
Shovel testing revealed dark grayish brown
(10YR4/2) clay loam over very shallow limestone
bedrock at 5–10 cm below surface (cmbs) (Table
3). The THC minimum survey standards for
project areas 10 to 100 acres in size requires one
shovel test per 2 acres. Thus, approximately 11
shovel tests are required within the 21.2-acre APE.
SWCA excavated a total of 20 negative shovel
tests (ST01–20). Based on extensive disturbances

from the previous construction of retention ponds
on the 3M property in the west end of the APE for
archaeology, shovel testing was not warranted
west of ST01 (see Figure 3).

Due to steep slopes, the prevalence of thin clay
soils overlying bedrock and exposures of bedrock,
the APE has little to no potential to contain intact,
buried cultural deposits. However, the survey

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a Proposed Access Road to Leander ISD’s Vandergrift High
School and Four Points Middle School Campus
The current investigation found the site to be in a
disturbed setting, extensively altered by the
construction and maintenance of numerous
overhead transmission lines, as well as dirt twotrack roads (Figure 9). The northernmost extent of
the site, extending into the direct disturbance zone,
is moderately wooded and relatively undisturbed
by artificial impacts. However, extensive sheet
erosion is evidenced by abundant bedrock
exposures.

Site 41TV2121
Site 41TV2121 is a small, surficial prehistoric
lithic scatter that was initially recorded by LCRA
in 2004 during a transmission line survey. The site
is in the eastern end of the current APE on a
generally level upland plain east of Bull Creek and
north of the baseball fields on the LISD campus.
Near the northern and western boundaries of the
known site, SWCA’s recent survey discovered a
sparse scatter of chipped-stone debitage and one
crude biface on the ground surface within the
direct disturbance area (Figure 8). No temporally
diagnostic chipped stone tools or cultural features
were identified. Based on the extent of cultural
material, the site boundary was extended
approximately 36 m to the northwest and now
measures 90 m northwest to southeast and 60 m
northeast to southwest.

A series of seven shovel tests (ST10–16) (see
Figures 3 and 8) excavated in and adjacent to the
site extension discovered no buried cultural
materials, only very shallow (maximum depth of
10 cmbs) dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt clay
intermixed with limestone gravels and eroding
bedrock overlying limestone bedrock (see Table
3).

Figure 8. Site 41TV2121 map.

extensively altered by the construction and
maintenance of numerous overhead utilities as
well as dirt two-track roads. The northernmost
portion of the site is plotted within the currently
proposed direct disturbance area. This area is
moderately wooded with mature cedar, few vines,
and short grasses. The landform is mostly level
with gradual slopes to the north and east. These
slopes are subjected to frequent slope wash as
evidenced by several small washes with abundant
exposed bedrock.
A total of five negative shovel tests (ST03 and
ST17–20) were excavated within and adjacent to
the northern boundary of the site. Shovel testing
revealed shallow, dark grayish brown (10YR4/2)
and very dark brown (7.5YR2.5/3) loam and clay
loam over limestone bedrock from 2–20 cmbs (see
Table 3).

Figure 9. Overview of previous disturbance at site
41TV2121, facing west.
Based on the shallow upland soils and the
abundance of natural and artificial disturbances,
site 41TV2121 has no potential to contain intact,
buried cultural deposits eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or that warrant SAL designation. No
temporally diagnostic chipped stone tools or
cultural features were identified. The extension of
the site within the current project area was
evaluated according to NRHP and SAL criteria.
Based on extensive prior disturbances, a lack of
potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, and
the overall lack of integrity, site 41TV2121 is
recommended as not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Accordingly,
no further work is recommended.

The current investigation found no traces of site
41TV2122 within the direct disturbance area. In
addition, the shallow, residual nature of the soils
and the abundance of exposed limestone bedrock
indicate little to no potential for intact, buried
cultural deposits. Based on the lack of cultural
material and no potential for buried cultural
deposits, site 41TV2122 will not be impacted by
the proposed construction activities, and no further
work is recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey on behalf of LISD for a proposed LISD
access road for the LISD campus, City of Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The APE for archaeology
was defined as all direct disturbance areas within
the larger infrastructure corridor and adjacent
private properties. SWCA’s survey corridor
expanded to a maximum width of 200 feet as
necessary to capture associated project facilities,
such as the construction staging areas, stormwater
and water quality ponds, and the temporary bridge
construction access and work areas. As such, the
APE for archaeology measured approximately
5,400 feet long and up to 200 feet wide; and
encompassed approximately 21.2 acres. Most of
the project area disturbances will extend to a depth
of 0.5 to 5.0 feet, with the exception of bridge

Site 41TV2122
Site 41TV2122 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that
was initially recorded by LCRA in 2004 during a
transmission line survey. The site is located 230
meters (m) west of Bull Creek and northeast of the
nearby 3M campus, and only the northernmost
portion of the site is plotted within the direct
disturbance area. The site is situated on a gradual
to moderate slope, and three transmission lines and
a network of two-track roads bisect the central
portion of the site. Based on the extent of cultural
material, the site measures 80 m north to south and
105 m east to west.
The current investigation found the site to be in a
disturbed setting similar to that of site 41TV2121.
The central portion of site 41TV2122 has been

However, SWCA discovered a small extension of
41TV2121 within the direct disturbance area near
the LISD campus. The site is extensively altered
by erosion and mechanical disturbances. Based on
those prior disturbances, as well as no potential for
intact, buried cultural deposits due to thin clay
rocky soils that developed in place from the
underlying limestone bedrock, and the overall lack
of integrity, site 41TV2121 is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. Accordingly, no further
work is recommended.

footings, which will have disturbances to a
maximum depth of 50 feet below ground surface.
Archaeological investigations were performed to
comply with the ACT as the project falls within
property owned or controlled by LISD and Travis
County, political subdivisions of the state.
Additionally, as the proposed project may require
an incidental take permit from the USFWS under
Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, portions of the
project are subject to Section 106 of the NHPA.
The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in
the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the APE,
and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any
site recorded within the property for inclusion to
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. The
investigations included a background review of
previous work, historic map review, and an
intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
portions of the APE.

In accordance with the ACT and 33 CFR 800.4,
SWCA, on behalf of LISD, has made a reasonable
and good faith effort to identify cultural resources
within the APE for archaeology. As no properties
were identified that meet the criteria for listing on
the NRHP, according to 36 CFR 60.4, or for
designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC
26.12, SWCA recommends no further cultural
resources investigations are warranted within the
project APE.

The background review determined that a portion
of the APE has been previously surveyed and that
three archaeological sites (41TV2120–2122) are
within or adjacent to the APE. All three sites were
recommended as not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Historic
maps revealed no possible historic-age structures
within or adjacent to the property.
During the cultural resources survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined 21.2 acres with an
intensive pedestrian inspection and the excavation
of 20 shovel tests. In general, the APE for
archaeology consists of an eroded and rocky
upland setting with very shallow soil. As the APE
is located adjacent to commercial and residential
development, there was a significant amount of
disturbance throughout. Disturbances consist of
road construction and maintenance activity,
overhead utilities, and sheet erosion.
The SWCA investigations included areas adjacent
to previously recorded sites 41TV2121 and
41TV2122. SWCA’s current investigations found
no trace of 41TV2122 extending into the direct
disturbance area.
