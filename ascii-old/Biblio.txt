Consolidated Bibliography
EXPLANATION: Following is a consolidated bibliography that incorporates all the
individual chapter bilibographies from the dissertation. References from the appendices
are not included. Where the same reference is cited in different chapters, I have not
reconciled the different citation forms -- for example, Richard Fullington’s chapter on
mollusca is listed as “Fullington 1978a” in Chapter 8, but as “Fullington 1978” in
Chapter 9. I have simply listed both versions. There are other cases where “Smith 2000”
might refer to a particular article in one chapter and to an entirely different article in a
different chapter. Again, I have not reconciled these, but simply listed the different
sources as originally given in the chapter bilibographies.
