From the Editor’s Desk
Down to the Sea in Ships
Applying dry-land techniques and tools to sunken vessels has grown into a relatively new
branch of Anthropology. From ancient sculptures, like the Venus de Milo, to the skeleton of
the sailor trapped in LaBelle, the story of ships is the story of the men and women who
sailed on them. We are fascinated by Pitcairn Island, by Brendan the Navigator, by the Tahitians who sailed to the Hawaiian Islands, and by the KonTiki, built by Thor Heyerdahl.
When I was a child we had an elderly workman who as a young man had twice sailed around Cape Horn in tall ships. He
spoke of these adventures as the highlight of his life. I guess I was really impressed, because when I got old enough to
start thinking about a bucket list, Cape Horn was near the top. Not only did I sail around it, but I got to go onshore for a
while. There is a monument there to the men who have been killed in this endeavor. The weather got bad, and we had to
return to the ship before we had time to climb all the way to the memorial. Nevertheless, I claim bragging rights:
I HAVE SAILED AROUND THE HORN!

La Belle of Dark Waters – The Discovery, Recovery, Conservation,
and Reconstruction of La Salle’s 1686 Shipwreck
Bradford M. Jones
Archeology Division
Texas Historical Commission
Abstract

The French explorer Rene Cavelier Sieur de La Salle’s 1684 expedition to found a colony on the
Mississippi River ended in his death in the wilderness of Texas in 1687, in part because of the loss of
their only ship La Belle. Grounded in 1686 inside of Matagorda Bay, La Belle was the key to La
Salle achieving his goals, and its loss a watershed moment that led to the tragedy that followed. The
identification of La Belle by Texas Historical Commission archaeologists in 1995 led to the full scale
excavation of the lower third of the hull and the recovery of nearly 2 million artifacts. Now, over
twenty years since La Belle was raised from its watery grave, this presentation will take you through
the discovery, recovery and conservation of the ship culminating in the reconstruction of the hull in
the Bullock Texas State Historical Museum.
