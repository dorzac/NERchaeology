ABSTRACT

On January 29–30, 2019, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. conducted an
archeological survey of .8 miles (9.7 acres) between President George Bush Turnpike (SH161) and
Liberty Grove Road for the proposed Merritt Road Interconnector. Fieldwork was conducted to
comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas
under Antiquities Permit 8610. Sixteen subsurface shovel tests and three mechanically excavated
trenches revealed no cultural material in the proposed project footprint. Surveyors found a survey
area with dense clay and minimal potential for containing archeological material. Lacking structures
in the project vicinity, no architectural history survey was warranted. Based on the results of the
survey, AmaTerra recommends that no further work is warranted and that the proposed project
proceed with no significant cultural resources affected. All notes and forms generated while
conducting fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of a 9.7-acre archeological survey for the City of Rowlett’s proposed
Merritt Road Interconnector within the City of Rowlett in Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). Over two
days of fieldwork on January 29 and 30, 2019, archeologists excavated sixteen shovel tests and three
mechanical trenches along the proposed project’s footprint, all devoid of cultural material. AmaTerra
recommends that the proposed project has minimal potential to adversely impact significant
archeological resources and should proceed with no further work or coordination required.

1.1

Project Description

The proposed Merritt Road Interconnector is located between President George Bush Turnpike
(State Highway 161) and Liberty Grove Road. The project consists of a 0.8-mile new roadway and
bridge over Muddy Creek to connect President George Bush Turnpike and Liberty Grove Road
(Figures 1 and 2).

Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) is the City of Rowlett’s engineering contractor for this project. The
proposed roadway will establish a new 100-foot-wide right-of-way (ROW) to be owned by the city of
Rowlett. This proposed ROW is currently composed of several parcels that Rowlett will acquire from
the City of Dallas or private landowners.
The project’s depth of impact has not been defined, but archeologists estimate that the surface
roadway will impact sediments to depths of approximately three feet while the bridge pilings will
extend well below that depth.

1.2

Management Summary

Project engineers have identified that the road’s Muddy Creek crossing will require an Individual
Permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to be issued by the United States army Corps of
Engineers. This permit calls for federal-level cultural resource regulatory oversight outlined in
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106). In addition,
the City of Rowlett will own and manage the roadway right-of-way once it has been acquired from
the current landowners. Accordingly, all construction is subject to state-level archeological resource
regulation defined in the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). This project is not being coordinated
through the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).

Project engineers at Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) coordinated the project with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in a letter dated February 1, 2018 (Alredge to Wolfe) and received a response
stating that archeological survey would be required for regulatory compliance (letter, Shelton to
Alredge, 3/15/2018; Appendix A). With no recommendation for architectural history survey
included in the THC’s project review response and no potentially historic-age structures in the
vicinity, architectural history survey was considered unwarranted and was not conducted.

1.3

Administrative Information

Fieldwork was conducted on January 29 and 30, 2019. AmaTerra archeologist Amy Goldstein served
as the Principal Investigator with a field crew comprised of Brittany McClain and Sara Parkin.
Approximately 20-person hours were expended in conducting the field survey. Because fieldwork
was of limited duration this report is presented as an abbreviated “Short Report” in accordance with
Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Standards.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SUMMARY

The project setting is located within the North-Central Plains physiographic region (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996), within the Blackland Prairie vegetation region as defined by Gould et al.
(Gould et al. 1960). The Blackland Prairie was historically characterized as a prairie consisting of tall
grasses, productive soils, and gentle topography; however, much of the region is currently comprised
of crop land and other agriculture uses (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2019). According to Collins,
geographically the project area is characterized as an area of low topographic relief and poor
drainage that is prone to frequent flooding (Collins 1995).
The survey area is located in an area consisting of fallow pasture/fields, woodland areas, and
encroaching wetlands. There is roadway development adjacent to both the easternmost and
westernmost sections of the project area; disturbances associated with this development are more
frequent near the western project terminus. Disturbances include existing facilities, fence lines,
constructed footpaths and ATV trails alongside Muddy Creek and its tributary, and residential
construction.

2.1

Geology and Soils

According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (USGS 2019), the entire project footprint overlies the Late
Cretaceous-era Ozan Formation. Recorded soils include a 500-meter-wide band of Trinity clay
alluvium that composes the Muddy Creek floodplain with associated Houston Black and
Heiden/Ferris-Heiden complex clays on adjacent terraces (USDA-NCSS 2019; Figure 3).

2.2

Cultural History

The project area is located within the northeastern portion of the North Central Texas archeological
region. The cultural history of the project area is generally divided into four major time periods:
Paleoindian (9000–6500 BC), Archaic (6500 BC–AD 750), Late Prehistoric (AD 700–1600), and
Historic (A.D. 1600 to present) (Prewitt 1981). The prehistoric periods are principally defined by the
presence of diagnostic projectile points and other technologies that are intended to delineate change
in socio-cultural patterns. However, cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the
vast area of Texas; in some regions, hunting and gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory;
in others, cultures with farming and settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures in North
Central Texas appeared to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods, with moderate changes in technology.

Paleoindian (11,000–8500 BC)

The earliest undisputed time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian Period. In
north Texas, it is generally considered to date from about 11,000 to about 8,500 years before present
(BP). The archeological evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of northern
Texas were highly nomadic hunters and gatherers (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). Populations were
likely small and dispersed, and they exploited a variety of wild food resources. Stone tool technology
and faunal remains suggest that Paleoindian peoples relied heavily on exploitation of mega-fauna
such as mammoth and bison. This focus on big game hunting fostered a distinctive lithic technology
characterized by large, leaf-shaped fluted projectile points. Folsom and Clovis points are diagnostic
of this time period. However, it has been acknowledged through more recent studies that a
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence economy that included exploitation of medium to
small animals, marine resources, and various plants was common.

Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources. A small
number of archeological sites dating to this earliest time period are known to occur in north-central
Texas. In counties surrounding the project area, only seven archeological sites have been dated to the
Paleoindian Period (two percent of the total datable sites recorded; Biesaart et al. 1985, Collins
1995). Over the 2,500-year span of the Paleoindian Period, this calculates to about one known site
per 357 years of occupation. As a consequence of this scarcity, these inherently valuable
archeological sites are considered to be significant cultural resources.

Archaic (8500 BC–1250 BC)

Much of Texas prehistory resides within the Archaic Period – a long time span dominated by hunting
and gathering societies. This period is notable for changes in the style of projectile points and tools
and the introduction of grinding implements and ground-stone ornaments. This indicates a gradually
increasing population that utilized abundant plant and animal resources of environments similar to
those of modern times. The primary weapon during the Archaic was the spearthrower or atlatl.
Climate patterns wavered during the Archaic Period but were generally warmer than in the
Paleoindian Period.

Near the end of the Paleoindian Period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming gradually
warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). In response, plant and animal populations also
changed, and the human populations in north Texas began to exploit a wider variety of food
resources. Large game was no longer the primary focus of subsistence. Changes in technology
included a more diverse suite of lithic tools, increased use of grinding stones and the development of
basketry. Pottery is absent. This adaptation is known as the Archaic Period and has been dated in
north Texas as occurring between about 8500 BP and 1250 BP. The Archaic Period is subdivided into
the Early Archaic (8500–6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000–3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500–
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Survey—City of Rowlett’s Proposed Merritt Road Interconnector, Dallas County, Texas

1250 BP). Each of these subdivisions has characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points,
which suggest differences in economy and possibly regional affiliations.

Of the more than 240 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding counties, 54
percent date to the Archaic Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). Over the 7,250-year span of the Archaic
Period, this calculates to about one known site per 54 years of occupation, a five-fold increase over
the Paleoindian Period. Archaic Period archeological sites are thus not quite so rare as Paleoindian
sites, but their data potential can be significant, especially if they are undisturbed. Consequently, a
high proportion of Archaic Period sites are considered to be significant cultural resources.

Late Prehistoric (1250–250 BC)

During the Late Prehistoric Period (1250–250 BC), major changes in technology were adopted by the
people living in North Central Texas. The development of ceramics and the introduction of the bow
and arrow allowed for significant changes in economic strategies and shifts in social structures. Also,
during this time crops such as maize appeared in Late Prehistoric peoples’ diet (Brown and Lebo
1990:16). It is uncertain whether this multitude of changes were locally produced or acquired
through trading, but the ramifications of such activity resulted in a more diversified economy.
Settlement patterns also changed to include larger villages with houses (Ferring and Yates 1997:6).
At about 1060 BP, there is some evidence that the climate in north Texas became somewhat drier.
During the latter half of the Late Prehistoric Period, bison spread over the plains of North Texas and
became a vital resource (Brown and Lebo 1990:16).

Of the more than 300 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding counties, about
44 percent date to the Late Prehistoric Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). This calculates to about one
known site per eleven years of occupation during the 1,150 years of this time period— a five-fold
increase over the preceding Archaic Period and 30-fold increase over the Paleoindian Period. This
higher density of archeological sites dating to the Late Prehistoric Period is likely due to a
combination of variables, including better preserved (and thus more likely to be discovered) sites, as
well as higher levels of human population. Consequently, Late Prehistoric Period sites are common
in northern Texas. Their significance is evaluated with respect to the degree of preservation, site type,
and artifact content.

Historic (250 BC–present)

During the Historic Period (250–100 BC), contact with Europeans to the south and east intensified
and the widespread use of metal tools, firearms, and the horse dramatically altered and largely
replaced earlier economic and social adaptations. During this period or early contact, the Wichita
peoples practiced limited cultivation in northern Texas (Prikryl 1987:178). During the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, the Comanche migrated from the northern plains into much of Texas. On
the eastern margins of this area were the Caddo peoples.

The city of Rowlett, located in northeast Dallas County, is bordered by the Trinity River (now
submerged under Lake Ray Hubbard) and Rowlett Creek. The creek, which starts in Collin County,
was named after an early settler, Dr. Daniel Rowlett. In 1886, the Greenville & Dallas Railroad (later
purchased by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad) built a line through the settlement. Rowlett
received a post office in 1889 and by 1900, it had two doctors, a cotton gin, three general stores, a
barbershop, a blacksmith shop, two churches, a depot, and a post office. Electricity was introduced in
1924, and in 1952, Rowlett was incorporated as a city with 250 citizens and 10 businesses. The
construction of IH 30 in 1960 and the completion of Lake Ray Hubbard in 1971 were significant
factors in the growth of Rowlett and the community’s transformation from a small, agricultural
center into a suburb of Dallas (Ruyle 2010).

Previous Archeological Studies and Site Potential Data

Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the THC
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas 2019) and a review of historical maps and aerial photographs.
Research focused on the identification of archeological sites, sites listed as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs), Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites and/or districts listed on or
determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and previously
conducted archeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62 miles) of the project area (Figure 4).

This search identified no recorded archeological sites, SALs, NRHP properties, cemeteries, RTHLs, or
historical markers within one kilometer of the project area. Three previously conducted surveys
occurred within a kilometer of the project footprint, but they do not overlap with the current project
area.
Based on historic maps and aerial photographs, there is minimal potential for encountering historic
cultural remains within the project area (Figure 5 and 6).

CHAPTER 3: FIELD METHODOLOGY

Archeologists followed the CTA’s standards for 100 percent intensive linear survey during their field
investigations for the Merritt Interconnector Project. Sixteen shovel tests were placed approximately
50–75 meters apart along the proposed roadway’s 0.8-mile length, and three backhoe trenches were
excavated within the project footprint (Table 1 and 2, Appendix B).

Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 30 cm
below the surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all soil was
screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded
on a standardized form while the test locations were recorded using hand-held Global Positioning
System (GPS) units. Backhoe trenches measured 90 cm wide and between 300–400 cm long. Each
was excavated in approximately 10-cm layers and extended to at least 1.3 meters deep until the
archeologists assessed sterile soil had been reached and no cultural material was present, as one
archeologist monitored excavation while another screened sediment approximately every three to
four bucketfulls.

For the purposes of this survey, archeological sites were defined as resources containing a certain
number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition
included: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such
as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, or (3)
a positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two positive tests located within
20 meters of each other.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

The survey area consists of fenced pasture, wooded marsh, and encroaching wetlands. The project’s
western terminus consists of a fenced agricultural pasture with mixed tall and short grasses and
scrub that transitions to a mowed lawn on the northernmost section of the property associated with
the residence (Figure 7 and 8). The central portion of the project area is dominated by a narrow
woodland that flanks Muddy Creek and its unnamed tributary. Muddy Creek and the surrounding
area regularly flood, leaving behind a marshy wooded area with sparse vegetation, secondary forest
growth, and scattered trees (Figure 9 and 10). East of the tree line is an encroaching wetland area
with standing water, tall grasses, and a developing wetland habitat (Figure 11). The project’s eastern
terminus is comprised of fenced pasture (Figure 12). The project footprint has high traffic roads
located at each end.

A total of sixteen shovel tests were excavated throughout the project area (Figure 13). Shovel tests
were excavated in a linear transect approximately 50–75 meters apart. Soils between the project’s
western terminus and the wooded area on the west side of Muddy Creek consisted of 10 cm of clay
mottled with construction debris (presumably from previous road construction) (10YR 4/3)
followed by a mottled clay with <1cm inclusions (10YR 3/1–2.5YR 6/4). Shovel tests within this area
were terminated at 25–30 cm due to compact clay.

Two shovel tests were excavated inside the tree line but were terminated after hitting the water table
(BM5 & BM9).
Six shovel tests were excavated east of the tree line (BM6-8 and SP5-7). The soil was less disturbed
east of Muddy Creek and consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay to silty clay.

Three mechanical trenches were excavated within the project footprint. Backhoe trench one (T1)
measured 92 x 306 cm and was excavated to a depth of 130 cm. After recording soil stratigraphy, the
depth was taken down to 175 cm to ensure undisturbed soil had been reached and no cultural
material was present. The top three zones in T1 included gravel inclusions of varying sizes that all
appear to be construction backfill. Zone 3 included a broken green plastic pipe; plastic debris was
found in zones 1–3. The trench was taken down to sterile black clay. T1 was excavated west to east,
and the north wall was profiled.

Backhoe trench two (T2) measured 90 x 348cm and was excavated to a depth of 159 cm. Trenching
was terminated at the water table. The top zone (10 cm) included small roots and gravel inclusions,
and Zone 3 had small limestone inclusions. T2 was excavated north to south, and the east wall was
profiled.

Backhoe trench three (T3) measured 90 x 280 cm and was excavated to a depth of 130 cm. After
recording soil stratigraphy, the depth was taken down to 294 cm to ensure undisturbed soil had been
reached and no cultural material was present. T3 was comprised mostly of very compact clay with
micro-gravel inclusions T3 was excavated north to south, and the west wall was profiled.
A fourth backhoe trench was excluded because of a sewer line running through the eastern portion
of the APE (Figure 14).

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Working under Antiquities Permit 8610, archeologists intensively surveyed approximately 9.7 acres
of land in Dallas County to be impacted by the proposed Merritt Road Interconnector Project using a
combination of sixteen shovel tests and three backhoe trenches. The project footprint was devoid of
archeological sites, features, or artifacts. Additionally, the APE has little to no research potential since
subsurface cultural materials were not encountered during the survey. Through prior coordination
it was determined that architectural history survey was not warranted and was thus not conducted.
In accordance with Section 106 and the ACT, the Principal Investigator recommends that the
proposed Merritt Road Interconnector Project should proceed, and there is no need for further
coordination or field investigations. In the unlikely event that potentially SAL-eligible archeological
resources are inadvertently encountered during construction, all work should cease until such time
as those resources can be investigated by a professional archaeologist and coordinated with
appropriate representatives of the THC.

Complying with stipulations of Antiquities Permit 8610, all project-generated photographs, notes,
and forms will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin.
