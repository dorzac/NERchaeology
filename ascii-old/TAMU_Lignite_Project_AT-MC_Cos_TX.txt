INTRODUCTION
This is a progress statement on a continuing archeological survey of
the Brazos Electric Power Cooperative's lignite mining and power leases in
McMullen and Atascosa counties, Texas.

The purpose of the survey is to

locate and evaluate the significance (insofar as surficial observations
vill allow) of archeological and historical resources to be affected by
the above named project.

The findings of the first two weeks of field re-

connaissance are presented here in order to forecast and assess the kinds of
archeological and historical resources that will be encountered.

Recommendations

for mitigation of adverse impacts anticipated on the resources documented
herein are included.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The archeology in the south central Texas region is poorly known despite

several surveys which have been conducted along the major streams.

This expedition recorded several sites along both sides of San Miguel Creek
in Frio and Atascosa counties.

Analysis of several surface collections of

artifacts from sites along San Miguel Creek, including materials taken from
one site in the survey area (41 MC 1), were analyzed and reported by Hester
(1969).

This study revealed evidence of a long period of prehistoric

utilization for the area, perhaps extending back to early post Pleistocene

2

times (ca. 7,000

~.C.).

Archcologic~1l

work has been conducted in t:he Choke Canyon dam .::.::d

reservoir basin (Wakefield, 1968).

conc~cted

More intensive work has been

in this area recently by archeologists from the Texas Water Development
Board.

Although unpublished, this work promises to provide valuable com-

parative information for south central Texas.
One major area of concern to archeologists working in south

ce~tral

Texas is the lack of an adequate time-space framework within which archeological
materials can be ordered.

,..;.,i-_

-

-. :

This factor has been realized by Wakefielc (1968)

'

and evidenced by the customary usage of terms having broad temporal connotations.
The broad subdivisions commonly employed in the classification of prehistoric
materials are Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Neo-American (Suhm, Krieger and
1
..~

Jelks, 1954).

The term Paleo-Indian (or Paleo-American) has-been used to

refer to late Pleistocene and early Post-Pleistocene hunting peoples of North
America, a time period extending from about 12,000 B.C. to

7~QO

B.C.

However,

this term has been extended to include virtually all archeological Eaterials
thought to date during this time period.
Following the retreat of the last glaciation, the climate of Texas has
shown a general trend toward war:ner and drier conditions although
versals are known (Bryant, 1969).

mi~or

re-

The aboriginal population of Texas gradually

increased following the close of the Pleistocene.

Groups settled in specific

geographical territories and mace remarkable adaptations to the local environments.

This period of "settling down" in specific geographic lJcalities

and maintaining an almost unchanged lifeway for several thousand years by
hunting and gathering has been termed Archaic by American archeologists.

Lithic artifacts which commonly occur in the area include dart points
(used to tip spears propelled with a throwing stick or atla:l), small
arrow points, several varities of bifacial and unifacial tcols, cores, flakes
and burned rock (Hester and Hill, 1971).

SURVEY EXPECTATIONS AND TECHNIQUES
Operating on the assumption that archeological sites may occur anywhere, the reconnaissance was designed torinspect all kinds of terrain

fe~tures.

In this way, a "transect sample" of archeological sites a::<l resources would
provide data to forecast the location and density of arche:ilogical sites in
areas yet to be examined.
An archeological site is any location showing the e•idence of past
utilization.

The most common type of archeological sites expected in the

survey area are campsites where the prehistoric inhabitants built cooking
fires, manufactured and repaired their tools.

These sites are expected along

and around well watered areas; the density and degree of :efuse concentration
is expected to covary with the reliability of the water source.

For example,

the largest stream in the survey area is San Miguel Creek.

Virtually every

yie~i

evidence of pre-

inhabitable location along this creek is expected to

historic occupation and the most concentrated archeological deposits are
expected in this area.

A proportional decrease in site censity and material

(i.e., fewer sites <:rnd with less material in each) is ex?ected as one moves
up the tributary systems.

Where permanent water sources ;.;ere unco!Pmon, but

where seasonal sup?lies would be available, occasional c: intermittant

utilization is expccteJ.
Another kind of site anticipa:ed is the quarry or lithic workshop
site where raw material, especially cherty rocks, were collected and particlly
reduced for stone tool manufacture.

Because many of the same activities

expected in quarry sites were also c~nducted in campsites, it will be dif:icult
in some instances to differentiate ~etween the two.

Furthermore, the location

of quarry sites depended upon the location of lithic resource outcrops and
the selective preferences of the prehistoric flintknappers.
When evidence of an archeological site was found, the general area
was walked over in an attempt to delineate the extent of the archeological
deposit.

Enough of the area was us~ally covered to estimate site boundaries
'

with a reasonable degree of accuracy, especially since the limits are usually
marked by the area of a specific topographic feature such as a terrace
remnant or a ridge between two

drai~ages.

Collecting procedures varied, depending upon the particular conditions.
Random collections were often made around eroded or disturbed areas where the
archeological materials had been displaced from their original context.

Where

the deposits were felt to be reaso~ably intact (such as in pastures where
cultivation has not been practiced, little or no collecting was done; should
the site be revisited at some future date, controlled collecting could reveal spatial patterning of the refuse.

Where archeological materials were

observed, their presence, conditio~, and density were noted.
All reconnaissance work was cone ori foot by survey parties consisti~g
of 1 to 4 people.

Usually at leas: two persons compose a work unit.

6

Collected artifacts were placed in labeled bags and each locality
was given a field reference designation.

Later, trinomial numbers denoting

the state (41), county (AT or MC) and specific site designation were
assignea :o each site.

RECONNAISSANCE REsuiTs
As stated earlier, the objectives of the reconnaissance were to examine
all types of terrain features and record any and all archeological materials
encountered.

Attention was focused on the lignite lease trac.ts during the

reconnaissance for two reasons; first, these areas contain good examples of
all types of terrain and streams in the survey area.

Secondly;-- the sur-

face modi:ication of these areas, once mining begins, will be total and
all archeological resources should be recorded as soon as possible.

upland areas between stream drainages were inspected.
Arc~eological

materials are abundant in the survey area; in fact,

sites were found along every drainage system inspected, even to the small
header tr~butaries and on upland ridges formed by the intersection of two
tributarv forks.

Upland sites are clearly evident on the two large lease

As expected, sites found along San Miguel Creek and its major tributaries
near Cross evirience very concentrated refuse deposits.

For example, sites

41 MC 96 ;· 97, 98 and 99 contain many lithic artifacts and much lithic debris.
These sites are shallow, being no more than 1 to 1.5 feet- thick; the cultural
deposits are confined to a upper brown sand capping the alluvial terraces
along the larger streams, such as San Miguel Creek.
Site descriptions and listing of the artifacts recovered are presented
in Table 1.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Eighteen aboriginal sites have been located during the
initial reconnaissance of the Brazos Electric Power Cooperative lignite and
power lease.* The following reco:nmendations are proposed to mitigate the

*See Addendum

affects of the planned modification on the resources.

These recommendations

are designed to record and recover as fully as is deemed feasible the
archeological resources in the mining lease tracts.

The recommendations

also take into account the fact that prehistoric archeological sites are
nonreneYable sources for scientific information on extinct peoples.

The

only record of their existence is the material remains of their activities.
It is assumed that their behavior practices were patterned ana that
characteristics of their lifeway are preserved in the archeological record.
Operating on this assumption, a recovery program is designed to document
and study a sufficient sample of these material remains to provide for high
probability statements regarding their cultural lifeway.

.

As stated earlier in this report, this is a progress statement prepared

to provide documentary evidence on the existence and condition of archeological
sites that have been encountered during the initial reconnaissance.

These

data only provide an indication of what is expected in the survey area and
are inadequate to support an overall assessment.

When the survey is complete,

a full assessment of the archeological and historical resources present in
the

sur~ey

area will be made and a problem oriented recovery program will

be designed.

However, on the basis of the data we have, we foresee the need

to conduct further investigations in certain sites.

The recommendations are

based en the physical conditions of the sites relative location with regards
to the topographic setting, data potential regarding temporal, functional and
technological problems.

In other words, the recommendations are not based

strictly on the merits of each site alone, but rather how information from
that si:e can contribute toward solving regional archeological problems.

At

the same time, it is

~ealized

that is is simply not feasible to conduct intensive

investigations at every site found; this would burden the recovery program
with vast amounts of duplicated information to say nothing of the project
costs.

Archeological samples having high predictive value can be obtained

economically with well designed recovery programs.

Designing such a recovery

program is a major objective of the survey.
The recommendations for mitigating the adverse affects on the archeological
resources thus far found are as follows:
Surface Collecting
Several sites located in the lignite leases will be completely destroyed
and need to be intensively collected from in order to salvage the archeological
data.

While no excavations are needed because the artifact bearing fill is

either eroded away or the materials are lying directly on the surface,
systematic collecting of the lithic material is recommended.

These data are

expected to yield important information on the prehistoric resource procurement
and reduction methods, the utilization of upland resources, and settlement
patterns.

It should be emphasized that controlled surface collecting, while

not necessarily time consuming, has never been attempted by archeologists in
south central Texas in upland areas such as those described herein.

The re-

turns from this reco:nended work would be invaluable for planning future
archeological recovery in the survey area.

The returns need not be positive

to be beneficial, but positive returns in the sense of accumulating an excellent
sample of archeological material is anticipated.
Excavation
Because of the surficial nature of the archeological deposits in the

13

upland area, only one site thus far found in this area is recommended for
subsurface testing.

The site, 41 AT 22, has been partially disturbed by

mechanical terracing of the hillside and this surf ace modification has
brought to light a concentrated deposit of lithic materials.

Controlled

testing is recommended to better evaluate this kind of site and the nature
of the deposit.
Several sites were investigated along the north side of San Miguel
Creek.

Two of these, 41 MC 96 and 41 MC 98 are recommended for subsurface

testing to better evaluate the condition and nature of the buried deposits
in this area.

Although the artifact bearing sands are thin (1 to 1.5 feet

thick), spatial patterning of artifactual materials might be present.

Further-

more, no scientific excavations have been reported in this area of Texas and
the technical problems of excavation which must be considered in order to
plan a major recovery

progra~

need to be understood.

In conclusion, it will be necessary to conduct subsurface investigations
in a number of sites in the survey area in addition to those recommended
above in order to acquire an adequate sample of data from which a history
of cultural adaptation can be reconstructed and explained.

The recommendations

set forth in this report are aimed toward meeting that requirement.

The full

recovery program will necessarily involve the following procedures:
1.

Intensive survey of the study area (in progress).

2.

Subsurface testing to evaluate and assess the data potential
of buried cultural materials.

Data derived from this procedure

will be used to design procedure 3.

14

J.

Conduct an extensive collecting program which will probably
involve extensive excavations at certain localities selected
on the basis of specific archeological problems designed
during procedures 1 and 2.

It is not possible to provide a cost estimate of the recommended work
at this time; however, it is appropriate to predict that several field seasons,
two to three months each, are anticipated.

ADDENDUM
Since the body of this report was

~7itten,

thirteen additional sites

.

have been located and recorded (making a total of 31 sites aitogether) .
Of the thirteen sites, six are located along the La Parita Creek drainage and
seven are along La Jarita Creek.

Site locations, dimensions and artifact

content tend to support the aforementioned postulated patterns of aboriginal
habitation in the survey area.

That is, the majority of sites and those

with the heaviest artifact concentrations are found in areas c1ose to either
permanent or otherwise reliable water supply and are above the areas seasonally
inundated by floodwater.
The collections from the more recently recorded sites have not been

I
11

processed and analyzed; however, based on field observations, sites 41 AT 25,
41 MC 102, 103, 104 and 106 are recommended for more controlled surface
collecting.
