MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an intensive pedestrian survey for Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., on behalf
of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), of the proposed 8.7-mile-long road
widening project along U.S. 271 from Loop 286 in Paris to 0.78 miles south of FM 196 near
Pattonville in Lamar County; survey included a proposed reroute of FM 196 near Pattonville.
Survey for the proposed road widening project totaled 249.26 acres. Construction plan
schematics created by TxDOT and provided to GMI by the client determined the area of potential
effect. Proposed construction will include the entire existing right-of-way and require the
addition of new right-of-way (ROW) of widths varying from 45 feet to 150 feet, depending on the
location along the corridor. Several small creeks in the project area will be affected because the
maximum depth of impact likely will surpass the general 5-foot depth to a maximum depth of 20
feet necessary to accommodate the proposed box culverts and a bridge replacement along
Mulberry Creek. The entire newly proposed right-of-way is on private property with limited
rights-of-entry (ROE), and thus those properties with restricted access will be assessed from
adjacent properties where possible.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this construction project area was to
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists initiated fieldwork on 18 July 2007 and concluded on 19 July
2007 (GMI project # 30575.00.03). Of the 249.26 acres within the APE, 114.55 acres is existing
ROW which has been previously surveyed. Of the 134.71 acres of new ROW, only 26.9 acres
were available through ROE. Forty-three shovel tests was excavated, resulting in documentation
of one archeological site and one isolated find. Both of these cultural resources are recommended
as ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Therefore, it is recommended that the proposed widening of U.S. 271
will have no effect on historic archeological properties in the area of potential effect and
construction may proceed. All notes, forms, and photographs obtained from the project are on
file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas
at Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive cultural resources pedestrian survey along
approximately 8.7 miles of the U.S. 271 proposed road widening project between Paris and
Pattonville in Lamar County in far northeastern Texas. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under
subcontract with Michael Baker Jr., Inc., conducted survey of this road widening project in the
Paris District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The cultural resources work
for this project was undertaken on July 18â19, 2007, in order to satisfy federal requirements
governing cultural resources treatment under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat.
915] and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L.
91â190; 83 Stat. 852]. TxDOT, the ultimate client, created under enabling state legislation and
thus a political entity of the State of Texas, must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas
[Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas]; therefore, the cultural resources
investigation was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4607.
The purpose of the pedestrian survey was to identify and inventory all cultural resources
contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). GMI conducted the intensive pedestrian survey of 8.7 miles of the TxDOT
U.S. 271 road widening project within a proposed new right-of-way (ROW) varying from 45 feet
(ft) to 150 ft that included a proposed reroute of FM 196 (Figure 1). The project area is
composed of existing ROW and newly proposed ROW presently on private property. The
existing ROW (114.55 acres) has been previously surveyed, but additional survey will be
conducted in areas as deemed necessary by the project archeologist. Private properties with rightof-entry (ROE) will be surveyed using judgmental shovel tests and walkover survey where
appropriate, but those properties with restricted ROE will be investigated through a combination
of observation and extrapolation based on nearby accessible properties. Of the 134.71 acres of
new ROW, only 26.9 acres were available through written or verbal ROE agreements.
This report provides information on the environmental setting (Chapter 2) and the cultural setting
of the project area (Chapter 3). The research goals and methodology used during the survey
(Chapter 4), the research results (Chapter 5), and the recommendations concerning the project
1

area (Chapter 6) complete the report. References cited in the report, Appendix A (artifacts
recovered from the survey), and a list of the curated materials (Appendix B) follow the body of

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located in the uplands of Lamar County southeast of Paris in the
northeasternmost section of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, but the project area lies more
specifically within a subdivision of this zone commonly referred to as the Blackland Prairie
Ecoregion. This chapter summarizes the modern natural environmental conditions of the survey
area by providing information about the topography and hydrology, geology, soils, climate, and
flora and fauna, and concludes with a synthesis of the regional paleoenvironmental sequence.

TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The western portion of the project area begins approximately at the intersection of Loop 286 and
U.S. 271 near Paris and continues southeast to approximately 1 mile southeast of Pattonville.
Elevation within this project area ranges from 510â400 feet above mean sea level (see Figure 1).
The project area passes through the upper dendritic reaches of Big Sandy Creek and Little Sandy
Creek, through the upper flood plain of Mulberry Creek, and terminates on the western edge of
Bee Bayou Creek.

GEOLOGY
Lamar County is part of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, a physiographic province derived from
Upper Cretaceous marine and deltaic processes of the Gulf of Mexico (Fenneman 1938:100â102;
Sellards et al. 1932). The project area can be further subdivided into the Blackland Prairie
Ecoregion (Texas Parks and Wildlife [TPWD] 2007a) and narrowly defined as being underlain by
Upper Cretaceous formations of (from north to south) Blossom Sand, Brownstone Marl, Gober
Chalk, and Ozan Formation. The Blossom Sand formation is defined as âa quartz sand,
calcareous, glauconitic, ferruginous, thin clay interbeds, brown; weathers brown and red; in upper
part abundant marine megafossils in sandstone concretions; thickness 20â250 ft,, thinning
westwardâ (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG]1979). The Brownstone Marl is a mixture of
âmarl and clay, glauconitic at base, phosphatic, some calcareous septaria in Lamar County, dark
gray; weathers yellowish gray; marine megafossils common; thickness 80â175 ft, thins
westwardâ (BEG 1979). The Gober Chalk is defined as âshowing locally Roxton Limestone
5

beds, Kr. Roxton Limestone, sandy, glauconitic, soft, tough, red; marine megafossils common;
thickness 10 ft, feathers out eastward. Gober Chalk, argillaceous, between Honey Grove, Fannin
County, and Lamar County, lower part chalky marl, brittle, bluish gray; weathers white; thickness
300 ft, feathers out eastwardâ (BEG 1979). The southern portion of the project area or the Ozan
Formation is characterized as âclay, calcareous, some fine sand, bluish gray; weathers light gray;
marine megafossils; thickness 425 ftâ (BEG 1979).

SOILS
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA 1979) has 13 mapped soils within the project area:
Annona loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes; Austin silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Crockett loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes; Freestone-Hicota complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes; Guyton silt loam, frequently
flooded; Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes; Heiden-Ferris complex, 3 to 5 percent slopes;
Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Leson clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Normangee clay
loam, 2 to 6 percent slopes, eroded; Parisian silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Trinity clay,
frequently flooded; and Wilson silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes.

Annona loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes
This soil is a deep, gently sloping soil on the top and sides of ridges. Natural drainageways are
common, but the soil is somewhat poorly drained, and permeability is slow. Areas are oblong in
shape and range from 5 acres to about 1,500 acres in size. The soil is generally used for grazing
lands or for hay fields and has a medium potential for trees (USDA 1979:8).
The typical surface layer is dark grayish brown, slightly acid loam about 4 inches thick. Between
depths of 4 and 9 inches, the soil is a light yellowish brown, strongly acid loam that has light
grayish brown and brownish yellow mottles. The subsoil essential begins between depths of 9
and 16 inches, where it is a dark red, very strongly acid clay with gray mottles. Between depths
of 16 to 26 inches, the soil is light brownish gray, very strongly acid clay that has dark red and
gray mottles. Between depths of 26 and 42 inches, the soil is a gray, strongly acid clay that has
dark red and yellowish brown mottles. Between depths of 42 and 55 inches, the soil is a
yellowish brown, slightly acid clay that has gray and reddish brown mottles. Between depths of
55 and 75 inches, the soil is a mottled gray and yellowish brown, mildly alkaline clay (USDA
1979:8).
This soil has a low probability for containing prehistoric cultural materials because it is on gentle
slopes that occur along the tops and sides of upland ridges. There is a slightly higher potential for
historic cultural material to be present, likely in the form of outbuildings because of the typical
use of this soil as pasture.

Austin silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
Austin silty clay is a moderately deep, gently sloping soil on tops and sides of ridges. Areas are
oblong and follow the contour of the landscape. They range from 5 acres to about 45 acres in
size. These soils are well drained, and permeability is moderately slow with the available water
capacity being low. The soil is generally used as cropland but can also be used as rangeland
(USDA 1979:9).
6

The general soil profile consists of a surface layer composed of very dark brown, moderately
alkaline silty clay about 5 inches thick. Between depths of 5 to 12 inches, the soil is very dark
grayish brown, moderately alkaline silty clay. Between depths of 12 and 27 inches, the soil is
brown, moderately alkaline silty clay. Between depths of 27 to 37 inches, the soil is pale brown,
moderately alkaline silty clay loam that has brownish yellow and yellow mottles; 30 percent of
this layer is platy chalk fragments. The underlying material is white and very pale brown platy
chalk to a depth of 44 inches (USDA 1979:9).
The soil has a low potential for yielding prehistoric cultural materials because it is situated in the
uplands and has low water-carrying capacity. There is a slightly higher potential that this type of
soil will contain historic materials because it is a multifunctional soil used as potential cropland
and could possibly contain evidence of outbuildings.

Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
Crockett loam is a gently sloping soil found on tops and sides of ridges. Areas are oblong and
follow the contour of the slope. They average about 50 acres in size. The soil is moderately well
drained with very slow permeability. It is generally used for pasture and hay fields with the
potential of also being used as openland or rangeland (USDA 1979:12).
The typical soil profile begins with a dark grayish brown loam approximately 7 inches thick. The
subsoil begins with a dark reddish brown clay from 7â12 inches below surface, that is underlain
by a mottled yellowish brown, dark grayish brown, and reddish brown clay from 12â22 inches
below surface. Below this is a dark grayish brown clay with yellowish mottles from 22â41
inches, and a clay zone composed of light olive brown soils in the upper part and mixed
brownish, grayish, and olive soils in the lower part from 41â65 inches below surface (USDA
1979:12).
The soil has a low potential for yielding prehistoric cultural materials because it is situated in the
uplands and has a low water-carrying capacity. There is a slightly higher potential for this type of
soil to contain historic materials because it is a multifunctional soil used as potential cropland and
could possibly contain evidence of outbuildings.

Freestone-Hicota complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes
This soil complex is on nearly level to gently sloping, broad mounded ridges. Areas are irregular
in shape, and range from 12 acres to about 200 acres in size. This complex is about 63 percent
Freestone soil and 24 percent Hicota soil; 13 percent consists of other soils in areas so small and
so intricately mixed that it is not practical to separate them. The complex is a moderately welldrained soil that has slow permeability. The available water capacity is high, and the soil is
typically used for areas of pasture and hay production. This soil complex has a medium potential
for trees (USDA 1979:16).
The general soil profile for this complex consists of a surface layer of brown, slightly acid fine
sandy loam about 6 inches thick. Between depths of 6 and 16 inches, the soil is a light yellowish
brown, medium acid, fine sandy loam. Between depths of 16 and 23 inches, the soil is a
yellowish brown, strongly acid loam that has strong brown mottles. Between depths of 23 and 33
inches, the soil is a yellowish brown, strongly acid clay loam that has red and grayish brown
7

mottles. Between depths of 33 and 44 inches, the soil is light gray, very strongly acid clay loam
with dark red and yellowish brown mottles; uncoated sand and silt grains are on vertical faces of
peds. Between depths of 44 and 59 inches, the soil is light brownish gray, medium acid clay that
has dark red and yellowish brown mottles. Between depths of 59 and 80 inches, the soil is light
brownish gray, medium acid clay loam that has olive yellow, yellowish brown, and dark red
mottles (USDA 1979:16).
The potential of these areas to yield prehistoric material is low but slightly better than the
proceeding soil types. Because these soils exist on slightly mounded broad ridges implies but
necessarily means a more lengthy period of surface stability at slightly lower elevations. There is
a low potential these areas may provide evidence of historic materials likely related to activities
associated with grazing or the processing of hay in the form of outbuildings.

Guyton silt loam, frequently flooded
Guyton silt loam is a nearly level soil found along the flood plains of streams that drain through
loamy soils on forested uplands. The flood plains are generally less than 250 yards wide, with
many shallow scour-channels and low natural levees. The slopes are concave and range from 0 to
1 percent. These soils are poorly drained, and permeability is low, while the available water
capacity is high. Runoff from this soil type is slow, and there is generally a layer of overwash
ranging from 2 to 7 inches thick overlying this soil. Guyton silt loam is mainly used for pasture
or hay production and has a high potential for containing trees (USAD 1979:17â18).
The general soil profile consists of a surface layer of grayish brown, medium acid silt loam 5
inches thick with strong brown mottles. Between depths of 5 to 16 inches, the soil is light
brownish gray, medium acid silt loam that has yellowish brown mottles. Between depths of 16 to
20 inches, the soil is grayish brown, medium acid silty clay loam that has yellowish brown and
strong brown mottles and pockets of uncoated sand and silt grains. Between depths of 20 and 36
inches, the soil is light grayish brown, strongly acid silt loam that has yellowish brown mottles
and pockets and vertical streaks of uncoated sand and silt grains. Between depths of 36 and 44
inches, the soil is grayish brown, strongly acid silty clay loam that has yellowish brown mottles
and pockets and vertical streaks of light gray silt loam. Between depths of 44 and 72 inches, the
soil is gray, slightly acid silty clay loam that has strong brown mottles and pockets of light gray
silt loam (USAD 1979:17â18).
This particular soil has a medium probability of yielding prehistoric cultural material due to both
its proximity to a fairly stable water source and its aggrading tendency in this area, as it likely did
in the past. The likelihood of trees being present in this soil type also lends credibility to its being
a medium probability area for prehistoric materials, because trees are indicators of longer-term
stable surfaces. The soil indicates a low potential for yielding historic cultural material because it
is frequently flooded.

Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes
Heiden clay is a gently sloping soil on tops and sides of ridges. Undisturbed areas have gilgai
(surface undulations and depressions) microrelief. Heiden clay areas are oblong and follow the
contour of the slope and range from 8 to 75 acres in size. Natural drainageways are common and
8

result in well-drained soil. Permeability is very low and available water capacity is high. The
soil is mainly used for pasture and hay production but alos has a high potential to be used as
openland or rangeland (USDA 1979:18â19).
The typical profile of soil begins with a surface layer of very dark grayish brown, moderately
alkaline clay about 26 inches thick. Between a depth of 26 and 48 inches, the soil is olive gray,
moderately alkaline clay. Between depths of 48-62 inches, the soil is mottled dark grayish
brown, light olive brown, and brownish yellow, moderately alkaline clay. The underlying
material, which extends to a depth of about 80 inches, is stratified brownish yellow, light olive
brown, and light olive gray platy shale (USDA 1979:18â19).
This soil has a low potential for yielding prehistoric cultural materials because it is an upland soil.
The soil also has a low potential for producing historic cultural materials because it has a
tendency to shrink and swell with a high potential for water erosion. There is, however, a higher
possibility of recovering evidence from this soil type related to some type of historic outbuilding.

Heiden-Ferris complex, 3 to 5 percent
This soil complex is generally found on gently sloping, eroded side slopes. Areas are oblong and
range from 15 to 60 acres in size. This complex is about 48 percent Heiden soil, 44 percent Ferris
soil, and 8 percent other soils that are too intricately mixed to be separated and tend to be slightly
concave in the lower parts of the mapped areas commonly exhibiting shallow gullies. This soil is
well drained with very slow permeability, making the water erosion hazard severe. It is generally
used for range, pasture, and hay production land (USDA 1979:19).
The general soil profile consists of a surface layer of very dark grayish brown, moderately
alkaline clay about 22 inches thick. Between depths of 22 and 38 inches, the soil is dark grayish
brown, moderately alkaline clay. Between depths of 38 and 58 inches, the soil is yellowish
brown, moderately alkaline clay. The underlying material, to a depth of 63 inches, is stratified,
light yellowish brown and light brownish gray, moderately alkaline, soft, platy shale (USDA
1979:19).
The soil has a low potential for yielding any cultural material because it is generally eroded. The
potential for prehistoric materials is low due to the combination of slope and lack of water
resources, while the same limitations hinder the potential for historic materials. There is,
however, a possibility that historic outbuildings related to the cattle industry maybe present on
these types of soils.

Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
This soil is deep, gently sloping soil found on broad ridges, sides of ridges, and long, narrow foot
slopes. Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief. In some areas, many deep, wide gullies have
formed in natural drainageways. Areas are irregular in shape and range from 8 acres to more than
1,000 acres in size. The soil is moderately drained with very slow permeability, but it has high
water capacity. Runoff from the soil is moderate, making the water erosion hazard moderate.
This soil includes some pockets of Leson soil. This soil is generally used as cropland, although it
also has a high potential for rangeland, and a medium potential for openland (USDA 1979:20).
9

The general soil profile consists of a surface layer of very dark gray, moderately alkaline clay
about 5 inches thick. Between depths of 5 and 23 inches, the soil is black, moderately alkaline
clay. Between depths of 23 and 38 inches, the soil is very dark gray, moderately alkaline clay.
Between depths of 38 to 51 inches, the soil is olive gray, moderately alkaline clay that has light
olive brown and gray mottles. Between depths of 51 and 69 inches, the soils is light olive brown,
moderately alkaline clay that has yellow and gray mottles. Between depths of 69 and 77 inches,
the soil is grayish brown, moderately alkaline clay that has brownish yellow mottles. Between
depths of 77 and 80 inches, the soil is brownish yellow and light brownish gray, moderately
alkaline, stratified shaly clay (USDA 1979:19).
The potential for this soil to provide prehistoric cultural materials is low because areas with this
soil tend to have limited available surface water sources. In addition, the plasticity of the soil and
the constant shrinking and swelling tends to displace cultural material from its original context.
There is a slightly better potential for historic material to be associated with this soil type because
it is amenable to row crops and the water erosional hazard is less than many of the other soils in
the project area.
Leson clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
Leson clay is deep, gently sloping soil on the top and sides of ridges. Undisturbed areas have
gilgai microrelief. Areas are irregular in shape and range from 5 acres to more than 300 acres in
size. The soil is moderately well drained with very slow permeability and high water capacity.
Leson clay is generally used for cropland but has a high potential for rangeland and a medium
potential for openland wildlife habitat (USDA 1979:22).
The typical soil profile consists of a surface layer that is black, slightly acid clay about 20 inches
thick. Between depths of 20 and 39 inches, the soil is very dark gray, neutral clay that has
yellowish brown mottles. Between depths of 39 and 57 inches, soil is dark grayish brown, mildly
alkaline clay that has olive mottles. Between depths of 57 and 66 inches, the soil is olive,
moderately alkaline clay with brownish mottles. Between depths of 66 and 75 inches, the soil is
light brownish gray and pale olive, moderately alkaline, stratified shaly clay (USDA 1979:22).
This soil has a low potential for producing prehistoric cultural material because it is an upland
soil with a tendency for swelling and cracking that displaces cultural material. The soil is
generally dominated by grasses and has limited surficial water sources. There is a somewhat
higher potential for historic cultural materials, likely to representing some type of outbuilding, to
be found on this soil because it is amenable to crops.
Normangee clay loam, 2 to 6 percent slopes, eroded
This is a deep, gently sloping soil on eroded sides of ridges. Areas are oblong and follow the
contour of the slope. Areas with this soil range from 5 acres to more than 100 acres in size, with
nearly all areas being formerly cultivated. Erosion has removed the surface layer so that clayey
material is exposed on about 25 percent of the acreage. In about 65 percent of the acreage, the
loam surface is less than 5 inches thick. The rest is not eroded. A few active gullies are present,
but most can be crossed by farm equipment. The soil is well drained, but permeability is very
slow and water capacity is medium, making water erosion a severe hazard. The soil is used
mainly for pasture and hay production, with a medium potential for rangeland and openland
(USDA 1979:24).
10

The general soil profile consists of a surface layer of brown, slightly acid clay loam about 3
inches thick. Between depths of 3 and 19 inches, the soil is brown, medium acid clay with
reddish brown and dark grayish brown mottles. Between depths of 19 and 38 inches, the soil is
light olive brown, neutral clay that has yellowish brown and dark grayish brown mottles.
Between depths of 38 and 44 inches, the soil is mottled light olive brown and dark grayish brown,
mildly alkaline clay. Between depths of 44 and 55 inches, the soil has alternating layers of light
olive brown, grayish brown, and yellowish brown mildly alkaline, platy shale (USDA 1979:24).
The soil has a low potential for yielding any cultural material because the majority has been
impacted by severe water erosion. Those areas of intact soils are more likely to produce historic
cultural material than prehistoric, but this potential remains low because the soil was often used
for pasture or hay p;roduction.

Parisian silty loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
This soil is found on the top and sides of ridges. Soil areas are oblong and range from 10 to 950
acres in size, and typically include pockets of Crockett, Mabank and Normangee soils. The soil is
moderately well drained with very slow permeability but high water capacity. Runoff is slow
because the angle of the slope causes the potential for moderate water erosion. The soil is
generally used for hay production, but is also used as cropland and has high potential for use as
range, openland, and rangeland habitat (USDA 1979: 25).
The general soil profile consists of a very dark grayish brown, medium acid silt loam about 11
inches thick. Between depths of 11 and 17 inches, the soil is very dark grayish brown, medium
acid silty clay loam. Between depths of 17 and 21 inches, the soil is dark grayish brown, medium
acid clay that has dark red and reddish brown mottles. Between depths of 21 and 27 inches, the
soil is brown, slightly acid clay that has dark grayish brown, reddish brown, and yellowish brown
mottles. Between depths of 27 and 39 inches, the soil is light olive, neutral clay with brown and
grayish brown mottles. Between depths of 39 and 56 inches, the soil is dark yellowish brown,
neutral clay that has brown and grayish brown mottles. Between depths of 56 and 68 inches, the
soil is mottled yellowish brown and grayish brown, mildly alkaline silty clay loam. Between
depths of 68 and 80 inches, the soil is mottled yellowish brown, light brownish gray, and pale
olive, neutral clay (USDA 1979:25).
This soil has a low potential for yielding prehistoric cultural materials because it is an upland soil
with little available water sources. It has a slightly higher potential of producing historic cultural
material because it is one of the better-suited soil for urban construction. However, this soil has
often been impacted by European agricultural activities, which means the majority of any
materials that are present are likely to be out of context.

Trinity clay, frequently flooded
This soil is a deep, nearly level soil on wide flood plains of streams that drain clayey soils on
prairies. The surface of most areas is marked by partly filled, old stream and scour channels.
Many areas are scoured, and other areas receive thin deposits of sediment. New channels are
being formed where the natural levees along the old channel are higher than the flood plain edges.
Slopes are plane and range from 0 to 1 percent. There are often pockets of Elbon and Varro soils
11

interspersed throughout this soil. The soil is poorly drained, and permeability is very slow but
water capacity is high. The soil is typically used as pasture or for hay production, and the soil has
the potential to support trees (USDA 1979:29).
The general soil profile is represented by a very dark gray, moderately alkaline clay about 19
inches thick. Between depths of 19 and 38 inches, the soil is black, moderately alkaline clay that
has dark grayish brown mottles. Between depths of 38 to 62 inches, the soil is very dark gray,
moderately alkaline clay that has dark grayish brown mottles (USDA 1979:29).
The soil is generally a byproduct of the resulting erosion and deposition of clayey materials in
and along the waterways post-introduction of European agricultural practices in the drainages.
This soil often slowly buries intact landforms as it chokes up the drainage and has a medium
probability of burying prehistoric cultural material along the edges of waterways. The soil has a
low potential for producing historic material because it often floods and is therefore rather
unusable for historic occupation.

Wilson silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes
The soil is deep, nearly level to gently sloping and is found on ridgetops and foot slopes. Areas
are oblong and range from 5 acres to more than 150 acres in size. This soil unit often includes
small pockets of Crockett, Deport, Burleson, and Mabank soils. It is mainly used for pasture and
hay production, but it has a medium potential for range, openland ,and rangeland (USDA
1979:31â32).
The typical soil profile begins with a very dark gray, slightly acid silt loam about 6 inches thick.
Between depths of 6 and 9 inches, the soil is very dark gray, medium acid clay loam. Between
depths of 9 and 28 inches, the soil is very dark gray, slightly acid clay Between depths of 28 and
39 inches, the soil is dark gray, neutral clay. Between depths of 39 and 80 inches, the soil is
grayish brown, mildly alkaline clay that has light olive brown and olive yellow mottles (USDA
1979:31â32).
The potential of this soil to yield prehistoric cultural material is low because it is situated in the
uplands away from water sources. There is a higher potential that historic cultural material will
be located because these soil areas would be useful for the placement of outbuildings related to
early farming and cattle ranching pursuits.

CLIMATE
The modern climate of this region is characterized by a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid
climate that is generally mild, with brief periods of extremely hot and cold weather. The
prevailing winds are southerly with temperatures remaining above 0Â°C (32Â°F) approximately 240
days each year (USDA 1979). Summers are hot and prone to drought, with temperatures often
reaching and exceeding 37Â°C (100Â°F). Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly distributed, with the
maximums occurring in April, May, and September, and the minimum in August. Much of this
rainfall is in the form of heavy thunderstorms, resulting in rapid runoff, limiting absorption by the
soil. Snowfall is rare, generally lasting less than one week and averaging less than 2.5
centimeters (cm; 1 inch) per year.
12

FLORA AND FAUNA
The West Gulf Coastal Plain Section of Texas consists of series of relatively narrow, north-south
alternating vegetation bands of oak-hickory forests and open grasslands. A west-to-east cross
section of the region indicates transitions beginning in the Western Cross Timbers, crossing into
the Grand Prairie, followed by the Eastern Cross Timbers, and concluding in the Blackland
Prairie. The project area occurs in the Blackland Prairie portion of the region, which is one of
several tall grass prairies in this part of Texas. The region is also assigned to the Texan biotic
province, which is representative of its intermediate location between the grasslands of the
Southern Plains to the west (Kansan Balconian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces) and the
deciduous forests of the Southeast (Austroriparian and Carolinian biotic provinces) (Blair 1950;
Fenneman 1931, 1938; Kier et al. 1977).
Blackland Prairie vegetation is dominated by grasses in the uplands; woodlands are restricted to
streams and river bottoms. Prior to the historic period, the project area was covered with a water
oak-elm-hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water marshes and ponds
(McMahan et al. 1984). Where it exists today, and possibly through the majority of the
Holocene, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm, American elm, willow oak, southern red
oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash, sycamore, pecan, bois dâarc, flowering
dogwood, dewberry, coralberry, dallisgrass, switchgrass, Virginia wild rye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, yankeeweed, and Leavenworths eryngo (McMahan et al. 1984:22),. Cherry, sweetgum,
hawthorn, blackberry, sedge, Indiangrass, giant cane, and beaked panicum were probably also
present (USDA 1979).
The upland portion of this project area typically consists of tall grass prairies. Dominant floral
species include little bluestem, big bluestem, and Texas wintergrass. The Blackland Prairie
proved to be exceptionally fertile cropland and today few areas of native prairie remain due to
extensive European agricultural practices (Jurney et al. 1989:13â14, TPWD 2007b).
No endemic vertebrate species are in the Texas biotic province, but 47 species of mammals are or
were common in the region. These mammals include several animal species, such as white-tailed
deer, bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, muskrat, and raccoon, of particular economic benefit to present
and past human populations. Important faunal resources in this region prior to European contact
included bear, bison, and antelope. Additional species of limited benefit include a range of turtle,
snake, frog, fish, and freshwater mussel, along with bird species such as bobwhite, quail, and
pheasant. Other species associated with this region include the meadowlark, field sparrow, sage
grouse, lark bunting, gray fox, and red fox (Schmidly 1983; USDA 1979).

SYNTHESIS OF THE REGIONAL PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SEQUENCE
The regional paleoenvironmental synthesis compiled by Bryant and Holloway (1984) stands as
one of the main sources of information for this region of Texas. They compiled data spanning the
Wisconsin Glacial to the present and identified three major paleoenvironmental shifts, beginning
with the Wisconsin Glacial period (20,500â12,000 B.C.). They defined this period as possessing
a cooler, moister climate than present. The pollen data for the subsequent Late Glacial period
(12,000â8,000 B.C.) signifies an increase in mean temperature due to the rise in grass pollen and
decrease in arboreal pollen. Finally, the Holocene period (8,000 B.C.âpresent) is generally
considered a continuation of the drying trend, but there are undoubtedly punctuations of brief
mesic periods.
13

The continuing efforts of geologists and paleobotanists have provided more-refined data for the
events leading to the establishment of the regionally modern floral and fauna (Bousman 1991). It
appears there are three periods of greater aridity as represented through increased grass pollen
rates from 5550â1050 B.C., 450 B.C.âA.D. 450, and A.D. 1550â1650 (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993). These data need to be further tested against new regional data sets, but it does offer some
insight into the complexity of the regionâs paleoenvironmental research and may provide a useful
backup for understanding cultural change.
Geoarcheological studies in the Trinity River basin to the west have identified a series of
Holocene-age cut-and-fill alluvial sequences that seem to correlate across the river basin and
potentially correlate with events identified in the Colorado and Brazos rivers. During the periods
of terrace construction, the vegetation cover (probably grasslands) contributed organic carbon at a
rate faster than sediment deposition, resulting in a series of buried soils and the accumulation of
soils as the terrace treads aggraded. These soils have been named and radiocarbon-dated at
several locales across the Trinity River basin, and a similar phenomenon is likely present in the
Sabine River drainage. The following is an overview of the geomorphic progression for the
region.
It is likely that as many as three alloformational stratigraphic units comprise the Holocene terrace
(Ferring 2001:28â39). Each is marked by an erosional unconformity at the top and pedogenic or
soil development. Along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, these consist of the Aubrey
Alloformation, dating ca. 14,200 to perhaps 13,400 years ago, at the bottom; the Sanger
Alloformation dating between 10,900 and 5,700 years ago; and capped by the Pilot Point
Alloformation that dates from 4,525 to about 700 years ago (Ferring 1990:47â48). The Arlington
paleosol developed in the upper part of the Sanger Alloformation depositional unit, whereas the
West Fork paleosol developed in the Pilot Point Alloformation. In some places, an unnamed
recent alluvium measuring up to 1.5 meters (m; 4.9 ft) thick caps the Pilot Point alluvium, and it
too has developed a pronounced soil in some places. The sequence of soils is not as clearly
defined for the Sabine River, but this research from the Trinity River provides a general
framework for understanding the phenomena governing soil formation in the Sabine River basin.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
This chapter is subdivided into two sections: Previous Investigations and Regional Culture
History. Previous Investigations provides an overview of the archeological research conducted
within a 1-kilometer radius of the proposed construction along U.S. 271 between Paris and
Pattonville. The history of archeological research in this region spans the late 1800s to the
present and includes tens if not hundreds of both small- and large-scale studies. The purpose of
this section is not to provide an overview or summary of the entire chronology of the research
conducted in the region, but to provide information relative to archeological investigations and
their findings within the 1-kilometer radius of the proposed project area. Regional Culture
History, based on the regional research projects, provides the historical overview that is largely
accepted by the professional archeological community.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
According to the Texas Archeological Site Atlas, five surveys have been conducted within the 1kilometer radius of the current project area. The first two were conducted in 1979 by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on a proposed sewer line. The first 1979 survey
conducted in March documented one site (41LR61). Site 41LR61 was recorded as a thin lithic
and fire-cracked rock scatter that included one biface fragment situated on a knoll overlooking
Big Sandy Creek (Fox 1979). The site was recommended for additional testing if destruction was
imminent. The other survey in June 1979 failed to document any cultural resources.
The next survey conducted in the area was in 1980 by the EPA and appears to be an extension of
the 1979 work. It is difficult to say with certainty though because the reports for all three EPA
surveys are unobtainable. The fourth survey was undertaken by TxDOT in 1994 and included an
investigation of the entire existing right of way of U.S. 271 within the project area and the
northernmost section of the proposed reroute of FM 196. The survey did not document any
cultural materials (Noble 1994). The final survey conducted in the area was sponsored by the
Texas Development Water Board in 1998 but resulted in no cultural properties, an official report,
however, is unobtainable.

REGIONAL CULTURE HISTORY

Native American Cultural Chronology
The following brief discussion is based on the prehistoric archeological record of Northcentral
and Northeastern Texas derived primarily from four major reports by Peter and McGregor (1988),
Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986) for the upper Trinity River basin west of the
current project area. The generalized cultural sequences is presented in Table 1, and subsequently
followed by a discussion of each time period.

Paleo-Indian Period
Point types found in Northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the
period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Based on a
sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most
common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring and Yates
(1997) suggest that these types date to about 9,500â10,000 years ago, based on cross-dating with
other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of early
Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine. The majority of
the recorded Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage, where the most intensive
archeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than
one or two projectile points. As with many other areas of Texas, Paleo-Indian materials in
Northcentral Texas often are found in surface contexts or mixed with later materials. The
generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to
be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly
mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100â101).
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts
(Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm
Fork of the Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968).
16

Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in Northcentral Texas with apparently discrete
Paleo-Indian componentsâthe Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites, located in the northern part of
the TxDOT Dallas Districtâare early, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville
Lake site (41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse
lithics (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182â184). Although the original radiocarbon
dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years
before present.), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have
resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of
naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion,
contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 10,000â8000
B.C. for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human
occupation of Northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm
Fork north of Dallas, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m of Holocene
alluvium on the Elm Fork flood plain (Ferring 1986, 2001). The discovery of this site suggests
that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining
deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations.
The Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small.
The largest, white-tailed deer, can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the
Lewisville Lake site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as
representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison
apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31â32). Such a
divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to
changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into
Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).
There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian components on the central Blackland Prairie
itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is
clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 10,000 to 6,500 B.C.
Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high
residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational
archeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the RichlandChambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site
in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989).

Archaic Period
For Northcentral Texas, the Archaic is tentatively dated between ca. 6000 B.C. and A.D. 700, with
segments of approximately 2,000 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the
period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 6000 to 4000 B.C., the
Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700.
Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman
(1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to
those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool
types has proven difficult, because many of the investigations have focused on surface
17

manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early splitstemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched
forms such as Bell, Andice, and Calf Creek along with Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde.
Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the
Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook
and Harris 1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type site artifacts, however, showed that the
materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman
et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and
Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been
documented for the Brazos drainage west of the TxDOT Dallas District in Young, Stephens, and
Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier
environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the
period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic
populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of Northcentral Texas to develop a diversified
hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks,
while populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a).
Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that
populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may
suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use
within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicates repeated site
occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling hypothesis. Still, even
with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic
human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987).
Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use
by Native Americans during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components
have been excavated, particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to
say much about artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of
projectile point styles traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic period in
Central Texasâfor example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis,
and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998)âwas identified during analyses for the Superconducting
Super Collider project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were
identified as well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do
not appear to represent major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably
early points were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir and the
Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie point from Pecan Springs being the
clearest example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The relatively intensive work at RichlandChambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the oak woodlands,
although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in
part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion
during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Only a few radiocarbon
assays predating 4,000 years before present were obtained, but points dated to this interval in
Central Texas (for example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie) occur at the Richland-Chambers
Reservoir in only very small numbers.
18

A much different picture is presented for the later portion of the Archaic period, after about
1500 B.C. All areas of the central Blackland Prairie that have been studied archeologically
contain sites dating to this period, and the Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which
much is known about Native American lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek sites
on the Blackland Prairie proper yielded such Late Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and
Yarbrough, although they tend to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963;
Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider
project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central
Texasâsuch as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernalesâand a variety
of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state,
such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the
relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest that
the region saw an increased use by hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic conditions than
before, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note
that, while the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas
proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early
and Middle Archaic.
Brown (1987:44-22 through 44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in
occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the
region, i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir (southeastern Kaufman County) and Richland-Chambers
Reservoir (southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek
Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a
variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), while at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir
have identifiable components of this age. In addition to constellations of projectile point styles
(e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east
than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics
may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the
Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is called
the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period).
At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett
Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and
arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the sherds
could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). At RichlandChambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated
between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently
representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin.
The most complete picture of the archeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the
oak woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers
creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits
focused on wild plant foods, such as hickory nuts and prairie turnip, and faunal taxa such as deer,
turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not
sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and
it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. A conspicuous component
of the record are the so-called âWylie pits,â which are large man-made depressions measuring
approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.61 m (2 ft) in depth, excavated at the Bird Point
Island and Adams Ranch sites. These were large features that appear to have been used for
19

communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of
band aggregation in âtension zonesâ as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth
1987).
Human burials are common in the archeological record of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods of at least the eastern part of Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of these burials are
associated with Wylie pit features. These features were first identified at a series of sites along
the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus
(Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the
Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the area of Lavon Lake suggest that the pits and
the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus
definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south
confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of
associated artifact types and the long time span represented by the pits made it clear that the
Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as
unusable, further supported Lynottâs (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated
with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens
of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700â1700) is marked by the initial
appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period is based upon dated
contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and
large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pits and the human
burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late
Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places
and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens, such as
corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may
be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of
differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure,
although this evidence is nowhere near as strong as that for the Caddo area of far northeastern
Texas. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be
divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites
of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Prikrylâs (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700-1200) is marked by the Scallorn,
Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grogtempered and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some
locally manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas
Caddoan ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake
in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain
1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988).

20

As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarized the results of that research as follows:
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr. bp. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a âmiddle
subperiodâ of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that
arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies
three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle
subperiodâthe Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek on
the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haleyâs Point site (34MA15) on the Red
River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that
maize is common at Haleyâs Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are
representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial
dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication
1999).
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period, after ca. A.D. 700, also are common downstream on the
Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super
Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula,
Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et
al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population
densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types,
which have such widespread distributions, the arrow point styles point eastward and northward.
The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also support interaction
with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills
Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of
the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small collection relating to the
early Caddoan types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield
1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early arrow points,
as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small collection of highly
fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
21

Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although
materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites (Story 1965).
Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better
represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not by much. Not surprisingly, ceramics
are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddoan tradition to
the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent
of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965).
The faunal remains from the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites, many of which probably relate to
Late Prehistoric occupations, consist predominantly of deer, turtles, and small mammals, with
bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears
that this part of the Trinity basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary
groups during the Late Prehistoric period.
Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric
period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at
Richland-Chambers Reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there
was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth
1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were
used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for
example the stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139,
which probably were used in a more limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird Point Island
site point to intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half of the period, and
other components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island,
Adams Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features suggesting
intensive use but no houses. These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in
length. Macrobotanical remains point to use primarily of wild plant foods, i.e., hardwood nuts, a
variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is
maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in contexts dating to the last half of the period.
Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow
points that characterize the early and late parts of the periodâAlba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs.
Perdiz and Clifftonâare the same styles as found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that
Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddoan wares, with
most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity.
During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200â1700), influences from the Southern Plains
became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an
increase in bison herd size in Northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison was
important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases
continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris
and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl
1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some
of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular
arrow points such as Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz points. Tools specific to bison
processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison
scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the
Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945).

22

The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the Henrietta
complex of Northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Kriegerâs (1946) more expansive
Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos
rivers. The type site, M. D. Harrell, is located along the Brazos River in Young County just
northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger
1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths,
storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking
river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex
include the Coyote and Glass sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967;
Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well
(Martin 1994).
The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to
obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have
tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Reservoir, for instance, Ferring and
Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the
lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical
camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that
occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period
than before and that maize horticulture, if practiced at all, was limited. The adaptation
developing in Northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations
revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997).

Historic Native AmericanâNorthcentral Texas
The cultural divergences between Northcentral and Northeast Texas, which began in the Archaic
period, continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, not the
least of which was the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the
cultural makeup of Northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and
existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, the Caddoan groups
continued to dominate the Northeastern portion of the state, although significant changes were
occurring there also. Both regions will be treated separately in the following sections.
Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in Texas was sporadic at
best. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains,
although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of journeys
into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John 1975).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North
Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the Historic period
(A.D. 1700 to 1850; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very
sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early Historic era, it is not clear which specific
aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. What is
clear is that the early Historic period in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation,
movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).

23

Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune,
Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period
(Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about 1725â1750,
Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as
the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and
Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Available data suggest that many of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great
Plains, including North Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to
the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested
that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth
century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the French in
the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time âon the Blackland
Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin,
and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). However, if the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of
the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very
early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas,
Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita
Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even
have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The term âWichitaâ is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719 their villages were located along the Arkansas
River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their
villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the
Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos
rivers. In 1759, the Taovaya village on the Red River was attacked by Diego Ortiz Parrilla, but
was successfully defended. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish,
one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of present-day
Dallas/Fort Worth (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were
included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United States in 1837
and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live between the upper
Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the
Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of other Native
American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). Subsequently, as
a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in
1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to
Kansas during the Civil War, but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near
present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).

24

Although archeological sites that can be associated definitely with various historic-age groups are
few, sites attributable to the historic Wichita have been identified at the edges of Northcentral
Texas. Among these is the Stansbury site located in Hill County, now inundated by Lake
Whitney (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage
pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow
points, and flintlock musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the
Red River in Montague County. These sites are known collectively as âSpanish Fortâ and occur
on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b) excavated one of these
sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site produced artifacts and features similar to those
discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on both the Brazos and Red rivers were located
atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of
these historic-age Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American
sites with European items (Sollberger 1953).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory by the United States in 1803.

European and American Historical Background

General North Texas Region
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of Northeast Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions
of this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in Northeast Texas, see Peter and
Cliff (1990a:Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (around 1542) when the survivors of the de Soto entrada, led by LuÃ­s de
Moscoso de Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and
Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Moscosoâs exact route is unknown, but archeological studies
indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley somewhere between present-day
Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party crossed the Red River and journeyed
through Northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls before returning to the Mississippi River
to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso route through Texas
(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of Naguatex with the Hatchel-MitchellMoores site complex in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from here the entrada moved
southwest through Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere in the vicinity of
Douglassville, where Wright Patman Lake is now located.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to remove the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native populations.
In 1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai areaâSan Francisco de los Tejas and
SantÃ­simo Nombre de MarÃ­aâbut abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46â49).

25

The French, led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first intruded into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182), and in 1714 St. Denis set up a trading post
at Natchitoches (in present-day Louisiana). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in
Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of missions and presidios in
East Texasâthis time a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River, the
Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n (later moved to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the
Angelina River, the Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose de los
Nazonis, and Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Ais, as well as San Miguel de Lineares de los Adaes in
present-day Louisianaâas a buffer against further French encroachment into that region (Cooper
et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46â49). When France and Spain went to war, the
French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, the Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas. After
briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Handbook of Texas Online 2002a).
Benard de la Harpeâs 1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red
River north of present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend
(Cooper et al. 2003; Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence
occurred in 1760, when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to presentday Rains County to make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These
trading posts eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies:
modern-day archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of Spanish and French origin that
would suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites.
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase, and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis
Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spainâs claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammelâs Trace and Daytonâs Road.
Trammelâs Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at
Eppersonâs Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded
in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern-day Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793â794). Daytonâs Road was a major east-west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.

26

The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990a:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves in the region. The town of
Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout
the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39). Other major
industries established about the same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad
construction also progressed westward (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North Texas was beyond
the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence: that conflict played
out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836. The most significant change
thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make
the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian
removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or exterminate the Native
Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group
of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after
conducting raids on Indians to the north (Handbook of Texas Online 2002b). Subsequently, many
native groups who used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red River.
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood in 1846, entering the union as the twenty-eighth
state. It did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch during that
period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession. The
sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture, even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most
of Northeast and Northcentral Texas, anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:306), and nearly all the counties in the study area voted to secedeâthough some, like
Delta County, did support Sam Houstonâs Unionist forces during the early part of the war
(Handbook of Texas Online 1997). Eventually, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of
America.
Although the fighting never reached North Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the
region (Works Projects Administration [WPA] 1992:55â58). Because most able-bodied men
were away fighting for the Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected
from and fearful of Native American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was
an eastward retreat of the frontier. Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable
immigration of Southerners who were moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep
South. The region gradually became impoverished as the war progressed, when food and other
commodities became expensive and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55â58).
North Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers of
fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to be
affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the withdrawal of
U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110â113). The defeat of the South in 1865 brought
with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation system, and
the presence of a Union army of occupation. The end of slavery brought many changes in the
27

economy of rural North Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources provided by
slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period ceased to be economically feasible and many
were broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its way into the
hands of speculators and investors, with the result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant
farming replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was now often held by absentee
landlords, with the labor supplied by African-American or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers
or tenants. Although this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was
a successful replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century,
the bulk of the rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
The state re-entered the Union in 1877. After 1870, the population of North Texas began to
increase, and the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent
recession. One of the most important factors in this recovery was the increasing role of the
railroad in the regional economy. A small amount of railroad construction had occurred prior to
the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of track had been laid westward from
Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad. Following the end of the war,
construction did not resume for four more years. When it finally did, it continued at a relatively
steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner
of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line
and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and Arkansas), building west from Jefferson,
crossed western Marion County and the southwest portion of Cass County. In the piney woods of
northeastern Texas, the Houston, East and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was
completed in 1882, quickly followed by the Kansas and Gulf Short Line, the Texas Southeastern,
the Grovetop, Lufkin and Northern, the Texas and New Orleans, and the Angelina and Neches
River Railroad. In 1901 the Gulf, Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad as well as the St. Louis
and Southwestern Railway had completed lines through San Augustine County; and by 1902 the
Eastern Texas Railroad was operating from Lufkin to Kennard in southeastern Houston County,
thus connecting the northeastern counties and opening manufacturing/trade/transportation
opportunities.
New towns sprang up along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the
improved communications they brought, spurred the development of other local industries as
well. The economic boom caused by the railroads brought many changes to Dallas and Fort
Worth, the two largest towns in the region, both of which were sited on the Trinity. During this
period, lumbering assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the piney woods of
northeastern Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf,
Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk,
Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to
process this lumber also sprang up throughout these Northeast Texas counties, especially in
Lufkin and Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production, and
provided another major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). All of these mills
helped supply raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:198).
Following the arrival of the railroads, colleges and universities soon made their way to Northeast
Texas. Central College, a Methodist institution, was established in 1881 (renamed Eastman
College in 1895) in Sulphur Springs, the county seat of Hopkins County (Handbook of Texas
Online 2001). East Texas Normal College, later renamed East Texas State University (and now
28

known as Texas A&M University-Commerce), was established in Commerce, located 15 miles
from Greenville, in 1894. Stephen F. Austin State University was founded in Nacogdoches in
1923. Numerous universities, colleges, and branches thereof sprang up throughout the
increasingly urban areas of Dallas, Fort Worth, and Texarkana.
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.
Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in many North Texas counties in the 1930s led to the
development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of the
region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 2:783).
The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas such as Texarkana and Marshall, and larger urban
areas like the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, which has swallowed many lesser municipalities
between and surrounding the city centers. Commercial patterns in the region have benefited from
the construction of several major interstate highways (IH 20 and IH 30) that have served to link
the area to major manufacturing centers to both the east and the west. The improved
infrastructure, as well as the construction of several lakes in the area, also has brought increased
prosperity in the form of tourism and the recreational dollar. In spite of this growth, agriculture
and livestock continue to play a major role in the regional economy (Fox 1980:1).

Lamar County
The area that comprises present-day Lamar County was initially settled between 1816 and 1826.
Originally part of Red River County during the Republic of Texas years, the area population had
increased enough by 1840 to warrant the formation of a new county, which was established
through legislation in December 1840. The county was named for the fourth president of the
Texas Republic, Mirabeua B. Lamar. After several temporary sites, the county seat was finally
designated in April 1844 as Paris, which was founded by George W. Wright who donated 50
acres of land in 1844. The town was originally know as Pinhook, but was renamed after Paris,
France. By the beginning of the Civil War, the settlement had a population of 700 and had
become a cattle and farming center (Handbook of Texas Online 2007a, 2007b). The residents of
Lamar County, many of whom were of English and Irish heritage and had migrated from
Tennessee and Kentucky, voted first against secession, but after war was initiated, supported the
Confederacy through military units recruited from the county. After the Civil War, the
population steadily increased, but the county remained essentially rural. Although numerous
smaller communities were established, Paris, with a population of 9,358 in 1900, was the only
major community in the county. Lamar County had a population of 55,742 in 1920, but the
29

population declined to a low of 34,234 in 1960, to increase again to 43,949 in 1990. The largest
towns in 1990 were Paris (with a population of 24,699) and the communities of Blossom, Deport,
Reno, and Roxton, ranging from roughly 1,700 to 600 residents (Handbook of Texas Online
2007a, 2007b).
In the late 1800s, the railroads began arriving in Paris: the Texas and Pacific in 1876; the Gulf,
Colorado and Santa Fe, and the St. Louis and San Francisco in 1887; the Texas Midland (later the
Southern Pacific) in 1893; and the Paris and Mount Pleasant Railway in 1910. By the 1920s,
Paris Junior College, one of the oldest in Texas, had been established. After a tornado destroyed
homes and businesses in 1982, the city invested millions of dollars over the next decade to
rebuild, renovate, and revitalize the downtown area. By the 1990s, Paris was a regional medical
center for northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma, and the major economic base was built
on the agri-business and numerous manufacturing industries (Handbook of Texas Online 2007a,
2007b).

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

INTRODUCTION
The cultural resources investigations were designed to identify prehistoric and historic
archeological sites and all other cultural resources located within the approximately 8.7 miles of
the U.S. 271 road widening project in Lamar County, Texas. This work was undertaken with two
primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
All cultural resources were identified through a program of background research for potential
sites and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing, using the field methods described
below.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
A review of the site files at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted to examine the
records of known sites within 1 kilometer of the APE. Five surveys have been conducted within
the 1-kilometer radius of the current project. including one along the northernmost portion of the
proposed FM 196 reroute. This survey was part of the 1994 TxDOT survey of the existing ROW
(Noble 1994), during which no cultural remains were identified. Of the other surveys conducted
nearby, one resulted in identification of site 41LR61, which was recorded in March 1979
approximately .4 miles south of the intersection of Cobb Ranch Road and U.S. 271 (Fox 1979).
The site was identified as a prehistoric lithic scatter on several sand knolls. Although no
eligibility determination was made, the site was recommended for testing should it be threatened.
No archeological sites are within the current proposed APE. One cemetery adjacent to the APE,
Meadowbrook Memorial Park, is located between FM 1508 and U.S. 271 along the north side of
the APE (USDA-FSA DOQ Blossom, TX 2004 topographic quadrangle), but the right-of-way is
not scheduled for widening in this area.

31

Archival resources consulted include the 2006 Texas historic overlay GIS (geographic
information system) map, as well as the USDA 1907 Cooper and 1903 Paris area soils maps, for
historic structures (Foster et al. 2006). A literature search for pertinent archeological work in the
general Lamar County area was undertaken at Fondren Library, Southern Methodist University to
provide a context for the current investigation.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Two GMI archeologists conducted pedestrian survey by walking a single transect or two parallel
transects, as determined by the Project Archeologist. On single transects, shovel tests were
excavated in leapfrog fashion, and on parallel transects each archeologist excavated shovel tests
along the transect. Prior to fieldwork, the APE was translated from a CADD file into a Shapefile
and was then uploaded onto a Trimble global positioning system (GPS) backpack unit. This
Trimble unit was referenced during fieldwork to determine and document the location of shovel
tests since the proposed route was not clearly marked on the ground. Upon completion of
fieldwork, collected GPS data were downloaded and used as the basis for the maps presented in
this report. The Project Archeologist maintained field notes that documented survey conditions,
vegetation cover, area covered daily, and initial interpretations of cultural properties, and kept a
photograph log that documented each photograph taken.
Examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of regional archeological site distribution
patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey in combination with the
observed soil profiles from shovel tests formed the basis for determining the intensity of
investigation and the placement of judgmental shovel tests within the project area. The entire
project area is considered to be of low probability because it is composed almost entirely of
upland deposits. Therefore, it was recommended that shovel tests be judgmentally placed, but in
accordance with current survey standards for linear projects (e.g., a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per linear mile) as approved by the Texas Historical Commission. It was also agreed that shovel
tests would be excavated in areas where ground cover hindered site detection or in areas of high
site probability such as along creek margins. Should areas along the project corridor be identified
as having been previously altered or impacted (e.g., urban sprawl, buried utilities, highway
construction, etc.) or exhibiting large areas of bedrock at the surface, shovel tests were not
excavated but the areas were photodocumented. All excavated shovel test units were recorded
with a GPS unit to ensure accurate placement on a map of the survey area. During fieldwork, all
exposed surface areas such as road cuts, animal burrows, and plowed fields were closely
inspected for cultural material.
A total of 43 shovel tests was excavated during this survey. The location of each shovel test was
recorded as a GPS point throughout the survey area. The 43 excavation units exceed the
minimum of shovel tests required by Texas Historical Commission guidelines for a project of this
size and configuration. In all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and
were excavated either to the top of the Bt-horizon (subsoil) or to 80 cm below ground surface.
The soil from each shovel test was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-inch) hardware cloth, and
each shovel test was backfilled.
GMI follows standard procedures to define sites and delineate site boundaries. When a cultural
artifact is encountered, either surface or subsurface, a series of four shovel tests in a cruciform
pattern (one in each cardinal direction) around the initial find is excavated. Site designation is
32

applied only to clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than 10 artifacts), clusters of subsurface
artifacts (two or more positive shovel tests), or significant architectural properties. If no further
cultural remains are located, the original artifact is recorded as an isolated find (or locality),
photographed, recorded in field notes, and plotted on applicable topographic maps, and the survey
continues.
If cultural material is located in any of the additional shovel tests, the find is recorded as a site,
and shovel testing continues in the cruciform pattern until a sterile shovel test is encountered to
fully delineate the site areal extent within the project corridor. The additional shovel tests are
used to obtain estimates of the site depth, contents, and integrity. Each recorded site is identified
with a permanent datum marker consisting of a â-inch-diameter metal rebar stake placed on the
site. This marker is topped with an aluminum cap bearing the siteâs temporary GMI field
number, and the site datum location is recorded using GPS. A scaled pace-and-compass map is
prepared, showing the site boundary, shovel test locations, cultural and topographic features,
generalized contour intervals, and any integral onsite vegetation, as well as any other specific
aspects of the site. The site is photographed from several viewpoints with a digital camera; any
damage from vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances is also photodocumented. These
photographs are recorded in a photo log. A State of Texas site recording form is prepared, noting
locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated period of occupation, and
artifactual material (both surface and subsurface). The site location is plotted on the appropriate
project and topographic maps.
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests on both site and nonsite (isolated occurrence) areas are
collected. Wherever possible, limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally
diagnostic artifacts are implemented to expand the sample of materials used in evaluating the
cultural affiliation, age, and other research-potential issues about the site.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
One historic brick fragment was recovered during this project and transported to the GMI
laboratory. In the laboratory, all artifact are subjected to standard procedures of cleaning,
analyzing, and labeling. The first step in the process involves the cleaning of artifacts in the most
appropriate method per artifact as determined by GMI laboratory personnel. Once cleaned, the
artifact(s) are sorted through visual inspection and separated into prehistoric, historic, and ecofact
(faunal and vegetal remains) classifications. A specialist then analyses each artifact and records
such information as material type, style, function, and metric attributes.
Prehistoric lithics are analyzed for specific attributes, defining chipped stone tools (biface
[including projectile points], uniface, edge modified flake, utilized/modified cobble tool),
debitage (flake, shatter, core), ground stone (mano, metate, pestle, pendant, etc.), and fire-cracked
rock. Prehistoric ceramics are analyzed for identification of vessel portion (body, rim, base),
temper, decoration, etc., to allow placement of each sherd into named types when possible.
Burned clay fragments with no indication of vessel structure (i.e., lacking temper, decoration,
etc.) are identified either as baked clay (the result of unintentional firing as in hearth remains) or
as daub (used for shelter construction).

33

Historic materials are analyzed to determine objects for domestic (e.g., ceramics, glass, tableware,
lamp fragments), architectural (nails, brick, window glass), activities (farm-, transportation-,
weapons-related), or personal (e.g., doll/doll parts, perfume bottles, comb) consumption.
Unidentifiable fragments of metal and glass with no ability to provide specific information are
classified as âunidentifiedâ and simply counted as present among the assemblage. The discussion
of the one historic brick fragment is present in Appendix A.
Ecofacts represent faunal and vegetal remains onsite that were likely altered in some way to
reflect human occupation. Such material may be shell, faunal bone, or seed representing food
consumption or personal decoration, charcoal remains from hearths, and wood remains used as
shelter or fuel. When possible, ecofacts are analyzed to the species level to help in determining
specific subsistence economies and time periods of site occupation.
After the analyses of the artifactual materials are complete, all recorded attributes for each artifact
are entered into an ACCESS database on an IBM network system. Computer printouts are
compiled and archived with the permanent project files.

CURATED MATERIAL
All records and materials generated from this project were returned to the GMI laboratory
facilities in Plano, Texas, and labeled or recorded in compliance with TARL standards. All
documents and materials related to this project will be permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project
(Appendix B).

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
During the present survey, a total of 43 shovel tests was excavated within those areas of the
newly proposed right-of-way with right-of-entry and in those sections of the existing ROW
considered to have the highest potential for producing cultural material. This chapter provides an
overview of the survey corridor, work conducted, and a discussion by segment of the corridor
from the northwest to the southeast terminus and the cultural remains documented within the
project area.

OVERVIEW OF SURVEY CORRIDOR
At the time of this survey, the majority of the newly proposed ROW on private property was
inaccessible due to ROE restrictions. Of the 76 parcels of land owned by 45 landowners, only 15
parcels from nine landowners were accessible prior to the beginning of survey. Through the
efforts of Chris Brook, additional property owners near Mulberry Creek provided verbal ROE to
their properties the evening before survey was conducted. All properties with ROE and portions
of the preexisting ROW were judgmentally shovel-tested, which formed the basis for assessing
adjacent properties with ROE restrictions (Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c).
The project area was subdivided into segments based on accessibility to the newly proposed
ROW, which resulted in formation of four segments. These segments were lettered sequentially
from A to D (Table 2), beginning at the northwest terminus of the project. These four segments
are composed of one or more individual properties, with each property requiring different survey
treatment predicated on their observed condition.

Survey Area: Segment A

Segment A extended from the northwestern terminus of the project at the U.S. 271/Loop 286
intersection near Paris to a tributary of Big Sandy Creek (see Figure 2a). In total, six shovel tests
were excavated in this segment; no cultural materials were identified. Two shovel tests were
35

excavated within the newly proposed ROW of the northwesternmost accessible property, and the
other four tests were excavated on the east and west banks of the tributary of Big Sandy Creek at
its junction with U.S. 271; no cultural resources were found. The two northwestern shovel tests
indicated that the property has been cleared and leveled to create pasture (Figure 3).
The portion of the segment with restricted ROE was inspected from the adjacent properties with
ROE and from the existing ROW. Observation revealed that the northwestern part of the segment
has been disturbed through construction of buildings such as a veterinary clinic, installation of
utility towers, and land-clearing for pasturage (Figure 4). The portion of this segment with
restricted ROE to the northwest of the tributary of Big Sandy Creek has also been impacted by
private development, land-clearing for pasturage, and creation of stock ponds (see Figure 2a).
The upland dendritic reaches of Big Sandy Creek within this survey segment are deeply incised
(Figure 5). There is no true flood plain associated with this creek, and the profiles of the shovel
tests excavated adjacent to the tributary of Big Sandy Creek indicated a weak soil overlying a
mixture of clay loams. The clay loams were sterile with no indication of a paleosol.

Survey Area: Segment B
Segment B consisted of the project area between the tributary of Big Sandy Creek and the eastern
boundary of the James Winters property. Nearly the entire segment was composed of property
without ROE, except the property immediately east of Little Sandy Creek (see Figures 2a and
2b). The properties without ROE were photodocumented from the existing ROW, and based on
observations, it is concluded that the majority of this newly proposed ROW appears to have been
impacted by clearing, grading, cattle grazing, or construction of stock ponds and buildings. An
overview of those properties with ROE restrictions provides the context for these conclusions.
The ROW terrain southeast of the tributary of Big Sandy Creek rises to FM 1508 from an
elevation of 480 feet to 510 feet above mean sea level (Figure 6). This area is predominantly
active pasture and is extremely level, flat, and treeless, which is a combination of attributes
generally associated with clearing and grading activities. These same types of conditions were
documented in the northwesternmost property with ROE in Segment A, and thus the same
activities are likely associated with this property. The likelihood of these activities having
occurred on this property is strengthened because the property in Segment A and this property
were at one time owned by the same individual (Chris Brook, personal communication 2007).
The segment portion on top of the hill eastward from the Seventh Day Adventist Church is
primarily owned by the same individual (Ferguson); ROE was not obtained for this parcel. The
land use pattern seems to be consistent throughout this landownerâs property, which is a working
ranch (Chris Brook, personal communication 2007) that has been cleared and graded with
interspersed pushpiles and stock ponds (Figure 7, see Figures 2b and 2c). These conclusions are
supported by observation of small unnamed drainages on the property that have been filled with
pushed trees and logs (Figure 8). This same land use pattern continues from this point to the west
side of Little Sandy Creek.
The only area with ROE in this segment was directly east of Little Sandy Creek. Two shovel
tests were excavated on the east bank of Little Sandy Creek (see Figure 2b). Little Sandy Creek
is a deeply incised upland creek with an intact flood plain (Figure 9). These two shovel tests

Survey Area: Segment C
Segment C began at the eastern boundary of Segment B and continued southeast to CR 14250,
and includes Mulberry Creek. The majority of access to the area northwest of CR 13350 was
restricted, except for one property. This property was not formally tested because there is no
newly proposed ROW in this area, and the existing ROW in this location has been impacted by
pond-building activities and access road construction (Figure 10).
Figure

Overview of property with ROE at beginning of Segment C, looking northwest

Figure 10. Overview of property with ROE at beginning of Segment C, looking northwest.

The portion of the newly proposed ROW along the south side of U.S. 271 between the beginning
of the segment and CR 13350 is also owned by Ferguson and has been used in a manner similar
to that discussed in Segment B. The most stark example of clearing and grading activities present
on the Ferguson property was observed upslope from CR 13350. There were several large
pushpiles and uprooted charred tree trunks within the newly proposed ROW (Figure 11).
Presumably, this general land use pattern was widely employed on this property.
The area between CR 13350 and CR 14250 near Mulberry Creek included several properties to
which access was granted through a combination of written and verbal ROE agreements. As a
result, judgmentally placed shovel tests were excavated along the entire newly proposed ROW on
the south side of U.S. 271 between CR 13350 and CR 14250, and the existing ROW on the north
side between the picnic area and CR 14250. A total of 35 shovel tests was excavated within the
vicinity of Mulberry Creek, and a bank of an unnamed tributary of Mulberry Creek was profiled
on the south side of U.S. 271. These investigations resulted in the recovery of one brick fragment

from a shovel test on the southeastern corner of the CR 13350/U.S. 271 intersection. This
recovery was documented as Isolated Find #1 and is discussed in greater detail later in this
chapter.
Mulberry Creek is the largest creek in the project area and has a flood plain that includes several
backwater sloughs and massive erosional gullies (Figure 12). Mulberry Creek is deeply incised
(Figure 13), and current investigations revealed small portions of the flood plain adjacent to the
main channel with alluvial sediments. The profile of the bank of an unnamed western tributary of
Mulberry Creek south of U.S. 271 indicated more than 2 m of alluvial sediment at that location
(Figure 14). A shovel test was excavated 5 m to the south of this location, and subsoil was
reached at 70 cm below surface.
A similar pattern was observed on the north side of U.S. 271 where a shovel test adjacent to the
creek failed to indicate the presence of subsoil, but a shovel test 20 m away indicated subsoil was
present at 70 cm below surface. These data indicate recent, rapid, sequences of cut-and-fill
episodesâlikely the byproduct of the recently cleared and subsequently eroding uplandsâ
resulting in the rapid aggradation of modern alluvial sediment in and near Mulberry Creek. Thus,
there is a low potential for an intact buried paleosol or surface amenable to human occupation in
the locations of deeper alluvium.

Survey Area: Segment D
Segment D consisted of the section from FM 14250 to the southeastern terminus of the project
area (see Figure 2c). Segment D also included the realignment of FM 196 on the south side of
U.S. 271 in Pattonville. No shovel tests were excavated in this area due to a combination of ROE
restrictions and observable disturbances. However, one historic site was documented in this area
and will be discussed later in this chapter under the heading of archeological sites.
Terrain within this segment of the project area rises from roughly 450 feet above mean sea level
at FM 14250 to 500 feet above mean sea level at Pattonville. The project area at this point is
composed of property with restricted ROE but observations noted the area consists of cleared
uplands and a small auto salvage yard (Figure 15). The ROW crosses a small unnamed
intermittent creek, and then passes through several Pattonville residential lots near the
intersection of U.S. 271 and FM 196 to which ROE has been granted. It was evident based on
observations that these lots have been significantly impacted by construction of residences and
associated landscaping (Figure 16).

The reroute of FM 196 passes southward over the historic railroad grade, which was recorded as
the historic site, and then is projected to destroy a Baptist church and three residential locations.
This proposed FM 196 reroute ends roughly 80 m south of the CR 14420 and FM 196
intersection. All land along this proposed reroute has been altered by building construction,,
landscaping, or road construction; thus, no intact archeological deposits are present (Figure 17).

The remainder of the project area continuing from FM 196 along U.S. 271 is composed of
properties with restricted ROE. The first property to the southeast is a construction staging zone.
The area is demarcated by piles of gravel and tar, machinery, and exposed clay (Figure 18). The
remainder of the newly proposed ROW is densely forested (Figure 19). The forest is young
growth and covers the historic railroad grade, which was observed in the woods northwest of the
Thomas Odell driveway. Therefore, the construction of the railroad grade has likely impacted the
newly proposed ROW in this area.

SITE 41LR359
Pedestrian survey for the U.S. 271 road-widening project documented one known but previously
unrecorded historic site within the project area (Table 3). Site 41LR359 is a remnant of the
historic Paris and Mount Pleasant Railway (Pa-Ma Line) railroad grade (see Figure 2c). The
railroad was chartered on 29 January 1909 and completed in 1913. It carried freight and
passengers from Paris to Mount Pleasant for a period of 40 years.

A walkover survey along the railroad grade for those sections where ROE was secured confirmed
that the railroad grade within the current project ROW is intact in several areas beginning on the
west side of Pattonville and extending to the southeastern terminus of the project area as observed
via a property with ROE just beyond the limits of the project area (Figure 20). The grade has
been previously impacted by the construction of U.S. 271 and FM 196 and additionally impacted
by private developments, but the general trajectory of the railroad can still be determined. No
shovel tests were excavated because of disturbance caused by railroad construction, and no
artifactual material was observed. Because of the extensive disturbance to the roadbed from
construction and development in the ROE area as well as the lack of cultural material observed
within the ROW, the portion of site 41LR359 within the current project area is recommended
ineligible for inclusion in the National Register or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark.

ISOLATED FIND #1
The only subsurface cultural material identified during this survey was recovered from the
northwesternmost portion of the accessible area at the southern end of Segment C (Table 4; see
Figure 2c). The shovel test was excavated at the southeast corner of the CR 13350 and U.S. 271
intersection (Figure 21). One brick fragment was recovered from the 0â10-cm level of a shovel
test near a partially filled spring. Three additional shovel tests were excavated within the ROW
boundary in a cruciform pattern around this isolated find, but no additional cultural material was
found. The brick fragment is a machine-made specimen dated to post-1902 and several surfaces
appear to have been burned (see Appendix B). The origin and historic affiliation/association of
this machine-made brick fragment are unknown. Since this cultural occurrence does not meet the
criteria for definition as a site, it is by definition not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological survey of the 8.7 miles to be affected by the proposed widening of U.S. 271
was designed to investigate the project area for previously undocumented cultural resources,
reassess any previously recorded archeological sites within the project area, and collect sufficient
data for the evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. One archeological site
and one isolated find were identified and documented during this survey. This chapter provides a
more detailed discussion of the NRHP and SAL criteria and presents recommendations for future
treatment of these resources.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Eligibility for Inclusion in the NRHP
The cultural resources discussed in this report were evaluated according to criteria based on
federal regulations for determining the significance of those resources for inclusion in the NRHP.
âHistoric propertyâ means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. This term includes . . . artifacts, records,
and remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term âeligible for inclusion in
the National Registerâ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the
Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria [36 CFR 800.2].

Subsequent to identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions
associated with cultural resources, the following NRHP eligibility criteria are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
57

(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR Â§ 60.4].
Usually, Criterion âdâ is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important
information is generally recognized to refer to scientific importance. However, scientific
importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the time and in part by the state of
available information regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. The
purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum drawers with relics, but rather to
fill informational gaps relating to specific research domains. As research progresses within a
region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some of those research domains. Through
time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though
complementary data are often needed from different periods, seasons, settings, and site types to
fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to address specific questions
approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of that kind of repetitive
information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification criteria of important
historic properties are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain. Archeological sites with
integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Archeological sites that exist on static landforms, such as bedrock surfaces or ancient upland
hilltops that lack eolian sands, can contain concentrated densities of artifacts and feature remains.
Such âpalimpsestâ remains of occupations are generally regarded as having very little or no
research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of prehistory,
because the artifact assemblages are mixed and not interpretable. In such cases, the sites are not
regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
The most ideal kinds of archeological remains are those left in rapidly aggrading settings, where
there is a chance for noncultural sediments to separate a series of materials and residues
representing brief, short-term activities. Usually, aggrading alluvial, wind-blown or eolian sand
sheets and dunes, and sometimes colluvial slopewash are the kinds of settings and events that are
apt to quickly bury archeological remains and preserve the discreteness of activities. The
evaluation of the depositional potential is one of the key characteristics for distinguishing the
integrity of deposits.
Information is useless in a vacuum. Thus, the first criterion of significance for any archeological
property within the APE is considered to be its capability to yield relevant information. Whether
or not specific archeological properties exhibit such potential or contain data relevant to any
particular historic context or research theme is dependent upon a precondition of contextual
integrity of the archeological deposits. For example, a prehistoric site buried by sediment within
an aggrading river levee has a far greater potential for containing undisturbed deposits than one
located on an eroding upland surface. The nature of contextual integrity as it affects research
potential of a property, must, however, also be viewed as relative, since different research
problems require different types of data.

58

Eligibility for Inclusion in the SAL Program
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or
one of its political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private lands which has been specifically designated
as an SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard
archeological techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of
new information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources
Code 1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and
Chapter 41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].
The 8.7-mile road-widening project for U.S. 271 in Lamar County is being developed by TxDOT,
whose existence is due to State of Texas enabling legislation. Thus, Condition 1 of the SAL
programâan entity of the State of Texasâis met. The five criteria of the second condition are
very generalized, occasionally ambiguous, and might apply to virtually any archeological site.
For example, the first criterion for sufficient preservation of materials to âallow application of
standard archeological techniques to advantageâ is vague as to the meaning of the use of
âtechniques to advantage.â Clearly, some kinds of surface recording techniques could be applied
to preserved chipped stone remains in a highly disturbed and shallow archeological site for the
advantage of illustrating methods in a classroom teaching exercise. Nevertheless, the argument
can be made that without some degree of context, such sites are neither worthy of nor warrant
SAL designation simply because they contain archeological remains. We tend to place greater
emphasis on the SAL criteria for sites with integrity (criterion B), addition of new information
(criterion C), and/or unique or rare attributes (criterion D), over the criteria for the preservation
sufficient to apply archeological techniques (criterion A) or the mere opportunity to test
techniques, theories, and methods (criterion E). In so doing, the SAL criteria strongly resemble
the NRHP criteria regarding site integrity and the potential to yield information significant to
prehistory or history.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Roughly 20 percent of the newly proposed right-of-way was investigated through intensive
pedestrian survey and shovel testing in association with the proposed widening of U.S. 271
between Paris and Pattonville in Lamar County. The entire existing right-of-way has been
previously surveyed and was again partially investigated during this survey. One archeological
site and one isolated find were documented in the project area. The remaining portions of the
project corridor were inaccessible because of lack of entry rights, but were assessed from adjacent
properties and the preexisting right-of-way. These inaccessible areas, however, have little or no
59

potential for yielding cultural materials based on observations and extrapolations made from data
collected from neighboring properties and the general knowledge of the soils, geology, and
archeology of the area. Additionally, review of historic maps showed no potential for additional
historic structures within the project corridor. Therefore, construction of the proposed U.S. 271
road-widening project between Paris and Pattonville in Lamar County will have no effect on
historic archeological properties, and no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended for the project area.

APPENDIX A
HISTORIC-ERA ARTIFACT ANALYSIS DATA

FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND ENUMERATION OF
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS COLLECTED DURING THE PROJECT

Introduction
The analysis of the historical material makes use of four major analytical categories or classes of
artifacts, consisting of:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Domestic;
Architectural;
Personal; and
Activities.

Unidentified metal fragments and ceramic or glass sherds that are unclassifiable as to category are
placed in a separate, indeterminate category. Although the use of these artifact categories may
perpetuate ideas about functional classifications, it is felt that at the survey level of research, such
an analytical framework is the most efficient way to handle the artifactual data.
Major artifact categories are sorted into various subcategories, including tableware, food storage,
and furnishings. These are then sorted into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the
type of subcategory and material type. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are
associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible. The general nature of each of the
major artifact categories is discussed below.

DOMESTIC ARTIFACTS
The domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumes some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares include stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items are identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g.,
nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and are assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items or storagewares are also subdivided as to whether they were ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items are further subdivided into types and subtypes
using technological and decorative attributes, such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., gray bodied, bristol, cobalt, slipped, Albany slip, natural
slip) and interior treatment (e.g., blue gray, Bristol, slipped, Albany slip, unglazed). These
attributes form the basis for assigning production dates to individual specimens.
Glass storageware is subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); and either decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base),
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded), or sometimes function
(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). Individual items are given
A-3

artifact-specific dates based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination. Metal storageware pieces may consist of storage cans or pots, but are most often
represented by metal canning jar lids.
The furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service or food storage-related household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historical artifact assemblage from rural sites and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass.
Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the domestic category.
In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the architectural or activities categories.

ARCHITECTURAL ARTIFACTS
The architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of architectural items include such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails are further subdivided as to
whether they are wrought, cut, or wire; and the brick is distinguished as to whether it is
handmade, machine-made, or high-fired.

PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
The personal item category includes items of individual use, such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historical archeological sites.

ACTIVITIES ARTIFACTS
The final analytical category of historical artifacts relates to what have been called activities
items. This category includes all nonhousehold items, such as those associated with
transportation activities and farm-related equipment. As with personal items, this category often
makes up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts
from a site. Activity category items include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples,
fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for activities
items include tools, harness and equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons,
and coal.
