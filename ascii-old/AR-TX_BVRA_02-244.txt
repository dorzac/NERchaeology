ABSTRACT
The Bell-Milam-Falls Water Supply Corporation located in Cameron, Texas
plans to install a four-inch water transmission line along the east side of County
Road 104 on private land. In response to a request by the Texas Historical
Commission, an archaeological survey was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates on August 11, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5728. The length of the
area where the pipeline is to be installed is 10,400 feet with a twenty-foot easement
for a total of 4.8 acres. No prehistoric or historic sites were found within the project
area. On area with exposed gravels on the surface was observed, but analysis
revealed that these gravels were fractured due to natural causes such as freezing
and thawing. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission,
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Brazos Valley Research Associates, the
Texas State Library, and the client.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The Bell-Milam-Falls Water Supply Corporation plans to install a four-inch
water transmission line along the east side of County Road 104 in eastern Milam
County on private property within an easement of twenty feet (Figure 1). The
water transmission line will be placed in a trench eight inches wide and forty
inches deep. The area investigated is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle Rogers (3097-443) (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is the Bell-Milam-Falls Water
Supply Corporation. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and he
supervised the field survey. The survey involved 16 person hours and was
performed on August 11, 2010. The field crew consisted of John Connally and
Christal McMillion. This project is regulated by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Rural Development, and the reviewing agency is the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and other archaeological surveys in the
project area and vicinity. The online soil survey for Milam County prepared by the
United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service
was reviewed in order to assess the soils in the project area. The report
documenting the previous work for the initial phase of this project (Leach-Palm and
Rader 1996) was reviewed in order to become familiar with their findings. The field
methods consisted of an inspection of the exposed ground surface and shovel tests
in selected areas. Most of the project area is in upland settings with clay at or near
the surface. Since it is highly unlikely that buried prehistoric sites exist in this
setting, shovel tests were excavated mainly to confirm the presence of clay below
the surface. All excavated earth was passed through quarter-inch hardware cloth,
and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was used to record the data resulting from the
tests. The approximate location of the five shovel tests is depicted on the project
area map (Figure 2). Gravels were observed on the surface in several areas where
shovel tests were excavated. Additional tests were not considered necessary since
clay was at the surface throughout the area, and there were no obvious drainages
south of Shovel Test 5. A sample of gravels was collected and examined in the
laboratory by William A. Dickens, Ph.D. This project was documented by digital
photography, notes, and forms.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin,
Texas and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that there are no known
sites in the project area. A previous survey was conducted in by archaeologists
from Horizon Environmental Services (Leach-Palm and Rader 1996) for the same
client under Antiquities Permit 1659 as part of the Bell-Milam-Falls Water Supply
Corporation 1995 water system improvements project. Areas selected for shovel
testing were based on the presence of Holocene soils as defined by the Bureau of
Economic Geology maps. These soils were typically found in areas associated
with major streams. The majority of the smaller drainages in their survey area were
shallow and broad with little evidence of aggrading conditions. These areas were
viewed as having little potential for buried cultural resources. In the current project
area, the only evidence of drainages consists of what appears to be the upper
reaches of ephemeral tributaries that probably only contain water following periods
of rainy weather. Leach-Palm and Rader (1996:7-1) cite a study by Sharpless and
Yelderman 1993) that states that prehistoric and historic sites in soils associated
with the Blackland Prairie have been “constrained by combinations of the lack of
perennial water, clay content in the soil, and a low diversity of floral and faunal
species within the grasslands.” They also state that significantly fewer sites occur
along intermittent drainages and those that do occur at confluences with perennial
waterways or other intermittent waterways. These sites are usually limited activity
areas such as flake scatters situated near sources of stone that are suitable for the
manufacture of stone tools. They mention that most of the surface soils in their
project area predate human occupation. Therefore, cultural resources (if present)
should be restricted to the surface. The survey by Horizon Environmental Services
examined four segments in close proximity to the current project area.
According to the online soil survey for Milam County, there are three known
soil types in the project area. The majority of these are Houston Black Clay, 1 to 3
percent slopes (HoB) and Ferris-Heiden Complex, 5 to 15 percent slopes, eroded
(FeE2). A small area in the approximate center of the project area is described as
having Tinn Clay, frequently flooded (Tn). In general, an absence of soils in the
current project area is viewed as being directly related to the shallow clay soils and
a lack of a dependable water source in the area. Several forms of disturbance
were observed. These consist of past agricultural activities over much of the area
and construction of five chicken houses and a stock tank. Appendix II contains
photographs of the project area. In several areas, chert gravels were observed on
the surface. Some of these gravels were fractured and, at first glance, resembled
cobbles that were tested by aboriginal groups in order to determine their quality for
use as a source for the manufacture of stone tools. An examination of a sample of
these cobbles by William A. Dickens revealed that the fractures are the result of
natural causes such as freezing and thawing. This survey did not observe any
evidence of historic utilization on the east side of County Road 104 except for the
chicken houses that were probably constructed in the 1970s, a stock tank that is
probably recent, and the fact that much of the area had been cultivated in the past.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
