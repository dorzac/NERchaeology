INTRODUCTION
Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. plans to construct a well site on the
Retrieve Unit owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Brazoria
County, Texas (Figure 1). The well site is three acres. Within the footprint of the
well site will be a water pit and a reserve pit. The water pit will be 150 feet by
150 feet and will be dug to a depth of six feet. The reserve pit will be 30 feet by
60 feet and will be dug to a depth of five feet. Except for the bore hole in the
center of the well site and the two pits, the remainder of the three acres will not
be disturbed below the surface. All construction in this area will consist of
placing gravel on top of the existing surface.
The project area is in close proximity to Oyster Creek, a former channel of
the Brazos River. This tract is viewed is a very high probability area for the
presence of significant prehistoric sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was
recommended by the Texas Historical Commission, (THC) Archeology Division.
Significant archaeological sites have been recorded along this stream and
oxbow lakes associated with Oyster Creek. The project area is depicted on the
Lake Jackson topographic quadrangle (2995-122) (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Brazoria County is located in the southeastern part of Texas along the Gulf
of Mexico. Much of the area is defined as Gulf Coast Prairie. It is bordered by
Matagorda, Fort Bend, Harris, and Galveston counties. It covers an area of 1407
square miles. The land surface of the county is classified as broad and nearly level,
and the highest elevation in the county is Damon Mound that rises to 146 feet
above sea level. There are a few sloping areas that occur mainly adjacent to major
drainages such as the San Bernard River, Brazos River, and Oyster Creek. Most
drainages flow to the southeast through the major streams. Other streams empty
directly into the Gulf of Mexico or into the bays adjacent to the gulf. According to
the soils book for Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981:1), the inland portion of
the county belongs to the Gulf Coast Prairies Major Land Resource Area.
Project Area
The project area is located on the east bank of Oyster Creek, a former
channel of the Brazos River. Although low terraces are present in areas along the
creek, the current project area is flat and generally featureless. At the time of this
survey, the area was in pasture (Figure 3). According to the published soil survey
for Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981:Sheet 75), the project area is located
near the margin of two mapped soils â the Clemville silty clay loam (12) and the
Norwood silt loam, 0 to 1 % slopes (33).
Clemville silty clay loam is described by Crenwelge et al. (1981:16) as being
a nearly level, non-saline soil with slopes averaging about 0.4 %. Typically, this soil
type is a moderately alkaline, calcareous silty clay loam to a depth of about 30
inches. The upper strata are reddish-brown, and the lower strata are yellowish red.
Between 30 inches and 60 inches, the soil is reddish-brown, calcareous,
moderately alkaline silty clay that grades to clay in the lower part. This soil is well
drained and rarely floods. Surface runoff and permeability are slow. Historically,
this soil is used mainly as cropland. In a few areas it may serve as pasture. The
main crops grown in this soil are grain sorghum, cotton, soybeans. And corn. The
native vegetation of this soil consists of a dense stand of hardwood trees with
various understory plants.

Norwood silt loam, 0 to 1 % slopes is described by Crenwelge et al.
(1981:31) as a nearly level non-saline soil located on natural levees parallel to the
larger bayous and rivers. Slopes average about 0.3 %. The surface layer of this
soil is typically reddish-brown silt loam to a depth of about 48 inches. Between 48
inches and 54 inches, it is a yellowish-red very fine sandy loam. From 54 inches to
64 inches, it is a reddish-brown silt loam. This soil is calcareous and moderately
alkaline throughout. It is well drained and rarely floods. Surface runoff is slow, and
permeability is moderate. The soil is used mainly as cropland and pasture with the
main crops being grain sorghum, soybeans, corn, peanuts, and some vegetable
crops. The native vegetation of this soil consists of a dense stand of hardwood
trees with various understory plants.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Brazoria County is located in the Southeast Texas cultural-geographical
region of Texas as defined by the THC in a statistical overview published in 1985
(Biesaart et al. 1985:76). At that time, Brazoria County was fifth in the state in
terms of numbers of sites recorded (1630) and percentage of sites recorded
(8.06%). Within the region, Brazoria County was sixth with 89 sites (44% of the
state and 5.46% of the region). According to Biesaart et al. (1981:114), all major
periods of Texas prehistory were documented in Brazoria County in 1985. At that
time, 89 sites had been recorded at TARL. Of this number, 43 sites were classified
by temporal period as follows: Paleo-Indian (2 sites), General Archaic (11 sites),
Middle Archaic (2 sites), Late Archaic (2 sites), and Late Prehistoric (26 sites).
Information for the county in 1985 came primarily from surface collections (79
sites). Twenty-three sites were tested by hand in 1985, 12 were excavated, and 1
tested by machine. The archaeological potential of Brazoria County is reflected in
part by the increasing number of recorded sites found as a result of cultural
resource management studies. As a result of these investigations, the number of
recorded sites now stands at over 220 sites (TARL site records).
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazoria County is
situated within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. According to their
research, site density within the region is low at 0.001 â 0.1 sites per square mile.
Threats to sites in the area consist of mainly of urban sprawl, agriculture, and
destruction by relic collectors.
Most of the archaeological surveys in the county consist of small area
surveys, many of which did not locate cultural resources. State and Federal
agencies such as the Corps of Engineers, Galveston District; Texas Water
Development Board, and Texas Department of Transportation have been active in
the county and surrounding area. The remaining studies have been conducted by
universities, private contractors, and avocational archaeologists. Most of these
projects can be found by checking the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology
series published by the THC (Moore 1990, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993, and 1994), a
bibliography of Southeast Texas (Moore 1989), the site records at TARL, and the
Sites Atlas on the Internet.
The importance of Oyster Creek in prehistoric times is demonstrated by a
survey conducted by Moore Archeological Consulting in 1991 (Moore and Moore
1991). This study examined 750 acres adjacent to Oyster Creek (proposed
Cullinan Park) and several oxbow lakes formed when the creek (formerly the
Brazos River) changed course. In all, ten prehistoric sites were recorded. Three of
these sites contained historic components. This project was north of the current
project area and adjacent to the Texas Central Prison Farm. Of the ten prehistoric
sites, three (41FB199 and 41FB200) were tested (Moore 1996). Later, in advance
of park construction, data recovery was conducted at sites 41FB199 and 41FB200.

Both sites date to the Late Prehistoric period and have received the
designation of State Archeological Landmark. Site 41FB200 produced numerous
stone artifacts and ceramics. Bone preservation was excellent, and large quantities
of fish and animal bone were found as well as plant materials recovered through
flotation.
Brazoria County is one of the original Texas counties being created and
organized in 1836. Activity in the area began in 1528 when the Spanish explorer
Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca passed through what is now Brazoria County,
probably crossing Oyster Creek, Old Caney Creek, and the Brazos and San
Bernard rivers. Other Spanish adventurers were in the region in 1689 (Alonso De
Leon) and 1727 (Joaquin de Orobio y Basterra). The first Anglos to settle the area
were immigrants to Stephen F. Austinâs colony in the 1820s. The population grew,
largely due to the importance of the Brazos River as a transportation artery.
Between 1849 and 1859, the area supported a plantation economy based on cotton
and sugar cane, and Brazoria County became the wealthiest county in Texas.
One of the early plantations was the Retrieve Plantation on Oyster Creek
four miles north of Lake Jackson. The plantation was established in 1839 by Abner
Jackson. In the beginning, Jacksonâs plantation contained a two-story mansion,
slave cabins, a sugar house, and an oven. All of the structures were constructed of
brick. About 1842, he sold half of his interest in the plantation to James Hamilton.
During the 1850s, the plantation produced several sugar crops, and it became one
of the largest sugar producers in Texas. Merchandise was transported by
steamboat along Oyster Creek to a point on Retrieve known as Steamboat Landing
and carried goods to and from the plantation and Lake Jackson before the Civil
War. In 1911, the land was leased and worked by hired laborers from the prison
system. The State of Texas purchased the 7424 acre plantation in 1918 and
continued to use the property as a prison farm. The Retrieve Unit has been one of
the most productive farms in the Texas prison system. The above information was
taken regarding Brazoria County and the Retrieve Plantation was taken from The
Handbook of Texas Online.
Today, the population of the county is 257,256, and the economy is based
on the petroleum and chemical industry, fishing, tourism, and agriculture.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the
presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and
vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Brazoria County
were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic
sites found in the area. In order to comply with the law, a One Dig was performed
to make sure that no buried utilities would be affected by the backhoe trenching.
The One Dig test number was 063535108.
Field Survey
The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and the Project
Archaeologist was Edward P. Baxter. The entire project area was investigated by a
100% Pedestrian Survey and backhoe trenching. Two backhoe trenches were
excavated at the location of the proposed water pit and reserve pit (Figure 4) , and
they were dug to the APE. These trenches were 36 inches wide, 10 meters long
and between 5 and 6 feet deep. Backhoe Trench 1 was dug in the area of the
proposed reserve pit and was excavated to a depth of five feet. Backhoe Trench 2
was dug in the area of the proposed water pit and was excavated to a depth of six
feet. Each trench was examined for features and artifacts and profiled in the field
(Figures 5 and 6). The location of the two trenches is depicted on the map that
illustrates the well site. Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital
camera, and a hand-held GPS was used to create waypoints to help locate the
trenches.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have
been recorded in the project area, and a professional archaeologist had not
previously examined the tract. No archaeological sites were found during the
course of this survey. This survey was conducted in accordance with the Minimum
Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division. Additional archaeological work is not considered necessary. Therefore, it
is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the excavation
associated with the water pit or the reserve pit, all work must stop until the situation
can be evaluated by the THC. Should the location of the reserve pit or water pit be
changed, the THC must be notified as additional backhoe trenches may be
necessary.
