ABSTRACT
On behalf of Targa NGL Pipeline Company LLC (Targa), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive archaeological survey for portions of the proposed Mont
Belvieu to Galena Park 12-Inch Export Pipeline Project in Chambers and Harris counties, Texas.
The work, which included an archaeological background literature and records review, an
intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing and auger testing, was conducted in support of
Targa’s application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404
permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current
Interim Guidance Document dated April 25, 2005) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
The entire proposed project route is located within existing utility corridors. A background
review indicated that although some previous linear projects intersect the current route, no
portion of the project corridor has been previously surveyed for cultural resources. No previously
recorded archeological sites are located within the project corridor. However, a portion of the
proposed project corridor does pass close to the location of the Galena Park Sites (41HR6141HR70).
Following a USACE-approved scope of work, the SWCA archaeological investigations focused
on the anticipated permit review area, and consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing of stream floodplains and adjacent terraces. Auger tests were conducted within
deep alluvial sediments along the San Jacinto River. Investigations were conducted within a 100foot-wide (30 m) corridor totaling approximately 8 miles (encompassing a total area of 97 acres)
of the overall project length.
The survey recorded one new archaeological site. 41HR1110 is a late-nineteenth to earlytwentieth-century historic artifact scatter. Based on the paucity of the recovered assemblage,
absence of any features, and lack of contextual integrity, the portion of site 41HR1110 within the
project corridor is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). Any part of site 41HR1110 located outside of the existing project corridor
remains unevaluated.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C and Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800.4),
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the
anticipated permit review area. Based on the results of the current effort it is SWCA’s opinion
that the proposed project will have NO EFFECT on significant cultural resources within the
investigated project area. As such, SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations
within the investigated project area.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Archaeological Survey of Portions of the Proposed Targa Mont
Belvieu to Galena Park 12-Inch Export Pipeline Project, Chambers and Harris Counties, Texas.
SWCA PROJECT NUMBER: 20531
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Targa NGL Pipeline Company LLC (Targa) is proposing to construct a
pipeline starting in Mont Belvieu in Chambers County and ending in Galena Park in Harris
County. The pipeline will measure approximately 27.3 miles in length and will be constructed
within a workspace ranging between 75-160 feet (22-48 meters) in width. However, in areas
defined by SWCA as high probability areas, the workspace ranges between 75-100 feet (22-30
meters). No portion of the proposed pipeline corridor has been previously surveyed. SWCA
investigations included a background literature and records review and an intensive
archaeological survey for portions of the project alignment crossing anticipated U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional waterways.
LOCATION: Geographically, the project area lies in the Gulf Coastal Plain in Chambers and
Harris counties, Texas. The project begins at the Targa Mont Belvieu Terminal in Mont Belvieu,
Chambers County, Texas and will extend west and south approximately 27.3 miles through
Chambers and Harris counties and terminate just north of the Houston Ship Channel at the Targa
Galena Park Marine Terminal in Galena Park, Harris County, Texas. The project area is depicted
on the Pasadena, Jacinto City, Highlands and Mont Belvieu, Texas United States Geological
Survey 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles.
NUMBER OF ACRES SURVEYED: Approximately 97 acres (survey investigations were conducted
within an 80 to 100-foot-wide survey corridor along portions of the line totaling approximately 8
miles).
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Marianne Marek
DATES OF WORK: November 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011.
PURPOSE OF WORK: On behalf of Targa, SWCA completed an archaeological survey pursuant
to regulatory obligations related to the acquisition of a USACE – Galveston District Section 404
Permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current
Interim Guidance Documented April 25, 2005) and the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA).
NUMBER OF SITES: One new historic archaeological site, 41HR1110, was identified during the
present survey.

ELIGIBILITY OF SITES: Based on the paucity of the recovered assemblage, absence of any
features, and lack of contextual integrity, the portion of site 41HR1110 within the project
corridor is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
CURATION: SWCA conducted a selective collection survey. Potentially diagnostic materials
were collected and non-diagnostic artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the
field, but not collected. Artifacts collected are temporarily housed at the SWCA Houston office.
At the completion of all field efforts, analysis, and reporting, artifacts will either be returned to
the landowner from whose property the materials were collected or curated at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
COMMENTS: The archaeological investigations were concentrated along portions of the project
route where the alignment crossed anticipated USACE waterways. Crossings were investigated
utilizing a “first-terrace-to-first-terrace” survey methodology, wherein the terraces and
floodplains adjacent to each drainage were examined. All investigations were in accordance with
the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commissions minimum
archaeological survey standards for such projects.

INTRODUCTION

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA

On behalf of Targa NGL Pipeline Company
LLC
(Targa),
SWCA
Environmental
Consultants
(SWCA)
conducted
an
archaeological reconnaissance survey of
portions of the proposed Targa Mont Belvieu
to Galena Park 12-Inch Export Pipeline
Project located in Harris and Chambers
counties Texas (proposed project). The work,
which included an archaeological background
literature and records review and an intensive
pedestrian survey, was conducted in support
of Targa’s application requirements for a U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section
404 permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part
325, Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection
of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with
current Interim Guidance Document dated
April 25, 2005) and the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA).

Geographically, the project area lies within the
Gulf Coastal Plain in Chambers and Harris
counties, Texas. The proposed project begins
at the Targa Mont Belvieu Terminal in Mont
Belvieu, Chambers County, Texas and will
extend west and south approximately 27.3
miles through Chambers and Harris counties
and terminate just north of the Houston Ship
Channel at the Targa Galena Park Marine
Terminal in Galena Park, Harris County,
Texas. The project area is depicted on the
Pasadena, Jacinto City, Highlands and Mont
Belvieu, Texas United States Geological
Survey 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles
(Appendix A1).

The subject investigations began with a
background literature and records review of
previously conducted cultural resources
surveys and recorded archaeological sites. The
fieldwork consisted of an intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing of stream and river
floodplains and adjacent terraces. The goal of
the work was to locate all prehistoric and
historic archaeological sites in the investigated
project area, establish vertical and horizontal
site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate
the significance and eligibility of any site
recorded for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).

The project involves the installation of
approximately 27.3 miles of 12-inch-diameter
pipe within a 75 to 160-foot-wide construction
corridor. However, in portions of the overall
alignment defined by SWCA as high
probability areas, the workspace ranges
between 75-100 feet (22-30 meters).
Construction impacts will be confined to the
project corridor and include clearing of
vegetation, grading, and the stockpiling of
soil. With the exception of horizontal
directional drills (HDD) and bores at the San
Jacinto River and other locations, the pipeline
will be installed using the conventional opencut construction method at a maximum depth
of approximately 5-6 feet below the surface.
As such, the area of potential effects (APE) is
27.3 miles long, 75- to 160-feet wide, and
approximately 5-6 feet deep.

All investigations were conducted in
accordance with Texas Historical Commission
(THC) standards. Marianne Marek served as
Principal Investigator. Timothy Roberts, Jill
Armbruster, Greg Sundborg, and Kristen
Jeremiah conducted fieldwork between
November 1 and November 30, 2011.

A review of topographic maps identified
several named waterways along the project
route, which include Hunting Bayou, Sulphur
Gully, Greens Bayou, Spring Gully,
Carpenters Bayou, San Jacinto River and
Cedar Bayou. Land use within the project area
ranges from rural agricultural and pasture

lands, to suburban, urban, and industrial
environments (Appendix A2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is situated in southeast
Texas, in an area that includes the upper
Texas coast, from the Sabine River
southwest to the Brazos River, as well as the
adjacent inland coastal plain. This area is
defined as the Western Gulf Coastal Plain
(Griffith et al. 2007). The Western Gulf
Coastal Plain is a relatively flat strip of land,
generally 50 to 90 miles wide, adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico. The principal
distinguishing characteristics of this region
are its relatively flat topography and mainly
grassland potential natural vegetation.
Inland from this region, the plains are older,
more irregular, and have mostly forest or
savanna-type vegetation. Largely and
because of these characteristics, a higher
percentage of the land is used for cropland
than in bordering ecological regions. Rice
grain, sorghum, cotton and soybeans are the
principal crops. Urban and industrial uses
have expanded greatly in recent decades and
oil and gas production is common (Griffith
et al. 2007).
Harris and Chambers counties fall within the
Level IV Northern Humid Gulf Coastal
Prairies Ecoregion (Griffith et al 2007). The
historical vegetation was mostly tallgrass
grasslands with a few clusters of oaks. Little
bluestem
(Schizachyrium
scoparium),
yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans),
brownseed
paspalum
(Paspalum
plicatulum), gulf muhly (Muhlenbergia
capillaries), and switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum) were the dominant grassland
species in a mixture with hundreds of other
herbaceous species across these prairies.
Some post oak savannas (Wuercus stellata)
occur along the boundary with the East
Central Texas Plains. Some loblolly pines

(Pinus taeda) occur in the northern extent of
the region. Riparian area vegetation in the
north part of the region is similar to the
South Central Plains. In the south fewer
bottom land oaks and hickories occur, and
pecan (Carya illinoesis), sugar hackberry
(Celtis laevigata), ash (Fraxinus sp.),
southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), and
cedar elm (Ulmuss crassifolia) become the
important overstory species. Cane brakes
(Arundinaria gigantean) may have also
occurred along some creeks and rivers in
this region (Smeins et al. 1992).
Historically, the diverse animal populations
of the region included bison (Bison bison),
pronghorn (Antilocarpa americana), and
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).
Red wolves (Canis rufus) were once found
in the riverine forests (Gafe 1999). Birds and
waterfowl are relatively abundant today
(Griffith et al. 2007).

GEOLOGY
The geology along the project route includes
areas mapped as the Alluvium and the
Beaumont
Formation.
Holocene-age
alluvium is mapped along the confluence of
Buffalo and Hunting Bayous and the San
Jacinto River. Alluvium consists of clay,
silt, and sand, with organic matter, occurring
in point bar, natural levee, stream channel,
backswamp, coastal marsh, mud-flat, and
narrow beach deposits (Barnes 1992). The
Pleistocene-era Beaumont Formation is
mostly clay, silt, and sand; includes mainly
stream channel, point-bar, natural levee,
back swamp, and to a lesser extent coastal
marsh and mud-flat deposits. It has
concentrations of calcium carbonate, iron
oxide, and iron-manganese oxides in zones
of weathering. The surface almost
featureless, characterized by derelict river
channels shown by meander patterns and
pimple mounds on meanderbelt ridges,

separated by areas of low, relatively smooth,
featureless backswamp deposits without
pimple mounds. Thickness is plus or minus
100 feet (Barnes 1992).

SOILS
Soil survey data obtained from the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS
2011) for Chambers and Harris counties
were used to compile a list of soils
intersected by the project route. Soils
identified along the project route are
presented in Table 1.

PALM) is a geo-archaeological model
developed by the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) to provide an
evaluation of the archaeological potential of
proposed project areas throughout the
Houston District (Abbott 2001).
Based on Abbott's Houston-PALM, the soils
in the project area with the highest
geoarchaeologial potential are Brazoria and
Kaman clays; Hatliff, Nahatche and Ozan
loams; and Voss sands (Abbott 2001).
Along the project route these soils are
mapped on the east side of the San Jacinto
River.

CULTURAL HISTORY
PREHISTORIC
The project area is located in the Southeast
Texas Archaeological Region (Perttula
2004:7). The prehistoric cultural sequence
of this region has been described by Aten
(1983), Patterson (1995), Ricklis (2004:
181), and Story (1990). The following
synopsis is based on these sources.
The prehistoric cultural history of
southeast Texas has been divided into
three general periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic and Ceramic. The Paleoindian
period, called the "Early Cultures" by
Story (1990:168), is most conspicuously
identified by lanceolate projectile points
with ground lateral and basal margins.
Clovis, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff types
are distributed throughout the East Texas
part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, although
Folsom and Dalton tend to occur only in
the northern and north-central areas. A
general picture of these early peoples has
been reconstructed from a relatively scant
record. Their high-mobility lifestyle
depended upon a diversity of food
resources, including big game mammals.
Population densities were low and social
structure is hypothesized as relatively
simple.
The Archaic period encompasses a wide
span of time and cultures. Two basic
characteristics, along with various
adaptive changes, distinguish this from the
earlier period. The "increased density of
population and reduction in size of the
area exploited" (Story 1990: 213) are
evidenced in the material record by a
number of indicators. Projectile point
styles proliferated while displaying greater
geographical and temporal specificity.
Lithic technology became more expedient

and liberal with raw materials as locally
available lithic resources were more
commonly exploited. Specialization in
cooking features and food processing
implements suggest more intensive
utilization of available plant resources.
Shell exploitation along the coast becomes
more prevalent as evidenced by ubiquitous
shell midden sites. Archaeologically, the
Archaic is much more visible as these
adaptations left a more voluminous and
diverse legacy of sites and materials.
The Ceramic period or "Late Cultures" as
defined by Story (1990), for southeastern
Texas began roughly 2000 years ago. A
pervasive characteristic of these cultures is
the ubiquity of plain sandy-paste ceramics.
Kent and Gary points are frequent in the
early stages of this period, and were
eventually displaced by arrow points such
as Alba and Catahoula, perhaps as early as
A.D. 500 to 600. Subsistence strategies
depended on hunting and gathering, with
little if any evidence of horticulture. Bison
may have been exploited in the few
centuries prior to European contact.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Earliest Contact / Colonial Era (15001836)
The Spanish Colonial period (A.D. 1630–
1821) can be characterized as the initial
period of Aboriginal/European contact and
European settlement in Texas. During this
time, the region was inhabited by several
aboriginal groups including the Coapite,
Copane, Karankawa, and Orcoquizas
(Kleiner 2008). The first Spanish
expedition into the area was probably the
expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca, following the failed 1527 Panfilo de
Narvaez expedition (Kleiner 2008). In
February 1685, the La Salle expedition

entered Matagorda Bay and established
Fort St. Louis along Garcitas Creek.
Throughout the mid-1700s, the upper
Texas coast continued to be an area of
contention between France and Spain until
the 1763 Treaty of Paris clearly placed
Louisiana within the Spanish realm.
French trader Joseph Blancpain traveled
through the lower Trinity River and
Galveston Bay area in 1754. In response,
the Spanish established Nuestra Senora de
la Luz Mission in 1756 near the present
day site of Wallisville. In the same year a
military presidio, Agustin de Ahumada
Presidio, was established on the east bank
of the Trinity River near the LibertyChambers County line. Most Spanish
settlement in the area was abandoned by
the early 1770s (Kleiner 2008).
By 1803, when the United States acquired
Louisiana, the region was under Spanish
control as a part of the Atascosito District
(Kleiner 2008). Shortly thereafter, Mexico
gained independence and assumed Spain’s
former territories in 1821. AngloAmerican settlement began in earnest after
1824 when Stephen F. Austin received the
first official colonization grant from the
Mexican Government to bring 300 Anglo
settlers into the area.
Colonization proceeded rapidly and
Harrisburg, Velasco, Brazoria, Columbia,
Washington and San Felipe became the
principal settlements. However, the
Mexican government’s efforts to later
curtail American immigration resulted in
several disturbances, all leading up to the
Texas Revolution and the final battle at
San Jacinto in which Texas won
independence from Mexico.

Republic of Texas / Pre-Civil War
(1836–1860)
During the Republic of Texas era, from
1836–1845, Liberty (originally including
all of the future Chambers County) and
Harris (then Harrisburg) and Brazoria
counties were formed and organized in
1836 (Henson 2008; Kleiner 2008). The
Brazos River, Oyster Creek, and Buffalo
Bayou played an integral role in the
economic life of the region at this time.
Plantations dotted their banks, growing
rice, cotton, sugarcane and other crops,
while steamboats transported goods and
people to and from the port at Galveston.
The cattle industry was introduced at this
time as well, serving as another boost to a
growing economy (Henson 2008; Kleiner
2008).
During the 1850s, these industries grew in
conjunction with the railroads. In 1853,
Harrisburg County was the terminus for
the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado
Railway, facilitating the transport of
cotton and sugar across the county. Five
other railroads were built before the Civil
War, including the Texas and New
Orleans Railroad (Houston to Orange) and
the Eastern Texas Railroad (Sabine Pass to
Beaumont), both of which were completed
by 1861 (Henson 2008).
With the region’s dependence on slave
labor, residents voted heavily in favor of
secession and many citizens participated
as Confederate soldiers. (Kleiner 2008).
The Post–Civil War / Reconstruction
Period (1865–1880)
Following the Civil War, recovery from
the war was slow, with principal
agricultural exports dropping to a fraction
of their pre-war totals. After the war, many

freedmen worked for their former masters
or started small farms. By the late 1870s,
livestock, lumber, and shipping industries
had recovered significantly, owing in part
to railroad expansion and improvements,
and utilization of the Houston Ship
Channel (Henson 2008). However,
significant agriculture did not develop
again until after 1890 (Henson 2008;
Kleiner 2008)
Late-Nineteenth / Early-Twentieth
Century (1880–1940s)
After 1880, rail transportation in the
region increased significantly, principally
following the introduction of the Texas
and New Orleans (now the Southern
Pacific Transportation Company) in 1860,
linking Houston to Orange. This railroad
was later linked to the Louisiana and
Western and through service to the City of
New Orleans in 1881 (Kleiner 2008). By
1890, Midwestern developers had
purchased land along the new North
Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City
Railroad which headed east from Houston
along the southern side of Buffalo Bayou
towards Morgan’s Point. This was done to
attract other out-of-state farmers to raise
fruit, berries and vegetables, or just to seek
more a temperate climate (Henson 2008).
Oil exploration in the early twentieth
century generated a population explosion
in the region, particularly in Humble with
the oil boom at Moonshine Hill in 1905.
Oil was also discovered at Goose Creek
and Tabbs Bay, which led to the
establishment of a temporary boomtown in
1915-1917. In 1919, Ross Sterling and the
Humble Oil and Refining Company (now
Exxon) built a refinery near the oilfield on
the San Jacinto above the mouth of Goose
Creek. The development of the area as an
industrial hub really began in 1911 when

the formation of the Houston Ship
Channel
Navigation
District
was
approved. The 50-mile-long channel was
deepened and eventually widened to allow
oceangoing vessels. Petroleum and other
refineries developed along Buffalo Bayou
and the San Jacinto River (Henson 2008;
Kleiner 2008).
In modern times, the region’s economy
continues to center around the shipping,
agricultural, and petroleum industries.
Many residents of the region find
employment in the Houston metropolitan
area.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review consisted of a
cultural resource and environmental
literature review of the project area. An
SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
corresponding USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle
maps
on
the
Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas online database
for any previously recorded surveys and
historic or prehistoric sites located in or
near the project area. Site files, relevant
maps, NRHP and State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) listings were examined.
These sources provided information on the
nature and location of previously
conducted archaeological surveys and
previously recorded cultural resource sites.
Aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic
Geology Maps, and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service’s Web Soil Survey,
were also examined for historical and
environmental information related to the
project area.

FIELD METHODS
Prior to the field investigation, SWCA
developed and presented a scope of work
to the THC and the USACE Galveston
District for review and approval. The
resulting approved scope of work limited
investigations to include areas adjacent to
natural, relatively intact, jurisdictional
waterways and drainages crossed by the
project. The areas surveyed total
approximately 8 miles, or 29 percent of
the overall 27.3-mile length of the project.
The field survey consisted of one team of
two to three SWCA archaeologists
walking one transect within a 75 to 100foot wide survey corridor on either side of
a crossing. Investigations were focused on
the terraces and floodplains along Hunting
Bayou, Sulphur Gully, Greens Bayou,
Spring Gully, Carpenters Bayou, San
Jacinto River and Cedar Bayou.
The survey was of sufficient intensity to
determine the nature, extent, and
significance of any cultural resources
located within the investigated project
area. The survey met all THC minimum
archaeological survey standards for such
projects with any exceptions thoroughly
documented.
SHOVEL TESTS
During
the
survey,
the
SWCA
archaeologists examined the ground
surface and eroded profiles for cultural
resources. Shovel testing was the general
method of subsurface explorations utilized
during the survey. The utilization of
shovel tests was keyed to the level of
disturbance within the area and the nature
of the soils, geology, and topography.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm
arbitrary levels to culturally sterile

deposits. The matrix was screened through
¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel
test was plotted using a Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver, and each test was
recorded on appropriate project field
forms.
AUGER TESTING
Portions of the project alignment
encompass topographic settings that have
the
potential
for
deeply
buried
archaeological sites. These areas include
floodplains and terraces adjacent to the
San Jacinto River and the confluence of
Buffalo Bayou at Hunting Bayou. Due to
conditions not conducive with the use of a
backhoe or gradall (i.e. thick vegetation,
standing water), auger testing was
employed to search for deeply buried sites
at these locations.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background literature review revealed
that 13 recorded archeological sites are
located within one mile of the proposed
project alignment (Table 2). None of these
sites will be impacted by the proposed
project.
In addition, although the background
literature review determined that several
linear projects intersect the proposed
project corridor, none of the proposed
route is has been previously surveyed for
cultural resources.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Between November 1 and November 30,
2011, SWCA archaeologists investigated a
total of 11 segments within the project
alignment. The level of investigation was
keyed to the topographic setting as well as
the level of disturbance in each segment.
Please refer to Table 3 for a description of
work performed within each segment.

one shovel tests were not excavated due to
heavy disturbance by pipeline and utility
corridor construction and maintenance.
Shovel tests were excavated to an average
depth of 30-50 centimeters below surface
(cmbs) and were terminated at compact or
sterile subsoil. The placement of shovel
tests within each segment is presented in
Appendix A.
One shovel test (0.7
percent), ST A14 in Segment 7, was
positive for cultural materials.

The SWCA survey included the
excavation of a total of 112 shovel tests
and two auger tests (Appendix B). Twenty

SEGMENT 1
Segment 1 refers to the 2-km (1.4-mile)
portion of the line crossing Cedar Bayou
(Appendix A). This segment of the proposed
project corridor has been previously cleared;
it is regularly mowed, and already contained
from four to more than six existing pipelines
(Figure 2). The edges of the corridor are
wooded. A total of 23 shovel tests were
excavated at 100 meter intervals and every
test exhibited disturbed soils. A typical
shovel test in Segment 1 had two strata in
profile. Stratum I from 0 to 5 cmbs was a
dark grey brown (10YR 3/2) clay. Stratum II
from 5 to 35 cmbs was grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) clay with yellowish red (5YR
5/6) mottles (Appendix B). No artifacts
were recovered from Segment 1.

Figure 2. Cedar Bayou crossing (looking east).

SEGMENT 2
Segment 2 designates a 1.3-km (0.7-mile)
portion of the project adjacent to Galena
Park and Hunting Bayou (Appendix A). The
segment of the corridor contains from four
to over six buried pipelines and four
overhead transmission lines (Figure 3). A
total of 12 shovel tests were excavated in
this segment and no artifacts were recovered
(Appendix B). The soils in each shovel test
were mixed from construction disturbance.
A typical shovel test in Segment 2 had one

stratum in profile. Stratum 1 was a dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) sandy clay with
yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles.

This segment also contains multiple buried
pipelines and overhead transmission lines
(Figure 10).
A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated
along the segment, and the soils within each
shovel test exhibited disturbance from prior
construction (Appendix B). One of the

excavated shovel tests (A14) was positive
for cultural materials (see site 41HR1110
below). A typical shovel test in Segment 7
had two strata in profile. Stratum I from 0 to
30 cmbs was grayish brown (10YR 5/2)
sandy clay loam mottled with dark yellowish

cmbs was very dark gray brown (10YR 3/2)
clay with gravel.

and both handmade and machine-made brick
(Figures 12 and 13). The associated artifacts
date to the late-nineteenth and earlytwentieth-century.
Historic
aerial
photographs from 1944 to the present do not
show any structures in the area. Therefore,
site 41HR1110 predates 1944. The artifact
assemblage indicates the remains to be from
a turn-of-the-century house site.

SITE 41HR1110
41HR1110 is a historic artifact scatter
located on a topographic rise on a ridge
overlooking the floodplain east of the San
Jacinto River (Appendix A). The artifact
scatter is oriented east to west and measures
approximately 150 m x 30 m within the
survey corridor. The site does extend to the
north beyond the survey corridor. Within
the survey corridor the site has been heavily
disturbed by previous pipeline and utility
corridor construction and maintenance –
with the northern part of the site area
appearing recently graded. Ground surface
visibility in this area was 100 percent
(Figure 11).
Historic cultural materials identified on the
ground surface represent a domestic
assemblage and included stoneware,
whiteware, ironstone, aqua glass, amethyst
glass, brown snuff bottle glass, cow bone

According to the 1916 Burnett Bay USGS
topographic quadrangle map, two structures
are indicated in the vicinity of site
41HR1110, approximately 0.3 miles
northwest and approximately 0.21 miles
east-northeast of 41HR110 (Figure 14).
Based on a review of recent aerial
photography readily available on Google
Earth and the 1944 Highlands USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle these
structures were razed or destroyed prior to
the 1940s, indicated by the absence of the
structures on the 1944 Highlands USGS 7.5minute
topographic
quadrangle.
No
additional information on these structures is
available and there is no mention of these
sites on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas
online database (THC 2013).
A total of seven shovel tests were excavated
within 41HR1110. The three shovel tests
along the project alignment were excavated
at 50-m intervals and four delineation shovel
tests were excavated at 10-m intervals.
Shovel test A14 was positive with historic
and modern artifacts recovered between 0
and 30 cmbs. Delineation shovel tests
excavated to the east and west of ST A14
did not recover any additional artifacts
(Figure 15). Delineation shovel tests were

overlay of 1916 Burnett Bay USGS topographic
quadrangle map depicting location of 41HR1110
and proximity to indicated structures.

A typical shovel test from site 41HR1110
(ST OT 2) included two strata in profile.
Stratum I, 0-40 cmbs, was a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/6) fine sandy loam. Stratum
II, 40-45+ cmbs, was a pale brown (10YR
6/3) compact fine sandy loam mottled with
reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6). Shovel tests
were terminated at depths ranging from 35
to 80 cmbs at compact, usually mottled,
sterile subsoil.
The portion of 41HR1110 within the
proposed project corridor is completely
destroyed by the initial construction of the
utility corridor in the 1950’s and the
subsequent expansion of the corridor to
contain at least 15 buried pipelines. The
portion of 41HR1110 within the proposed
project corridor does not have any intact
cultural deposits or features, and is therefore
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing
on the NRHP. No further work is required at
this site.

SEGMENT 8
Segment 8 designates the 588-m (0.35-mile)
portion of the corridor on the west end of the
alignment near Buffalo Bayou (Appendix
A). This portion of the project corridor
contains multiple buried pipelines (Figure
16). Seven shovel tests were excavated
along the segment and no artifacts were
recovered (Appendix B). The soils in each
shovel test were disturbed from prior
construction. A typical shovel test in
Segment 8 had two strata in profile. Stratum
1, from 0 to 20 cmbs was dark grayish
brown silt loam (10YR 4/2). Stratum II from
20 to 50 cmbs was very dark grayish brown
clay (10YR 3/2).

Figure 16. Segment 8 overview (looking east).

SEGMENT 9
Segment 9 designates a 566-m (0.35-mile)
portion of the corridor on the west side of
the San Jacinto River (Appendix A). This
segment already contains numerous buried
pipelines and overhead transmission lines
(Figure 17). A total of six shovel tests were
excavated along the segment and no artifacts
were recovered (Appendix B). The soils in
each shovel test were disturbed from prior
construction. A typical shovel test in
Segment 9 had two strata in profile. Stratum
1, from 0 to 55 cmbs was light yellowish
brown sand (10YR 6/4). Stratum II from 55

to 65 cmbs was strong brown clay (7.5YR
5/6).

Figure 17. Segment 9 overview (looking south).

SEGMENT 10
Segment 10 is a 645-m (0.4-mile) part of the
line on the east of the San Jacinto River
(Appendix A). Segment 10 also contains
multiple buried pipelines and overhead
transmission lines (Figure 18). A total of six
shovel tests were excavated and each
exhibited soils disturbed by previous
construction. No artifacts were recovered
(Appendix B). A typical shovel test in
Segment 10 had two strata in profile.
Stratum 1, from 0 to 50 cmbs was light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam
(10YR 4/2). Stratum II from 50+ cmbs was
very pale brown sand (10YR 8/2) mottled
with brown (10YR 4/3) clay.
A single auger test was excavated at ST A2,
which appeared to be a less-disturbed area.
The auger test revealed that Stratum II
extended to at least 106 cmbs. Water was
encountered at 100 cmbs.

Figure 18. Segment 10 overview (looking eastnortheast).

SEGMENT 11
Segment 11 is a 2-km (1.25-mile) part of the
line that crosses Greens Bayou (Appendix
A). This portion of the corridor has been
heavily modified by previous construction
from buried pipelines, six overhead
transmission lines, and a sewer line (Figure
19). A total of five shovel tests were
excavated in this segment and no artifacts
were recovered (Appendix B). The soils in
each of the excavated tests were disturbed
from the construction. A typical shovel test
from Segment 11 contained one stratum in
profile. Stratum 1, from 0 to 30 cmbs
contained mixed very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2), light brownish grey (10YR 6/2)
and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) clay. An
additional 16 shovel tests within this
segment were not excavated due to severe
disturbance.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Targa, SWCA conducted an
intensive archaeological survey of portions
of the proposed Mont Belvieu to Galena
Park 12-Inch Export Pipeline Project in
Chambers and Harris counties, Texas. The
work included an archaeological background
literature and records review, and an
intensive pedestrian survey with shovel and
auger testing of 11 segments within the
proposed project corridor.
The entire proposed project route is located
within existing utility corridors. A
background review indicated although some
previous linear projects intersect the current
route, no portion of the project corridor has
been previously surveyed for cultural
resources.
Following a USACE-approved scope of
work, archaeological investigations were
focused in the anticipated permit review
area, and consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
stream floodplains and adjacent terraces. All
investigated areas consisted of an 80 to 100foot-wide (30 m) corridor centered along
anticipated USACE jurisdictional waterways
totaling
approximately
8
miles
(encompassing a total area of 97 acres) of

the overall project length. Deep auger
testing was conducted in alluvial settings at
the San Jacinto River.
One new archaeological site, 41HR1110,
was identified during the present survey.
The site consists of a historic domestic
artifact scatter located mostly within the
existing pipeline corridor. Historic aerial
photographs and surface artifacts suggest
that it is the remains of a turn of the century
house site. The site has been totally
destroyed by prior pipeline construction and
maintenance. There are no intact cultural
deposits or features remaining within the
project corridor. Therefore the portion of
site 41HR1110 within the proposed ROW is
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for listing
on the NRHP.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325,
Appendix C and Section 106 of the NHPA
(36 CFR 800.4), SWCA has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify
historic properties within the anticipated
permit review area. Based on the results of
the current effort, it is SWCA’s opinion that
the proposed project will have NO EFFECT
on significant cultural resources within the
investigated project area. As such, SWCA
recommends no further archaeological
investigations for proposed project area.
