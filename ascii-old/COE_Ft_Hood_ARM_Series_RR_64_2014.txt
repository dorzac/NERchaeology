14. ABSTRACT

41CV115, Subarea B, Rockshelter A is a large (89.4 sq m) site located in a 2 m thick exposure of Edwards Limestone, 8.7 m below
a broad, level upland surface, at an elevation of 294.1 m above mean sea level. The Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute
investigation of the site identified 12 strata and 9 cultural features and recovered 30,179 lithic artifacts (12,534 of which were
analyzed), 274 Historic period artifacts, 2,211 vertebrate faunal remains specimens, 11 shell artifacts, 21,809 unmodified
invertebrate faunal remains, and 3,761 macrobotanical remains. Sixteen radiocarbon assays on the identified strata and features
indicate use of the site ranging from cal AD 680–740 to cal AD 1730–1926. Diagnostic projectile points recovered from the site
include Late Archaic (Pedernales), Transitional Archaic (Ensor, Darl), and Late Prehistoric (Scallorn, Perdiz, Cuney) forms. The
field results and lab analysis are reported herein, followed by a discussion of the the site's chronology, spatial and temporal intensity
of use, seasonality and subsistence, the general character of its use, and its apparent position in local and regional prehistory.

Introduction and Management Summary
41CV115 is a large multi-component site on Fort Hood, Coryell County, Texas (Figure 1.1). Originally
defined in 1976 (Trierweiler 1994:A-731) as a 20 ha secondary lithic workshop, the site was subsequently
redefined to incorporate an even larger area in 1986 by Dureka and Strychalski (Trierweiler 1994:A-731).
Finally, in 1988, Pry and Peterson (Trierweiler 1994:A-731) lumped 41CV115 and 41CV114, located
immediately to the south, into a “mega-site.” This newly created mega-site included the original lithic
workshop, an even larger lithic procurement area, and 13 rockshelters. In 1994 the site was divided into
two subareas (Trierweiler 1994:A-731). Subarea A subsumed the upland lithic procurement and reduction
area, while “Subarea B consisted of a single rockshelter (designated shelter A)” (Trierweiler 1994:A-731).
The current investigations focus on 41CV115, Subarea B, Rockshelter A, hereafter simply referred to as
Rockshelter A.
The first archaeological testing of Rockshelter A was conducted in June 1993 by TRC Mariah
Associates, Inc. (TRC-MA), whose three excavated test pits recovered over 3,500 prehistoric artifacts and
identified two cultural features with calibrated radiocarbon dates ranging from 820 ± 40 BP to 1240 ± 40
BP. Based on the relative and absolute chronological data, Trierweiler assigned the occupation/utilization
of the rockshelter to the last ca. 1300 years BP, or the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric I and
II periods. The rockshelter was deemed eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (Trierweiler
1996:223).
The site is a large, dry, north by northwest-facing reentrant rockshelter located in a ca. 2 m thick
exposure of Edwards Limestone, ca. 8.7 m below a broad, level upland surface, at an elevation of ca.
294.1 m above mean sea level. This is an area near the boundary between the Real-Rock outcrop complex
soil with 12–40 percent slopes and the Brackett-Topsey association soils with 3–8 percent slopes (Soil
Conservation Service 1985). The interior of the rockshelter is crescent-shaped in plan and measures ca.
17.5 m northeast to southwest across the dripline. The maximum projection, near the center of the dripline,
is ca. 6.1 m. The total area protected by the extant overhang is ca. 89.4 m2. The ceiling of the rockshelter
measures a maximum of ca. 1.5 m above the pre-excavation floor, again near the extant dripline. The ceiling
is relatively flat and maintains this approximate height throughout the entire interior and the interior floor
of the rockshelter is relatively flat and only lightly covered by scattered pebble- and cobble-sized limestone
fragments, which are concentrated near the extant dripline.
The Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute (MAI) excavation of Rockshelter A took place over the
course of four summer field seasons (2003–2006) and involved a reexamination of TRC-MA Test Pit 3 and
the new excavation of a total area of 22 m2. Excavation was conducted in natural depositional or stratigraphic
units and where possible by microstrata or arbitrary levels within natural strata of considerable thickness.
Arbitrary levels of 5 cm were employed where natural strata exceeded 5 cm in thickness. Natural strata
and microstrata were defined on the basis of subjective criteria including texture, apparent composition,
friability, degree of compaction, and, on a more limited basis, color.
All fill from every excavation unit was dry-processed through ⅛ in (3.2 mm) hardware cloth. The
combination of reasonably dry, easily disaggregated sediment and small screen size maximized the recovery
potential for macrofloral and macrofaunal remains as well as for lithic and other artifactual materials. To
recover materials smaller than 3.2 mm, a constant volume sample (CVS) of ca. 1,500 cm3 of fill was
collected from each natural stratum, microstratum, or arbitrary level within natural strata. These samples
were collected from the southwest corner of every excavated unit for flotation processing. Flotation samples
xiii

were also collected from cultural features, but the approximate 1,500 cm3 sample size was not maintained.
All feature fill was collected for processing via floatation.
Cultural features were mapped three-dimensionally, stratigraphic profiles were drawn whenever it
was deemed appropriate (as often as every 1 m), and contour interface maps were constructed. These
contour interface maps will permit the subsequent reconstruction of the paleotopography of the site. Since
the distribution of roof spalls clearly determined the amount of open floor space available to aboriginal
occupants, special care was taken to map all spalls larger than the size of a quarter coin. Although tedious,
recording coordinates of roof spalls and cultural features as well as associated artifactual and ecofactual
materials renders the production of large-scale floor maps a relatively simple task.
The MAI investigation identified 12 strata and 9 cultural features and recovered 30,179 lithic artifacts
(12,534 of which were analyzed), 274 Historic period artifacts, 2,211 vertebrate faunal remains specimens,
11 shell artifacts, 21,809 unmodified invertebrate faunal remains, and 3,761 macrobotanical remains. Sixteen
radiocarbon assays on the identified strata and features indicate use of the site ranging from cal AD 680–740
to cal AD 1730–1926. Diagnostic projectile points recovered from the site include Pedernales (Late Archaic
[ca. 1000–300 BC]), Ensor (Transitional Archaic [ca. 200 B.C. to AD 600]), Darl (Transitional Archaic, ca.
AD 200), Scallorn (Late Prehistoric, Austin Phase [AD 700–1200]), Perdiz (Late Prehistoric, Toyah Phase
(AD 1200–1500), and Cuney (Late Prehistoric through Historic [roughly 400–200 BP]).
The chapters in this report describe the site’s environmental setting (Chapter 1) and an overview of the
greater study area’s environmental history and its implications for human adaptation (Chapter 2). The general
analytical approach to the site, the field and laboratory methods employed, and previous investigations
of the site are outlined in Chapter 3. The results of the field investigations, including observations on
the rockshelter’s development and sedimentation, its stratigraphy and identified cultural features, and the
results of the radiocarbon analyses performed for the project are detailed in Chapter 4. These results are
followed by descriptions of the analysis performed on the recovered lithic artifacts (Chapter 5), historic
artifacts (Chapter 6), vertebrate faunal remains (Chapter 7), shell remains (Chapter 8), and macrobotanical
remains (Chapter 9). The report concludes with a discussion (Chapter 10) of the site’s chronology, spatial
and temporal intensity of use, seasonality and subsistence, the general character of its use, and its apparent
position in local and regional prehistory.
While it has proven difficult to segregate materials from each of the Late Prehistoric components at
Rockshelter A, it appears that the stratigraphic positioning of the Archaic versus Late Prehistoric diagnostics
is clearer, at least in some areas of the site. Based on the stratigraphic occurrence of temporally diagnostic
projectile points, where present, and the relative positioning of features and strata within and outside the
rockshelter dripline, it is possible to differentiate between levels associated with Late Prehistoric versus
Archaic components—again, at least in some areas. However, due to the co-occurrence of apparently
Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostics in some levels with little vertical separation, as well as conflicting
diagnostics and reversed radiocarbon dates in other areas, it remains clear that substantial portions of the
site contain temporally mixed assemblages of Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials. As with the individual
Late Prehistoric components, it is often the case that the Archaic components cannot always be successfully
separated from Late Prehistoric components.
Rockshelter A nonetheless offers important data regarding the prehistory of Fort Hood for two
primary reasons. Despite some apparent taphonomic issues, the site is valuable for its deep chronological
history, beginning with the Early Archaic (though this component is poorly understood) and extending
into the Protohistoric and, perhaps, early Historic periods. Because of the sheer time depth represented
at the site, as well as a presumably dense Protohistoric/Historic occupation that is practically unknown
elsewhere at the Fort, the site has the potential to illuminate cultural and technological behaviors that
might otherwise remain poorly understood or unknown. Secondly, the extensive subsurface excavations
conducted here permits a significantly more detailed trans-temporal examination of materials than the
xiv

mixed surface assemblages studied during most of the larger surveys. This has enabled the consistencies
and, to a lesser extent, differences, in technological strategies between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods to be identified and explored. With all of its merits and shortcomings, the artifactual and ecofactual
assemblage from Rockshelter A will almost certainly contribute to the picture of prehistoric human activity
on the Fort Hood archaeological landscape, which will become increasingly complete as more sites are
systematically examined.

1. Environmental Background
Site Location and Setting
J. M. Adovasio and J. L. Yedlowski
41CV115 is a large multi-component site on Fort Hood, Coryell County, Texas (Figure 1.1). Originally
defined in 1976 (Trierweiler 1994:A-731) as a 20 ha secondary lithic workshop, the site was subsequently
redefined to incorporate an even larger area in 1986 by Dureka and Strychalski (Trierweiler 1994:A-731).
Finally, in 1988, Pry and Peterson (Trierweiler 1994:A-731) lumped 41CV115 and 41CV114, located
immediately to the south, into a “mega-site.” This newly created mega-site included the original lithic
workshop, an even larger lithic procurement area, and 13 rockshelters. In 1994 the site was divided into
two subareas (Trierweiler 1994:A-731). Subarea A subsumed the upland lithic procurement and reduction
area, while “Subarea B consisted of a single rockshelter (designated shelter A)” (Trierweiler 1994:A-731).
The current investigations focus on 41CV115, Subarea B, Rockshelter A, hereafter simply referred to as
Rockshelter A.
Rockshelter A is a large, dry, north by northwest facing reentrant rockshelter (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).
It is located in a ca. 2 m thick exposure of Edwards Limestone, ca. 8.7 m below a broad, level upland
surface, at an elevation of ca. 294 m above mean sea level. This is an area near the boundary between the
Real-Rock outcrop complex soil with 12–40 percent slopes and the Brackett-Topsey association soils with
3–8 percent slopes (Soil Conservation Service 1985). The interior of the rockshelter is crescent-shaped in
plan and measures ca. 17.5 m northeast to southwest across the dripline. The maximum projection, near the
center of the dripline, is ca. 6.1 m. The total area protected by the extant overhang is ca. 89.4 m2 (Figure
1.4). The ceiling of the rockshelter measures a maximum of ca. 1.5 m above the pre-excavation floor, again
near the extant dripline. The ceiling is relatively flat and maintains this approximate height throughout the
entire interior. Only as the ceiling approaches within ca. 50 cm of the rear wall does the ceiling height begin
to decrease (i.e., slope downward) to ca. 1.1 m. The interior floor of the rockshelter is also relatively flat,
sloping slightly upward as it approaches the dripline in the northeast and southwest and as it approaches
the rear wall. The interior floor is only lightly covered by scattered pebble- and cobble-sized limestone
fragments, which are concentrated near the extant dripline.
The exterior of the rockshelter is relatively rugged and reflects three factors: colluvial deposition,
seasonally active downslope erosion, and the presence of pebble through small boulder sized limestone
fragments. At the periphery of the bedrock outcrop in which the rockshelter is formed, the outcrop
merges into the surrounding hillside. As a result, colluvial (talus) slopes have formed on either side of the
rockshelter. The northeastern (i.e., grid east) talus slope exhibits a mean dip of 26° at a strike of 14° west
of magnetic north. The southwestern (i.e., grid west) talus slope exhibits a mean dip of 26° at a strike of
55° west of magnetic north. These two colluvial slopes intersect near the center of the dripline, where they
combine with over the roof runoff to form an erosional gully. This erosional gully is quite distinct as a result
of the removal of sediment by running water exposing a bed load of pebble through small boulder sized
limestone. This erosional gully demarcates the head of the valley in which the rockshelter is located. The
combination of these factors has resulted in the creation of an “amphitheater” topographic setting. The talus
slopes are littered with detached limestone fragments ranging from pebbles through small boulders. These
fragments are concentrated along the talus immediately in front of the rockshelter parallel to the dripline
with considerably fewer scattered downslope.

Figure 1.3. General view of Rockshelter A facing southeast. Note the erosional
gully.
As one proceeds downslope, the eastern talus slope’s amphitheater-like topography gives way to a
gently undulating, flat, broad character. This area would have provided an ample and attractive extra-shelter
activity locus. In fact, there is evidence of an apparent burned rock midden in this vicinity, ca. 12 m outside
(i.e., northwest) the extant dripline. The morphology of the site appears to be little changed from its terminal
aboriginal configuration. In general, this site presents no obstacles to human habitation either beneath the
overhang or along the talus slope. In fact, its roomy, flat interior and high ceiling make it highly attractive
as a sheltered seasonal habitation locus.The rockshelter deposits appear to have remained pristine with no
visible historic disturbance other than previous archaeological investigations.

Physiography
F. J. Vento
The Edwards Plateau is the southernmost expression of the Great Plains physiographic province
(Figure 1.5). Entirely contained within Texas, the plateau is situated in South-Central Texas east of the
Pecos River and west of the Colorado River. This hilly area is clearly demarcated by the Balcones Fault
escarpment to the east and south, but grades into the Chihuahuan Desert to the west and the Great Plains to
the north. A largely erosional region, the Edwards Plateau is underlain by thick, lower Cretaceous limestone
that extends northward beneath the cover of unconsolidated Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments which form
4

Figure 1.5. Terrain model of Texas, showing the locations of Rockshelter A and the Edwards
Plateau along with its natural subregions. Although the site, according to the boundaries depicted
here (following Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2012), appears to lie within the Blackland
Prairie, the assemblage of landforms observed in this portion of the fort clearly shows greater
affinity to those present on Lampasas Cut Plain subregion of the Edwards Plateau.
the constructional surface of the High Plains region of the Great Plains. Although erosional processes have
long since removed these Tertiary sediments from the Edwards Plateau, a cover of unconsolidated silty
materials characterize remnant summit areas in the region lying adjacent to the High Plains (Thornbury
1965).
The plateau can be divided into three natural subregions. The first subregion, the Live Oak-Mesquite
Savanna, encompasses the central and western portions of the plateau and is characterized by broad, relatively
level uplands that are moderately dissected by gently sloping stream divides. The second subregion, known
variously as the Balcones Canyonlands or Texas Hill Country, is situated adjacent to the escarpment and
is characterized by highly dissected, fast-moving streams flowing through steep-sided canyons. The third
subregion, the Lampasas Cut Plain, is situated in the northeastern portion of the plateau and is characterized
by broad valleys. Fort Hood lies within (or at least intersects the northeastern boundary of) this third zone.
It should be noted that although the northern portion of the fort appears to lie within what the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (2012) define as the Blackland Prairie natural region, the assemblage of landforms
observed in this portion of the fort clearly shows greater affinity to those present on Lampasas Cut Plain
subregion of the Edwards Plateau.

Perennial streams on the Edwards Plateau are few and those present typically entrench the plateau
as much as 5,486 m over a distance of 24 km. The upper reaches of streams are often dry and open into
box canyons where springs provide permanently flowing water. Sinkholes commonly dot the limestone
terrain and connect with a network of caverns. Alternating hard and soft marly limestones form a stairstep
topography in the central interior of the province.

Bedrock Geology
F. J. Vento
The bedrock units present in the vicinity of the study area ascribe to the Comanche Series, which
spans from about late Aptian to early Cenomanian times (ca. 114–97 mya) (Figure 1.6). The Comanche
Series crops out as a group of fluvio-deltaic sands, marginal marine marls and clays, and a series of massive
reef and back reef carbonates (Nelson 1973; Young 1972). These massive carbonates form the mesas and
other imposing features of the Hill Country and Edwards Plateau regions of Central and South-Central
Texas.
Early on in the Comanche Series’ deposition, Texas was a coastal plain along an expanding early
Gulf of Mexico. As the advancing sea drowned this coastal plain, the Gulf Coast became a very shallow
marine platform bordered by a series of barrier reefs called the Stuart City Trend (Meyerhoff 1967; Young
1972). Back reef communities thrived behind these protective barriers, as is evident from the number and
diversity of fossils found in rocks of this age in Texas and Mexico. Many of the species that lived behind
these barriers are endemic to this region.
Meanwhile, the “Skull Creek Seaway” (the colloquial name for the first push of the Late Albian Sea,
named for the Skull Creek Shale) that invaded from western Arctic Canada continued to make its rapid
southward advance on to the western interior of the United States (Elder and Kirkland 1993; Jeletzk 1971).
Shortly thereafter, North America was split into two landmasses by the opening of the Western Interior
Seaway (Cobban et al. 1994).
As the deposition of the Comanche Series came to a close, the Skull Creek Seaway retreated
northward, effectively breaking the open connection. (The maximum extent of this retreat is called the
Muddy Lowstand, named for the Muddy Sandstone.) During the early Cenomanian, the “Mowry Sea”
(colloquial name for the second surge of the Western Interior Seaway, named for the Mowry Shale) again
plunged south to form—for the second time—an open connection between the Arctic and Gulf Coast. This
was a stable connection that lasted until the end of the Cretaceous period (Cobban et al. 1994).
The Comanche Series is divided into three major groups (from oldest to youngest): the Trinity,
Fredericksburg, and Washita Groups. The Trinity Group includes the Glen Rose and Paluxy Formations.
The Glen Rose Formation consists of alternating beds of fossiliferous limestone, dolomite, and marl that
achieve a total thickness of up to 114 m, although only its upper part is exposed locally. The formation
is relatively thin bedded and tends to alternate between relatively resistant limestone and erodible marl
resulting in a characteristic stair-step topography. The Glen Rose Formation is locally exposed primarily in
the valleys of Cowhouse Creek and its major tributaries (i.e., House Creek, Table Rock Creek, Clear Creek,
and Turkey Run Creek). The Paluxy Sand consists of fine to very fine quartz sand with interbeds of shale
and limestone that rests on top of the Glen Rose Formation. Although it can achieve thicknesses of 2l m,
in the western reaches of Fort Hood the unit is present as a thin, eastward-pinching wedge of material that
rarely exceeds 3–6 m in thickness and does not even appear on the regional geologic map (Barnes 1979).
Rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Fredericksburg Group rest above the Trinity Group rocks. At the
base of this unit is the Walnut Clay, which consists of interbedded, highly fossiliferous clays, limestones,
and shales that may reach thicknesses of 53 m. The Walnut Clay is commonly exposed throughout the Fort
Hood area due to the lateral stripping of overlying rocks. This unit forms the principle substrate of the broad
intermediate upland (Killeen) surface.
6

Figure 1.6. Bedrock geology of Fort Hood. Rockshelter A is located at the contact between the
Edwards Limestone and the Comanche Peak Limestone.
The Comanche Peak Limestone lies above the Walnut Clay. This unit forms the intermediate slopes of
the higher upland (Manning) surface and consists of hard, thinly bedded limestones and shales. The highest
extensive rock unit of the Fredericksburg Group is the Edwards Limestone, which consists of a thick (up
to 18 m) cherty, fossiliferous limestone that forms the resistant cap of high upland mesas. The Edwards
Limestone is the main source of chert in the area. It occurs as tabular or nodular forms in the bedrock, as a
residual lag on the surface, in soils on chert-bearing strata, and as alluvial and colluvial gravels.
7

The youngest rocks occurring in the Fort Hood area belong to the Washita Group. Included in the
Washita Group are the Kiamichi Clay, the Duck Creek Limestone, the Fort Worth Limestone, and the
Denton Clay. Although not individually mapped (Barnes 1970), rocks from the Washita Group are likely
preserved on high upland surfaces in the eastern portion of Fort Hood.
Locally, Cretaceous rocks dip more steeply to the east than do the present land surfaces. Consequently,
Cowhouse Creek flows up-section through this area, moving from upper Trinity Group rocks to the west
into lower Fredericksburg Group rocks to the east.

Structural Geology
F. J. Vento
Structurally, the region is situated between the stable continental interior and the subsiding Gulf
Coast basin. The area is underlain by a deep-seated extension of the Paleozoic Ouachita orogen. During
the Cretaceous period, Central Texas was the site of a very broad continental shelf covered by a shallow
epeiric sea. For more than 80 million years, carbonate deposits (i.e., limestones, marls, calcareous shales)
were deposited on the shelf as the shoreline oscillated back and forth. Occasionally, relatively thin deposits
of terrigenous clastics were washed onto the shelf from the west, forming interbedded formations—like the
Paluxy Sandstone, Hensell Sandstone Formation, and Antlers Formation—that tend to pinch out to the east.
As the Gulf Basin subsided in the Miocene, severe extensional stresses developed in the formerly flat-lying
Cretaceous marine rocks across a hinge formed by the Ouachita subcrop, and fracturing occurred, forming
the Balcones fault system (Woodruff and Abbott 1986).
The Balcones fault system is an extensional fracture zone composed of a series of roughly parallel
normal step faults arranged en echelon and broken by relatively small scale transverse faults, half grabens,
grabens, and horsts. In general, the upthrown side of the fault exposes lower Cretaceous rocks of the Trinity,
Fredericksburg, and Washita Groups, including the Edwards and Glen Rose Limestones. In the fault zone,
a sequence of Upper Cretaceous limestones, marls, chalks, and clays (including the Del Rio Clay, Buda
Limestone, Eagle Ford Group, Austin Chalk, and Navarro Group) are exposed at the surface. East of the
fault, increasingly younger Tertiary clastics are successively onlapped toward the modern coastline, and
the Cretaceous rocks are buried deeper and deeper beneath these younger rocks in the subsiding basin.
Although the relief provided by the escarpment is typically less than 100 m, major differences in character
of relief, climate, soils, and vegetation are apparent between the two sides of the fault zone.
Regionally, the lower Cretaceous rocks form a two-tiered or stair-stepped arrangement locally termed
the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hayward et al. 1990). This landscape developed between the Brazos and Colorado
Rivers west of the Balcones Fault zone and consists of large, mesa-like remnants of an early Tertiaryage planation surface surrounded by a broad, rolling pediment formed during the late Tertiary and early
Quaternary. These two surfaces differ 25–40 m in elevation and form the what are known variously as the
“high” and “intermediate” uplands (Hayward et al. 1990) or the “Manning” and “Killeen” surfaces (Nordt
1992). Modern stream valleys are in turn incised up to ca. 40–70 m into the pediment surface.

Drainage and Hydrology
F. J. Vento
Fort Hood is drained by a series of dominantly eastward-flowing streams, including the Leon River,
Owl Creek, Henson Creek, North Nolan Creek, Reese Creek, Cowhouse Creek, House Creek, Clear Creek,
and Table Rock Creek (Figure 1.7). These internal drainage lines are in turn fed by numerous rills and gullies
(external links) that flow north to northeast and south to southeast, typically originating on the margins of
the Manning surface and flowing across the Killeen surface to the principal valleys. Occasionally, small
drainages are present atop the Manning surface, but these features are poorly entrenched into the hard
limestone and are relatively subtle. In contrast, the tributaries feeding across the Killeen surface are deeply
8

Figure 1.7. Subwatersheds and major watersheds of Fort Hood, showing location of Rockshelter
A.
entrenched into the softer Comanche Peak Formation, Walnut Clay, and Glen Rose Formation rocks (see
Figure 1.6), forming fairly pronounced valleys.
Fort Hood’s hydrology is dominated by the watershed of Cowhouse Creek, which accounts for more
than half of the total area within the fort and subsumes the basins of Table Rock Creek, House Creek,
Cottonwood Creek, Slaughter Creek, Clear Creek, Brown’s Creek, Bull Branch, Taylor Branch, and many
smaller tributaries. Cowhouse Creek joins the Leon River on the eastern side of the base at a confluence
now inundated by the impoundment of Belton Lake. North of the Cowhouse watershed, the facility is
drained by Shoal Creek, Henson Creek, and Owl Creek, all of which join the Leon River on the eastern
margin of Fort Hood. The major watersheds south of Cowhouse Creek are North Nolan Creek, which flows
into the Leon east of the facility, and Reese Creek, which flows southeast into the Lampasas River. All of
9

the streams eventually feed into the Little River and then into the Brazos River, which in turn flows into the
Gulf of Mexico.
On a regional basis, the greater study area can be classified as being in a late initial stage of drainage
development. This assignation is based upon the moderately broad, undissected areas that occur between
often deeply incised streams. The region’s stream density is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity
of the bedrock units.
The consequent dendritic stream network formed on the flat-lying units are fed by a multitude of
springs and seeps within the Fort Hood boundary, particularly on the margins of the Manning surface. The
thick Edwards Limestone, which caps the upper surface, is broken by numerous fractures, macropores, and
small sinks. Gravitational waters moving primarily through secondary openings (joints, bedding planes,
etc.) typically encounter the top of the less permeable, thin limestones and marls of the Comanche Peak
Formation and then flow laterally, emerging as springs or seeps at the base of the massive limestone scarps
that ring the high surface. These same springs and seeps have formed many of the upland rills and gullies
that dissect the upper and lower valley slopes. As noted above, such a headward eroding rill is present at
Rockshelter A.
Seeps and springs are also present, though less common, in the lower formations, particularly the
Glen Rose outcrops on the flanks of the modern valleys on the western side of Fort Hood. While a few of
these seeps and springs are perennial and may have discharges up to several hundred gallons per hour, the
majority are currently ephemeral seeps that are most active for a few weeks following major precipitation
events or have very minimal flow during dry periods. While all of the surface drainages on the high upland
surface are ephemeral, most of the larger tributaries crossing the intermediate upland are either intermittent
or perennial due to groundwater (base flow) discharge. For example, the average monthly stream flow for
September (1900–2003) was only 0.156 m3/sec and likely documents the contribution to Cowhouse Creek
by ground water recharge.
The highest stream discharges along the major tributaries occur during the late winter and early spring
in association with higher effective precipitation and lowered rates of evapotranspiration. Conversely, the
lowest discharges generally occur during the late summer (August) and fall, when there is a seasonal deficit
in ground water storage and lower amounts of precipitation. It is noteworthy that the highest discharge (in
excess of 3,115 m3/sec) was recorded in 1991, registering a volume that was more than 25 times higher than
the highest discharge (ca. 113 m3/sec) for the following year.

Rockshelter Soils
F. J. Vento
The mapped soils present in the immediate vicinity of the rockshelter are ascribable to the RealRock outcrop complex (12–40 percent slope) and Eckrant rock outcrop complex (1–3 percent slopes). The
Eckrant rock outcrop complex is present on the roof of the shelter and occurs along the flat upland divide.
Eckrant rock outcrop soils consist of very shallow well-drained, clayey soils on uplands. These soils have
formed in limestone. Slopes range 1–3 percent. Thickness of the sola and the depth to bedrock range 15–38
cm. Coarse rock fragments make up 35–70 percent of the pedon while the clay content ranges 40–55
percent. The soil is mildly to moderately alkaline. A typical pedon might contain an A horizon package up
to 12 inches thick, which is underlain by limestone bedrock. In some areas, where erosion has removed
the A horizon, bedrock is exposed at the ground surface. The Eckrant rock outcrop complex soil is well
drained, permeability is moderately slow and available water capacity is very low. Due to the steep slopes,
mass wasting processes (slopewash, creep, rock fall) are extremely active and erosion (primarily by rills)
is extensive in the study area.
The Real Rock outcrop complex soils consist of shallow, moderately steep to steep soils on areas of
outcropping rock on side slopes of uplands. The areas are generally long and narrow and are on hill slopes
10

or bluffs overlooking small rills or streams. The surface pedon of the Real soil is moderately alkaline,
dark brown gravelly to bouldery clay loam A1 horizon about 13 cm thick. Where present, the A2 horizon
consists of a moderately alkaline gravelly to bouldery clay loam. The thickness of the A2 horizon locally
varies due to erosion and mass wasting processes. The A2 horizon is underlain by bedrock.
The Real soil is well drained. Runoff is very rapid and permeability is moderate; available water
capacity is very low. The well-drained nature of the soil and low water capacity is due to the high secondary
permeability of most of the limestone units in the study area.

Modern Climate
F. J. Vento
Although the climate of Central Texas is considered humid subtropical, with its relatively hot summers
and mild winters, the region is considered marginal at best, lying as it does near the boundary between
humid subtropical and steppe (characterized by generally dry overall conditions). During the cool season
the region is influenced by continental components as the area lies well inland. Winds typically have a
northwesterly component. As such, the region can experience fairly dry and cold episodes. This regime may
be offset by southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico. During such times, the region may experience
a modified maritime component in the overall climate with generally warm and humid conditions. This
constant climatic tug of war keeps the general cool-season climate relatively mild.
Subfreezing temperatures occur for about 25 days per year in Austin. Such conditions are initiated by
infiltration of cold, dry Continental Polar air masses that stream into the region behind strong cold fronts
associated with mid-latitude (frontal) cyclones. These systems are usually strong enough to stem the flow of
Maritime Tropical (i.e., warm, moist) air masses emanating from the Gulf of Mexico. This is especially true
when jet stream activity follows a meridional (highly amplified) pattern across the continent. During such
flow regimes, the atmosphere transports huge quantities of mass latitudinally. Cold air flows equatorward
while warm air flows poleward. Mid-latitude cyclones result along the air mass boundaries with the strength
of the cyclone proportional to the latitudinal thermal gradient. The coldest temperature recorded at Austin,
for example, is -19°C, which occurred on 31 January 1949 (National Weather Service 2004). Due to the
region’s marginal geographic position, relatively warm winter temperatures may offset cooler periods. For
example, a temperature of 37°C was recorded at Austin on 21 February 1996.
Summers are characterized by generally hot conditions with high temperatures topping 32°C on ca.
80 percent of the days from June through August. Temperatures over 38°C are not uncommon due to the
mostly continental location. The highest temperature recorded at Austin is 44°C, which occurred on 5
September 2000. High humidity values are also fairly common, as the region is sufficiently close to the
Gulf of Mexico to experience generally high atmospheric water vapor totals. When very high temperatures
coincide with high humidity, the risk of heat-related illness and death increases. The persistence of warm
and humid summertime conditions can be offset by periods of generally cool and dry air. This situation
occurs when relatively weak cold fronts sweep through the region bringing cooler air from higher latitudes.
Precipitation is characterized by a relatively uneven distribution throughout the year. Small
precipitation peaks occur during the months of May and September. During May, precipitation is enhanced
by a higher frequency of frontal cyclones, which occur as the atmosphere becomes more active in equalizing
latitudinal thermal inequalities. The spring season is characterized by a relatively cold polar region and a
fairly warm low latitude region. Frontal cyclones redistribute excess energy both horizontally (latitudinally)
and vertically through the atmosphere. As such, frontal cyclone frequencies peak during the month of May
for this region. Fronts initiate cloud and precipitation-generating processes which contribute to precipitation
spikes in May.
The September precipitation peak is associated with increases in tropical activity. Most of the
precipitation generated from tropical activity derives from the prevalence of tropical disturbances generated
11

in the warm Gulf of Mexico waters. The occasional tropical storm or hurricane also increases precipitation
totals during late summer. The majority of precipitation though summer stems from individual airmass
thunderstorms. These small-scale systems form in relatively clear air when abundant heat and moisture is
present. Annual precipitation for Austin averages 81 cm, with extremes ranging between 29 cm in 1954 and
164 cm in 1919.
Climatic extremes may occur relative to even small-scale shifts in synoptic components. Most extremes
occur relative to jet stream positioning. Jet stream variability occurs from a variety of interacting processes
but most variability stems from fluctuations in semi-permanent pressure nodes. For North America, these
nodes are located over the central North Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia, and Florida.
Each of these nodes is “connected,” or more appropriately “teleconnected.” Variations in atmospheric mass
in one node lead to offsetting changes in each downstream node. The result of this Pacific/North American
teleconnections pattern governs overall jet flow characteristics.

Modern Flora
J. M. Campbell
Fort Hood lies near the southern limit of the North American Great Plains in a vegetation region
known variously as the Grand Prairie (Hill 1887 [cited in Diggs et al. 1999]), Cross Timbers and Prairies
(Hatch et al. 1990), Blackland Prairie (Mahler 1988), and Lampasas Cut Plain (Diggs et al. 1999). As noted
above, the Lampasas Cut Plain is located on the northeastern Edwards Plateau (Riskind and Diamond 1988)
and is considered a center of plant species endemism (Texas A&M Bioinformatics Working Group 1999).
Fort Hood (and North-Central Texas in general) lies in a zone of transition between regional climates, at
the point where the moister East Texas deciduous forest intergrades with the dryer grassland of the Great
Plains (Diggs et al.1999). Fort Hood is situated precisely at the point where relatively flat plains extending
from the east (the Blackland Prairie) change to a more topographically diverse region with elevated, mesalike, forested hills, broad grassland valleys, and deeply cut stream canyons (i.e., the Lampasas Cut Plain
proper). The resulting wide variety of microhabitats contributes to highly diverse vegetation features in the
area (Diggs et al. 1999).
Fort Hood’s plant communities have been mapped and classified (to the level of alliance) by the
Department of Defense National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS), using The Nature Conservancy’s
list of alliance and association types in the United States, and based upon remotely sensed data and field
verification in 20 m x 20 m sample plots. This effort has identified 23 different woody vegetation units at
Fort Hood, described in an online document that lists the major plant species found in each community.
This document also provides location references to the 37 major map grid areas (digital ortho quarter
quadrangles [DOQQs]) on Fort Hood where each vegetation unit is found (Department of Defense 1999).
The primary goal of the vegetation study conducted by the Mercyhurst University Biology Department
was to provide local, quantitative, plant community information for Rockshelter A to help define the
environmental context of the site and interpret archaeological findings. The study assumes that the modern
flora in and around Rockshelter A includes some of the same species and communities that were present
during prior periods of occupation by Native Americans. Specific objectives of field work conducted from
November 2003 through August 2004 were to: (1) determine species composition and community structure
of vegetation within and immediately surrounding the rockshelter, (2) characterize seasonal variations in
the local flora, and (3) compare plant community structure of the rockshelter area (situated near the top
of a wooded, north-facing slope at the head of a natural spring) to other similar wooded habitats in the
surrounding area. The findings were also intended to identify local plants that may have been utilized by
the people which inhabited the area.

12

Methods
Plant species composition of the wooded slopes and adjoining open areas in and near Rockshelter A
were assessed by informal walk-through surveys conducted during November 2003 and April, June, and
August 2004. Plants were identified using Diggs et al. (1999), Sanchez (2002), Tull and Miller (1999), Ajilvsgi
(1984), and Gould (1978). A quantitative analysis of vegetation within Rockshelter A (microtopographic
study) was carried out on 7 April 2004. Positions were first noted for all woody plants with stems or trunks
larger than 1 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) in the area downslope from the rockshelter rim. The
study area was divided into three microtopographic zones: east slope, west slope, and middle swale. A
stratified random sampling methodology was used to compare plant species populations among the three
zones, with a total of twenty 4 m2 plots distributed proportionally according to the size of the zones (seven
plots each on the east and west slope areas and six plots in the middle swale). Plant seedling count data from
the replicate sample plots were analyzed to determine the apparent patterns of spatial dispersion of some of
the more abundant taxa in relation to the water drainage feature that defines the site.
A more extensive quantitative analysis of vegetation in the vicinity of the rockshelter and surrounding
habitats (macrotopographic study) was conducted on 5–7 June 2004 utilizing students enrolled in a plant
ecology field course. Plant communities were assessed using line intercept sampling in five different loci:
(1) east facing slopes near the southern end of the mesa that contains the rockshelter, (2) west-facing slopes
in the same area, (3) north-facing slopes immediately surrounding Rockshelter A, (4) north-facing slopes
and upland flats west of Rockshelter A, and (5) riparian area on Shoal Creek north of the rockshelter (Figure
1.8). These areas were sampled to represent a variety of slope, aspect, moisture, and disturbance regimes
and to provide a basis for discerning distinctive botanical features of Rockshelter A in comparison to other
similar wooded habitats in the area.
Three replicate 50 m sample lines were established by tape measure in each area (except the Shoal
Creek riparian zone, where only two sample lines were used). Within each area besides the rockshelter, the
sample lines were spaced at least 100 m apart. In the rockshelter area, one 50 m sample line was established
ca. 5 m upslope from the rim of the rockshelter (extending parallel to it), and the other two lines were
sampled perpendicular to the first line, traversing the woods (down-slope) along the east and west sides of
the site.
Each individual plant with any part intersecting the imaginary vertical plane defined by the sample
line was identified, and its intercept length was recorded. This data allowed subsequent calculation of total
percent cover of each plant species in all vegetative strata (trees, shrubs, vines, and groundcovers) along
each sample line. Percent cover values for the replicate sample lines were then averaged by species for the
five sampled areas.

Results: Seasonal Variations and Occurrence of Geophytes
Herbaceous flowering plants were found in bloom in the study area during every visit to Fort Hood
(Table 1.1), although few species were found in November. The greatest variety was detected in April and
June, and included four taxa of geophytes: meadow garlic (Allium canadense var. canadense), tenpetal
thimbleweed (Anemone berlandieri), devil’s shoestring (Nolina lindheimeriana), and twistleaf yucca
(Yucca pallida). Geophytes are species that form underground storage organs which allow the plants to
survive adverse climate conditions in a dormant state. These plants are important in archaeological studies
in Central Texas because they were apparently utilized as food by prehistoric Native Americans (Acuna
2006; Texas Beyond History 2004; Thoms 2008). Several additional taxa were found in bloom in August,
including geophytes evening rainlily (Cooperia drummondii) and cusp blazing star (Liatris mucronata).
The highest total number of herbaceous plant species identified in June is partly attributed to sampling
bias, as the more intense observations were made concurrent with quantitative studies by the students
enrolled in the plant ecology field course. It is likely that many more species were present (and in bloom)
in August than indicated in Table 1.1.

Training Area 52.

Results: Microtopographic Variation within Rockshelter A
The data for smaller (1–4 cm DBH) trees and shrubs identified within the rockshelter area (Table
1.2) probably under-represents abundance of many taxa, since the underbrush on the site had been cleared
during the previous field season. Most of the counts for vines and trees and shrubs >10 cm tall in Table 1.3
represent stems regrown from cut stumps, with the exception of Buckley oak (Quercus buckleyi), which
appeared to benefit from site clearing via germination of acorns present in the surface litter. The larger
individuals of this species were well dispersed in the rockshelter area (see Table 1.2). Larger specimens of
Ashe’s juniper (Juniperus ashei) and Texas ash (Fraxinus texensis) were found on the east and west slopes,
but not in the middle (low) area.
In contrast,  osage orange (bois d’arc [Maclura pomifera]) occurred in a line along the lowest point of
the middle area, but was absent on east and west slopes. Single individuals each of Eve’s necklace (Sophora
affinis) and mescal bean (Texas mountain laurel [Sophora secundiflora]) were found, the latter occurring
nearly beneath the eastern rim of the rockshelter. Remarkably, no additional specimens of either of these
species were counted during subsequent, extensive vegetation sampling in the area.

Dead specimens.

Small seedlings of Carolina buckthorn (Frangula caroliniensis), the most abundant taxon encountered
in the 4 m2 plot sampling (see Table 1.3), showed a clumped distribution within the rockshelter area and
were significantly more abundant in sample plots within the lower middle swale (F = 4.192, P = 0.033
for a single-factor ANOVA performed on log-transformed count data). The higher density of buckthorn
seedlings in the middle swale of the site could be partly attributed to moister soil conditions in areas where

runoff drained during storm events. An alternative explanation may be that the seeds of Carolina buckthorn
(Frangula caroliniensis) were carried by runoff water and concentrated in the area where water moved
through the site. The first explanation (distribution attributed to soil moisture) seems less tenable when
considering the spatial dispersion of stickywilly (Galium aparine), an herbaceous plant that requires moist
soil conditions (Diggs et al. 1999). This plant also showed a clumped spatial dispersion within the site, but
showed lower average counts in plots within the middle swale than on the east and west slopes. This would
suggest that soil moisture available to support germination and growth of young seedlings was no better
in the lower part of the site than on the higher elevation slopes. An observation made by author Campbell
in November 2003—that empty land snail shells appeared to be more concentrated on the ground in the
middle swale of Rockshelter A—lends support to the suggestion that runoff water moving through the site
during storm events affects within-site dispersion of buoyant objects, including plant and animal debris.
Water drainage patterns in Rockshelter A therefore may be a significant microtopographic factor affecting
plant species distribution in this situation.

Results: Macrotopographic Variation
A total of 84 different species of plants were identified during the quantitative studies conducted in
June (Table 1.4). The east- and west-facing slopes on the southern end of the mesa that contains Rockshelter
A produced fewer different species of trees and shrubs than the habitats sampled on the mesa’s north
side. The dense forest-thicket on the perimeter of Rockshelter A presented a woody plant community that
17

was remarkably diverse compared to the other location sampled, including several trees and shrubs not
encountered at other sampled habitats.
Rockshelter A produced a poor diversity of groundcover species compared to other locations. This
was probably due to reduced light availability below the dense canopy of trees and shrubs. The Shoal Creek
riparian habitat produced a well-balanced mixture of plant species in the various vegetative strata, likely
due to a higher tree canopy, which allowed more light to penetrate to the ground layer.
Ashe’s juniper (Juniperus ashei) was the dominant tree at all locations sampled, and Buckley oak
(Quercus buckleyi) and Texas ash (Fraxinus texensi) were important secondary species. Green ash (Fraxinus
pensylvanica) and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) were additional secondary tree species found at the Shoal
Creek riparian habitat. Other tree and shrub species important at the moister Shoal Creek area that did
not occur at the other upland sites included sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), wingleaf soapberry (Sapindus
saponaria), and common hoptree (Ptelea trifoliata). Vines were present at all locations, with grape (Vitis
spp.), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and saw greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox) as the most frequently
occurring taxa.
The three locations which presented more open gaps in the tree/shrub canopy (east- and west-facing
slopes and north-facing slopes/flats) all had prominent representation of grasses and grass-like plants in the
groundcover stratum, with cedar sedge (Carex planostachys) and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha) as
the dominant species. Yellow puff (Neptunia lutea) was a frequently occurring herbaceous species in these
habitats. Noteworthy geophytes that were prominent in the dry, rocky soils on the east- and west-facing
slope areas were devil’s shoestring (Nolina lindheimeriana) and twistleaf yucca (Yucca pallida). Grassy
openings on the upland flats west of the rockshelter contained prominent patches of wildflowers such as
quinineweed (Centaureum beyrichii), golden tickseed (Coreopsis tinctoria) and upright prairie coneflower
(Ratibida columnaris).
The Shoal Creek riparian habitat produced distinctive moisture-loving groundcovers including Indian
woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), white avens (Geum canadense), and wild petunia (Ruellia nudiflora).
Topographic factors affecting moisture availability appear to be primary variables affecting plant community
composition in the sampled locations. Dryer conditions that were apparent on east and west-facing slopes
with more southerly exposure produced a more limited variety of woody species compared to areas on the
north side of the mesa, although one species—prairie sumac (Rhus lanceolata)—appeared to be favored in
the dryer situations. Many plant species appeared to have populations directly dependent on local moisture
sources (i.e., the various species mentioned above that were found only in the Shoal Creek riparian zone).
Distinctive vegetation found near man-made ponds in the area further corroborates this point. Black
willow (Salix nigra) and cottonwwod (Populus deltoides) were observed in November 2003 growing on
the margin of the pond located between Rockshelter A and Shoal Creek. Two wetland-adapted shrubs—
common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) and winged elm (Ulmus alata)—were observed during
the same period at another pond near the road east of the mesa containing the rockshelter. The occurrence
of several plants exclusively at Rockshelter A may be attributed to local moisture provided by the springs
which formed this feature.
Secondary variables likely affecting plant community composition in the sampled locations are
disturbances potentially caused by fire suppression, cultivation, grazing, and military training activities
(e.g., the creation of trails for tanks and other military vehicles). All of these disturbances affect the balance
between woody plants (trees and shrubs) and groundcover species (grasses and herbaceous taxa) and are
important factors influencing plant community diversity. Numerous trails which cross the mesa containing
the rockshelter were the most obvious disturbance that likely affected the areas sampled in this study,
allowing wildflowers and other groundcovers to maintain populations in open areas that might otherwise
be overtaken by trees and shrubs.

Grasses category consists of at least nine different species: Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), Carolina canarygrass (Phalaris caroliniana),
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), field brome(Bromus japonicas), prairie threeawn (Aristida oligantha), silver beardgrass (Bothriochloa laguroides),
Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha [dominant]), white tridens (Tridens albescens), and yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum).
Note: “P” indicates taxon was present.
a

Several of the aforementioned plant species produce edible fruits that may have been utilized as food
by people inhabiting the rockshelter site (e.g., Ashe’s juniper [Juniperus ashei], Buckley oak [Quercus
buckleyi], sugarberry [Celtis laevigata], and grape [Vitis spp.]). Evidence of human usage of these plants is
discussed in detail in Chapter 9.
The alien shrubs privet (Ligustrum sp.) and Formosa firethorn (Pyracantha koidzumii), both native to
Asia, are cultivated plants that apparently “escaped” to establish naturalized populations in the rockshelter
area; they may indicate that the site was disturbed by overgrazing in the past. The singular occurrence of
mescal bean (Sophora secundiflora) at the rockshelter may be a result of the plant having been brought and
used at the site by Native Americans, since this plant apparently had some ritual uses and is a powerful
psychotropic agent (Adovasio and Fry 1976; Diggs et al. 1999; Merrill, 1977). It could also be a natural
occurrence in this habitat, since this species is favored on rocky limestone slopes (Diggs et al. 1999).
Occurrence of osage orange (Maclura pomifera) at the rockshelter site could be related to former human
habitation, since the branches of this tree were used by prehistoric people for making bows (Schambach
2003).

Modern Fauna
F. J. Vento
The Fort Hood landscape is typical of the Edwards Plateau biotic zone as described by Blair (1950).
The Edwards Plateau is in the Balconian biotic province. In addition, Fort Hood contains a variety of
species from the Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, and Kansan biotic provinces. At present three
species are listed as threatended or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. These species include
the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) a winter resident of the region, the golden-cheeked warbler
(Dendroica chrysoparia), and the black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla).
Several major wildlife habitats exist in the Fort Hood region encompassing both aquatic and terrestrial
habitats. For ease of discussion, they are divided into aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The terrestrial habitats
are further divided into upland woodland (consisting mainly of juniper and oak scrub forest); deciduous or
riparian woodland (primarily in stream bottom, canyons, and other mesic areas with predominate flora of
live oak, elm, and hackberries); grassland and other open areas (where trees are few or absent); and urban
areas (where species diversity is low but populations are high). Species identified within these areas are
listed in Table 1.5.

The terrestrial wildlife habitats closely follow the vegetation communities discussed earlier. Deciduous
woodland areas contain the greatest density of passerine birds while grassland areas display the least dense
populations. White-tailed deer is an important game animal in Central Texas, and the herd at Fort Hood
has been subject to a managed sport harvest for much of the post-WWII era (Wolverton et al. 2007:548).
Wild Turkey, another important game species, is well established at Fort Hood and appears to be gradually
increasing in numbers. Small game populations appear to be healthy. Winter waterfowl populations remain
consistently low and erratic due to the absence of suitable habitat and distance from the major routes of the
Central Flyway.
Aquatic environments at Fort Hood include streams, springs, ponds, reservoirs and other water
environments. They include Belton Lake, Leon River, Cowhouse Creek, other streams and tributaries and
numerous ponds and springs (see Figure 1.7). The streams are generally intermittent and seasonal, however,
some form pools when not actually flowing. The ponds, streams and other aquatic habitats are important to
resident wildlife (see Table 1.5) and as a source of moisture for species in surrounding habitats. Fort Hood
also stocks nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the winter months of each year, but this
exotic species either is fished out by summer or dies off due to the summer heat.

Molluscan Fauna
J. M. Campbell, E. A. Weber, and M. J. Campbell-Weber
Shell materials originating from many different species of mollusks are commonly found during
archaeological investigations at Fort Hood. The two classes of mollusks which are most frequently recovered
24

at archaeological sites on the fort are Gastropoda (snails) and Bivalvia (clams or mussels). Occurrence
of mussel shells at archaeological sites remote from locations where the animals live (i.e., fresh water
habitats) can only be attributed to human transport. Prehistoric and historic uses of mussels by humans in
Texas have been extensively reviewed by Neck (1982) and Howells et al. (1996). Native Americans used
mussels primarily as food, and secondarily as ornaments and tools (Neck 1982). Caches of mussel shells
(likely remnants of prehistoric clam bakes) have been found at many prehistoric sites on Fort Hood (e.g.,
Abbott and Trierweiler 1995). The mussel species found in some of these situations are indicative of past
conditions of aquatic habitats on the fort, since some freshwater mussel species are known to have specific
habitat requirements (Howells et al. 1996).
Interpreting snail shells found at archaeological sites is more problematic, since snails occur naturally
in a wide variety of habitats (Allen and Cheatnrn 1960) and some species are apparently attracted to sites of
prehistoric human habitation, such as Fort Hood rockshelters (Carlson 1993a, 1993b). The archaeological
significance of snails in Central Texas, particularly in regard to human subsistence patterns, has been
reviewed by Baker (1993). Amino acid racemization analyses of snail shells have been extensively used at
Fort Hood for dating purposes (e.g., Ellis and Goodfriend 1994). In other archeological studies in Texas,
analysis of carbon ratios in snail shells has been used to make inferences regarding changes in vegetation and
climate (Goodfriend and Ellis 2000). Changes in snail community structure are known to be correlated with
variation in vegetation and climate (Magnin et al. 1995; Rousseau and Kukla 1994), although the practical
utility of this concept for archeological studies at Fort Hood have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. A shift
in snail community composition associated with change from grassland to wooded habitat has been noted
at site 41CV111 in eastern Fort Hood (Carlson 1997).
This section summarizes the results of molluscan studies conducted at Fort Hood by Mercyhurst
College biologists in conjunction with the MAI archaeological investigation of Rockshelter A. Specific
findings reported here include the results of a field survey of the modern molluscan fauna of Fort Hood,
coupled with a review of snail and mussel species data reported in prior archeological studies at the fort.

Molluscan Faunal Methods
Gravel bar features of the two largest streams in and near Fort Hood—Leon River and Cowhouse
Creek (two loci), as well as tributaries Owl Creek and Shoal Creek—were inspected in November 2003,
April 2004, June 2004, and August 2004 (Figure 1.9). Some of these inspections were conducted concurrent
with botanical surveys of the fort and assessment of alluvial deposits visible at cut-banks of the streams.
During each inspection, at least 100 m of the channel and lower banks were scrutinized for the presence
of live mussels or remnant shell material from dead animals. Mussels were identified using Howells et al.
(1996). Modern collection records and distribution data on mussel species known to occur in the Leon
and Brazos River basins were reviewed in Howells et al. (1996) and information distributed by the Texas
Mussel Watch (2012) program.
The snail fauna of Fort Hood in the general vicinity of rockshelter Rockshelter A was assessed by
collection of shells visible on the soil surface in the immediate area of the rockshelter site and adjacent
habitats in November 2003. Records were kept of live snails whenever they were opportunistically observed
during vegetation studies in and near the rockshelter site in April 2004, June 2004, and August 2004, and a
nocturnal search for live land snails in the rockshelter area was carried out in August 2004. For comparative
purposes, surface collections of land snail shells were also obtained from a forested canyon in the Shell
Mountains area and from an area of more open, prairie-savanna habitat on the north side of Cowhouse
Creek east of Old Georgetown Road. Shells representative of the modern snail community of the fort were
also collected from alluvial deposits along Cowhouse Creek (at Old Georgetown Road) in August 2004.
Snails were identified using keys in Burch (1962), Cheatum and Fullington (1971, 1973), Fullington and
Pratt (1974), and Peckarsky et al. (1960). The nomenclature utilized for Rabdotus species in this report
follows the recent convention in Perez and Cordeiro (2008).

Molluscan Faunal Results: Mussels
No evidence of modem populations of freshwater mussels was found in the few streams sampled,
except the Leon River at the Route 36 bridge crossing in Training Area 54 (Table 1.6). Many of the sampled
sites (other than the Leon River site) appeared to lack appropriate substrate supporting freshwater mussel
populations. We observed several extended reaches of stream channels that were scoured to bare bedrock.
The Owl Creek site had a firm clay bottom (also not favorable for most freshwater mussels). It is possible
that Fort Hood streams contain reaches with substrate materials more favorable for freshwater mussels
(mixtures of mud, sand, and gravel), but we did not observe such situations in our limited survey. The
recent mussel survey of Fort Hood by Zar Environmental (2011) confirmed our observation of the absence
of modern mussel populations in Fort Hood streams besides the Leon River. At the single site we sampled
on the Leon River, 11 of 15 unionid species previously documented (Howells et al. 1996) for the river were
identified (see Table 1.6). The species found at this site represent approximately half of the bivalve species
recorded for the Brazos River (which the Leon River flows into). The low total number of specimens
identified in the Mercyhurst study is attributed to the river’s inaccessibility for sampling in April and August
2004 due to high water levels. It is likely that more species are present in the river than our data represents,

which was verified by the four additional (rare) species found in the Leon River by Zara Environmental
(2011). The dominant species we found were yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres), smooth pimpleback
(Quadrula houstonensis), and fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis). The latter two species were also listed
among the top three species found in the Leon River by Zara Environmental (2011). Large numbers of
shells of the invasive sphaerid Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) were also observed on the gravel bar where
the native mussel shells were found. Shells representing an apparently well-established population of Asian
clams were observed at both sites sampled on Cowhouse Creek. The only indications of mussel populations
found along Cowhouse Creek were fragments of unionid shells recovered from cut bank exposures of
Holocene alluvium on the upper banks of the creek. Zara Environmental (2011) likewise found no mussels
in Cowhouse Creek.

Mussel species found in previous archeological studies of prehistoric sites along Cowhouse Creek (in
lower areas now inundated by Belton Lake) suggest that this stream supported a diverse freshwater mussel
community in the past (Table 1.7). A comparison of the mussels found at a prehistoric site along the Leon
River to the Cowhouse Creek fauna indicates three species distinctly associated with Cowhouse Creek
—Tampico pearlymussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis), Louisiana fatmucket (Lampsilis hydiana), and Texas
lilliput (Toxolasma texasensis). These species are all adapted to slowly moving or standing water habitats
with mud substrates (Howells et al. 1996), which would be conditions frequently present in an intermittent
stream system.
The Leon River drains an area over five times the size of the Cowhouse Creek watershed (USGS
2004a, 2004b). Modem Cowhouse Creek is considered an intermittent system (McCaleb 1985), while the
Leon River has more stable flow partly attributable to reservoirs established upstream of Fort Hood in the
early 1960s (Handbook of Texas Online 2002). The Leon River was rarely intermittent during the decade
of flow monitoring prior to 1960, with only two months (both in 1954) with zero average daily flow (USGS
2004a). Since 1960, only a single month (in 1984) was recorded with zero average daily flow. Cowhouse
Creek had zero average daily flow during 15 months distributed over five different years between 1951 and
1960 (USGS 2004b) and had 15 additional months with no flow in eight different years since 1960. The
most recent period of prolonged intermittency was in the fall of 1999 (USGS 2004b).
The dominant mussel taxon in both streams prehistorically was apparently threeridge mussel (see
Table 1.7), which is tolerant of low water quality and apparently able to “dig in during droughts and
endure dewatering” (Howells et al. 1996). This fact suggests that periodic intermittency was potentially an
important factor in the ecology of mussel faunas of both streams during the period when Native Americans
28

of the Fort Hood area were utilizing these populations. It is noteworthy that threeridge mussel (Ablema
plicata) appears to be a relatively minor component of the modem mussel community indicated for the
Leon River in the Mercyhurst sample (see Table 1.6), as confirmed by Zara Environmental (2011), and that
the two modern dominant species (yellow sandshell and fragile papershell) are both considered intolerant
of drought and dewatering.
The report of Texas pimpleback at a Leon River site in Table 1.7 (Mehalchick et al. 2003) should
perhaps be re-evaluated, since Howells et al. (1996) consider this species restricted to the Colorado and
Guadalupe River systems, well to the west of Fort Hood. Zara Environmental (2011) also does not include
Texas pimpleback on its list of mussel species potentially occurring at Fort Hood. Zara Environmental’s
(2011) finding of no modem mussel populations in Cowhouse Creek provides additional evidence that
these populations may have declined as a consequence of prehistoric or historical disturbances. Although
the shallower channel and intermittency would have made Cowhouse Creek more vulnerable to human
exploitation, Howells et al. (1996) indicated that mussel harvesting by Native Americans had no impact in
Texas waters.
Studies of fluvial responses to climate change in river systems east and west of the Leon River in Texas
have indicated reductions in the supply of sediment, floodplain abandonment, and increases in channel
incision due to more drought-prone climate during the last 1,000 years (Blum et al. 1994; Waters and Nordt
1995). Nordt (1992) noted similar circumstances affecting alluvial erosion and deposition processes at Fort
Hood during the last 700–800 years. Significant local, prehistoric degradation of substrate conditions due
to climatic factors could explain the occurrence of streams with scoured bedrock bottoms and a decline
of the Cowhouse Creek mussel fauna. Loss of mussel diversity attributable to human-induced substrate
degradation have been documented elsewhere (Watters 2000). Increasing drought severity alone could
contribute to the decline of mussel populations (Metcalf 1983 [cited in Howells et al. 1996]; Johnson et al.
2001).
Historical disturbances possibly contributing to the decline of mussels in Fort Hood streams include
reduction in base flow discharge due to excessive groundwater usage, lowering of the water table, and
cessation of flow of springs (e.g., Dibble and Briuer 1989; Skinner et al. 1984). Historic changes in land
use that altered vegetation via fire suppression and overgrazing (see Chapter 9) may have affected local
hydrology. It has been suggested that overgrowth of Ashe’s juniper (Juniperus ashei) may adversely affect
spring flow (Roemer et al. 1985). Springs are especially critical sources of water for mussel populations in
smaller streams during droughts (Johnson et al. 2001). The presence of invasive species such as Corbicula
fluminea can exacerbate adverse effects of drought on freshwater mussels (Johnson et al. 2001).
It is unknown whether the Leon River or Cowhouse Creek were sites of human exploitation of mussels
for pearls or the shell button industry. Species prominent among Fort Hood’s prehistoric and modern mussel
fauna (i.e., threeridge mussel [Ablema plicata] and Quadrula spp.) were apparently important in the Texas
shell button industry (Howells et al. 1996). Most Texas mussel populations did not supposedly suffer from
overharvesting during the Historic period (Howells et al. 1996).

Molluscan Faunal Results: Snails
Twenty different taxa of snails were detected in the survey of the modern gastropod fauna of Fort
Hood (Table 1.8). Eight species were found in the vicinity of the rockshelter, where the dominant species
were taxa typically associated with wooded habitats on the fort. The modern snail community detected on
the wooded slopes near two smaller rockshelters in Shell Mountain Canyon showed a similar prevalence of
woodland species. Of the two Rabdotus species found, whitewashed snail (Rabdotus dealbatus dealbatus)
is considered primarily a woodland species, while Prairie rabdotus is considered more of a grassland species
(Fullington and Pratt 1974). The collections made in the more open country near Cowhouse Creek along Old
Georgetown Road produced relatively more prairie mussel (Rabdotus mooreanus) than whitewashed snail.

Single live specimen observed at a site on Owl Creek near the eastern boundary of the fort.
Aquatic species.

The snail shells collected from alluvial deposits at the bridge over Cowhouse Creek on Old Georgetown
Road included a remarkable diversity of small species not detected elsewhere on the fort (see Table 1.8).
When surface collections of snails were made at rockshelter Rockshelter A in November 2003,
a distinct concentration of shells (composed of various species, including arboreal land snail (Oligyra
orbiculata,), whitewashed snail, and grassland liptooth (Polygyra morreana) was noted in the middle
(lowermost) portion of the area immediately below the rockshelter rim. Apparently the pattern of runoff
drainage through the site during precipitation events transported the buoyant snail shells overland and
deposited them onto the rockshelter talus slope. Although no dead snail shells were observed on the surface
within the rockshelter, runoff from storm events entering the rockshelter was documented, indicating the
possibility that water may carry snail shells into these features.
Live arboreal land snail were observed within the rockshelter in April 2004. Three specimens were
found attached to wooden stakes 8–10 cm above the surface. At the time of this observation, there was
water dripping from the middle of the rockshelter ledge, and the wooden stakes and floor of the shelter were
visibly moist. During vegetation sampling in June 2004, two additional live specimens of O. orbiculata
were observed on branches of young Buckley oak (Quercus buckleyi) trees approximately l.5–2 m above
the ground on the east side of the rockshelter area. A third live specimen was found during the same period
on a small tree below the rockshelter. On 25 August 2004, several live arboreal land snail specimens were
found at the rockshelter along the top of the ledge. All were resting on bare soil or rock in an inactive state
(with foot withdrawn and operculum covering aperture).
30

No live specimens of Rabdotus spp. were seen on any date in any location in or near the rockshelter
site, and none were found near Rockshelter A during a nocturnal search by three persons using flashlights
during August 2004. The only live specimen of Rabdotus found was on August 24, 2004, attached to
an exposed tree root hanging from a shaded vertical cliff along the banks of Cowhouse Creek near Old
Georgetown Road. The inactive animal was “cemented” to the root with a clear, membranous film of mucous.
It subsequently became active when placed in a plastic jar with wet Spahagnum moss. The captured snail
appeared to exhibit negative phototaxis; when its container was placed beneath a light, it moved into and
remained within the Sphagnum moss. When the jar was moved to a dark location away from the light, the
Rabdotus became active—moving to the top of the jar and underside of the lid. These observations confirm
prior reports that Rabdotus are cryptic and nocturnal (Fullington and Pratt 1974). The observations also
suggest the possibility that Rabdotus might naturally be attracted to the moist shady conditions presented
by rockshelter environments. Concentrations of Rabdotus in rockshelter sites at Fort Hood have previously
been attributed, among other reasons, to their preference for shaded areas (Carlson 1993a, 1993b).

Molluscan Fauna: Summary
The foregoing analysis of modem and prehistoric freshwater mussel communities of Fort Hood
indicates that certain species of mussels found at archeological sites in locations intermediate between the
Leon River and Cowhouse Creek may be indicators of foraging patterns of prehistoric people, since some
species appeared to occur primarily in one stream or the other. Mussels may also be potential indicators of
prehistoric changes in hydrological conditions of Fort Hood’s aquatic habitats. Two questions that need to
be addressed are whether or not freshwater mussel populations have been extirpated from Cowhouse Creek
west of West Range Road, and whether the loss (if verified) was related to climate associated hydrological
changes or historical disturbances.
Notable findings of Mercyhurst’s study of the modem snail fauna of Fort Hood include evidence
that natural phenomena can account for apparent concentrations of snails in rockshelters—water transport
of empty shells and shade seeking behavior of live animals. Also, field collection of Rabdotus spp.
shells confirming distinct habitat (vegetation) preferences by prairie mussel (prairie grasslands) versus
whitewashed snail within the fort suggests it may be possible to use these species as indicators of local
vegetation history at prehistoric sites where their shells are present throughout stratigraphic profiles. This
application of snail data from archeological sites will require careful consideration of the potential for shells
to be transported by water from upland areas with different vegetation characteristics than the local site of
interest.

2. Millennial-Scale Climatic Change and Human Adaptation in
Central Texas
David B. Madsen
The human occupation of Rockshelter A spanned only the last 4,000–5,000 years, yet this late
Holocene interval encompassed a number of major climatic episodes. As a result, understanding the nature
of the climatic cycles and the paleoenvironmental changes they engendered is critical to interpreting
the archaeological record at the site. In order to provide a context for understanding foraging strategies
and concomitant changes in material culture here and elsewhere on Fort Hood, I here review the
paleoenvironmental proxy records for Central Texas and surrounding regions. While the Rockshelter A
sequence spans only the latter third of this record, I consider the entire post-Pleistocene environmental
history, since the Fort Hood archaeological sequence as a whole spans virtually the entire period.
The prehistoric human foragers who occupied the Fort Hood region had to deal with two distinct but
interrelated types of environmental change. First, change in climatic conditions directly influences people
most obviously in terms of annual variation in the overall distribution of precipitation and temperatures, as
well as less obviously in terms of variation in seasonality. These variations in short-term weather patterns
affect the productivity of the resources utilized by foraging groups and, hence, alter a variety of behaviors
such as group size, mobility, storage, and choice of winter sites. Second, longer term climatic change more
indirectly, but more fundamentally, affects people by altering both the distribution and composition of the
resource base. Change in the basic environmental structure in which people live, and upon which annual
variations are imposed, alters the selective context in which people operate, and alters, on a permanent
basis, the behavioral strategies which are most successful. Recognition of how these two types of changes
modified the behavior of foragers through the 13,500 years of known human history in Central Texas is
critical in understanding how the material record of this behavior may best be interpreted. This is particularly
critical for this region since environmental changes were never ameliorated by adoption of agriculture. Here
I review the environmental history of the Southern Plains Periphery and attempt to identify critical periods
of change.
A number of similar reviews have been assembled previously (e.g., Blum et al. 1994; Boutton et al.
1998; Byrant and Holloway 1985; Caran and Baumgardner 1990; Collins and Bousman 1993; Collins et
al. 2003; Decker et al. 2000; Holliday 1995; Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Johnson and Goode 1994; Nordt
et al. 1994, 2002; Toomey et al. 1993), but the millennial-scale climate cycles described in these reviews
are all inductively derived from a variety of proxy data. As a result, they tend to be incomplete (since
the data on which they are based are not usually continuous), disharmonious (since their chronological
controls are often limited and/or have poor resolution), and occasionally contradictory (see Decker et al.
[2000] for an elaboration of these problems). This lack of clarity in turn makes it difficult to understand
the nature of cultural change in the Southern Plains Periphery. Here I take a different approach and use
the chronology defined in North Atlantic ice and deep sea core records to identify the timing of possible
millennial-scale climate cycles in the Central Texas region during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. I
then examine environmental climate proxy data within this temporal framework to identify critical climate
change events that most likely influenced human adaptation in the area. I have made no attempt to be
exhaustive in this synopsis, since details of the Central Texas regional record are available in the reviews
cited above. Rather, I focus on possible “trigger” events in the paleoenvironmental record that may have
influenced cultural change in the region.
33

Change in the variation of short-term climatic conditions (aside from the normal variance associated
with daily to inter-annual variability) occurs primarily in terms of change in volatility and equability.
Volatility is a measure of the year-to-year, decadal change in temperature and precipitation. Highly volatile
climates are those in which variations are extreme; less volatile climates are those in which short-term
variations are modest. The long-term average conditions are the same, but the range of variation differs
considerably. During the late Pleistocene and Holocene, climates have shifted between steady states of
relatively high and relatively low volatility. In many cases, these differing steady states have lasted for more
than a thousand years before shifting rapidly to alternative steady states.
Equability is a measure of the relative difference in the length and intensity of climate on a seasonal
basis. Highly equable climates are those in which there is relatively little difference in precipitation and,
particularly, temperatures between one season and another. Mediterranean and coastal climates are often
highly equable. Climates with low seasonal equability are characterized by warm summers and cold winters,
and/or wet and dry seasons. Average annual precipitation and temperatures for systems with high and low
equability may be similar, but their distribution is different. For human foragers, changes in equability alter
the way people are able to utilize a given resource base. For example, such changes may prolong or shorten
the growing season, or keep winter temperatures above freezing and allow the use of root crops and marsh
resources that may normally be frozen.
On the whole, changes in volatility and equability were limited throughout most of the Holocene, at
least in comparison to full-glacial conditions (e.g., Bond et al. 1997; Mayewski et al. 1997), and these kinds
of short-term climate changes likely had limited impact on human societies beyond that associated with
normal inter-annual variations in weather. The principal exception is the Younger Dryas, a period of dramatic
climate change about 10,900–10,000 14C years ago (ca. 12,800–11,500 cal yr BP). The Younger Dryas is
characterized by a return to near full-glacial conditions in general, but it is also marked by extreme climatic
variability on at least a decadal level (e.g., Mayewski et al. 1993; Stuiver et al. 1995; cf. Stauffer et al.
1998). As a result of this drastic change in climatic volatility, for the millennium or so of the Younger Dryas,
Central Texas foragers were being whip-sawed from one climatic extreme to another, often within periods
of less than a decade. The variance of these extremes is considerably greater than that of the Holocene;
indeed, the range of climatic variation from one decade to another was almost as great as the entire range of
variation for the late Wisconsin as a whole (Mayewski et al. 1993). Younger Dryas environmental conditions
also differed from climatic cycles that followed in seasonal equability (e.g., Zielinski and Mershon 1997).
During the Younger Dryas summers were cooler (resulting in reduced evaporation), but winters were no
colder and may even have been slightly warmer (see for example, Lyman 2008).
These features of the Younger Dryas had important implications for hunter-gatherers in the Southern
Plains Periphery. The climatic volatility means that the availability of ephemeral plants, such as grasses,
probably fluctuated in concert with the wildly fluctuating climatic conditions. Animal populations dependent
on these ephemeral taxa may also have been maintained at reduced levels (or restricted in distribution) since
episodes of drastic climatic change were followed by only limited recovery time. Mature individuals of
less-ephemeral plant species, such as nut trees, probably survived these rapid climate swings, but their seed
production likely varied substantially and immature individuals may not have survived. This variation in
environmental proxies of Younger Dryas climates probably resulted in the maintenance of relatively low
population densities, as early Central Texas foragers were repeatedly subjected to stress. The seasonal
equability of the Younger Dryas, on the other hand, may have prolonged the seasonal availability of food
resources and reduced the need for storage through the winter months.

Long-term Environmental Change
Climatic changes which are more fundamental, but more indirect in human terms, are those in which
averages of temperatures and precipitation change on relatively long scales. These often exceed scores
of generations, and, hence, represent climatic change that operates outside the corporate memory of any
34

foraging group. These changes are essentially permanent in terms of human lifetimes, and lead to changes
in the composition of plant and animal communities and in the distribution of other critical resources such
as water. While changes in volatility and equability are types of climatic change which obviously also lead
to change in the composition of the resource base, they do so in less-fundamental ways than do changes
in absolute temperatures and amount of available water, since the shorter term changes are imposed upon
these longer term variations in climate.
These long-term climatic changes are related most directly to changes in the relative distance between
the earth and the sun which varies with perturbations in the earth’s orbit and axis, and, hence, affects the
amount of solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface. These climatic changes operate on a number of
different scales ranging from ca. 20,000 years to 100,000 or more, and, depending on where the earth is in
each of these Milankovitch cycles, can reinforce or counteract each other. For late Quaternary climates, the
19,000- and 23,000-year precession cycles and the 41,000-year obliquity cycles are particularly important
(e.g., Grootes and Stuiver 1997). Most discussions of climate change in the Southern Plains Periphery are
based on these longer term cycles and, for the Holocene, focus on the nature of the “Hypsithermal” or
“Altithermal” warming associated with the current glacial cycle.
Shorter-term climatic cycles on millennial scales of about 6,100 (Bond cycles) and about 1,500 years
(Dansgaard-Oeschger [D-O] cycles) have also been recognized in proxy records from ice cores and from
cores taken from the ocean and larger continental lakes. As yet, it is not clear how these shorter term
cyclical variations may relate to the celestial mechanics which drive the longer cycles, although there is
some suggestion that they are caused primarily by variation in solar output itself (e.g., Björck et al. 2001;
Bond et al. 2001; Denton and Karlén 1973; Finkel and Nishiizumi 1997; Kodera 2002; Neff et al. 2001;
Rahmstorf 2003). However, there is no clear consensus currently, and a number of possible explanations for
the cause of these shorter cycles, particularly the D-O cycles, have been posited (e.g., Broecker 2003; Clark
et al. 1999; Clement et al. 2001; Keeling and Whorf 2000; McIntyre and Molfino 1996; Poore et al. 2003;
Rind and Overpeck 1993). In particular, there are large-scale climate changes correlated with stochastic
events such as volcanic eruptions and catastrophic floodwater outflows which reduced or enhanced the
underlying solar-based climate cycles (Magny and Bégeot 2004). Three such events, related to the sudden
collapse of proglacial Lake Agassiz, occurring about 12,850 14C yr BP, 9900 14C yr BP, and 7350 14C yr
BP (ca. 15,400 cal yr BP, 11,250 cal yr BP, and 8200 cal yr BP), fed large quantities of cold, fresh water
into the North Atlantic, temporarily shut down the ocean conveyor system that largely structures Northern
Hemisphere climates, and dramatically enhanced the scale of D-O cycles during these periods (Teller et al.
2002). The 8200 cal yr BP event is particularly evident in Central Texas (e.g., Ellwood and Gose 2006). A
number of other similar floodwater events occurred throughout the early Holocene, but were of a smaller
scale and had reduced impacts on climate.
Regardless of the cause, it is becoming increasingly clear that the transitions between the steadystate conditions that characterize these millennial-scale cycles are relatively abrupt, often on the order of
a decade or less, and certainly within the lifetime of an individual. In the North Atlantic, and apparently
throughout the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Benson et al. 2003; Bianchi and McCave 1999; Brown et al.
2000; Burns et al. 2003; Courty and Vallverdu 2001; Ding et al. 1998; Grafenstein et al. 1999; Gupta et al.
2003; Leuschner and Sirocko 2000; Nederbragt and Thurow 2005; Noren et al. 2002; Poore et al. 2003;
Schulz et al. 1999; Sirocko et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2003; Wilkins and Currey 1997 [but see Wunsch 2006
for an alternative view]), the D-O cycles are synchronous and take a characteristic form (Alley 1998). While
they range in duration from 1,000 to 2,000 years, they average about 1,500 years long (more precisely ca.
1,470 years long [Rahmstorf 2003]), and are initiated with a rapid rise in temperature in a matter of decades
(5–8° C during the glacial period and 1–3° C during the Holocene), gradually return to moderate conditions
over the course of ca. 1000 years, and end with a rapid return to very cold temperatures prior to the start
of a warming event which initiates a new cycle (Figure 2.1). Currently, nine cycles have been recognized
in these detailed core records during the 13,500 years of recorded human occupation on the southern

Plains (e.g., Bond et al. 1997). While it is becoming
evident that environmental change in Central Texas
is correlated with millennial-scale cycles evident
in the ice core records, all nine of the Holocene
cycles have yet to be recognized locally. This is
probably due to a combination of factors, such as the
relatively coarse nature of the local environmental
record and the presence of other, longer cycles which
may obscure local manifestation of millennial-scale
fluctuations. Most of the Holocene cycles will likely
become evident once detailed and sensitive records,
comparable to those from tree rings and lake
varves, are available for the entire period of human
occupation in Central Texas.

Other, even shorter, climatic cycles, such
as those associated with the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation,
which range in length from a few decades to several
centuries, are also evident in a variety of proxy records and may also be related to variation in solar output
(e.g., Berger and von Rad 2002; Chapman and Shackleton 2000; Clement et al. 2001; Gagan et al. 2004;
Grafenstein et al. 1999; Kunzendorf and Larsen 2002; Menking and Anderson 2003; Takahashi et al. 2003).
Unfortunately, these shorter cycles are within the range of variation of most radiocarbon dates, and records
of these events are difficult to correlate both with one another and with environmental and archaeological
changes. As a result, I focus here on the better defined and readily identified D-O cycles, although it is
important to recognize that some of the more intensive shorter-term cycles may underlie some changes in
human adaptation in the Southern Plains Periphery (see for example Hodell et al. 2001).

Human Response to Rapid Climate Change Events
The rapid and dramatic climate change events associated with the onset of each new D-O cycle
appear to have had an equally dramatic impact on human foragers. Certainly, biotic communities responded
rapidly to such events (e.g., Viau et al. 2002; Williams et al. 2002), and where human foraging is closely
linked to the composition, distribution, and density of these communities, cultural change too appears to
correlate with the initiation of each cycle (see for example, deMenocal 2001; Sandweiss et al. 2001).
Such a hypothesis is not simple environmental determinism, but rather is based on the assumption that
people are smart enough to get in out of the rain. It merely suggests that people tend to make optimal decisions
based on conditions at hand, and, when those conditions change, so too do the optimal choices people
make. Clearly, there is a correlation between the culture history classification schemes used for organizing
North American prehistory in the 1950s–1970s (e.g., Jennings 1968) and the ca. 1,500-year climate cycles
characteristic of the Holocene. Shifts from Clovis to Folsom to Late Paleoindian to Early Archaic, and so
on, are directly comparable to the environmental record (e.g., Gunn and Prewitt 1983). The problem for
anthropological archaeology comes in determining the kinds of human response to these changes that are
related to each event. Obviously these can be varied, ranging from technological innovation, to change in
mobility, change in group size, etc. These may, and undoubtedly do, vary from place to place and time to time,
but their synchronicity is due to the underlying rapid climate change events that fostered them. As a result,
in order to discern the nature of Holocene cultural changes in Central Texas it is necessary to understand
the environmental background against which they occurred. The chronology of the more complete and
chronologically well-controlled North Atlantic core records may most appropriately be used in defining
cycles of environmental change in the Central Texas area (Figure 2.2). There are, however, some slight
36

Figure 2.2. Percent of drift ice tracers derived from four North Atlantic marine
core records showing the approximate age of Holocene millennial-scale climate
cycles. The cycles represent episodic movement of cold polar surface water into
the North Atlantic. The cycles are also evident in Greenland ice core records.
(Sources: Bond et al. 2001; Porter and Zhou 2006).
chronological variations of 50 years or less between the marine and ice core records due to depositional
discontinuities and differences in chronological techniques. Perhaps more importantly, there appears to be a
lag in the response of vegetational communities to the climate change events recorded in the North Atlantic
records (Viau et al. 2002). While these response times are short, consistently less than 200 years and often
less than 100 years (Williams et al. 2002), there is a similar lag in response times in the North Atlantic
records, with the peak of drift ice indicators lagging cold peaks by a similar 1–2 centuries (Marshall and
Koutinik 2006). Since human response to climate change is likely filtered through biotic proxies, it is
probably most appropriate to use the chronology established for correlated vegetational changes across
North America to review environmental change in the Southern Plains Periphery. Here I employ the
chronology established by Viau et al. (2002) for significant discontinuities in the vegetational record, but
recalibrate the chronology to radiocarbon years using CalPal Online (Danzeglocke et al. 2007) for easy
comparison to the archaeological record (Table 2.1) (CalPal Online calibrations for radiocarbon to calendar
years and calendar to radiocarbon years are similarly provided in the following discussion.)
I should emphasize that these intervals represent discontinuities in vegetational records from across
the North American continent and are not indicators of

elsewhere. Due to limitations in the precision of the local

and I have grouped multiple cycles together into more

broadly defined periods in the following discussion.

It should also be noted that these changes might not all be due entirely to D-O cycles. In particular,
the ca. 7300 14C yr BP (ca. 8200 cal yr BP) discontinuity is at least partially due to flooding of the North
Atlantic by the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet damming glacial Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway (e.g.,
Barber et al. 1999), an event that may have masked or exacerbated solar-driven climate change. Further, as a
result of these fresh water impulses, the ocean and continental records are not always contemporaneous, as
can be noted by comparing the chronologies shown in Figure 2.2 and Table 2.1, although for the most part
they compare favorably. It is important to recognize as well that the periods between these discontinuities
represent cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature and precipitation regimes, and that stress on
human foraging populations was not uniform throughout the cycles. Some environmentally related cultural
changes are undoubtedly related to these intra-cycle climate fluctuations, but may not be as easily recognized
as those associated with the “triggers” that ended/initiated each major cycle.

Post-Pleistocene Environmental History and Human Adaptation
The Last Glacial Maximum and Deglaciation
(20,000–11,900 14C yr BP [24,000–13,800 cal yr BP], 11,900–10,850 14C yr [13,800–12,800 cal yr BP])
A brief discussion of environmental conditions in the Central Texas region during and immediately
after the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM] is warranted because it is becoming increasingly likely that people
first entered the North American continent sometime prior to 12,500 14C yr BP (14,800 cal yr BP) years ago
(e.g., Gilbert et al. 2008). While definitive evidence of such an early period of occupation in the region has
yet to be identified, it will likely ultimately date to after about 20,000 14C yr BP (ca. 24,000 cal yr BP [e.g.,
Madsen 2004]). Millennial-scale D-O cycles occur throughout the last glacial period and are much more
pronounced than during the Holocene (Mayewski et al. 1997), but are not distinguished here since there are
at present no known cultural change events which may be related to them.
The full-glacial period, from ca. 20,000–14,500 14C yr BP (ca. 24,000–17,600 cal yr BP), appears
to have been much like the Younger Dryas in terms of both increased volatility and seasonal equability
(e.g., Mayewski et al. 1993). Vegetation in the Central Texas region during this time period was thought
to be dominated by coniferous forests and woodlands (e.g., Bryant and Holloway 1985 [see also Bryant
and Shafer 1977]). Initially, this interpretation was supported by an analysis of noble gases in groundwater
(Stute et al. 1992), but reanalysis of the pollen sequences on which this original interpretation was based
and the analysis of new sequences from the region (Hall and Valastro 1995), as well as carbon isotope
ratios in the bones of grazing animals dating to this period (e.g. Koch et al. 2004 [see also Graham 1987;
Nordt et al. 2002]), do not support an interpretation of widespread forest during the full-glacial. Also, the
groundwater in question is now thought to date to the middle and later Holocene rather than to the LGM
(Castro et al. 2007). On the other hand, speleothems from the Central Texas region indicated the last glacial
interval was markedly wetter than any time during the Holocene (Musgrove et al. 2001).
In general, ecosystem response to climate change decreases from pole to equator and differences
between conditions during the LGM and the Holocene in the Southern Plains Periphery are not as dramatic
as those further north (e.g., Stute et al. 1995). Average annual temperatures may only have been ca. 5–6º C
cooler, and, although there was more effective moisture, the savanna mosaic of grasslands, woodlands, and
riverine gallery forests differed from the present primarily in the density of the vegetative cover (Bryant and
Holloway 1985; Bousman 1998; Koch et al. 2004; Nordt et al. 2002; Toomey et al. 1993,).
At the close of the full-glacial, ca. 12,500 14C yr BP (ca. 14,800 cal yr BP), global temperatures
increased rapidly during what is known as the Bølling-Allerød period in the North Atlantic (Bard et al.
1996), and sea levels rose ca. 20 m in less than 500 years (Weaver et al. 2003). In Central Texas, however,
some data indicated this deglaciaiton is marked by a period of cooler temperatures caused by a dramatic
increase in glacial meltwater flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, a subsequent reduction in sea surface

38

temperatures and salinity, and cooler climatic conditions on nearby land masses (Nordt et al. 2002; Poore
et al. 2003; Spero and Williams 1990). At Hall’s Cave on the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas, on the
other hand, magnetic susceptibility data indicate rapid warming beginning at the beginning of the deglacial
period about 12,200 14C yr BP (ca. 14,700 cal yr BP [Ellwood and Gose 2006]).
Unfortunately, paleoenvironmental data in the Central Texas area are limited for much of the deglacial
period, resulting in only broad characterizations of climatic conditions covering multiple D-O cycles over a
period of about 15,000 to 11,000 14C yr BP (ca. 18,300–12,900 cal yr BP [e.g., Toomey et al. 1993; Blum et
al. 1994; Nordt et al. 1994, 2002; Koch et al. 2004]). This seems to be only a result of the lack of sufficiently
detailed chronological records, as soil isotope data do reflect intervals of cooler than present conditions and
a reduction in C4 plant productivity corresponding to glacial meltwater events dating to about 15,000 and
12,000 14C yr BP (ca. 18,300 and 14,000 cal yr BP) (Nordt et al. 2002), and poorly dated Central Texas
pollen records also indicate some fluctuations between wetter and dryer conditions during the prolonged
deglacial phase (Bousman 1998; Decker et al. 2000).
Human foragers must certainly have been in the Southern Plains Periphery throughout most of the
Bølling-Allerød, and their apparent absence is likely due to changes in sedimentation and site preservation.
Given that people had reached South America by at least 12,500 14C yr BP (14,800 cal yr BP [Dillehay
1997]) and that a “Clovis” technology was well-developed and established in Central Texas by ca. 11,500
14
C yr BP (ca. 13,400 cal yr BP) at sites such as Wilson-Leonard and Aubrey, it seems plausible that if there
was a climatic “trigger” related to the development of Clovis, that trigger was likely the period of rapid
global warming and dramatic environmental change associated with the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød
climatic cycle rather than the subsequent Younger Dryas cycle as is still often proclaimed (e.g., Faught
2004).
The Bølling-Allerød climate cycle is marked by a number of meltwater events which resulted in
100 to 200-year periods of global cooling followed by returns to much warmer temperatures (Björck et al.
1996; Zielinski and Mershon 1997). One of these warmer periods dating to ca. 11,300–10,900 14C yr BP
(ca. 13,200–12,800 cal yr BP) immediately precedes the onset of the Younger Dryas and may be related to
what Haynes (1991) has referred to as the “Clovis drought” evident throughout much of the mid-western
and western United States. In the Great Basin, this interval is marked by a rapid drop in lake levels and a
massive fish die-off as waters became too warm and saline to support a fresh-water fish fauna (e.g., Madsen
et al. 2001). A similar dramatic pre-Younger Dryas lake recession is recorded in central New Mexico (e.g.,
Anderson et al. 2002), while in West Texas the period is marked by a reduction in speleothem growth (e.g.,
Polyak et al. 2004), and in the Texas Panhandle by dune accumulation in lake basins (Holliday et al. 2008;
Wood et al. 2002).
How this apparent “Clovis drought” is related to the ca. 11,900 14C yr BP (ca. 13,800 cal yr BP)
meltwater event recorded in the isotope data cited above is unclear. Most likely, it is merely a matter
of poor chronological controls and the relatively short duration of these events, with the cooling period
immediately preceding the drying trend in the climatic cycle. If so, the pre-Clovis/Clovis interval is marked
by a rather dramatic shift in environmental conditions and may help explain the relatively sudden continentwide appearance of Clovis technology.
On the other hand, climatic interpretations for the Southern Plains Periphery during much of the
Pleistocene-Holocene transition are characterized by a number of apparent contradictions that have yet to
be resolved and this may be one of those issues. Moreover, some evidence from the Southern High Plains
suggests the Clovis period may have been wetter than the subsequent Younger Dryas (Holliday 2000), so
the issue is not fully settled.

39

The Pleistocene/Holocene Transition
(10,850–9950 14C yr BP [12,800–11,300 cal yr BP])
The Younger Dryas is one of these cycles for which seemingly contradictory interpretations have been
posited. For the most part, the Younger Dryas is widely recognized as a return to near full glacial conditions,
triggered by a massive flood of cold, fresh Lake Agassiz water into the North Atlantic (e.g., Mayewski et
al. 1993; Teller et al. 2002). Temperatures were reduced as much as 15° C below that for the subsequent
period (near Greenland [Taylor et al. 1997]), although certainly the temperature differential was not as
great further south in mid-continental locations such as Central Texas. These cooler temperatures fostered
a reduction in evapotranspiration rates along with increased precipitation in at least some areas. However,
temperature estimates derived from the stable isotope composition of buried soils in the central Great Plains
suggest this temperature reduction was not uniform across the Younger Dryas, with July temperatures
3–4º C below normal between ca. 11,500–11,300 14C yr BP (ca. 13,400–13,200 cal yr BP) and again at ca.
10,700–10,400 14C yr BP (ca. 12,700–12,300 cal yr BP [Nordt et al. 2007]). July temperatures were near
normal ca. 11,000–10,700 14C yr BP (ca. 12,900–12,700 cal yr BP) and again ca. 10,400–10,000 14C yr BP
(ca. 12,300–11,500 cal yr BP). Closed-basin lakes across western North America rebounded to highs that
would not be seen again throughout the Holocene (e.g., Benson et al. 1992), a pattern also evident in the few
available lake records from the western margin of the Southern Plains Periphery (e.g., Anderson et al. 2002;
Longford 2003; Wilkins and Currey 1997). In addition to these temperature and precipitation changes,
there was, as noted above, a return to a high degree of annual to decadal variation and to relative seasonal
equability (e.g., Mayewski et al. 1993; Stuiver et al. 1995; Zielinski and Mershon 1997).
This apparent uniformity in proxy records from across much of North America is not reflected in
similar records from the Southern Plains Periphery, where no consensus exists about the nature of Younger
Dryas environments. Holliday (2000) takes exception to previous studies suggesting a cooler moister
Younger Dryas in the region and marshals an array of geomorphological and stable isotope data to suggest
that much of the period from at least ca. 10,900–10,200 14C yr BP (ca. 12,800–11,900 cal yr BP) was
drier than the preceding climate cycle, albeit with fluctuation in those conditions (see also Humphrey and
Ferring 1994). Holliday elaborates on this record in subsequent work (Holliday et al. 2008), suggesting a
period of Younger Dryas aridity is limited to around 10,700 14C yr BP (ca. 12,700 cal yr BP), with moister
conditions on playa floors throughout most of the period from ca. 12,000–10,500 14C yr BP (ca. 14,000–
11,500 cal yr BP). Holliday et al. (2008), also suggest the playa record indicates a cooling episode ranging
ca. 11,400–11,200 14C yr BP (ca. 13,300–13,100 cal yr BP). Other data, such as those derived from faunal
data at Hall’s Cave (Toomey et al. 1993), from cave speleothems in the Guadalupe Mountains (Polyak et al.
2004), from Central Texas (Musgrove et al. 2001), from snail data at the Folsom site in eastern New Mexico
(Balakrisnan et al. 2005), and from fish fauna at Lubbock Lake (Johnson and Hill 2008) continue to suggest
the Younger Dryas was wetter and possibly cooler.
There are a number of possible explanations for these apparently conflicting interpretations (other than
that one of them is simply wrong). First, it may be a problem of chronological resolution. The Younger Dryas
both begins and ends within a decade or less (Mayewski et al. 1993). Since this is beyond the resolution of
current radiometric techniques, many of the proxy records on which these varying interpretations are based
may not correspond to one another at all. While this is a problem common to all century- to millennial-scale
climate cycles, it is particularly exacerbated during the Younger Dryas due to the presence of a radiocarbon
plateau during the interval (e.g., Goslar et al. 1999). As a result of this plateau, even a radiocarbon date with
a relatively small standard deviation may be correlated to a calendrical interval 5–600 years long. Since
the Younger Dryas itself is little more than 1,000 calendar years long, dating environmental proxies to this
period is particularly difficult.
Second, the effects of the Younger Dryas worldwide were not uniform. Such variation is to be
expected, since synoptic weather patterns were changed dramatically, and it may be that despite efforts to
40

model regional climates at the time (e.g., COHMAP 1988), the position of the jet stream may have been
such that parts of the Southern Plains Periphery were wet and others dry. A related issue is that specific
regional conditions may have differentially affected local environments. Nordt et al. (2002), for example,
suggest that as glacial meltwater was diverted from the Mississippi River during this period (Spero and
Williams 1990) continental areas adjacent the Gulf of Mexico were warmer than normal. How far north and
west these effects were felt is unknown. In contrast, it is also unknown how far south the cooler Younger
Dryas temperatures suggested by the central Great Plains soil records extended. As a result, the Central
Texas area may have been differentially impacted by both temperature regimes at different times during the
Younger Dryas.
Third, despite the relatively short length of the Younger Dryas, it was like other D-O cycles, with
change occurring throughout the period. For example, lakes in both the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada
reflect a wet-dry-wet sequence during the Younger Dryas interval (e.g., Oviatt et al. 2005), similar to the
playa record found on the Southern Plains (Holliday et al 2008). It may be that at least some of these
apparently conflicting records simply represent different parts of this cycle. Whatever explanation or
combination of explanations may ultimately resolve the issue, it is clear that the Younger Dryas was a
period of rapid and dramatic climate change that had a significant impact on regional biotic communities
and the human foragers dependent on them.

The Early Holocene
(9950–9200 14C yr BP [11,300–10,300 cal yr BP], 9200–8350 14C yr BP [10,300–9400 cal yr BP], and 8350–
7300 14C yr BP [9400–8200 cal yr BP])
Environmental proxy records for the Southern Plains Periphery are not well controlled for the early
Holocene and there is little evidence for the impact of millennial-scale climate cycles on regional biota.
Most summaries of extant data simply describe the period ganging ca. 10,000–7300 14C yr BP (ca. 12,500–
8200 cal yr BP) as “transitional” with wetter than normal conditions gradually becoming dryer until midHolocene “Altithermal” conditions are finally reached (e.g., Collins 1995; Collins et al. 2003; Decker et
al. 2000; Mear 1998; Nordt et al. 1994; Toomey et al. 1993). However, such generalized reconstructions
seem to be due more to a paucity of data than to actual conditions, as an array of data from outside the
region and a limited number of records from within the area suggest more variance throughout the early
Holocene. Unfortunately, what regional data are available for millennial-scale climate change events again
often appear contradictory (e.g., Ellis et al. 1995; Decker et al. 2000), due most likely to poor chronological
controls.
Ice core data indicate the Younger Dryas ended abruptly 11,660 cal yr BP (ca. 10,090 14C yr BP)
with temperatures near the Greenland ice cores warming 7–8° C in less than 40 years and rising more
gradually another 7–8° C over the course of the next ca. 1,500 years during what is called the “Preboreal”
in the European climate sequence (Taylor et al. 1997). A similar pattern is generally reflected in most
environmental proxies from the Southern Plains Periphery, although chronological controls for the Younger
Dryas to middle Holocene period are extremely poor for most records (e.g., Holliday 2000; Nordt et al.
1994; Toomey et al. 1993). Nordt et al. (2007), however, suggest central Great Plains soil data indicate
summer temperatures were as much as 1–2 ºC cooler from ca. 10,000–9000 14C yr BP (ca. 11,500–10,200
cal yr BP), only reaching modern normal levels ca. 7000 14C yr BP (ca. 7800 cal yr BP). Similarly, plant
macrofossils from woodrat middens in the Trans-Pecos area of West Texas indicate a sagebrush steppe,
characterized by cooler than modern temperatures and now only found north of the Colorado/New Mexico
border region, extended as far south as the El Paso area until at least ca. 7100 14C yr BP (ca. 7950 cal yr BP)
(Hall and Riskind 2009).
A similar pattern of precipitation change is reflected in Guadalupe Mountain speleothems, whose
growth (a product of relatively wet conditions) slowed after the Younger Dryas and ceased by ca. 9300 14C
yr BP (ca. 10,500 cal yr BP) (Polyak et al. 2004). This is in accord with an array of biotic and lacustrine
41

records from western North America suggesting the Pre-boreal was both cooler (by ca. 1–3˚ C) and moister
than at present, albeit much warmer and dryer than the preceding Younger Dryas (e.g., Grayson 1998;
Madsen et al. 2001; Wigand and Rhode 2002; Oviatt et al. 2003). Here again there is some apparent conflict
in climatic interpretations for the period, as palynological data from Central Texas (e.g., Bousman 1998)
indicate that while conditions were cooler than normal, they were also dryer, at least for the initial portion
of these cycles. Bousman suggests this may be the result of glacial meltwater being diverted down the
Mississippi River by a Younger Dryas glacial readvance 10,000–9000 14C yr BP (ca. 11,500–10,200 cal yr
BP). If so, the region of dryer than normal conditions may be restricted to those areas of the Southern Plains
Periphery most directly affected by Gulf of Mexico surface water temperatures. Certainly, Holliday (2000),
based on diatom data (especially Winsborough 1995), suggests conditions were moister sometime between
ca. 10,500–9500 14C yr BP (ca. 12,500–10,700 cal yr BP).
Changes in foraminifera in Gulf of Mexico cores (Poore et al. 2003), geomorphic data marshaled by
Holliday (2000), pollen data summarized by Bousman (1998), and magnetic susceptibility data described
by Hudler (2000) all suggest available moisture fluctuated on millennial-to-century climatic scales over
the course of the early Holocene. Unfortunately, these records are difficult to compare due to limited
chronological controls. The magnetic susceptibility record from Camp Bullis Cave suggests wetter than
normal conditions ca. 9800–9200 14C yr BP (ca. 11,200–10,300 cal yr BP), dryer conditions ca. 9200–8300
14
C yr BP (ca. 10,300–9300 cal yr BP), and increased moisture ca. 8300–7100 14C yr BP (ca. 9300–7950
cal yr BP [Collins et al. 2003; Hudler 2000]). Pollen from Boriak and Weakly bogs suggests conditions
were wetter than normal ca. 10,500–9400 14C yr BP (ca. 12,500–10,600 cal yr BP), dryer than normal ca.
9400–8800 14C yr BP (10,600–9800 cal yr BP), and experienced increased moisture ca. 8800–7800 14C yr
BP (ca. 9800–8600 cal yr BP). Faunal data from Hall’s Cave also suggest episodic fluctuations in available
moisture imposed on a general early Holocene drying trend (Toomey et al. 1993). These various proxies
appear to be recording the same climatic cycles, but how they are related and the specific timing involved in
changes from one cycle to the next is very unclear and must await more fine-grained temporal controls. The
chronology of changes in Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures does compare favorably with the North
Atlantic drift ice sequence (see Figure 2.2), and it is likely that all these records are temporally compatible.
Cycles of alluviation/soil formation become important proxy records during the early Holocene, but
none of these cycles are well dated. In some cases this is because of the poor quality of the dates rather
than the limited number. For example, one cycle, represented by deposition of the Georgetown Alluvium
and formation of the Royalty Soil, is associated with an array of dates on soil humates and gastropods, but
can only be placed within a general time frame of ca. 11,500–8000 14C yr BP (ca. 13,400–8900 cal yr BP)
(Nordt 1992, 2004; Nordt et al. 1994). Waters and Nordt (1995) date what may be an equivalent soil in the
Brazos River floodplain to about 8400 14C yr BP (ca. 9400 cal yr BP). Fredlund et al. (1998) also report
an early Holocene paleosol associated with phytoliths suggesting greater precipitation than at present, but
again the deposition is poorly controlled chronologically (see also Lintz 1993). An equally difficult issue is
the determination of exactly what these cycles of channel formation and landscape stability represent, since
arguments can be marshaled that one or both can represent either similar or dramatically different climatic
conditions (see discussion in Mear 1998, for example; see also Nordt 1992). Generally in Central Texas,
periods of alluviation and soil formation are thought to represent cooler/moister conditions, with channel
down-cutting associated with periods of increased warmth and aridity (but see Blum et al. 1994). Mear
(1998), however, suggests that at least one mid-Holocene channel cutting event is associated with a shift to
a cooler/wetter climate, and Humphrey and Ferring (1994) suggest pedogenesis is associated with reduced
alluviation, so, until these alluvial cycles can be more firmly controlled chronologically and matched to
other climate proxies, they are of limited utility.
The end of the early Holocene is marked by the last flush of Lake Agassiz water into the North
Atlantic ca. 7500–7300 14C yr BP (ca. 8400–8200 cal yr BP). In the North Atlantic and continental localities
around its periphery, the event is characterized by one of the most abrupt and widespread cold events
42

in the entire Holocene, although this cold event was superimposed on a more prolonged cooler period
likely related to solar output (Rohling and Pälike 2005). The cool cycle dates ca. 7800–7200 14C yr BP
(ca. 8600–8000 cal yr BP), but the superimposed cold event was initiated by the catastrophic drainage of
glacially dammed Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway ca. 8470 cal yr BP (ca. 7700 14C yr BP [Barber et al. 1999]).
Temperatures were reduced 4–8° C near the Greenland ice cores and 1.5–3° C on continental locations.
While the 8200 cal yr BP event is widely recognized throughout the northern hemisphere (e.g., Baldini et
al. [2002] and references therein), its local effects were not a uniform, with some areas becoming warmer
rather than cooler. Such may be the case in Central Texas where the event is characterized by dramatic
warming reflected in the magnetic susceptibility record at Hall’s Cave (Ellwood and Gose 2006). Outside
the region, on the northwestern Plains, stable isotopes in bison bone record the event as a short wet-warm
interval (Lovvorn et al. 2001). Given the severity of the event in comparison to the rest of the Holocene
record, it is likely that this 8200 cal yr BP event represents one of the climatic “triggers” that altered the
Central Texas archaeological record.

The Middle Holocene
(7300–5800 14C yr BP [8200–6600 cal yr BP] and 5800–4750 14C yr BP [6600–5500 cal yr BP])
Most compilations of environmental proxies for the period suggest dryer conditions corresponding
to the start of a prolonged mid-Holocene warm period commonly referred to as the Altithermal or
Hypsithermal (e.g., Collins 1995; Collins et al. 2003; Holliday 1989, 2000; Mear 1998). The mid-Holocene
is often characterized as uniformly warm and dry (e.g., Holliday 2000), with phytolith data from the rolling
plains of North Central Texas suggesting that conditions were as much as 3º C warmer than at present and
that annual precipitation decreased 5 cm or more (Fredlund et al. 1998). Central Plains soil data similarly
suggests summer temperatures were as much as 1º C warmer than modern normals during ca. 6500–4300
14
C yr BP (ca. 7400–4900 cal yr BP) (Nordt et al. 2007). Isotope data from the Aubrey site indicated
increasing dryness from ca. 8000–6000 14C yr BP (ca. 8900–6800 cal yr BP) and very dry conditions ca.
6000–4000 14C yr BP (ca. 6800–4500 cal yr BP [Humphrey and Ferring 1994]). Holliday et al. (2008)
suggest a prolonged period of limited playa filling ca. 9000–4000 14C yr BP (ca. 10,200–4500 cal yr BP),
indicating uninterrupted mid-Holocene aridity. Hall (1990) recognizes a period of entrenching in eight Texas
river systems ca. 7000–5000 14C yr BP (ca. 7800–5700 cal yr BP), and Lintz (1993) similarly summarizes
a variety of geomorphic evidence to suggest severely dry conditions between ca. 7000–4000 14C yr BP (ca.
7800–4500 cal yr BP). A period of renewed dune construction at Prairie Mounds on the Texas/Louisiana
border dates to ca. 6300–5200 14C yr BP (ca. 7200–6000 cal yr BP). Waters and Nordt (1995) contend a
dramatic shift to reduced flow in the Brazos River occurred much earlier, about 8400 14C yr BP (ca. 9400 cal
yr BP), and was associated with a change from lateral accretion characteristic of the period ca. 18,000–8400
14
C yr BP (ca. 21,700–9400 cal yr BP) to vertical accretion thereafter.
A number of other data sources, however, suggest a two-phase mid-Holocene dry interval separated
by a brief period of increasing moisture. In the Central Texas region, there are some suggestions of a brief
interval of moister conditions, however, characterized by the presence of travertine deposits in the Hall’s
Cave depositional sequence (Toomey 1993) and a spike in arboreal pollen at Boriack Bog (Bousman 1998).
Poor dating controls for both these intervals makes a correlation with a mid-Holocene event problematic.
However, that is an interpretation favored by Collins (1995). Bousman (1998) identifies two dry periods
between ca. 7800–6400 14C yr BP (ca. 8600–7300 cal yr BP) and ca. 5800–4200 14C yr BP (ca. 6600–4800
cal yr BP) in the Boriack and Weakley bog records bracketing a period of increased moisture. A similar
increase in arboreal pollen relative to grasses at Patschke bog dating to ca. 6000–5500 14C yr BP (ca. 6800–
6300 cal yr BP) likely also represents a period of increased moisture availability (Nickels and Mauldin
2001). The magnetic susceptibility record from Camp Bullis Cave suggests increasing dryness after ca.
7300 14C yr BP (ca. 8200 cal yr BP), a peak about 6800 14C yr BP (ca. 7600 cal yr BP), a gradual return to
the Holocene average moisture conditions by ca. 5400 14C yr BP (ca. 6200 cal yr BP), and an abrupt shift
43

to very dry conditions between ca. 5400–4700 14C yr BP (ca. 6200–5400 cal yr BP) (Hudler 2000). Stable
isotopes in Fort Hood alluvium also reflect a two-phase Altithermal separated by a brief moist interval,
with the driest interval dating to ca. 6000–5000 14C yr BP (6800–5700 cal yr BP [Nordt 2004; Nordt et al.
1994]). At Lubbock Lake (Holliday 1985), there is a peak of dryer conditions ca. 6300–5500 14C yr BP (ca.
7200–6300 cal yr BP), a second peak at ca. 5000–4500 14C yr BP (ca. 5700–5200 cal yr BP), and a brief
moist interval separating the two. At Double Lake, also near Lubbock, core data indicate two periods of
aridity ca. 6500 14C yr BP (ca. 7400 cal yr BP) and again at ca. 4900 14C yr BP (ca. 5600 cal yr BP). Further
to the west, two periods of lake desiccation in the Estancia basin dating ca. 7000–5400 14C yr BP (ca. 7800–
6200 cal yr BP) bracket a return of water to the basin floor (Menking and Anderson 2003). This moist and
possibly cooler mid-Holocene interval may correlate with the North Atlantic (Bond et al. 2001) and Gulf of
Mexico (Poore et al. 2003) sea surface temperature records suggesting cooler temperatures ca. 6000–5000
14
C yr BP (ca. 6800–5700 cal yr BP). However, no such interval is recorded in the magnetic susceptibility
curve for Hall’s Cave (Ellwood and Gose 2006).
Altogether, these data suggest multiple millennial-scale climate cycles spanning the mid-Holocene
are recorded in Southern Plains Periphery environmental proxies. However, as the variation in dates listed
above clearly indicates, chronological controls for these events are rather weak, and exactly where these
cycles are placed chronologically is a matter of conjecture. If these cycles are related to the D-O cycles
reflected in both ice core and continental vegetational records, as is most likely, then it is possible the brief
mid-Holocene moist interval recognized in many records is related to the rapid shift from one D-O cycle to
another at ca. 5800 14C yr BP (6600 cal yr BP).

The Late Holocene
(4750–3700 14C yr BP [5500–4050 cal yr BP], 3700–2700 14C yr BP [4050–2800 cal yr BP], 2700–1650 14C yr
BP [2800–1550 cal yr BP], 1650–675 14C yr BP [1550–650 cal yr BP], and 675 14C yr BP [650 cal yr BP] to
Present )
Proxy evidence of millennial-scale climate cycles in the Southern Plains Periphery is much clearer for
the late Holocene, although here again variation in dating of these events makes it difficult to be precise in
correlating them with D-O cycles recognized elsewhere. A variety of records suggest a return to wetter and
cooler conditions at the beginning period, a time that corresponds to what is called the Neoglacial interval
in the Rocky Mountains (Davis 1988). At Hinds Cave, along the lower Pecos River, carbon isotope data
derived from snail shells suggest relatively moist conditions at the beginning of the record ca. 4800 14C yr
BP (ca. 5500 cal yr BP [Goodfriend and Ellis 2000]). The magnetic susceptibility record from Hall’s Cave
(Ellwood and Gose 2006) reflects a ca. 300 year period centered about 3900 14C yr BP (ca. 4400 cal yr
BP) that was warm, but with increased rainfall. The Southern Plains playa sequence (Holliday et al. 2008)
reflects playa filling from ca. 4000–2000 14C yr BP (ca. 4500–2000 cal yr BP). At Boriack and Weakley
bogs, Bousman (1998) suggests conditions get increasingly wetter after ca. 5000 14C yr BP (ca. 5700 cal yr
BP), as arboreal pollen increases. This increase in available moisture peaks ca. 3200 14C yr BP (ca. 3400
cal yr BP), with relatively dry intervals at ca. 3200–2500 and ca. 2000–1200 14C yr BP (ca. 3400–2600 and
2000–1200 cal yr BP) bracketing another moist interval at ca. 2500–2000 14C yr BP (ca. 2600–2000 cal
yr BP). The Patschke bog pollen record similarly reflects a modest increase in arboreal pollen, interpreted
to indicate increased moisture, at ca. 4000 14C yr BP (4500 cal yr BP), followed by maximum Holocene
aridity ca. 3200 14C yr BP (ca. 3400 cal yr BP), and increased precipitation ca. 3100–1500 14C yr BP
(ca. 3300–1400 cal yr BP). Mites in stalagmites in the Guadalupe Mountains suggest increased moisture
between ca. 3000–700 14C yr BP (ca. 3200–800 cal BP [Polyak et al. 2001]). The Hinds Cave snail record
similarly indicates increased aridity reached a late Holocene maximum ca. 3300 14C yr BP (ca. 3500 cal
yr BP), followed by increased moisture throughout the remainder of the Holocene (Goodfriend and Ellis
2000). Strontium isotopes records from Hall’s Cave (Cooke et al. 2003) suggest a prolonged period of soil
erosion ended about 4400 14C yr BP (ca. 5000 cal yr BP), but the record is otherwise of limited sensitivity.
44

A neopluvial period dating to about 3400 14C yr BP (ca. 3700 cal yr BP) is also evident in dune and
alluvial sequences in the Guadalupe Mountains (Wilkens and Currey 1997). Pollen data from Bonfire Shelter
suggest wetter, but warmer, conditions after ca. 2600 14C yr BP (ca. 2700 cal yr BP [Bryant 1977; Bryant
and Holloway 1985]). Faunal and pollen data from Hall’s Cave indicate relatively dry conditions continued
until ca. 2500 14C yr BP (ca. 2600 cal yr BP), a return to increased precipitation between ca. 2500–1000 14C
yr BP (ca. 2600–930 cal yr BP), and the establishment of relatively modern conditions thereafter (Toomey
1993; Toomey et al. 1993). The dune record from Prairie Mounds on the Texas/Louisiana border (Otvos
2004) also shows a period of aeolian activity, and presumably increased aridity, dating ca. 3200–2650
14
C yr BP (ca. 3400–2800 cal yr BP) and again ca. 1600–700 14C yr BP (ca. 1700–700 cal yr BP), with
dune stability related to increased moisture between the two. Increased dune activity centered about 2000
14
C yr BP (ca. 2000 cal yr BP) is also recorded in sand sheets along the Texas Gulf Coast (Forman et al.
2009). Humphrey and Ferring (1994) suggest isotope data from the Aubrey site indicate continued very
dry conditions to ca. 4000 14C yr BP ca. (4500 cal yr BP), increasing moisture ca. 4000–3000 14C yr BP
(4500–3200 cal yr BP), a peak in annual precipitation ca. 2500–2000 14C yr BP (ca. 2600–2000 cal yr
BP), and rapid drying thereafter. Isotope data derived from Fort Hood alluvium (Nordt et al. 1994; Nordt
2004) suggest increasingly moist conditions after ca. 4300–4000 14C yr BP (4850–4500 cal yr BP), with
conditions beginning to dry after ca. 2400 14C yr BP (ca. 2500 cal yr BP), and a period of increased moisture
ca. 2000 14C cal yr BP. Conditions were similar to the present thereafter. Hall (1990) summarizes a variety
of paleoenvionrmental data from Texas and Oklahoma which together suggest an “unprecedented” late
Holocene wet period occurred between 2000–1000 14C cal yr BP. Blum et al. (1994) conclude that high
volume floods were common during a 2500–1000 14C yr BP (ca. 2600–930 cal yr BP) moist interval. Waters
and Nordt (1995) identify two major periods of soil formation in the Brazos River floodplain dating to
4200–2500 14C yr BP (ca. 4800–2600 cal yr BP) and 1250–500 14C yr BP (ca. 1100–500 cal yr BP), and
infer cooler and wetter conditions during these intervals.
Magnetic susceptibility records from Camp Bullis Cave (Hudler 2000) indicate a prolonged period
of gradually increasing moisture following the ca. 5400–4700 14C yr BP (ca. 6200–5400 cal yr BP) period
of maximum aridity. This peaks about 1300 14C cal yr BP, with a dramatic and abrupt return to dryer
conditions. Isotope data derived from mussel shells in North-Central Texas middens indicate cooler/wetter
conditions between ca. 2500–1500 14C yr BP (ca. 2600–1400 cal yr BP), preceded and followed by warmer/
dryer intervals (Brown 1998). Isotope records from stalagmites in the Guadalupe Mountains suggest dry,
mid-Holocene conditions continued to ca. 4000 14C yr BP (ca. 4500 cal yr BP), with distinctly wetter/cooler
conditions ca. 3000–800 14C yr BP (ca. 3200–710 cal yr BP). Climate proxy records for temperatures are
less numerous, but carbon isotope records for Central Plains soils (Nordt et al. 2007) and from Hall’s Cave
sediments (Cooke 2005) are relatively similar. The Central Plains sequence suggests summer temperatures
began to cool beginning ca. 4500 14C yr BP (ca. 5200 cal yr BP), reaching near modern normals or even
slightly cooler ca. 3500–2800 14C yr BP (ca. 3800–2900 cal yr BP) before warming again slightly ca.
2500–1200 14C yr BP (ca. 2600–1100 cal yr BP)
A number of lines of evidence suggest essentially modern conditions were established by about 1000
C cal yr BP, with a shift to distinctly dryer conditions. However, stable isotope data from alluvium at Fort
Hood reflect the advent of modern conditions by as early as 2000 years ago, with little change thereafter
(Nordt et al. 1994). The most prominent and widespread evidence for this shift comes in the form of channel
trenching dating to about 1000 14C cal yr BP evident across much of the Southern Plains Periphery (e.g.
Hall 1990; see also Hall and Lintz 1984; Collins 1988). As yet it is unclear whether or not this trenching
represents a short, but extreme episode of entrenchment or a more long-term change. Faunal data from
Central Texas, for example, indicate “modern drought-prone climate has characterized the last 1000 years”
(Toomey et al. 1993: 299), while persistent late Holocene changes in the Pedernales River system were
apparently due to the advent of a modern dry climate after 1000 BP (Blum and Valastro 1989). Both carbon
14

45

isotope (Cooke 2005) and magnetic susceptibility records from Hall’s Cave suggest increasingly cooler
temperatures throughout the last 1000 years.
The apparent uniformity in climatic conditions over the last millennium is contradicted by other lines
of evidence suggesting change in both temperature and moisture regimes, but these data themselves are
sometimes in conflict. For example, pollen data from Central Texas suggest “dry” events occurred ca. 1500
to 500–300 14C cal years ago, with woodlands, indicating the advent of more mesic conditions, appearing
definitively in Central Texas only during the last few hundred years (Bousman 1998; but see also Decker
et al. 2000). Speleothem data from the Guadalupe Mountains, on the other hand, suggest a slightly wetter
interval ca. 440–290 14C cal yr BP (Polyak and Asmerom 2001), a reconstruction that is consistent with
dune sequences from the same area (Wilkens and Currey 1997). At Fort Hood, channel incision interrupting
a long period of alluviation dates to 600–400 14C cal yr BP and is probably related to this interval. However,
interpretation of this sequence reflects the difficulties in assessing alluvial sequences in general and does not
help resolve the apparent conflict, as Nordt (1992: 65) suggests that coarse-grained material at Cow House
Creek could represent either dry conditions associated with increased colluvial erosion, or wetter conditions
associated with increased flow in the stream. It may simply be that the difference is due to the dominance of
different weather systems over the widely separated areas of East Central Texas and the Trans-Pecos area of
Texas/New Mexico, or that climate change in the region as a whole was time transgressive as suggested by
Wilkens and Currey (1997). Regardless, it is apparent that the “Little Ice Age,” widely recognized over much
of the northern hemisphere (Mann et al. 1998) and probably representing the most recent millennial-scale
cycle in climate events associated with change in North Atlantic Ocean surface water (Bond et al. 1997),
had an effect on Central Texas climates. Perhaps more importantly, for Late Prehistoric foragers, tree-ring
records for Central Texas (e.g., Cook and Krusic 2004) parsed through the Palmer Drought Severity Index,
show a high degree of volatility over the last 1,000 years (Forman et al. 2009). However, this increased
volatility may only reflect the sensitivity of the relatively recent tree-ring record, and the more generalized
records from earlier periods may also encapsulate such volatility within their overall averages.
Together, these data, and those from a variety of archaeological sites (e.g., Collins 1995), suggest
rapid fluctuations in late Holocene climates. These likely had a dramatic impact on cultural change in the
region. However, while data are slightly more consistent than are those for the early- and mid-Holocene
(for example, they consistently show a period of increased moisture about 2500 14C yr BP [ca. 2600 cal yr
BP] and a shift to dryer conditions about 1000 14C cal yr BP), establishing a precise chronology from the
environmental proxy data alone is problematic. It is possible a more definitive record can be drawn from
archaeological sequences themselves. Collins (1995), for example (see Dillehay 1974 for an initial review),
suggests the presence of bison remains in mid-to-late Holocene cultural sequences is primarily the result of
more mesic conditions, a resulting increase in the productivity and size of grasslands, and an extension of
bison herds into the Central Texas region.

Discussion and Integration
This brief review of late Quaternary environmental change in the Southern Plains Periphery is not
meant to be exhaustive (for that, see many of the compilations previously cited), but is intended only to:
(1) determine if the globally linked century- to millennial-scale climate cycles evident throughout much of
North America, particularly D-O cycles, are present in regional records from the Central Texas area, and
(2) if so, can the environmental changes engendered by those cycles be used to help explain changes in the
Central Texas archaeological record? Clearly, even this brief synopsis suggests evidence of such cycles is
present. Moreover, many of the abrupt climate change events that characterize these cycles are also evident
in many Southern Plains Periphery records. What is much less clear is how useful these records are in
understanding cultural change in the region.
There are a number of reasons why this is so. One is simply the lack of continuous fine-grained
records from which the nature and timing of millennial-scale climate change cycles can be determined.
46

Such records are few and far between. The large bulk of climate proxy data is derived from alluvial cut/
fill and soil sequences that, by their very nature, are episodic and discontinuous, and therefore leave gaps
in the record. A second factor is the lack of adequate chronological control. With the exception of Hall’s
Cave, the few available continuous records are controlled by only one or two radiocarbon age estimates,
and deposition rates and the timing of abrupt environmental changes are only loosely defined. Moreover,
even the chronological controls for the more numerous alluvial/soil sequences are problematical since a
large proportion of the dates are on bulk humates, gastropod shells, or other material for which reservoir
effects are poorly or completely unknown. Third, environmental proxy records are biased towards the
late Holocene because younger records are more likely to be preserved, especially those which postdate the dramatic erosional periods of the mid-Holocene. Yet, while the cause of the bias is obvious, it
is less obvious that the abundance and variety of records available for the late Holocene also biases the
way we view early- to mid-Holocene climate change. Millennial-scale cycles are readily apparent in the
late Holocene sequences since there are so many such records that can be compared and contrasted, and
because there are so many more chronological controls. Early- to mid-Holocene millennial-scale cycles
are most likely less obvious only because of the paucity of records dating to these periods. Finally, and
most importantly, it is difficult to extrapolate the Central Texas climate record from paleoenvironmental
proxies recovered in adjoining regions because the weather systems driving climates in those regions can
differ dramatically from those controlling Central Texas climates. For example, how far south did the midcontinental Canadian high extend during winters at various times in the past? Similarly, how far inland did
gulf moisture reach during different climatic cycles? Modern synoptic weather patterns for Central Texas
are illustrative of this problem. As Figure 2.3 shows, drought conditions as mapped for January 2009 reflect
an extended “exceptional” drought for the Central Texas region, a drought that does not extend into many
adjoining areas from which the paleoenvironmental records reviewed above were retrieved. If this pattern
were to continue over time scales comparable to those discussed here, as it may well have done in the past,
it would be difficult to detect from other regional records.
A specific example of this can be seen in a recent compilation of tree-ring records from North
American used to project future periods of aridity (Cook et al. 2010). A summary diagram of “longterm aridity changes in the West [including
Texas] over the past 1200 years” shows two
“megadroughts” that seriously impacted much
of western North America and the Mississippi
valley (Figure 2.4). Yet, conditions in Central
Texas were considerably different from what
this summary diagram might imply, with
precipitation actually above normal throughout
Texas during the first “megadrought” (see
Figure 2.4b). Conditions during the second
“megadrought” are even more illustrative of
the difficulties in extrapolating a local climatic
sequence from regional and national climate
proxies, as above normal rainfall prevailed in
the western portion of the Central Texas study
area, while drought conditions prevailed only
to the east (see Figure 2.4b).

in central Texas as of January 2009 (from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).

So what can be done to correct this
situation? First, it is important to recognize
what such a sequence might look like. Two
of the many climate cycles which influence

et al. 2010.)
environmental proxies are particularly relevant here: a 19,000 year-long Milankovitch cycle and the 1,500
year-long D-O cycles. Other, longer, cycles related to celestial mechanics are too long to be very useful
in determining late Quaternary environmental change (at least in the kind of detail needed to interpret
archaeological sequences), and shorter decadal-to-century scale cycles are currently beyond the resolution
available in proxy records. The exception may be tree ring sequences in some favored locales in western
North America; another may be speleothem/ travertines.
The two cycles must be examined together since at times they reinforce or counteract each other. To
do so it is necessary to understand what a product of these two cycles would look like and to understand
what we should expect to see as a result in the Central Texas environmental record. Figure 2.5 illustrates
a series of D-O cycles superimposed on the 19,000 year-long precessional cycle showing schematically
what a well-dated, fine-grained, continuous Central Texas environmental proxy record might look like. Not
surprisingly, none of the climate curves in most compilations of late Quaternary Southern Plains Periphery
environmental histories look anything like this hypothetical sequence. There are a couple of reasons for
this. First, as I have noted above, all Central Texas interpretive sequences of which I am aware were

reached inductively by comparing and contrasting a number of disparate records to see what patterns might
emerge. In so doing, the many variations and inconsistencies in these records are necessarily ignored and/or
smoothed over in order to define a general curve that most closely matches all of the records individually, a
sort of best-fit kind of approach. A second, and closely related factor, is that the poor chronological controls
available for most proxy sequences means that when inductively deriving a climate curve, an event in
one record associated with a particular millennial-scale climate cycle may be grouped with another event
in another record that is related to an entirely different cycle. Real differences are attributed to dating
errors and combined into smoothed curves to eliminate inconsistencies that, while apparently in error, are
nonetheless real.
The advantage of a more deductive approach is that we can take the expectations suggested by the
Figure 2.5b schematic and use them to examine the known proxy record to better understand where gaps in
that record occur, and, better yet, the kinds of analytical approaches that might be best employed in filling
49

those gaps. I have examined virtually all Central Texas proxy records against the expectations identified in
Figure 2.5a and can find only one which closely matches that expected sequence. That record is an estimate
of changes in the relative amount of woodlands/grasslands along the eastern margin of the Balcones
Escarpment developed by calculating the degree of canopy cover suggested by pollen ratios from Boriack
and Weakley bogs (Bousman 1998, Fig. 7).
Figure 2.5 is a comparison of the schematically defined expectations and estimated arboreal canopy
through the last 17,000 years. Actual ages are less important than the similarities in the sequences themselves,
since a limited number of chronological control points makes age assignments only crude estimates. What
is important is that the Boriack and Weakley bog records clearly reflect century- to millennial-scale climate
cycles superimposed on one of the shorter Milankovitch cycles. Such a close match between the expected
sequence and the actual proxy record suggests that we might expect to find a similar close match in other
proxy records once the gaps in those records are filled and better chronological controls are established.

Summary
The late Quaternary environmental record for Central Texas is extensive and varied, but is plagued by
inconsistencies and gaps, particularly for the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and early Holocene periods.
Despite these gaps and contradictions it is clear that a record of millennial-scale climate change events
can be developed against which the archaeological record for Texas, and, of course, for Fort Hood, can
be examined. I would be remiss here if I did not attempt to produce a summary diagram of Central Texas
Holocene climate change with which the archaeological record of the region can be compared. I should
caution, however, that such an attempt is hazardous, for the reasons I have outlined above, and is necessarily
a highly subjective exercise. Any such summary diagram must be selective in using proxy records from
surrounding areas, since they are often contradictory and are often dominated by climatic regimes different
than those controlling Central Texas weather. Thus, such a selective summary is likely to be wrong in many
details and subject to modification.
It does, however, allow archaeologists investigating human response to climate change to identify
areas of productive research. For example, even a cursory examination of Figure 2.6 suggest there may be
several climate change events that may have served as “triggers” of related cultural changes. Similarly, there
are other intervals when cultural changes do not seem to clearly correlate with climate cycles, suggesting
other causes, such as population growth or technological innovation, may be responsible for the evident
cultural transitions.
In comparing discontinuity “events” with the Central Texas archaeological sequence there are a
number of correlations that suggest cultural changes may have occurred in response to climatic events. The
end of the Younger Dryas at ca. 10,000 14C yr BP (ca. 11,300 cal BP) and the cultural transition from the
early to late Paleoindian periods is a correlation that may reflect a climatic influence on cultural evolution.
The transition from early to middle Archaic ca. 5800 14C yr BP (ca. 6600 cal yr BP) is another. Similarly,
there are several near correlations that suggest further investigation of chronological controls may be
warranted. For example, the near correlation between the middle to late Archaic cultural transition and the
ca. 3700 14C yr BP (ca. 4050 cal yr BP) vegetational discontinuity might mean that with better chronological
controls a direct correlation could be demonstrated.
On the other hand, there are a number of time intervals when cultural change and climatic events
do not seem to match, suggesting the cultural changes may be more related to social factors than they are
to environmental causality. For example, phases within the early Archaic of the Central Texas area show
no obvious correlations with environmental “triggers,” suggesting social forces or technological changes
may better explain the greater portion of these cultural transitions (that, or the interval has yet to be fully
explored and dated).
In sum, it appears that millennial- and submillennial-scale climate cycles were an important
component of Holocene cultural changes in Central Texas, and that the dramatic environmental changes

central Texas region based on proxy records discussed in the text. These are compared to the
sequence of North American vegetational discontinuities (Viau et al. 2002) and the Central
Texas archaeological sequence (after Collins 1995). Note: (a) The figure does not show Early–

that marked the transition between those cycles may have often acted as “triggers” fostering those changes.
The Central Texas climate cycles appear to be related to similar cycles widely recognized through the North
Atlantic region, across North America, and, indeed, throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Unfortunately,
the dearth of continuous, well-dated, environmental proxy records spanning the entire period of human
occupation in the region and the need to extrapolate from adjacent areas makes it difficult to construct
precise interpretations of the nature and timing of those climate cycles and their impact on past human
societies. Based on past research, however, it seem that the potential to recover such records, from east
Central Texas bogs for example, is high, and that with such records in hand interpretations of the Central
Texas archaeological sequence can be greatly enhanced.

3. Research Design
J. M. Adovasio and J. L.Yedlowski
Based on the 1993 and 1994 exploratory investigations (Trierweiler 1994, 1996) and the electrical
resistance and magnetic field gradient geophysical surveys (Zeidler 2004 [see Previous Investigations]), it
was apparent that potentially extensive, stratified, and intact anthropogenic deposits were present within
and directly adjacent to Rockshelter A. In addition to undisturbed stratigraphy with features of potentially
human origin, the recovered materials included an abundant flaked stone suite (including virtually
everything, from initial and secondary reduction elements through tertiary resharpening/rejuvenation
flakes to finished/discarded pieces) as well as a limited ecofactual inventory which minimally contained
fragmentary mammalian remains, fluvial and terrestrial mollusks, and floral materials.
Moreover, on the basis of the two radiocarbon dates reported for the site (see Previous Investigations)
and associated lithic diagnostics, all of the recovered material are tentatively ascribed to the Late Prehistoric
period (ca. 1200 BP through Contact). Within the Late Prehistoric occupation/utilization of the site, two
distinct components were recognized by the excavators. According to Trierweiler (1996:222), these
components represent the two locally identifiable components of the Late Prehistoric period, Austin
and Toyah (cf. Prewitt 1981, 1985). The Austin Phase is apparently well represented at other Fort Hood
rockshelters, while the Toyah Phase is not (Trierweiler 1996:222).
Based on the tested integrity of the deposits as well as the incidence, variety, potential age range,
and condition of the materials observed and previously recovered at Rockshelter A, the site was adjudged
worthy of additional investigation.  Specifically, personnel of the Fort Hood Directorate of Public Works,
Environmental Division, Office of Cultural Resources Management, recommended the site to MAI as
an ideal locus to conduct a multi-year, multi-disciplinary, student training and research project. It was
confidently expected that high-resolution excavation and sampling protocols at this locality followed by
precise laboratory Analyses would provide information on a wide variety of issues/topics at various levels
of interpretation.
The Executive Director and senior research staff of MAI concurred with the recommendation and
prepared a multi-year research plan which was submitted to and accepted by the Fort Hood Office of
Cultural Resources Management without reservation. As detailed further below, the research plan submitted
to Fort Hood was explicitly imperial in orientation and intentionally avoided the inevitable circumscription
imposed by so-called traditional research designs with their emphasis on very limited research objectives. It
should also be emphasized that the investigation of Rockshelter A was not conducted for or in compliance
with NHPA, Section 106, but rather in the context of a memorandum of agreement between MAI and the
Fort Hood Directorate of Public Works. The project was jointly funded by MAI and the Department of the
Army.
From the commencement of MAI’s participation in the investigation of Rockshelter A, the central
goal or theme of the project was the systematic acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of any and all data
bearing on the archaeology, geoarchaeology, geology, geomorphology, pedology, hydrology, climatology,
paleoecology, and floral and faunal succession of the site and its environs. Moreover, this data gathering,
analysis, and interpretation was to be executed with as great a degree of precision and employing the
most sophisticated methodologies of which any of the project staff were cognizant. In short, the project
was designed to epitomize so-called “state-of-the-art” data gathering and analytical methodologies and

53

procedures within the fiscal and temporal constraints mandated by operational agreements between MAI
and Fort Hood.
As the foregoing suggests, the research design for the investigation of Rockshelter A was essentially
empirical in orientation and in some ways “old line” in philosophy. The multi-year excavations at Rockshelter
A were never viewed as a laboratory or medium to test explicit hypotheses or within which to seek logicodeductive laws or nomothetic truths about prehistoric behavior in Texas. Nor was this project designed
to explore or explicate issues like agency, gender-based decision making, or any other post-processual
objectives. Instead, it was hoped that via the application of high-resolution protocols, information would
be forthcoming on a range of more or less traditional—that is, primarily culture-historical—issues. At the
lowest level of interpretation, these include delineation of the chronology of occupation/utilization of this
locality, the frequency and seasonality of aboriginal visitation/utilization, spatial and temporal shifts in the
intensity of site use, and a characterization of the nature and/or function(s) of site use parameters both in
time and through time. At the same time, it was anticipated that the geological history of the site before,
during, and after it served as a stage for the prehistoric actors and actresses of antiquity could be delineated
and potentially related to broader paleoenvironmental patterns.
At a slightly higher level of analysis, it was hoped that the excavations would illuminate durable
technological issues such as the nature of lithic procurement patterns, manufacture, use, refurbishment,
and discard throughout the sequence as well as the identification of task-specific activities for elements and
element sets within the lithic suite.
At arguably the highest level of analysis and interpretation, it was hoped that data would be forthcoming
on such matters as the timing and nature of the transition from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric, the
identification of artifactual signatures to this event or process, the character of the Austin and Toyah Phases
(at least at this locality), and the possible delineation of any changes in site use parameters, technology, or
subsistence strategies related to either or both of these phases.

Field Methods
The initial MAI archaeological investigation of Rockshelter A, conducted from 22 July 2003 to 7
August 2003, can best be characterized as exploratory and was directed at preparing the site for future,
more-comprehensive excavation. Data recovery was initiated by assembling a comprehensive photographic
inventory of the site and its environs in their natural state (i.e., before defoliation) using both black-andwhite print and color slide films in 35 mm format (Figure 3.1). After initial photography, all vegetation on
and immediately adjacent to the site (including the talus slopes and portions of the contiguous uplands)
was systematically stripped to the level of minute roots and twigs. The removal of living trees was
restricted to small (i.e., diameter <6 in) specimens and was preceded by consultation with appropriate Fort
Hood agencies. This procedure was intended to expose the extant site topography as well as the surficial
distribution of roof spalls and any preserved prehistoric/historic features or artifacts. At this juncture, the
site was rephotographed from the same perspectives that had been used in the initial photographic montage
(Figure 3.2).
The site was then topographically mapped with a Leitz electronic total station. A baseline with
permanent horizontal data points which bisected the talus slope from outside to inside the extant dripline
was established. The orientation of this base line was perpendicular to the rear wall and oriented 36º west
of magnetic north.
A 1 m interval grid system was established over the rockshelter deposits via a combination of directly
triangulating from the baseline and the use of the electronic total station. Each 1 m2 excavation unit was
designated according to its position east (easting is listed with an “R” for right herein) and north of the
baseline. Designation of all excavation units was reckoned from the intersection of the grid system lines
at the southwest corner of each excavation unit. All horizontal coordinates were subsequently reckoned
relative to this established grid system.
54

Figure 3.1. General view of Rockshelter A, prior to defoliation, facing grid south.

Figure 3.2. General view of Rockshelter A, after defoliation, facing grid south.
A permanent elevational datum point was affixed to the rear wall of the rockshelter. This datum (or
permanent wall mark [PWM]) was then correlated with mean sea level. The PWM was designated Datum
A. This combination of fixed datum points and a grid system provided absolute Cartesian coordinates for
the recording of all features and artifacts encountered during excavation.
During all phases of the 2003 field project, all observed surface artifacts were left in situ and marked
with surveyor’s flags. After completion of the topographic map, these surface materials were piece-plotted
via the total station, collected, and bagged for analysis.
In order to gauge, quantify, and better understand how weathering has contributed and continues
to contribute to rockshelter development/sedimentation, two attrition sample collecting platforms were
55

erected beneath the overhang or ceiling of the site. Each collection platform consisted of an open 1 m2 box
suspended from the interior of the ceiling. Both of these platforms were situated in differentially eroding
areas of the site, one over unit 25R18 and the other over 30R16 (Figure 3.3). The platforms effectively
caught any exfoliated materials released from the bedrock outcrop. Additionally, a dual-sensor weather
station was erected which recorded temperature, relative humidity, dew point, and light intensity hourly
both inside and outside the dripline as well as rainfall outside the dripline (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).
Attrition samples were collected daily during the excavation season along with weather data. During
the non-excavation season, samples and data were collected monthly. During post-excavation analysis,

attrition samples were correlated with weather data to establish an index of modern erosion and sediment
rain. This, in turn, was used as a gauge to measure prehistoric rockshelter development (see Chapter 4).
Subsurface excavation in 2003 was confined to the removal of backfill from TRC Mariah Associates,
Incorporated’s (TRC-MA), Test Pit 3, after which the four walls of the unit were resurfaced via trowel. The
four walls of Test Pit 3 were then photographed and detailed stratigraphic profiles were recorded.
The primary purpose of this re-exposure of an earlier test pit was to permit reevaluation of the
stratigraphic sequence and its integrity. This re-examination confirmed both the basic stratigraphic integrity
at Rockshelter A and the originally posited potential of the site. The final task of the 2003 field season was
the backfilling of Test Pit 3. The grid system and PWM were left in place for subsequent excavations.
In April and June 2004 and again in August 2004, floral surveys of the rockshelter, its immediate
environs, and various contiguous portions of Fort Hood were conducted under the supervision of J. M.
Campbell. These surveys specifically detailed the species composition of the modern floral community
in the study area (see Chapter 1). Concomitant with these floral inventories, Campbell supervised the
inventory of terrestrial pulmonate gastropods found throughout the same areas in which the floral surveys
were conducted. An inventory of aquatic mollusks in the major waterways of North Fort Hood and the Leon
River was also produced.
During the course of the entire project, 22 units measuring 1 m2 were excavated at the site; 13 were
excavated inside the dripline and 9 were excavated outside the dripline. Most of the units remained open
for as many as two (n=12) or three (n=1) years, while the remainder (n=9) were opened, excavated, and
closed in a single field season. During the 2004 field season, 9 m2 of surface area was hand-excavated.
This included ca. 2.1 m2 inside and 6.9 m2 outside the extant dripline (Figure 3.6). Of the 9 m2 excavated,
one 1 m2 unit (25R25 [Figure 3.7]) was a deep hole which was excavated to culturally sterile levels. A
total volume of 3.18 m2 was excavated and 53 constant volume samples (CVS), 15 feature fill samples
(HYPOS), and 7 radiocarbon samples were collected (see Chapter 3).
In 2005, ca. 17 m2 of surface area was hand excavated. This included 6 m2 outside and ca. 11 m2
inside the extant dripline. A total volume of 6.05 m3 of fill was excavated and 75 CVS, 20 HYPOS, and 20
radiocarbon samples were collected. In 2006, 10 m2 of surface area was hand excavated. This included 2

m2 outside and 8 m2 inside the extant dripline. A total volume of 2.55 m3 was excavated and 30 CVS, 148
HYPOS, 37 radiocarbon samples, and 2 humic acid samples were collected.
Following initial fieldwork in 2003, it was decided to initiate a comprehensive paleoenvironmental
literature search to augment and enhance the field collection of various environmental proxies both onsite

and elsewhere in North Fort Hood. The explicit goal of this study was to examine the evidence for millennial
scale climatic change and its relationship to human adaptation in Central Texas (see Chapter 2).

Excavation Methodology
The excavation, data collection, documentation, and sampling protocols employed during the 2003–
2006 project at Rockshelter A were initially developed during the mulit-year, multi-disciplinary excavations
at Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Washington County, Pennsylvania. They have subsequently been applied,
enhanced, and refined in multi-year closed site excavation projects in Kentucky, Mississippi, and open site
research in more than 17 states as well as abroad.
Prior to the onset of any other excavation related activity at the site, a series of individual excavation
unit contour maps (contour interface maps) were prepared utilizing a contour interval of 5 cm referenced
to the PWM and the grid system. In addition to contour intervals, all surface phenomena were mapped
including roof fall, artifacts, roots, etc.
Excavations commenced with the opening of a north–south trench that traversed the distance from
outside to inside the extant dripline of the rockshelter overhang. Excavation was carried out utilizing hand
tools. In all cases, no tools larger than a 6 inch pointing trowels were employed, and in many instances
smaller excavation tools were utilized. A considerable number of cobble-sized to small boulder-sized
limestone fragments were removed from all stratigraphic levels in all excavated units at the site. Although
such rock concentrations hindered excavation, at no time was excavation terminated in any unit due to their
presence. Where necessary, surface and subsurface roof spalls were reduced and removed utilizing power
drills, masonry bits, chisels, and sledge hammers.
Excavation was conducted in natural depositional or stratigraphic units and, where possible, by
microstrata or arbitrary levels within natural strata of considerable thickness. Arbitrary levels of 5 cm were
employed where natural strata exceeded 5 cm in thickness. Natural strata and microstrata were defined on
the basis of subjective criteria including texture, apparent composition, friability, degree of compaction,
and, on a more limited basis, color. Verification of the integrity of these stratigraphic units was achieved via
subsequent sediment size, grain composition, and geochemical analyses.

59

Units designed to explore the maximum depth of both cultural and natural deposits at the site were
established. These units, collectively termed deep holes, permitted an accurate assessment of the possible
geological and human factors that contributed to the natural and cultural histories of the site.
All fill from every excavation unit was dry-processed through ⅛ in hardware cloth. The combination
of reasonably dry, easily disaggregated sediment and small screen size maximized the recovery potential
for macrofloral and macrofaunal remains as well as for lithic and other artifactual materials. To recover
materials smaller than 3.2 mm, a constant volume sample (CVS) of ca. 1,500 cm3 of fill was collected from
each natural stratum, microstratum, or arbitrary level within natural strata. These samples were collected
from the southwest corner of every excavated unit for flotation processing. Flotation samples were also
collected from cultural features, but the approximate 1,500 cm3 sample size was not maintained. All feature
fill was collected for processing via floatation.
Cultural features were mapped three-dimensionally, stratigraphic profiles were drawn whenever
it was deemed appropriate (as often as every 1 m), and contour interface maps were constructed. Since
the distribution of roof spalls clearly determined the amount of open floor space available to aboriginal
occupants, special care was taken to map all spalls larger than the size of a quarter coin. Although tedious,
recording coordinates of roof spalls and cultural features as well as associated artifactual and ecofactual
materials renders the production of large-scale floor maps a relatively simple task.
The excavation of cultural features proceeded only after the feature had been photographed and
mapped in plan and its position had been reckoned and recorded relative to the grid system and elevation
datum. Excavation of each feature commenced by quartering the feature through its approximate center
parallel to the grid system in a north to south and east to west direction along known subdivisions of the grid
system. One quadrant was then excavated in 5 cm arbitrary levels, where thickness permitted, removing
only the feature fill. When completed, two partial profile maps of the feature were constructed, one facing
north or south, the other east or west. A second quadrant was then excavated, and the appropriate profile map
was completed. At this point, the feature was photographed in its partially excavated state. A third quadrant
was then excavated and the second profile map completed. The remaining quadrant was then removed, and
the fully excavated feature was again photographed. In the course of feature excavation, removed feature
fill was bagged separately for subsequent processing by flotation as previously described. It should be noted
that this basic feature excavation technique was modified, where warranted, to most effectively deal with
cultural features on an individual basis.
In the excavation of the rockshelter, specialized recovery procedures were employed to provide
data for post-excavation analysis. These procedures included the collection of charred organic material
for radiocarbon assay, the establishment of two collection platforms to measure monthly grain-by-grain
attrition from the ceiling of the rockshelter, and the cutting of continuous columns of bulk sediment for
pollen extraction and analysis.

Laboratory Methods
Processing and curation of archaeological materials recovered from Rockshelter A was designed to
ensure preservation of the cultural remains and their archaeological context for analysis in the present
and future research. All cultural remains—including artifacts, ecofacts, and archaeological samples—were
cataloged at MAI’s laboratories immediately following completion of the project’s field phase. The catalog
links both generalized (i.e., site, unit, stratum, feature, and arbitrary level) and absolute (i.e., precise xyz
coordinates) provenience data with each artifact, ecofact, or sample through the assignment of catalog and
unique specimen-specific numbers. Materials were also assigned to general artifact and ecofact categories
(e.g., prehistoric artifact, historic artifact, floral remain, faunal remain, fire-cracked rock, etc.) or sample
category (e.g., radiocarbon, geologic, flotation, etc.). Artifacts were further characterized by material class
(e.g., lithic, ceramic, glass, metal, wood, leather, bone, and etc.). Microsoft Access was used to produce the
catalog and a separate artifact inventory for the site’s artifact assemblage. Both the catalog and inventory
60

were printed in hard copy format on acid-free paper. The artifact inventory will be curated, in hard copy and
electronic form, with the artifact assemblage.
All soil and feature fill samples were processed through floatation in water or a 10 percent hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) solution. The volume of each sample was measured and recorded before the flotation
procedure. Large plastic buckets were used to dissolve soil samples in water and feature fill in the hydrogen
peroxide solution. Materials which floated (the light fraction) in the dissolved mixtures were removed using
nylon hoops. The remaining solution (the heavy fraction) was poured through graduated geologic sieves
measuring 4 mm (no. 5), 2 mm (no. 10), 1 mm (no. 18), and 500 μm (no. 35). After drying, the light fraction
was similarly sorted using the graduated sieve set. Samples of both fractions collected from the 4 mm
(no. 5) and 2 mm (no. 10) sieves were manually sorted using tweezers, magnifying lenses, and low-power
microscopes for artifact and ecofact recovery. Fill from the stratigraphic units identified at the site were
analyzed for sediment size using a Beckman-Coulter Model LS200 Particle Size Analyzer.
All cultural remains were thoroughly cleaned. Specimens which may have been damaged by washing
(e.g., metal and perishable materials) were dry-brushed. All cultural remains larger than 1 in2 were labeled
with an archaeological site survey number following the trinomial numbering system developed by the
Smithsonian Institution. Additionally, each artifact was labeled with a sequential catalog and sequence
number associating it with its provenience data while also providing it with a unique number for analytical
purposes. Specimens smaller than 1 in2 were labeled, when physically possible to do so, without obscuring
diagnostic features of the specimen. Artifact labels were sealed above and below with a clear sealer
(Acryloid B-72 in acetone). After cleaning and labeling, all artifacts were separated by general category,
material class, and type (see above) and placed in 4 mil polyethylene bags with acid-free provenience tags.
After analysis, all cultural remains were stored by provenience in archival-grade corrugated cardboard
cartons, which are acid- and lignin-free. These containers have a pH of 8.5–10 and pass the Photographic
Activity Test (ISO 18916:2007). Containers are labeled with site number and provenience package using
permanent ink.
Photographic materials used to document site excavation (i.e., negative, positive prints, and slides)
were stored in polyethylene or polypropopylene sleeves. A photographic catalog was produced in the field.
Slides and photos were labeled with catalog numbers, with slides also bearing descriptive information.
Curation-standard copies (i.e., clear carbon or photocopies on acid-free paper) of all field and analytical
documentation (e.g., notes, maps, drawings, etc.)

Previous Investigations
In June 1993, TRC-MA excavated a 50 cm x 50 cm test quad (Test Pit 1) near the center of the
rockshelter’s interior (see Figure 3.6). This test quad was excavated to a depth of 70 cm below ground
surface and yielded 416 cultural remains. Based upon the recovered data, Rockshelter A was recommended
for subsurface testing to determine potential eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NHRP) (Trierweiler 1994:A733-741).
In November 1994, TRC-MA excavated an additional two 1 m2 test pits (see Figure 3.6), one (Test Pit
2) near the rear wall and the other (Test Pit 3) immediately north of 1993 test quad (Test Pit 1) . Test Pits 2
and 3 were formerly excavated to depths of 30 cm and 102 cm below ground surface, respectively (Figures
3.8 and 3.9). Test Pit 2 yielded one glass shard and three pieces of flaked stone debitage. Test Pit 3 yielded
over 3,500 artifacts, including flaked stone cores, debitage, miscellaneous tools and projectile points, a
ground stone specimen, and over 500 ecofacts (i.e., bivalve and bone). Two cultural features were also
identified in Test Pit 3. Both features were apparent fire pits or hearths and both yielded numerous burned
rocks. Corrected radiocarbon assays of 820 ± 40 BP for Feature 1 and 1240 ± 40 BP for Feature 2 were
obtained (Trierweiler 1996:217–218). Based on the relative and absolute chronological data, Trierweiler
assigned the occupation/utilization of the rockshelter to the last ca. 1300 years BP or the Austin and Toyah
61

NRHP (Trierweiler 1996:223).
In April 2003, the Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands, Colorado State
University under the supervision of J. Zeidler conducted twin-electrode electrical resistance (ER) and
magnetic field gradient (MFG) surveys in the interior of Rockshelter A (Figure 3.10). Later in 2003, after
the initial archaeological investigation by MAI (see above), Zeidler conducted a ground penetrating radar
(GPR) survey (Figure 3.11) in the same area inside the rockshelter that had previously received ER and
MFG surveys.

The ER survey identified five high resistivity anomalies in the eastern interior of the rockshelter (see
Figure 3.10). According to Zeidler (2004:38), “these five high resistivity anomalies are likely stone clusters
that may or may not be fired.” Also identified was a low to high resistivity trend from the dripline to the
rear wall. This suggests that “there may be a sub-surface water source at the rear of the rockshelter which
contributes additional soil moisture in this area” (Zeidler 2004:38). Results of the MFG survey identified

no iron or steel objects within the interior of the rockshelter, indicating no major episodes of modern
disturbances to the deposits. Additionally, a number of potentially fired cultural features were identified
along the rear wall (see Figure 3.11).
Though completed after the preliminary MAI field investigations at Rockshelter A, results of the
GPR survey confirmed the results of the two previous geophysical surveys, notably that a number (four to
six) of large, ca. 1 m diameter anomalies of possible cultural origin were located near the dripline in the
easterninterior of the rockshelter. GPR also identified the underlying bedrock of the rockshelter interior
which lies at a maximum depth of ca. 1.10 m below ground surface near the dripline and gradually slopes
inward toward the rear wall, at which point it is only ca. 10–20 cm below ground surface (Figure 3.12).
In July 2003, prior to the defoliation of the rockshelter and its environs (see below), a non-systematic
floral survey was conducted by D. B. Madsen. This survey was undertaken to determine if the immediate
rockshelter environs contained floral species distinct from these further afield from the rockshelter. This
preliminary reconnaissance determined that no species were present at or immediately adjacent to the
rockshelter that were not present elsewhere above, below, or adjacent to the site.

4. Field Results
The MAI investigation of Rockshelter A identified and/or recovered 12 major natural depositional
units or strata (see below), 9 cultural features (see below), 16 samples for radiocarbon assay (see below),
30,179 lithic artifacts (see Chapter 5), 274 Historic period artifacts (see Chapter 6), 2,211 faunal elements
(see Chapter 7), 11 modified shell specimens and 21,809 unmodified vertebrate faunal remains (see Chapter
8), and 3,761 macrobotanical remains (see Chapter 9). This chapter describes the results of the rockshelter
development and sedimentation analyses, the site’s stratigraphy and cultural features, and the radiocarbon
chronology established for the site.

Rockshelter Development
F. J. Vento
Rockshelter A has formed in the Late Cretaceous Edwards limestone member of the Comanche series.
Locally, the Edwards limestone caps the ridges and upland divides within the study area. At the site, the
Edwards Limestone can be classified as a dense wackestone/packstone (biomicrite) which is well bedded
and exhibits strong, well developed joint sets. Due to fractures, macropores, and well developed joints the
limestone exhibits a high degree of secondary permeability.
Formation of the rockshelter has taken place primarily over of the last 15,000 years in conjunction
with changes in climate which affected the various agents of erosion, mass-wasting, and weathering. In
viewing the shelter, the packstone/wackestone (biomicrite) facies of the Edwards Limestone forms the
roof of the shelter and attains a thickness of approximately 7 m. The dense, hard facies is disconformably
underlain by a limestone facies consisting of a poorly consolidated, foraminiferal grainstone (Figure 4.1). At
the rockshelter site, the stratigraphic contact between the dense biomicrite and the foraminiferal grainstone
is sharp and abrupt. It is at this contact and as a result of well-developed joint sets in the packstone/
wackestone facies that the rockshelter reentrant and overhang has developed (Figures 4.2–4.5).
In front of the rockshelter and beginning at the dripline, is the headward catchment zone of a small
intermittent rill, which serves to drain the area. It appears that over time the rill has been enlarged and
migrated upslope. The development of the rill is in direct response to the development of a spring or
seep which has formed at the contact between the above units. The existence of a perched water table has
allowed for the hydrolysis (dissolution) of the weak, loose grainstone bed. The solution of the limestone
has taken place at the contact between two saturated but chemically dissimilar water masses that meet at
the water table. In this case, the saturated waters (with respect to calcium carbonate) are in contact with
equally saturated waters of the grainstone thus creating an unsaturated solution with respect to calcium
carbonate. The undersaturated conditions favor dissolution and subsequent formation of the reentrant. In
addition, during intense precipitation events, the rapid flow rate of water entering into open fractures (joints
or macropores) in an under saturated condition with respect to calcium carbonate would allow for effective
dissolution and expansion of the reentrant and open joints. As the open reentrant developed, mass wasting
processes (principally grain-by-grain attrition from the loose grainstone bed) allowed for enlargement of
the rockshelter.
Weathering at the site is both chemical and mechanical in nature. Mechanical or physical weathering
at the rockshelter is resultant from the in situ release of rock fragments and individual mineral grains from
the various facies of the Edwards Limestone. The two most active mechanical weathering agents include
frost-wedging (which occurs on average 25 days per year) and organic activity. Chemical weathering at

Limestone.

the rockshelter is primarily in the form of carbonization/hydrolysis of the limestone. This is essentially
caused by acidic rain water interacting with soil humus enriched in carbon dioxide thus producing a weak
carbonic acid which effectively causes dissolution of the bedrock. The abundant fractures and secondary
pores present in the Edwards Limestone Formation provide abundant pathways for water to enter into the
loose grainstone limestone facies.
Erosion at the site is effectively restricted to the well developed wash or gully situated at the mouth or
just outside the dripline of the shelter. This intermittent external drainage link is fed by surface runoff and
limited ground water recharge or baseflow. During large precipitation events, water in the gully or wash
moves sediment down slope in its channel. Evidence that the wash exhibits intermittent competence can
be seen in the large subangular or sub rounded rock fragments which lie within its defined channel. Refits

clearly indicate movement some of the colluvial soils
on the talus slope by both erosion and mass wasting.

Rockshelter Sedimentation
F. J. Vento

Figure 4.4. Photomicrograph (taken at 40 x under
cross nicols) of grainstone facies of Edwards
Limestone. This facies is poorly consolidated and
forms the rockshelter reentrant. The facies consists
of small fossil fragments (e.g. forams, bivalves, and
bryozoa).

The sediment suite present at Rockshelter
A resulted from three distinct surficial geological
processes: mass-wasting, erosion, and weathering
(Figure 4.6). At the periphery of the bedrock
overhang, the Edwards Limestone merges into the
surrounding hillside. As a result, colluvial (talus)
slopes have formed on either side of the reentrant.
The northeastern (grid east) talus slope exhibits a
mean slope angle of 26º to the west. The southwestern
(or grid west) talus slope exhibits a mean slope angle
of 26º to the northeast. These two distinct colluvial
slopes intersect near the center of the dripline, where
they combine with surface runoff from the rockshelter
roof to form an erosional gully or wash. This erosional
gully or wash has, through time, eroded headward
upstream as the roof of the rockshelter has retreated.
The rill or wash is supplied from both surface runoff
along the valley slopes and the roof of the shelter, as
well as from ground water recharge.

Mass wasting is the down slope movement
of material under the influence of gravity. At the
rockshelter site, mass wasting processes include
creep, slope wash, sheet wash, rock fall, and grain-bygrain attrition. The first three processes are effectively
restricted to the area outside the existing dripline of
Figure 4.5. Photomicrograph (taken at 40 x under the rockshelter. Creep is the nearly imperceptible

headward form just outside the dripline. Slope wash
occurs on the margins of the rockshelter and concave wash slopes have formed as a result of surface runoff.
These runoff events occur when the soils are saturated with water and any further precipitation results in
rejected recharge. Sheet wash is restricted to the area lying at the summit or roof of the shelter. Like slope
wash, sheet wash is restricted to periods of soil saturation. Both slope wash and sheet wash have contributed
sediment and water to the intermittent wash which lies outside the dripline (Figure 4.7).
Inside the dripline, minor sources of sedimentation include small rock fragments released primarily
from the poorly consolidated grain stone facies as well as from wash processes acting along the margins of
the site. The principal sediment source, however, is the continuous “rain” of sand- and silt-sized carbonate
grains from the grain stone facies. As part of this study, grain size columns were processed from both inside
and outside the dripline. These sediment column samples were examined for gravel sized through clay
sized fractions. The samples studied to date show a strong difference in grain size distributions inside and
outside the dripline as well as vertically at the site. Inside the dripline for example, the sediments are much
finer grained than those outside the dripline having been contributed from the grainstone facies. The grain

size analysis from a column on the talus slope outside the dripline is much coarser grained, resultant from
weathering of the biomicrite facies, and also exhibits a coarsening upward trend. The coarser grains outside
the dripline clearly reflect greater amounts of rock fall on the talus slope with the finer grains (silts and
clays) being contributed by slopewash, as opposed to grain by grain attrition.
In August 2003, Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute emplaced two 1 m x1 m sediment traps suspended
from the ceiling of the rockshelter and within the confines of the dripline (see Field Methods). From August
2003 to January 2007 samples from each trap were collected on a monthly basis. In addition a weather
station was maintained at the site which recorded, on
an hourly basis, temperature and relative humidity
both inside and outside of the rockshelter as well as
rainfall outside of the dripline.
The data shows a relatively strong correlation
between those months in which the traps captured the
greatest amount of sediment grains and those months
which exhibited higher amounts of precipitation and
moderate correlation between those months with lower
average temperatures and increased sedimentation
rates (Figure 4.8). The effects of wetting and drying
and temperature fluctuation effectively promote
release of sediments from the grainstone facies.
Based upon radiocarbon dates and diagnostic
stone tools, it appears that sedimentation rates for the
area lying outside the dripline are approximately 15
cm/1,000 yr. With regard to rockshelter sedimentation
inside the dripline, there appear to be significant
differences in the late Holocene sedimentation rates.
For example, a radiocarbon assay on a fire feature at
40 cm below ground surface yielded an age of 820 ±
70

Figure 4.7. Histogram showing mean grain size
distribution for samples collected inside and outside
the drip line at 41CV115A. Note that the majority
of the grains inside the drip line are significantly
finer than those from outside the drip line.

and humidity rates at Rockshelter A. Values are represented as a percent of total for each

40 cal yr BP (Tx-8418 [Trierweiler 1996:217]), and a second radiocarbon assay on another fire feature at a
nominal depth of 80 cm yielded an age of 1240 ± 40 cal yr BP (Beta-83260 [Trierweiler 1996:218]). These
dates indicate a sedimentation rate of 5 cm per 100 years for the period 800 BP to present and a rate of 10
cm per 100 years for the period ca. 1200–800 BP). The higher sedimentation rates for the deeper feature
may reflect paleoclimatic conditions which favored more active weathering (e.g., frost wedging) and mass
wasting (e.g., rockfall, slopewash) processes inside the extant drip. Assuming this is true, millennial-scale
climate change events during the Holocene in Central Texas, particularly the late Holocene (see Millenial
Scale Climatic Change and Human Adaptation), likely had an episodic impact on rockshelter development
and, in turn, on occupational intensity at the site (see also Collins 1991). Examination of the deeper deposits
inside the shelter would help confirm this posited link between climate change and shelter development.
All of the strata defined inside the dripline consist of distinct, lithostratigraphic units which have
been emplaced by wash processes, grain-by-grain attrition and minor rock fall. No soil horizons or
pedostratigraphic horizons have been imprinted on the strata inside the dripline. Outside the dripline,
however, the deposits consist of a thick (1.4 m) lithostratigraphic unit comprised of variably textured and
weathered colluvium. Soil development has proceeded on these colluvial sediments such that a strong
cumulic A horizon and weakly developed channery BC horizon has formed. The absence of any buried
paleosols, indicating landform stability outside the dripline on the talus slope and within the gully indicates
intermittent episodes of both sediment deposition and erosion by wash processes. These processes affectively
limit the degree for which in situ soil development can take place.

Stratigraphy
F. J. Vento and J. L. Yedlowski
The excavations at Rockshelter A distinguished 12 major natural depositional units or strata. One of
the surface strata, Stratum IV, is the only stratum that is horizontally continuous across all of the excavated
portion of the site, inside and outside the dripline and on the terrace north of the rockshelter. The remaining
11 strata are discontinuous deposits found across various excavated portions of the site (Table 4.1).
At the rockshelter proper, eight distinct strata were identified during the field excavations at the site.
Three distinct pedostratigraphic horizons or strata occur outside the extant dripline at the site. These include
Strata IV, I, and II. Strata IV and II can best be classified as the A1 and A2 horizons, respectively, of
the surface epipedon on the talus slope while basal Stratum I is comprised of less organic-rich colluvial
sediments emplaced during the late Holocene but prior to historic deforestation.
During the field excavations at Rockshelter A, limited archaeological field work was conducted on a
flat, bedrock defended structural bench lying north of the rockshelter as well as at the rockshelter proper.
On the structural bench, four distinct strata were identified. These include a thick surface epipedon which
was divided into uppermost A1 (Stratum IV), A2 (Stratum X), and lower A3 (Stratum XI). The basal A3
(Stratum XI) was conformably underlain by a channery sand Bk horizon which has formed from in situ
weathering of the limestone bedrock on the structural bench.
Inside the extant dripline six distinct lithogstratigaphic (Strata IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX) units
or strata were identified. All of these strata were variously deposited by grain by grain attrition, limited

slopewash primarily from the western talus slope and rock fall. Given their position inside the extant dripline
there has been limited weathering of the deposits as well as minor organic matter being contributed thus
limiting soil development. It should be noted that Stratum IV occurs both inside and outside the dripline and
that the stratum is not time parallel in these areas. Inside the dripline, Stratum IV is comprised primarily of
sediments contributed by rock fall, attrition and to a minor extent slopewash. On the talus slope, Stratum
IV is entirely comprised of colluvial sediments which have been contributed by mass wasting processes
(creep, slopewash and sheetwash).
The 12 identified strata are described below. The composite stratigraphy is presented in Figure 4.9.
The cultural and ecofactual associations of each stratum are summarized in terms of their presence within
the stratum and distributions within the stratum. Where distribution limits are not specified, the artifactual
and ecofactual materials are horizontally and vertically ubiquitous throughout the stratum.

Stratum I (Field Designation F8) (basal stratum outside the dripline on the talus slope)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum I was encountered in only one excavation unit on the talus slope, 25R25
(see Figure 4.9). Vertically, the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.47 m to 0.63 m below
ground surface and it extends to a maximum excavated depth of 0.20 m.
Texture: Stratum I is a channery silty sand. The primary modal peaks in the sand sized fraction occur
at 1 mm (0 phi) and 2 mm (-1 phi). The median grain size for the sand sized fraction is 1.18 mm. The sample
exhibits a standard deviation (degree of sorting) of 0.086 mm. The sample is positively skewed with a
value of 1.002 and a tail trending toward the finer grain size fraction. The kurtosis value is 1.03 indicating
a weak leptokurtic character for the sand sized fraction of the stratum. Stratum I is confined to the “deep
hole” outside the dripline on the lower talus slope of the site. The stratum can be classified as a weathered C
horizon and is primarily comprised of sediment which has moved downslope via mass wasting (slopewash,
sheetwash and creep) during late Holocene and historic times.
Description: Stratum I is a fairly well compacted, friable, channery silty sand horizon. Color varies
from light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2 [moist]) to light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3 [moist]). When dry the
color is light gray (2.5Y 7/2). It is separated from overlying Stratum II by a gradual (5–15 cm) interface
(boundary). Limestone rock fragments occur throughout the stratum, as do roots, rootlets, and invertebrate
faunal remains. Evidence of bioturbation is minimal. Stratum I appears to consist of decomposed (weathered)
bedrock and thus represent a C horizon.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum I consist of flaked stone debitage.
No historic artifacts were recovered from Stratum I. Ecofactual materials recovered from Stratum I consist
of invertebrate faunal remains. No cultural features occur in Stratum I. As Stratum I appears to represent
a weathered C horizon, all cultural and ecofactual materials recovered from this stratum are the result of
bioturbation and the natural downward movement of material from the overlying strata.

Stratum II (Field Designation F7)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum II was encountered in two excavation units on the talus slope, 25R25
and 25R26 (see Figure 4.9). Vertically, the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.26 m to 0.31 m
below ground surface, and it extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.20 m.
Texture: Stratum II like Stratum I lay outside the dripline of the rockshelter on the lower talus slope and
was confined stratigraphically to the “deep hole” unit. Stratum II can best be classified as a channery sand.
The horizon has a smooth wavy boundary with underlying Stratum I. For the size classes less than 4 mm (-2
phi), the median grain size for Stratum II is 1.2 mm. The standard deviation is 0.09 and displays a positive
skewness value of 1.011. The kurtosis value for the sand sized fraction is 1.08. The primary modal peaks
for the sand sized fraction occur at the 1 mm and 2 mm size classes. Like Stratum I, Stratum II represents
colluvial sediments moving downslope under the influence of gravity. The primary transport processes
outside the dripline are creep, sheetwash, and slopewash. The occurrence of historic artifacts in Stratum
73

II indicates deposition during historic times primarily in response to historic deforestation which favored
more active mass wasting and erosion outside the dripline. In addition, there has been active bioturbation
of the deposits on the talus slope outside the dripline.
Description: Stratum II is a non-compacted, friable, channery silty clay horizon. Color varies from
very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1 [moist]) through dark gray (2.5Y 4/1 [moist]) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2
[moist]) to light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 [moist]). It is separated from underlying Stratum I and the overlying
Stratum III by a gradual (5–15 cm) interface (boundary). Limestone pebbles through medium cobbles occur
throughout the stratum, as do roots, rootlets, and invertebrate faunal remains. Evidence of bioturbation is
present. Stratum II appears to represent a BK horizon.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum II consist of flaked stone debitage.
No Historic artifacts were recovered. Ecofactual materials recovered from Stratum II consist of vertebrate
and invertebrate faunal remains, floral remains, charcoal in the form of dispersed flecks, and possibly
thermally altered limestone pebbles and cobbles. No cultural features occur in Stratum II.

Stratum III (Field Designations F4, F5) (surficial stratum in some units inside the dripline)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum III is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified in five excavation units (22R19, 23R19, 24R19, 25R17, and 25R18) inside the extant dripline
(see Figure 4.9). Vertically, the stratum extends from ground surface to a maximum excavated depth of ca.
0.05–0.14 cm below ground surface. It was excavated to a maximum thickness, at its interface with Stratum
IV, of ca. 0.09 m.
Texture: Stratum III is the confined to units excavated inside the dripline in the western portion of the
rockshelter. Stratum III overlies Stratum VIII and underlies Stratum V. Stratum III can best be classified
as a channery sand. For the sand sized fraction, Stratum III exhibits a median grain size of 0.887 with
the primary modal peak occurring at 1 mm (0 phi) and a standard deviation value of 0.1004. The stratum
exhibits a skewness value of 1.l4 and a kurtosis value of 0.165. The stratum was deposited primarily by
a series of short-lived autogenic events contributed by slopewash and sheetwash sediment input into the
western confines of the site inside the extant dripline as well as from minor attrition from the roof and walls
of the shelter.
Description: Stratum III is a non-organic, semi-compact, friable sand horizon. Color varies from light
brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2 [moist]) on the surface of the site to dark gray (7.5YR 4/1 [moist]) where it is a
substratum. East 24.50 east meter line and south of the 19 north meter line Stratum III is a surficial stratum.
West 24.50 east meter line and north of the 19 north meter line Stratum III is a subsurface stratum. East of
the 23 east meter line, Stratum III is contained within Stratum IV. West of the 23 east meter line, Stratum
III underlies Stratum V and overlies Stratum VIII. Stratum III is located in the western portion of the
rockshelter’s interior which is under the influence of the western talus slope and is susceptible to sheetwash
deposition. This accounts for its stratigraphic position as both a surficial and non-surficial stratum.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum III consist of flaked stone
debitage. Historic artifacts consist solely of glass. Ecofactual materials recovered from Stratum III consist
of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. No cultural features were identified in
Stratum III.

Stratum IV (Field Designation F3) (surficial stratum in most excavation units)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum IV is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site; however, it
occurs both inside and outside the extant dripline and on the terrace north of the rockshelter (see Figure 4.9).
Vertically, the stratum extends from ground surface to varying maximum excavated thicknesses contingent
upon the location of the excavation unit. Inside the dripline at its southern extent Stratum IV varies form
only several millimeters thick to a maximum thickness of ca. 0.32 m. Outside the dripline on the talus
slope at its interface with Stratum II, Stratum IV varies from a minimum of ca. 0.30 m to a maximum of
75

ca. 0.80 m. On the terrace north of the rockshelter at its interface with Stratum X, Stratum IV varies from a
minimum excavated thickness of ca. 0.06 m to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.14 m.
Texture: Stratum IV is mapped both inside and outside the extant dripline and is the surface stratum
across most excavation units at the site. Outside the dripline, Stratum IV is and organic-rich channery
sand and is the surface epipedon or A horizon outside the dripline on the talus slope. The stratum is also
mapped on the bedrock bench to the north above the rockshelter. Stratum IV is comprised of both mineral
and organic matter. The stratum thickest expression is found outside the dripline where organic activity is
greatest. Outside the dripline the sand sized fraction for Stratum IV exhibited a median grain size of 0.98
mm and a standard deviation value of 0.21. The sample displayed a positive skewness value (2.04) and a
kurtosis value of 2.90. Inside the dripline the stratum was finer grained with less rock fragments present
and exhibited a median grain size for the sand sized fraction of 0.64 mm and a standard deviation value of
0.16. The sample positively skewed with a value of 2.09 and a kurtosis value of 3.75. The sand fraction both
inside and outside the dripline shows two modal peaks in the sand sized fraction occurring at 1 mm and 4
mm, respectively.
Description: Stratum IV is a moderately organic rich, fairly compact to compact, friable channery
sand horizon. Color varies from black (7.5YR 2.5/1 [moist]) through very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1 [moist]),
black (10YR 2/1 [moist]), black (10YR 3/1 [moist]), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2 [moist]), dark
gray (10YR 4/1 [moist]), very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1 [moist]), very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2 [moist]),
dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2 [moist]) to light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 [moist]). When dry the color varies
from very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) through very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2),
dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1 and 10YR 6/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), black (2.5Y 2.5/1), very
dark gray (2.5Y 3/1), very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), dark gray (2.5Y 4/1), gray (2.5Y 6/1) to light
brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2). Inside the extant dripline it is separated from numerous underlying strata by
abrupt and smooth to wavy interfaces (boundaries). Outside the dripline on the talus slope it is separated
from the underlying Stratum II by a gradual (5–15 cm) interface (boundary). On the terrace north of the
rockshelter it is separated from the underlying Stratum X by an abrupt and smooth to wavy interface
(boundary). Limestone pebbles through small boulders occur throughout the stratum, as do roots, rootlets,
and invertebrate faunal remains. The boulders are confined to excavation units in the immediately inside
and outside of the extant dripline. Evidence of bioturbation is present.
Within Stratum IV a pavement of large pebble to cobble sized tabular (ca. ≤ 5 cm thick) limestone
fragments was documented, initially, in excavation unit 25R19. This excavation unit was located immediately
inside the extant dripline at the southern end of the talus slope trench. Horizontally, this pavement totally
covered excavation unit 25R19. Vertically, it appeared on the 25 cm floor of Stratum IV and did not
extend north of the 20 North meter line (i.e., the extant dripline). On the basis of these facts this pavement
was defined as a substratum (Field Designation F5) to Stratum IV. Further excavation revealed that this
pavement continued to the east ca. 2 m parallel to the dripline into excavation units 26R19 and 27R19.
Further excavation also revealed that the matrix between the tabular limestone fragments was consistent
with Stratum IV in texture, compaction, friability, and color. Based upon these facts F 5 was subsequently
redefined as a depositional event. The trigger for this depositional event was the release of a small block
from the roof of the rockshelter along the dripline. This block measured ca. 0.70 m N–S × ca 1.0 m E–W
× ca. 0.50 m thick. The block was released from a section of the parent outcrop immediately adjacent to
a facies of the bedrock, exposed on the ceiling of the rockshelter, where the bedding planes are relatively
thin (ca. ≤5 cm thick). After the release of the aforementioned block this facies was exposed to increased
weathering in the form of water runoff and percolation resulting in the release of the tabular limestone
fragments .
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum IV consist of flaked stone tools
and flaked stone debitage. Historic artifacts consist of glass, ceramic, metal, and miscellaneous items most
76

of which were recovered from the site’s surface outside the extant dripline. Ecofactual materials recovered
from Stratum IV consist of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. Two cultural
features were identified in Stratum IV (see Cultural Features).

Stratum V (Field Designation F10) (surficial stratum in some units inside the extant dripline)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum V is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified inside the extant dripline (see Figure 4.9). Vertically, the surface of the stratum extends from
ground surface in the southern portions of the rockshelter’s interior to a maximum excavated thickness of
ca. 0.09 m below ground surface in the western portion of the rockshelter’s interior. It was excavated to a
maximum thickness, at its interface with Stratum VIII, of ca. 0.10 m.
Texture: Stratum V is the most laterally persistent and thickest stratum at the site. Stratum V is the
surface stratum in some units inside the dripline and underlies Stratum IV in most cases outside the dripline.
Excluding the limestone rock channers coarser than 4 mm in size, Stratum V is coarse carbonate sand. For
the sand sized fraction, Stratum V exhibits a median grain size of 0.947 mm and a standard deviation of
0.111. The stratum is positively skewed (1.19) and is moderately leptokurtic with a kurtosis value of 0.18.
The sand sized fraction exhibits a unimodal peak occurring in the 1 mm size class. A small secondary modal
peak occurs in the 2 mm modal size class. Stratum V can best be classified as a cobbly pebbly gravelly
coarse carbonate sand. Inside the dripline the stratum contained far fewer rock fragments with primarily
sediment deposition from grain by grain attrition and minor rock fall while outside the dripline the stratum
is comprised principally of colluvial sediments deposited by mass wasting processes. The stratum contains
abundant (40–60 percent) matrix supported gravel thru cobble size angular limestone rock fragments. The
angular limestone rock fragments are derived primarily from limestone weathered from the roof of the
shelter.
Description: Stratum V is a non-organic, semi-compact, friable sand horizon of apparent with
numerous limestone fragments of attrition deposition. Color varies from grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2 [moist])
through light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 [moist]). East of the 24.50 east meter line and south of the 19 north
meter line Stratum V is a surficial stratum. East of the 23 east meter line, Stratum V is contained within
Stratum IV. West of the 23 east meter line, Stratum V underlies Stratum V and overlies Strata III and VIII.
Stratum V is located in the western portion of the rockshelter’s interior which is under the influence of the
western talus slope and is susceptible to sheetwash deposition. This accounts for its stratigraphic position
as both a surficial and non-surficial stratum.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum V consist of flaked stone tools
and flaked stone debitage. Gass was also recovered from Stratum V. Ecofactual materials recovered from
Stratum V consist of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. Five cultural features
were identified in Stratum V (see Cultural Features).

Stratum VI (Field Designation F11) (surficial stratum in some units inside the extant dripline)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum VI is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified inside the extant dripline. Vertically, the surface of the stratum extends from ground surface in the
southern portions of the rockshelter’s interior. It was excavated to a maximum excavated thickness, at its
interface with Feature II, of ca. 0.10 m.
Texture: Stratum VI is restricted to the area lying inside the extant dripline at the site. Stratum VII
can be defined as a channery sand. For the sand sized fraction the stratum exhibited a median grain size of
0.95 mm and a standard deviation value of 0.11. The stratum is positively skewed with a value of 1.19 and
a kurtosis value of 0.19. The primary modal peak for the sand sized fraction occurs in the 1 mm (0 phi) size
class. The stratum is comprised principally sediments contributed from grain attrition from the roof as well
as minor rock fall. Stratum VI is much better sorted that Stratum VII and VIII.

77

Description: Stratum VI is a non-compact, highly friable channery sand horizon of apparent attrition
deposition (Stratum V) intermixed with undecomposed deciduous leaf litter. Matrix color varies from
grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2 [moist]) through light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 [moist]). This sediment and leaf litter
was deposited in a shallow depression. After excavation it was determined that the depression in which
Stratum VI was deposited was in fact a cultural feature (see Feature II). It was excavated in units 25R16
and 25R17.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum VI consist of flaked stone
debitage. Historic artifacts consist solely of glass. Ecofactual materials recovered from Stratum VI consist
of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. No cultural features were identified in
Stratum VI.

Stratum VII (Field Designation F14)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum VII is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified inside the extant dripline. Vertically, the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.09 m to
0.23 m below ground surface, and it extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.07 m.
Texture: Stratum VII is restricted to the interior portion of the site, inside the extant dripline. The
stratum is primarily situated in the central portion of the site interior lying east of Stratum VIII. The stratum
is a channery sand. There is clearly decreasing rock fragments to the east in the stratum. For the sand sized
fraction Stratum VII exhibited a median grain size of 1.93 mm and a standard deviation value of 0.12. The
stratum is positively skewed (0.91) and yielded a negative kurtosis value of -1.02.
Description: Stratum VII is a substratum to Stratum IV and Stratum V inside the dripline near the
center of the rockshelter (in units immediately contiguous to Test Pit #3). Its upper levels are highly mottled,
an admixture of attrition and more organic colluviallay deposited (i.e., sheet wash) sediments. In units
28R19 and 29R19 numerous tabular limestone rock fragments are present. In the vicinity of the 20 north
meter line this clastic material is vertically continuous through the stratum. In the southeast corner of 29R19
a single tabular, small boulder, ca. 10 cm thick, remains in situ. As one moves south away from the dripline
the clastic material decreases in quantity rapidly and dramatically. By the 19 north meter line very little
clastic material is found within Stratum VII. The clasts that are present are thin, tabular pebble to small
cobble sized. With depth the mottling of the sediments decreases, particularly the further south one moves.
Along the 18 north meter line the Stratum VII, 5–10 cm level is very reminiscent of Stratum V, in color and
composition. Color varies from light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 [moist]) to light gray (2.5Y 7/2 [moist]).
Stratum VII is separated from the overlying Strata VI and V and the underlying Stratum IX by an
abrupt and smooth to wavy interfaces (boundaries).
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum VII consist of flaked stone tools
and flaked stone debitage. No historic artifacts were recovered from Stratum V. Ecofactual materials
recovered from Stratum VII consist of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. No
cultural features were identified in Stratum VII.

Stratum VIII (Field Designation F15)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum VIII is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified inside the extant dripline (see Figure 4.9). Vertically, the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth
of ca. 0.14 m to 0.20 m below ground surface, and it extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.06
m.
Texture: Stratum VIII is confined to the interior portion of the site and to the western portion of the
east-west trench. The stratum is coarse grained with abundant angular limestone rock fragments having
been deposited by slopewash and creep from the western talus slope into the confines of the site. Stratum
VIII can be classified as a channery sand. For the sand sized fraction, Stratum VIII displayed three modal
peaks occurring at 1 mm, 2mm and 4 mm respectively. The stratum exhibited a median grain size in the
78

sand sized fraction of 1.83 mm and a standard deviation of 0.13. The skewness value was 0.73 and the
kurtosis value was -1.26. Stratum VIII is a mixture of sediments contributed by slopewash as well as from
grain by grain attrition and rock fall from the shelter roof and wall.
Description: Stratum VIII is a discontinuous substratum inside the dripline. It is confined to units
22R19 and 23R19 in the western extreme of the east/west trench. It consists of non-compact, highly friable
attrition deposited sediment intermixed with limestone pebbles and minor amounts of colluvial sediment.
Color varies from dark gray (2.5Y 4/1; dry) through white (2.5Y 8/1; dry) through dark gray (10YR 4/1;
dry) to very pale brown (10YR 8/2; dry). Stratum VIII is separated from the overlying Strata IV by an
abrupt and smooth to wavy interface (boundary).
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum VIII consist of flaked stone
debitage. No historic artifacts were recovered from Stratum VIII. Ecofactual materials recovered from
Stratum VIII consist of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. No cultural features
were identified in Stratum VIII.

Stratum IX (Field Designations F16, F19)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum IX is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site (see Figure
4.9). It was identified in nine excavation units (22R19–29R19 and 28R19) inside the extant dripline.
Vertically, the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.17 m to 0.35 m below ground surface, and it
extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.30 m.
Texture: Stratum IX is confined to the interior portion of the site. The stratum is decidedly coarser
grained in those excavation units to the west from rock contributed by slopewash, while to the east the
stratum contains far fewer rock fragments with those having been contribute primarily from roof fall.
Stratum IX can be classified as a channery sand. For the sand sized fraction, Stratum IX displayed three
modal peaks occurring at 1 mm, 2mm, and 4 mm respectively. The stratum exhibited a median grain size
in the sand sized fraction of 1.25 mm and a standard deviation of 0.25. The skewness value was 0.86 and
the kurtosis value was -1.11. Stratum IX is comprised of sediments supplied from grain by grain attrition
and minor rock fall on the east and from coarse colluvium, grain by grain attrition and rock fall on the west.
Description: Stratum IX is a substratum to Stratum IV inside the dripline. It was identified in 11
excavation units (21R19, 23R19, 24R19, 25R19, 26R19,27R19, 28R18, 28R19, 29R18, 29R19, and 29R20)
in the east-west trench. It consists of fairly compact to compact, friable silty clay sediment intermixed with
limestone pebbles through boulders and minor amounts of colluvial sediment in the western interior of the
rockshelter. Color varies from very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1 [moist]) through gray (2.5Y 5/1 [moist]) to dark
gray (10YR 4/1 [moist]). Stratum IX is separated from the overlying Strata IV by an abrupt and smooth to
wavy interface (boundary). Excavation did not penetrate Stratum IX.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum IX consist of flaked stone tools
and flaked stone debitage. A single piece of historic glass was recovered. Ecofactual materials recovered
from Stratum IX consist of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. Apparently
thermally altered limestone pebbles (angular) and cobbles were also recovered. Two cultural features were
identified in Stratum IX (see Cultural Features).

Stratum X (Field Designation F9)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum X is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified in only two excavation units on the terrace north of the rockshelter, 28R32 and 28R33. Vertically,
the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.07 m to 0.15 m below ground surface, and it extends to
a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.60 m.
Texture: Stratum X is confined to the flat structural bench which lies to the north of the rockshelter.
Stratum X is overlain by Stratum IV and underlain by Stratum XI. Stratum X can be classified as an organic
rich A2 horizon. The stratum can be described as a channery sand. For the sand sized fraction, the stratum
79

exhibits a median grain size of 0.57 mm and a standard deviation of 0.69. The stratum is positively skewed
(1.23) and exhibits a kurtosis value of 2.03.
Description: Stratum X is a semi-compact, friable channery sand. Color varies from very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2 [moist]) to black (10YR 2/1 [moist]). Sub-angular to sub-rounded limestone pebbles
through cobbles occur throughout the stratum, as do roots, rootlets, and invertebrate faunal remains.
Evidence of bioturbation is evidenced and decreases with depth. Stratum X is separated from the overlying
Strata IV by an abrupt and smooth to wavy interface (boundary) and from the underlying Stratum XI by a
clear (2–5 cm) and smooth to wavy interface (boundary).
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum X consist of flaked stone debitage.
No historic artifacts were recovered from Stratum X. Ecofactual materials recovered from Stratum X consist
of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains and floral remains. No cultural features were identified in
Stratum X.

Stratum XI (Field Designation F25)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum XI is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified in only two excavation units on the terrace north of the rockshelter, 28R32 and 28R33. Vertically,
the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.67 m to 0.75 m below ground surface, and it extends to
a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 0.35 m.
Texture: Stratum XI lies on the structural bedrock bench to the north of the rockshelter. Stratum XI is
the lower part of the surface epipedon which has formed on the structural bench above the rock shelter. The
stratum can be pedogenically classified as an organic rich A3 horizon. The stratum can best be classified as
a channery sand with a primary modal peak occurring at 1 mm for the sand sized fraction. The median grain
size and standard deviation for the sand sized fraction is 0.57 mm and 0.68 mm, respectively. The sample
is positively skewed (1.48) with a kurtosis value of 1.98.
Description: Stratum XI is a semi-compact, friable channery sand. Color varies from very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2 [moist]) through very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2 [moist]) to black (10YR
2/1 [moist]). Stratum XI is separated from the overlying Strata X by a clear (2–5 cm) and smooth to
wavy interface (boundary) and from the underlying Stratum XII by a clear (2–5 cm) to gradual (5–15 cm)
and wavy interface (boundary). Pebble- through cobble-sized, sub-angular to sub-rounded limestone rock
fragments occur throughout the stratum, as do roots, rootlets, and invertebrate faunal remains. Evidence
of bioturbation is minimal. The clastic portion of Stratum XI consist of numerous limestone channers all
of which are lying flat. This varies from the overlying Stratum X where the clasts consist of spheroidally
weathered sub-angular to sub-rounded limestone pebble through cobble sized rock fragments
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum XI consist of flaked stone debitage.
The only historic artifact recovered from Stratum XI was a single piece of glass. Ecofactual materials
recovered from Stratum XI consist of invertebrate faunal remains. No cultural features were identified in
Stratum XI.

Stratum XII (Field Designation F26)
Extent: Horizontally, Stratum XII is discontinuous across the excavated portion of the site. It was
identified in only two excavation unit on the terrace north of the rockshelter, 28R32 and 28R33. Vertically,
the surface of the stratum occurs at a depth of ca. 0.87 m to 1.10 m below ground surface, and it extends to
a maximum excavated thickness of 0.35 m.
Texture: Stratum XII lies on the structural bedrock bench to the north of the rockshelter. Stratum XII
is the basal horizon or stratum encountered during excavation on the bench and is overlain by Stratum XI.
Stratum XII can best be classified as a Bk horizon formed from the in situ weathering of the limestone that
forms the roof the shelter. The stratum can best be classified as a channery sand with a primary modal peak
occurring at 1 mm for the sand sized fraction. The median grain size and standard deviation for the sand
80

sized fraction is 0.64 mm and 0.80 respectively. The sample is positively skewed (1.01) with a kurtosis
value of 1.99.
Description: Stratum XII is a semi-compact, friable silty clay horizon. Color varies from very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2 [moist]) through dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2 [moist]), brown (10YR 4/3
[moist]), to very brown (10YR 5/3 [moist]). Stratum XII is separated from the overlying Strata XI by a clear
(2–5 cm) to gradual (5–15 cm) and wavy interface (boundary). In excavation unit 28R32 excavation was
terminated at the Stratum XII 15 cm floor. In excavation unit 28R33 Stratum XII achieved its maximum
thickness of 0.35 m where apparent bedrock was exposed. Stratum XII, on the terrace north of the rockshelter,
resembles and may correspond to Stratum II, on the talus slope.
Cultural Associations: Prehistoric artifacts recovered from Stratum XII consist of flaked stone
debitage. No historic artifacts were recovered from Stratum XII. Ecofactual materials recovered from
Stratum XII consist of invertebrate faunal remains. No cultural features were identified in Stratum XII.

Summary of Cultural Features
J. L. Yedlowski and J. M. Adovasio
The following descriptions of the nine cultural features identified and excavated at Rockshelter A
include quantitative data (e.g., maximum width, thickness, etc.), qualitative data (e.g., feature shape), and
artifactual and ecofactual associations. All color designations were determined using a standard Munsell
Soil Color chart (2000). The features include one fire floor with associated ash lens, two fire features, one
fire feature/floor, two occupation/activity areas, one functionally indeterminate pit, and two functionally
indeterminate stains (Table 4.2). Except for a single Darl projectile point recovered from Feature VI, none
of the other features yielded temporally diagnostic artifacts.

Feature I (Field Designation F6): Probable Fire Floor with Associated Ash Lens
Description: This feature is irregular to crescent shaped in plan, lenticular in cross section, and
surrounded to the south and east by a stratified ash lens. The stratified fill consists of highly mottled black
(2.5Y 2.5/1 [moist]) and very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2 [moist]) Stratum IV sediment interspersed with
relatively large quantities of charcoal flecks (Figures 4.10 and 4.11).

E–W Dimension: ca. 100 cm.

Thickness: ca. 7 cm.
Plan: (see Figure 4.11).
Profile: N–S (see Figures 4.9 and 4.11).

Figure 4.11. Plan and profile maps of Feature I at Rockshelter A.
Comments: Feature I originates at the ca. 2 cm floor of Stratum IV ca. 2 cm below ground surface
and extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 7 cm. It was identified in excavation units 25R18
and extends into units 25R17, 24R18, and 26R18. Excavation in the latter two units was not conducted.
This feature is designated a probable fire floor on the basis of its configuration and associations of possible
thermally altered limestone pebbles, the presence of charcoal flecks, and associated ash lens. Feature I
is contiguous to the Stratum V interface and Feature II. Though Feature I produced lithic debitage, no
temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered. The associated radiocarbon assays suggest an
Historic ascription for this feature. The calibrated date range is ca. AD 1707–1940 (see Radiocarbon
Chronology, below; see Chapter 10).

Feature II (Field Designation F12): Probable Fire Feature
Description: This feature is irregular to ovoid shaped in plan and basin-shaped in cross section. It
appeared as a light gray (10YR 7/1 and 5YR 7/1; dry) stain in the surrounding white (2.5Y 8/1; dry) Stratum
V (Figures 4.12–4.14).

Comments: Feature II originates variously within Stratum V, 0–5 cm arbitrary level, ca. 1–5 cm below
ground surface and extends a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 6 cm. It was identified in excavation
units 25R17 and extends into units 25R16, 26R16, and 26R17. Excavation in the latter two units was not
conducted. This feature is designated a probable fire feature on the basis of its configuration and associations
of charcoal flecks. Feature II is contiguous to the Feature I ash lens. No temporally diagnostic flaked
stone tools were recovered from the feature. One radiocarbon assay (OxA-21394) is available from this
feature and falls within the recent Historic period. The feature also produced historic artifacts. Based on the
radiocarbon assay and the recovered artifact suite, this feature is probably of Historic ascription.

Feature III (Field Designation F13): Probable Occupation/Activity Area
Description: This feature is irregular to ovoid shaped in plan and lenticular to basin shaped in cross
section. It appears as a dark gray (10YR 4/1 and 2.5Y 3/1 [moist]) stain in the surrounding Stratum IV and
Stratum IX. The unstratified and variable colored fill is interspersed with limestone pebbles and cobbles
(Figures 4.15 and 4.16).

Comments: Feature III originates variously within Stratum IV and Stratum IX, ca. 31–50 cm below
ground surface and extends a maximum excavated depth of 47 cm. In the western ca. one-half of excavation
unit 24R19 Feature III lies directly upon what appeared to be bedrock. It was identified in excavation
units 24R19, 25R19, and 25R20 and extends into units 23R19, 24R18, 24R20, and 25R18. Excavation in
the latter four units was not conducted. This feature is designated a probable occupation/activity area on
the basis of its configuration and associations of flaked stone debitage and charcoal flecks. No temporally
diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience of this feature, base

Feature IV (Field Designation F17): Functionally Indeterminate Stain
Description: This feature is irregularly shaped in plan and lenticular to basin shaped in cross section.
It appears as a light gray (10YR 7/2; dry) stain in the surrounding pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2; dry) Stratum V.
The stratified and variably colored fill is interspersed with dispersed charcoal flecks (Figures 4.17–4.19).

This feature lies directly adjacent to Features II and V. In fact, the construction/excavation of Feature II
directly impacted the northern extent of Feature IV. This feature is designated a probable fire pit on the basis
of its configuration and association of charcoal flecks. No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were
recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience of this feature, base upon its stratigraphic position, is
ascribed to the Late Prehistoric period.

line, lensing out to the north and east, resulting in a thin lenticular cross section. Due to the ephemeral
nature of the feature no profile maps were constructed.
After the Stratum V, 5–10 cm level beneath Feature V was excavated it became obvious that Feature
V pre-dates Feature IV on the basis of superposition. It is still possible that Feature V may be associated
with Feature II, given its proximity to both Feature II and the ephemeral nature of the feature. Feature II
was initially exposed in Stratum V, 0–5 cm, literally < 1 cm to 2 cm below the surface on which Feature II
was located (i.e., the Stratum V, 0 floor).
No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience
of this feature, base upon its stratigraphic position, is ascribed to the Late Prehistoric period.

Feature VI (Field Designation F21): Probable Occupation/Activity Area
Description: This feature is of unknown horizontal configuration and lenticular cross section. It
appears as a multi-colored (grayish brown - 10YR5/2, 10YR 6/1 - gray, 10YR 7/1 - light gray, gray - 2.5Y
6/1, and light gray - 2.5Y 7/2; dry) stain in the surrounding white (2.5Y 8/1, dry) Stratum V (Figures 4.21

Comments: Feature VI originates variously within the Stratum V, 10–15 cm arbitrary level, beginning
at the ca. 14 cm floor, ca. 14 to 15 cm below ground surface. It extends to the apparent bedrock basement
of the rockshelter, a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 36 cm. It was identified in excavation unit 25R16
and extends into units 24R16, 24R17, 25R15, 25R17, 26R15, and 26R16. Excavation in the latter six
units was not conducted. This feature is designated a probable occupation/activity area on the basis of its
configuration, the stratified nature of its sediment, and association of charcoal flecks. The surface of this
feature was impacted by the excavation of Feature II. It also directly underlies Features IV and V in unit
25R16; however, these two features did not directly impact Feature VI.
No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Three radiocarbon assays
are available from this feature. Of these assays only one (OxA-21508) falls within the expected temporal
range. The other two (OxA-21509 and OxA-21510) fall within the recent Historic period. Additionally, this
feature produced two historic artifacts. Based on its stratigraphic position, the contradictory radiocarbon
assays, and the mixed artifact suite, this feature is presumed to be a disturbed Late Prehistoric phenomenon.

Feature VII (Field Designation F-22 and F-24): Probable Fire Pit
Description: This feature is roughly oval in plan and basin shaped in cross section. It appears as a dark
gray (10YR 4/1; dry) stain in the surrounding dark gray (2.5Y 4/1; dry) Stratum IX (Figures 4.23 and 4.24).

Comments: Feature VII originates variously within the Stratum IX, 0–5 cm arbitrary level, between
the ca. 3 cm and 5 cm floors, ca. 40–45 cm below ground surface. It extends to a maximum excavated
thickness of ca. 17 cm. It was identified in excavation units 27R19, 28R18, and 28R19 and extends into unit
27R18. Excavation in the latter unit was not conducted. This feature is designated a probable fire pit on the
basis of its configuration and association of apparently thermally alerted limestone pebbles and cobbles and
charcoal flecks.
Upon excavation of the southeast quadrant of Feature VII, 0–5 cm in 28R19 it became apparent that
a second feature (field designation F 24) was in fact continuous with Feature VII. Therefore, F 24 was
redefined as Feature VII. As a result of this redefinition the northeast perimeter of Feature VII was redefined.
This feature may be continuous with the Feature 1 defined during the 1994 excavation of Test Pit #3
(Trierweiler 1994); however, this is difficult to determine with certainty since the documentation of Feature
1 (see Trierweiler 1994) is limited and only the southwest quadrant of Feature VII in 28R19 was excavated.
No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience
of this feature, base upon its stratigraphic position, is ascribed to the Late Prehistoric period.

Feature VIII (Field Designation F-23): Functionally Indeterminate Pit
Description: This feature is of unknown horizontal configuration and basin shaped in cross section. It
appears as a light grayish brown (10YR 6/2 [moist]), grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2 [moist]), and gray (2.5Y 5/1
[moist]) stain in the surrounding light grayish brown (10YR 6/2 [moist]), grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2 [moist]),

Comments: Feature VIII is an apparent pit excavated into Feature VI. It was noticed in the profile
along the 16.50 north meter line after the southeast quadrant of Feature VI had been excavated. It was not
noticed as the southeast quadrant was being excavated, undoubtedly as a result of the patch work of stains
which comprise Feature VI and the fact that the construction of Feature II truncated/destroyed the upper
portion both of the features. After being recognized in this profile, Feature VIII was also recognized in the
Feature VI profile along the 26 east meter line. The feature is located between the ca. 25.82 and the 26.00
east meter lines and the ca. 16.34 and 16.50+ north meter lines.
As the Feature VI, 5–10 cm arbitrary level is excavated, an attempt was made to identify the northern
perimeter in the northeast quadrant of Feature VI. All fill from Feature VIII in the northeast quadrant of
Feature VI was excavated separately from Feature VI and collected as floatation samples. Feature VIII
remains unexcavated in 26R16.
No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience
of this feature, base upon its stratigraphic position and the temporal provenience of Feature VI, is ascribed
to the Late Prehistoric period.

Feature IX (Field Designation F-27): Functionally Indeterminate Stain
Description: This feature is of unknown horizontal configuration and lenticular/basin shaped in cross
section. It appears as a gray (10YR 6/1; dry) stain (see Comments, below) in the surrounding dark gray
(10YR 4/1 [moist]) Stratum IV.

Comments: Feature IX was initially exposed in 2005 along the 19 north meter line in excavation
unit 24R19. The feature extended into 24R19 a maximum of ca. 3 cm. When exposed in profile the feature
appeared to be a decomposing limestone cobble. In 2006 the 19 north meter line in 24R19 was refaced, at
which time it was decided to remove the decomposed limestone. At that time it was determined that in fact
this was not decomposed limestone, but rather a highly compact gray (10YR 6/1, dry) sediment. At that
time it was decided to redefine this phenomenon as Feature IX.
Feature IX originates variously within the Stratum IV, 25–30 cm arbitrary level, ca.19 to 27 cm below
ground surface. It extends to a maximum excavated thickness of ca. 8 cm. It was identified in excavation
units 24R19 and extends into unit 24R18. Excavation in the latter unit was not conducted. This feature is
designated a functionally indeterminate stain on the basis of its configuration and composition.
No temporally diagnostic flaked stone tools were recovered from the feature. Temporal provenience
of this feature, base upon its stratigraphic position, is ascribed to the Late Prehistoric period.

Radiocarbon Chronology
J. M. Adovasio and J. L. Yedlowski
A total of 16 radiocarbon samples were submitted by MAI for radiocarbon assay, which combined
with three assays available from the 1994 testing of the site (Trierweiler 1996:217–218) accounts for a total
of 19 radiocarbon determinations for the site (Tables 4.3 and 4.4). The MAI samples were of sufficient size
to produce dates and were composed almost exclusively of charcoal, except for a single sample of charred
seeds. Eight of the MAI samples were processed by the University of California Irvine AMS laboratory,
and the remaining eight MAI samples were processed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the
History of Art, University of Oxford. All three of the determinations reported for the site by Trierweiler
(1996:217–218) were obtained from wood charcoal, and the samples were processed by the University of
Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory (one sample) and Beta Analytic (two samples).
Where possible, MAI samples for radiometric dating were selected from the fill of cultural features
such as fire hearths or fire floors. In the absence of cultural features, “free” charcoal samples from the
general fill of an arbitrary unit within a natural stratum were collected from individual excavation units.
Two of the Trierweiler (1996:217–218) radiometric samples were collected from cultural features, one
a hearth, and the other a concentration of burned rock which may have been a hearth. The third sample
derived from fill directly below the burned rock concentration/hearth feature (Trierweiler 1996:218).
The rationale for sample selections of the MAI suite was straightforward. It was initially decided to
select samples from cultural features and/or the general fill of strata with extensive horizontal expression.
Further, it was determined that the largest and most laterally extensive cultural feature, Feature I, should
have multiple samples assayed from various depths in all of its quadrants. The extensive and intensive
testing of charcoal from Feature I was deemed necessary not only because of its dimensions but also
because portions of it contained or were in close proximity to historic materials, while other segments
contained or were juxtaposed to prehistoric materials.
As noted above, the TRC-MA samples derived from within (n=2) or near (n=1) cultural features from
varying arbitrary levels in one of the TRC-MA test pits.
No radiocarbon samples were processed from Strata I, II, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI or XII. Because Strata
III, IV, and V have surficial exposures in different portions of the site, listing their 14C assays in numerical
order, that is by stratum number, is misleading. Consequently, the results of the MAI assays from Strata III
through V are presented in Table 4.3 by arbitrary level, and when applicable, by cultural feature. Similarly,
as Stratum IX is a subdivision of Stratum IV within the dripline, the solitary date from this lithostratigraphic
unit is included with the other Stratum IV dates. The results of the TRC-MA assays are also presented in
Table 4.4. The TRC-MA assays are ordered by depth (in centimeters) below modern ground surface and,
where possible, by feature.
All dates were determined using the half life of 5,568 years. Isotopic fractionation has been corrected
using the measured δ13C values. The indicated values were measured on stable isotope mass spectrometers.
(For details of the Oxford Laboratory chemical pretreatment, target preparation, and AMS measurement
see Bronk Ramsey, Higham, Bowles, and Hedges 2004; Bronk Ramsey, Highham, and Leach 2004.) The
protocols for the Trierweiler (1996:217–218) samples were not specified by the authors. Calibrations of all
of the MAI samples were generated via OxCal (4.1) using the IntCal09 dataset. The calibration program
used for the TRC-MA samples is unknown.
Interpretation of the calibrated ages of the MAI samples followed standard protocols in most cases.
The maximum calibrated age ranges are listed in Table 4.3. In discussing these assays in various sections of
this report, the primary calibration intercepts with the highest statistical probability are usually employed.
However, in several cases, secondary intercepts seemed to more accurately reflect actual ages based on
cross-dated associated cultural materials. Where secondary intercepts were employed, these have been
noted.

On the basis of the radiocarbon assays alone, the earliest occupation of Rockshelter A dates to cal
AD 680–740 while the latest visitation/utilization is cal AD 1730–1926 using the most probable calibration
intercept (89.4 percent) for sample OX-21394. Between these two extremes are 14 other determinations,
several of which are reversed. Cross-dated diagnostic lithic (see Chapter 5) and historic (see Chapter 6)
artifacts suggest an even longer occupation/utilization trajectory for the site. The implications of the various
dating media are discussed in Chapter 10.

5. Lithic Artifacts
A. M. Byrnes
All cultures engage in a network of innumerable interrelated social, environmental, economic, and
ideological factors, one of which—for most prehistoric cultures, at least—is lithic technology. Because each
of these factors affects and is affected by other parts of the cultural network, the study of any one of them
has the potential to inform both itself and any other(s) in the network. Although lithic artifact analysis aims
to understand elements of the design, mechanics, and process of tool production, its utility is not restricted
to illuminating technological nuance. Because stone tools are manufactured with the intention of fulfilling
some subsistence-oriented, domestic, artistic, or social requirement, the specific tools that are made and the
production strategy implemented in their manufacture are chosen in anticipation of and in response to many
factors (Nelson 1991; Yerkes and Kardulias 1993). Research has explored lithic technology and its potential
relationships to the abundance and distribution of resource patches (Bleed 1986); the structure of residential
or task-group mobility employed to target those resources (Boldurian 1991; Bamforth and Becker 2000;
Kelly and Todd 1988; Parry and Kelly 1987; Shott 1986); and the conveyance of social meaning through
style (Barton 1997:150; Weissner 1983; Wobst 1977). Time and energy constraints (Torrence 1989),
situational needs (Binford 1979:255), relative access to raw materials (Andrefsky 1994a, 1994b; Bamforth
1986; Collins 1975:21), and any number of other immediate or long-term considerations may also render
particular technological options more or less effective, desirable, or practical than others (Amick 1994).
Given the close relationship between such elements, it follows that lithic analysis has the potential to
provide insight into technology and technological organization, as well as a wider range of behaviors that
were central to daily life. It is with this understanding that the analysis of the Rockshelter A chipped stone
assemblage was approached; as such, this chapter elucidates specific aspects of the technology employed at
the Rockshelter A site while also drawing inferences about broader issues of site use, population movement,
and effects of raw material abundance on technological decision-making.
This document also aims to contribute to the database of multicomponent archaeological sites and
thereby elucidate a number of issues that remain unresolved in Central Texas prehistory. Collins (1995),
for example, outlines several difficulties that impact the current understanding of the degree of change/
continuity between major prehistoric periods and their constituent phases, many of which are the result of
a gap between prehistoric and ethnographic accounts of indigenous peoples or a scarcity of archaeological
gisements in the region. The rarity within the region of such sites—that is, those whose components are
adequately separated by sediments, thus permitting the isolation and evaluation of discrete components—
has limited the extent to which technological or other shifts can be identified within and between localities.
Unfortunately in the case of Rockshelter A, the site’s compressed deposits, the co-mingling of Late
Prehistoric and Archaic materials in portions of the site, and its general taphonomic history disqualify it as a
gisement and preclude characterization of and potential interrelationships between its individual prehistoric
components.
Given that these conditions pertain to much of the recovered assemblage, any interpretation of the site
components offered herein should be considered tentative if not tenuous. However, the site and immediate
area nonetheless contained Early Archaic through Late Prehistoric diagnostics and, in some areas of the site,
the boundary between these materials was somewhat clearer than in other portions of the site. Moreover, the
site’s apparent taphonomic issues are not believed to have led to dramatic vertical displacement of artifacts,
as diagnostics appear to be in proper chrono-stratigraphic order in most cases. It therefore appears that
101

Rockshelter A is still valuable to time-transgressive examination of the region’s chipped stone technology―
at least at the scale of differentiating between Archaic and Late Prehistoric components―despite the fact the
comparisons between individual Late Prehistoric and Archaic components cannot be made with certainty.

Methodology
The items recovered from the 1994 testing of Rockshelter A were analyzed by TRC Mariah Associates
(TRC-MA [Trierweiler 1994:A-731–A-739, 1996:214–222]) and reanalyzed by Mercyhurst Archaeological
Institute (MAI) as part of the present investigation. Due to differences in methodology employed for the two
field recovery projects, the 1994 materials cannot be fully integrated into the rest of the site assemblage. Any
methodological approaches that are unique to the 1994 reanalysis, as well as the results of this reanalysis,
are summarized in Appendix A rather than discussed in the context of MAI’s findings unless otherwise
noted. The following review, however, details the methods common to both the reanalysis of the TRC-MA
materials and to the subsequent MAI analyses.
All stone artifacts were examined for specific attributes, which were observed macroscopically and
microscopically (using a Leica 200m 2000 dissecting microscope) and recorded in a Microsoft Access
database. Raw material determinations were based on a digital photographs, descriptions, and a comparative
collection of samples provided to MAI by the Cultural Resource Management Division at Fort Hood.
These material types, identified and described by Trierweiler (1994) and Abbot and Trierweiler (1995),
delineate the recognized material varieties available on Fort Hood. As described, raw material Types 1–17
are bedrock sources or otherwise non-alluvial in origin and Types 18–28 are channel gravels. (Types 12
and 14 were collapsed into a single type, resulting in 27 individual varieties.) Raw material determinations
made by TRC-MA analysts for the 1994 materials were presumed to be correct, as at the time of the MAI
reanalysis a comparative collection and descriptions of material samples against which to compare the
artifacts had not yet been received.
The same basic metric data were collected for most artifact classes in the assemblage. For all flaked
stone tools, cores, and provenienced debitage, maximum length measurements were taken from proximal to
distal margins of each specimen (even fragmentary specimens lacking a platform, termination, base, or tip),
and maximum width was taken perpendicular to the maximum length measurement. Maximum thickness
refers to the thickest point on a given formal tool or core, or and the thickest point distal to the platform in
the case of modified and unmodified debitage. Length, width, and thickness measurements for all artifacts,
as well as length of modified edge in the case of retouched and utilized flakes, were taken to the nearest
0.01 mm using Fowler Sylvac digital calipers. The weights of all artifacts were recorded to the nearest 0.01
g using an Ohaus Precision Standard digital scale. All recorded angles—platform angles of debitage (i.e.,
the angle formed by the dorsal face of a flake and the platform), lateral edge angles of projectile points and
bifaces, and the angles of modified edges of flake tools—were recorded to the nearest degree using a Ward’s
Natural Science Contact Goniometer.
Additional data collected that are unique to each specific artifact class are detailed below, under the
individual artifact class subheadings.

Debitage
All piece-plotted debitage, as well as debitage measuring >1 cm² recovered from screened contexts, was
fully analyzed. For each of these artifacts, the following data were recorded: all pertinent metric attributes;
platform termination characteristics (i.e., degree of platform completion [i.e., complete, incomplete, or
crushed], platform angle, platform width, thickness, and angle, and platform preparation); termination type;
approximate cortex percentage; absence or presence/degree of thermal alteration; and dorsal flake scar
count. Platform measurements were not taken for flakes whose platforms were crushed or incomplete, as
platform fragmentation would render such measurements inaccurate. Although fragmented and crushed
platforms on some specimens prevented the measurement of platform angle and/or the identification of
102

platform preparation, these attributes were recorded whenever possible. When distal, medial, or lateral
flake fragments were encountered, only raw material type, debitage type, and flake portion were recorded
due to the fragmentary, non-diagnostic and relatively uninformative nature of such debitage fragments.
Similarly, potlids, shatter, angular debris, and unmodified chert pebbles/fragments (which were observed in
abundance during excavation) in origin were recorded but not analyzed.
The 1 cm² size cutoff for debitage from screened contexts was implemented for a number of reasons.
In general terms, while such items are important and abundant components of an assemblage and their
frequencies should be (and were) counted, the size cutoff was implemented to reduce the collection of
misleading and/or technologically insignificant data that would be generated in a specious analysis of
thousands of extremely small items. More specifically, the items falling below the size cutoff included
large numbers of small, angular debris and cortex fragments that could have either been by-products of
tool manufacture or naturally fractured non-cultural chert pebbles, which are present in abundant quantities
at the site. Without being able to distinguish most items in this small size grouping as being of cultural
or non-cultural origin, these items were essentially useless. While, under most circumstances, it is not
difficult to differentiate between cultural and non-cultural materials, the large quantities of burned items
in the assemblage did complicate the analysis. The burning of both modified and unmodified cherts in
the proximity of anthropogenic and/or natural fires produced a considerable volume of thermal spalls and
potlids that could have resulted from the incidental burning of both cultural and non-cultural items. The size
cutoff off was largely a means to avoid tainting the data set with potentially non-cultural materials.
Likewise, the size cutoff reduced the likelihood of contaminating the database of intentionally
removed flake products with flake-like shatter and other items that are incidental to all reduction strategies
and thus have little to no bearing on the technological processes operating on site. It was also considered
undesirable to confuse the dimensions of small, incomplete flake fragments with those from complete,
stage-specific, and technologically relevant knapping by-products; doing so would only blur the predictable
decline in flake size and weight throughout the tool production process, considering that many small flake
fragments that fall in these smallest size classes are simply portions of larger flakes generated during earlier
production stages. Additionally, the counting of small flakes fragments, particularly those without platforms,
would lead to some steps in the knapping process being counted multiple times. If a flake had broken during
detachment or due to post-depositional processes, for example, it would be redundant to consider each of
the resulting fragments as a discrete flake.
Finally, as the vast majority of these items were too small to be labeled, there was seldom any
convenient way to link them to their associated data recorded in the database. Thus, while the presence of
small items in the assemblage are admittedly important, the size cutoff served to reduce some of the “noise”
created in the assemblage by the presence of the myriad tiny, broken flake fragments, shatter, non-cultural
materials, and thermal spalls of which of which this size class was largely composed. The implementation
of the size cutoff is, in no way, intended to suggest that the items in the smaller size classes were entirely
non-cultural or uninformative. While it is true, and has been stated above, that our methods were used to
reduce the incorporation of items that were incidental to the primary focus of the analysis, the assessment
of reduction strategies through time, it was clear we were losing some potentially valuable data in the form
of pressure, retouch, and notching flakes. In order to gather information regarding these culturally and
technologically significant materials that fall in this small size range, therefore, no size cutoff was employed
for piece-plotted artifacts.

Flake Tools
The flake tools vary in shape, size, and nature of modified edges, all of which are the products of
numerous interacting factors including material type, duration and intensity of use, angle of use, amount
of pressure applied during use, and the type of material each flake tool was used to process. Although the
utility of use-wear studies has been recognized since the 1960s (Akoshima 1987; Hayden 1979; Keeley
103

1980; Kimball et al. 1995; Lerner et al. 1997; Semenov 1964; Schultz 1992; Stevens et al. 2010), the
understanding of use-wear itself remains somewhat enigmatic. As so many intertwining factors combine
to produce attrition patterns on stone tools, it is impossible to determine tool function from use-wear
patterns without extremely well controlled experiments designed to isolate each variable and identify the
signatures that each variable leaves on a tool edge. Given the difficulty in controlling for each variable
in a testable and replicable setting, combined with the need to use large sample sizes and all varieties of
raw materials to produce a good comparative collection of wear patterns, it is understandable that so little
of the archaeological literature succeeds in determining the function of tools based on use-wear. In the
case of the 41CV115 assemblage, inferences regarding the function of tools recovered from the site and
broader discussions of site use derived from these inferences, are made via comparison with Keeley (1980),
whose experimental studies are particularly extensive and whose results are especially well summarized
considering the volume of and diversity of data he has collected.
Flake tools were excluded from the above-mentioned debitage size cutoff to ensure that all tools were
analyzed completely, regardless of their size or degree of completeness. Otherwise, utilized and retouched
flake tools were analyzed in a manner identical to that of unmodified debitage, but additional data were
recorded in order to characterize the modified edges of these implements in greater detail. Data regarding
the number and location of modified faces (i.e., dorsal or ventral); number and location of used edges (i.e.,
proximal, distal or lateral); length of used edges; edge angle; attrition scar density (n/cm); and dominant
attrition scar patterns were recorded.
For analysis of the 1994 material recovered by TRC-MA (1994, 1996), the following attrition types
were noted: small parallel scars (Ps), moderate-sized to large parallel scars (Pm), small scalar scars (Ss),
moderate-sized to large scalar scars (Sm), moderate-sized flake scars overlain by smaller scars (MoS),
randomly oriented small scars (Rs), and randomly oriented moderate to large sized scars (Rm). Following
their reanalysis, the 1990s materials were returned to their lender, and the Keeley (1980:24) method for
quantification of attrition was since adopted for all subsequent artifacts recovered from Rockshelter A.
Thus, for tools identified in the 2003–2006 assemblages, the recorded use-wear types are as follows:
large deep scalar (Ld), characterized by relatively deep scars with a maximum width of 2 mm; small deep
scalar (Sd), exhibiting deep scars measuring 0.5–2 mm in width; large shallow scalar (Ls), exhibiting
comparatively shallow scars measuring <2 mm in width; small shallow scalar (Ss), exhibiting shallow
scars measuring 0.5–2 mm in width; large stepped (L step), exhibiting attrition scars measuring <2 mm in
width; and Small stepped(S step), exhibiting attrition scars measuring 0.5–2 mm in width. Unlike Keeley
(1980:24), however, the present analysis of tools from Rockshelter A did not differentiate between deep
(MicroD) and stepped (MicroStep) attrition scars measuring <0.5 mm in width. Instead, any examples
of attrition measuring <2 mm that could still be identified as having step terminations under low-level
microscopy were classified as Small Stepped (S Step). Any non-stepped attrition scars (regardless of relative
depth) measuring <0.5 mm in width were called, collectively, “micro.”
Despite differences in the terms used to describe them, the attrition types recorded for the 1994
flake tools were generally consistent with those from 2003–2006 and thus, in many cases, have direct
correlates in Keeley’s classification scheme. For example, any attrition coded as Sm by TRC-MA can be
simply correlated with Ls in the Keeley and later Fort Hood coding format, as they both refer to large,
shallow flake. Also, during the reanalysis of the 1994 artifacts, a distinction was made between non-stepped
flake scars with expanding terminations (then called “scalar”) and non-stepped flake scars that tapered or
remained consistent in width (then called “parallel”). Keeley (1980) does not make such a distinction, nor
was this distinction maintained for the 2003–2006 analysis. Thus, Parallel small, Parallel large, Scalar
small, and Scalar large scars identified in the 1994 assemblage would correlate simply to “scalar small” and
“scalar large” scars in the Keeley and subsequent Fort Hood analyses.

104

Unfortunately, the shift in use-wear definitions between the 1994 reanalysis and the 2003–2006
analyses do, occasionally, make attrition patterns identified between the assemblages more difficult to
compare. For example, in the analysis of the 1994 materials, a code was devised to describe large flake scars
that were overlain by smaller parallel/scalar scars (MoS). Following Keeley (1980) and the later Fort Hood
analyses, this attrition pattern would have been reduced to its two constituent attrition types—large shallow/
deep scars and small shallow/deep flake scars. However, during the reanalysis of the 1994 materials, the
depth of the large and small attrition scars were not noted, thus making comparisons between use-wear
patterns identified in 1994 reanalysis and those identified during later analyses somewhat tenuous.
Finally, during the reanalysis of the 1994 materials, tool edges that exhibited a variety of attrition
types were characterized as having collectively “random” attrition patterns. In the present analysis, the
term “random” was not retained, and instead each individual attrition type identified on a tool edge was
recorded. Despite the shift in methodology and some limitations in the comparison of tools analyzed with
these different methods, this deviation is not believed to have any serious consequences regarding the
interpretation of tool use or site use on the whole. As the tools recovered during the 1994 testing constitute a
relatively small portion of the total tool inventory, it is unlikely that any differences in attrition quantification
will result in a skewed interpretation of tool use at the site in general, or in any individual component.
The research identified several colluvially derived chert pebbles that appear to have undergone some
intentional modification. While colluvial pebbles are highly susceptible to natural fracture due to prolonged
exposure to the elements, taphonomic movement, trampling, etc., it cannot be said with certainty whether
this apparent attrition is truly anthropogenic. However, as it cannot be ruled out that sharp edges created by
natural fracturing would be deemed suitable as ad hoc tools, they were included in the flake tool category
and analyzed as such. As these items do not have ventral and dorsal faces or proximal or distal ends, per
se, opposing surfaces were called faces A and B (the unlabeled side being face A), and specific locations
(proximal, distal, lateral) of used edges were not recorded. However, all other attributes pertaining to the
modified edges were recorded for these items.
While data describing the nature of modified edges has been recorded, it is impossible to unequivocally
determine the specific function of the flake tools without a substantial comparative collection of experimentally
generated stone tools spanning the entire suite of variables that affect use-wear patterns. Raw material
type, tool shape, type of task, duration and intensity of use, direction of stroke, contact angle, and amount
of pressure applied are among the many variables that are collectively responsible for the morphological
characteristics of modified tool edges (Akoshima 1983:71). Such comparative collections are rare, as most
of the variables that affect use-wear patterns are extremely difficult to control in experimental contexts.
Likewise, high-resolution imaging via scanning electron microscopy (Fedje 1979) or, less frequently,
atomic force microscopy (Kimball et al. 1995), are typically required to identify discrete patterns of straie
or polish on tool edges on both experimental and real assemblages. It is for these reasons that the use-wear
portion of this analysis is largely limited to descriptive data and that inferences regarding tool function are
derived from attrition patterns identified by Keeley’s (1980:24) experimental studies, which continue to be
among the most comprehensive in the field.

Formal Tools
All tools and tool fragments were analyzed, regardless of size. First, formal tools were assigned
to basic morphological and technological categories: projectile points, bifaces, and cores. Although, in
the technological sense, the term biface refers to all bifacial implements ranging from very early-stage
unrefined bifaces to later-stage implements such as preforms and projectile points, bifaces were subdivided
into two categories (projectile points and non-diagnostic bifaces) for the purpose of this report. Although
it is understood that items commonly recognized as projectile points may have served additional functions
during their uselives, the utility of projectile points as chronological indicators made the point-biface
distinction important for analytical purposes.
105

Diagnostic bifaces (projectile points) were assigned to named types following Turner and Hester
(2011) based on shared morphological and technological features such as overall dimensions, notch
characteristics, blade and stem forms, and flaking patterns. Maximum length, width, thickness, weight,
lateral edge angle, material type, and thermal alteration were recorded. A verbal description was produced
for each, summarizing these attributes. Non-diagnostic bifaces and fragments thereof also underwent
metric analysis and individual description. Several biface fragments were identified that lack proximal
portions, but whose technological and morphological blade attributes otherwise appear consistent with
those of projectile points. In these cases, the specimens were variously placed into either the biface or
projectile point category, depending on the degree to which the extant portion of the specimen resembled a
recognized point type.
The stage of biface production was evaluated with the intention of identifying the specific steps in
the tool manufacturing process that occurred at the site and thereby illuminate the role of the site itself.
Early and middle stage bifaces, for example, generally indicate manufacturing errors during tool production
episodes. Conversely, while some late-stage tool discards may be the result of manufacturing defects, they
may also represent tools that have already served their respective purposes and are abandoned after use.
While it would not be uncommon for a site to have evidence of both of these types of activities (tool
production and tool use/discard), significant skewing toward either early or late stage tool fragments may
signify if the site was predominantly used as a tool production locus or for food acquisition & processing,
respectively.
Non-diagnostic bifaces were further separated into chronological units, when possible. Bifaces were
assumed to be either Archaic or Late Prehistoric/Historic in age, based on stratigraphic (and/or arbitrary
level) association with Archaic or Late Prehistoric/Historic points. The purpose of this was to identify what,
if any, changes in rockshelter use occurred between these time periods, with respect to the stages of tool
production carried out by the site’s inhabitants.

Cores
Cores were divided into categories based on the flaking strategy employed, either bifacial or
multidirectional. Multidirectional cores display flake scars removed from various directions, and such
flaking patterns often result in blocky, unstandardized cores. By contrast, bifacial cores have two distinct
faces resulting from the removal of flakes tangentially from the margins of the core.
It is often difficult to distinguish between bifacial cores and early-stage or unfinished bifaces, as there
is seldom a marked distinction between a discarded bifacial core and a biface that was intended for use as
a tool but was never finished. For the purpose of this report, items whose average flake-scar size is smaller
than the average size of flake tools at the site are considered bifaces, and those whose flake scars are equal to
or greater than the average size of flake tools at the site are considered cores. As there is still some possibility
of misclassification between bifaces and bifacial cores even with this guideline in place, questionable items
are described as early-stage bifaces or possible bifacial cores, to allow for both possibilities.
In addition to the defined core forms, some cores were listed as indeterminate in type, because of
their fragmentary nature or, more frequently, because they are tested cobbles whose flaking whose was so
minimal that no pattern of flake removal had been established.
Regardless of core type, all cores were weighed and measured, raw material type was identified,
approximate cortex percentage was recorded, and flake scars were counted as a rough measure of the extent
of core reduction. Flake-scar counts include only what appear to be intentional percussion flakes and not
those that appear to be related to edge preparation.

Incised Stone
The single incised stone recovered from Rockshelter A was weighed, measured, and photographed
using Hewlett-Packard’s Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM) technology.

Results: Artifact Descriptions
The MAI investigation of Rockshelter A and the immediate area recovered 30,179 lithic artifacts
(Table 5.1). Of this total, 17,645 items recovered from screened contexts did not meet the >1cm² size
criterion (see Methodology, Debitage) and hence were excluded from analysis. Considering the chertbearing limestone bedrock at the site, the fracture and incidental thermal alteration of naturally occurring
chert pebbles are presumed to be common phenomena. Thus, as noted in the methodology employed in this
analysis, most items in the smallest size classes are difficult to attribute to natural versus anthropogenic
origin. It should be noted that this size grouping is believed to consist of both cultural and non-cultural
materials. The analyzed lithic assemblage therefore totals 12,534 artifacts, including 41 projectile points,
89 bifaces, 63 cores, 12,340 pieces of debitage (see Table 5.1), and 1 incised stone (not tabulated). The
analyzed assemblage is described and characterized below.

Debitage
Modified and Unmodified Debitage
The debitage assemblage from Rockshelter A is composed of 12,340 artifacts, including 9,830 (79.7
percent) unmodified flakes and flake fragments, 268 (2.2 percent) flake tools, 1,211 (9.8 percent) pieces of
shatter, and 1,031 (8.4 percent) potlids and thermal spalls.
Flake portion could be recorded for 10,056 modified and unmodified flakes. Of these specimens, 5,460
(54.3 percent) were complete or nearly complete. The fragmentary specimens (n=4,596) included 2,809
(27.9 percent) distal portions, 877 (8.7 percent) proximal portions, 469 (4.7 percent) medial portions, 107
(1.1 percent) lateral portions, and 334 (3.3 percent) portions of unknown orientation. Complete or partial
terminations were retained on 6,440 modified and unmodified flakes. Feather terminations are the dominant
termination type, appearing on 3,826 (59.4 percent) of the specimens. Hinge terminations were noted on
847 flakes (13.2 percent), closely followed by step terminations, which were observed on 778 flakes (12.1
percent). Twenty-eight outrepasse terminations (0.4 percent) were recorded, while 61 terminations (0.9
percent) were modified to such an extent that the original termination type could not be recognized. Postdepositional fractures truncated termination of 900 specimens (14 percent).
109

Platforms, to varying degrees of completeness,
were observed on 6,387 of the specimens. Complete
platforms were the most frequently recorded platform
type (n=4,379 [68.6 percent]), followed by crushed
platforms (n=1,520 [23.8 percent]), and incomplete
platforms (n=465 [7.3 percent]), that were split either
during manufacture or after deposition. An additional
23 platforms (0.4 percent) could not be adequately
characterized, due to either modification incurred
during use or the obscuring of platform characteristics
during platform preparation.
Platform preparation, which was recorded only
for specimens whose platforms were sufficiently

platform reducing. Platform grinding was performed
on 233 (35.0 percent) of the specimens, while platform faceting (n=10 [1.5 percent]) and battering (n=5
[0.8 percent]) appear to have been employed very lightly.
Flake scar count is largely determined by the number of flakes removed prior to the detachment
of the flake in question. Generally, flake scar
density increases as the extent of modification
increases, meaning that surfaces created later in
the manufacturing process will tend to have more
flake scars than those removed during earlier stages.
Obviously, the size of the flake itself also limits
the number of flake scars that are present, but for
the most part, flake scar count is a useful tool for
estimating stage of manufacture (Figure 5.1). The
bulk of the debitage specimens from Rockshelter
A display only two or three flake scars, suggesting
that they were primarily generated during the early
decortication and primary shaping of tools. This is
not surprising, considering (as mentioned above) that
the initial decortication and shaping of an implement
often involve the removal of more flakes than do the
terminal stages of production. Debitage specimens
with higher numbers of flake scars occur, for the

denote the occurrence of later stage tool production at
the site as well.
Flake platform angles could be determined for 4,430 debitage specimens, or ca. 35.9 percent of the
total debitage assemblage. Overall, 71.2 percent (n=3,153) of all measured flakes display platform angles
between 50° and 79°, with the greatest number (n=1,247 [28.1 percent]) exhibiting angles ranging between
60° and 69° (Figure 5.2). This range is greater than the edge angles of almost all of the bifaces and biface
preforms from the site, indicating that that most debitage was generated in much earlier stages of production
than are represented by any of the recovered bifaces (see Bifaces). The bulk of the debitage inventory, then,
110

may have resulted from the decortication, weight
reduction, and shaping stages involved in arriving at
a preform, as well as the early stages of refining those
preforms. Later stages of production, as evidenced
by more acute flake platforms and middle and late
stage bifaces in the assemblage, are also present;
these phases of manufacture were also common, but
perhaps resulted in the removal of fewer by-products
than are created during earlier stages.
Examining the angle of flake platforms is also
a reasonable way to estimate production stage. As
bifaces are thinned, their lateral edge angles often
decrease; as a result, the platform angle of thinning
flakes also decreases. In the case of the assemblage
from Rockshelter A, most early and early-middle
stage bifaces tend to have edge angles in the 40–49°
Figure 5.3. Weight of modified and unmodified and 50–59° ranges, while equal numbers of middle

stage bifaces have angles in the 30–39°, 40–49°, and
50–59° range. Middle/Late stage bifaces most commonly display edge angles of between 40° and 49°, and
equal numbers of late stage bifaces have edge angles in the 30–39° and 40–49° range; for these middle/
late and late stage bifaces, edge angles greater than 49° are rare. It is more difficult to quantify changes
in platform angles of multidirectional by-products, but it is believed that, on average, multidirectionally
derived flakes tend to have greater platform angles (similar to those retained on early stage biface production
debris).
If weight is used as the simplest means of approximating flake size, it is evident that—despite the
abundance of early-stage production debris in the assemblage—most debitage from Rockshelter A is
quite small (Figure 5.3). Of the 4,430 flakes whose weights were recorded, most weigh ≤0.9g (n=2,983
[67.3 percent]). Only 1,447 (32.7 percent) specimens weighed ≥ 1 g. The small size of most flakes in the
assemblage seems to run counter to the trends suggested by the platform-angle and flake-scar data, but in
actuality probably highlights the fact that small debitage is produced during all stages of tool production,
not just the terminal stages. In all likelihood, platform preparation, edge trimming, eraillures, flake-like
shatter incidental to intentional flake removals, and deliberate pressure flaking and tool retouch are all
contributors to the small size class to which much of the assemblage belongs.
Varying degrees of thermal alteration were exhibited by the Rockshelter A debitage assemblage. A
sample of 6,447 modified and unmodified flakes were examined for heating and burning, the former being
characterized by increased luster and reddening, and the latter exhibiting blackening, crazings, and potlids.
Of this sample, 931 artifacts (14.4 percent) displayed evidence of burning, while 2,362 (36.6 percent)
appeared to have been heated. The remaining debitage and flake tools were either unheated or simply lacked
visible signatures of thermal alteration. It is unknown whether the heated artifacts were heated intentionally
as a means of improving the quality of the raw materials, or if they were heated incidentally because of their
proximity to hearths. It is probable that both intentional and incidental heating contributed to the sample.
Flake Tools
The flake tool assemblage from Rockshelter A is composed of 268 artifacts with a combined total of
361 utilized and retouched edges (Appendix B). This assemblage revealed a similar pattern to that identified
in flake tools from the TRC-MA investigation, in that small attrition scars appear to be significantly more
common than their larger counterparts, with the four most-common attrition types being small varieties.
Small shallow flake scars were noted on over half of the 361 tool edges (n=181 [50.1 percent]) from the
111

collective MAI field seasons. Microscopic (<0.5 mm) flake scars were present on nearly 38 percent (n=137)
of the tool edges, followed by small step fractures, which were apparent on 33.2 percent (n=120) of the
identified tool edges. The fourth most-common attrition type is represented by 109 (30.2 percent) tool edges
exhibiting small, deep flake scars. The fifth through seventh most-common attrition patterns are the large
shallow (n=62 [17.2 percent]), large deep (n=56 [15.5 percent]), and large stepped (n=51 [14.1 percent])
forms, respectively. The least-common attrition type, half-moon fractures, occur on only 24 (6.6 percent)
tool edges; however, this may be a slight under-representation. Half-moon fractures are often the result of
post-depositional phenomena and thus, artifacts exhibiting only half-moon breakages with an absence of
other attrition types were, under most circumstances, not considered to be tools.
When compared to edge angle, small shallow scars, large shallow scars, microscopic scars, small deep
scars, and half-moon scars all appear most frequently along edges with angles ranging 36–49º, while small
stepped fractures and large deep scars are more common along edges with angles ranging 50–64º. Large
step fractures occur frequently in this range as well, but are observed slightly more often on edges with
angles of 65–79º. Edges with the most-acute angles (<35º) most often exhibit small shallow, microscopic,
and/or small deep scars, but as noted by Keeley (1980:25, 37–40), half-moon breakages are also very
common in this range. Edge angles greater than 80º were rare, and attrition of all types were represented
the least within this range.

Projectile Points
The projectile point assemblage from Rockshelter A is composed of 46 artifacts, 41 of which were
recovered during the MAI investigation and 5 of which were recovered by the TRC-MA testing operation.
Projectile points (Table 5.2) were typed and given temporal ascriptions following Turner and Hester (2011),
with the exception of the Pedernales point in the assemblage. While Turner and Hester (2011:148) place the
Pedernales point in the Middle Archaic, Collins (1995:376) associates this point form with the Late Archaic
period. Despite the problematic nature of dating and chronology development in the region (Collins 1995),
a Late Archaic age for the Pedernales point will be used for the purposes of this report.
The projectile points recovered from the MAI investigation are assigned to six types, ranging from
the Late Archaic through historic/protohistoric times: Pedernales (Late Archaic [ca. 1000–300 BC]), Ensor
(Transitional Archaic [ca. 200 BC to AD 600]), Darl (Transitional Archaic, ca. AD 200), Scallorn (Late
Prehistoric, Austin Phase [AD 700–1200]), Perdiz (Late Prehistoric, Toyah Phase (AD 1200–1500), Cuney
(Late Prehistoric through Historic [roughly 400–200 BP]).
While projectile point discard does not necessarily reflect the intensity or duration of occupation,
the projectile point inventory from the site suggests minimal use of the site area during the Late Archaic
(Pedernales [n=1]), with slight increase in point discard during the Transition Archaic as evidenced by
a single Ensor and four Darl points. The Austin Phase is represented by three Scallorn fragments, while
the subsequent Toyah Phase component appears to be scant, producing a single Perdiz point. The most
frequently identified projectile point in the assemblage—the Cuney point—dates to the most recent
occupations, spanning the protohistoric to historic periods (n=14). An additional 16 points could not be
assigned to a particular period, as they were either unfinished preforms or lacking sufficient portions of the
haft element.
The TRC-MA 1994 test excavation (see Appendix A) also produced a Uvalde point from within
the dripline at Rockshelter A, perhaps pushing back the time of the site’s initial occupation into the Early
Archaic period. This testing also yielded a Perdiz fragment and two probable Scallorn fragments, each
adding to the Late Prehistoric point inventory, and a single untypable fragment.

percussion and pressure flaking. Although it is difficult to tell on this particular specimen, some of the
pressure flakes may be retouch flakes. These pressure flakes are smaller, denser, and steeper on opposing
edges, and while this does not significantly affect the symmetry or longitudinal cross section of the piece,
it creates an almost imperceptible beveling of the lateral edges. This is likely a function of edge retouch as
opposed to an intentional effort to bevel the blade, since beveling is not a common feature of Pedernales
points to my knowledge. The stem is short and slightly tapered, with a concavity formed by the removal of
one large channel-like flake on one side and a few small thinning flakes on the other face. The point is made
of Cowhouse Dark Gray chert.
Ensor Projectile Point (n=1 [see see Figure 5.4]), Transitional Archaic (ca. 200 BC–AD 600)
FS 679.40 (nearly complete): This is a nearly complete dart point made of Cowhouse Dark Gray
chert that lacks only its tip and a small basal ear fragment. Although this type is highly variable according
to Turner and Hester (2011:94–95), its straight sides, flat base, and shallow notches are consistent with
the characteristics apparent on this specimen. On both faces, broad percussion flake scars are overlain by
roughly comedial pressure flakes that frequently terminate in step fractures and culminate in a slightly
biconvex longitudinal cross section. Lack of visible wear on the point opens up the possibility that the
specimen was discarded prior to use; however, the reality of this is uncertain.
Darl Projectile Points (n=4 [Figure 5.5]), Transitional Archaic (ca. AD 200)
FS 619.4 (proximal fragment): This dart point is made of high-quality Fort Hood Yellow chert.
Although lacking its distal portion, this point is otherwise complete. The blade edges and stem edges are
practically parallel, and the specimen is remarkably symmetrical with the exception of a few minor ridges
on each surface. Both faces are predominantly percussion-flaked, as pressure flakes on the blade and stem
are very short and steep and do not extend very far onto either face. A series of steep pressure flakes were
removed to create a deliberately concave base that is a defining characteristic of the Darl point type.
FS 623.9 (complete): This complete dart point was manufactured from an unknown (but probably
local) raw material type that has been burned. The blade is slightly biconvex, with one lateral edge that has
been truncated by the unintentional removal of a long flake, which initiates from just below the tip of the
point and extends down approximately two-thirds of the blade edge. The regularity, or straightness, of the

blade is difficult to assess on this truncated edge; however, the other edge is noticeably offset and curved
along the middle and proximal portions of the point. There is extensive, but not particularly fine, retouch
along all present margins, including the relatively straight-sided stem. The basal concavity was formed on
one side by removing two medium-sized, shallow pressure flakes and few smaller pressure flakes, while
the concavity on the opposite face was created entirely by small, dense, and comparatively steeper pressure
flakes.
FS 969.19 (complete): Based upon its high degree of refinement, it is likely that this projectile point
represents a completed end-product that may or may not have been used. It lacks a portion of one basal ear,
but is otherwise complete and rather symmetrical, with a slightly biconvex cross section. The material from
which it was made is an unknown light gray material that is slightly sugary in texture, possibly novaculite.
FS 1002.911 (proximal fragment): This projectile point base exhibits the parallel sides and concave
base that are characteristic of the Darl point type. The degree of refinement of the flaking suggest that the
point was completed or nearly completed at the time of discard, although it is unknown if the fracture broke
the point occurred during use or post-depositionally. It possesses a slightly plano-convex cross section and
is manufactured of Heiner Lake Tan chert.

FS 530.33 (complete): The raw material from which this arrow point was made is unknown, as thermal
alteration has affected the material’s appearance. One of the faces is more heavily worked and consists of
broad percussion scars as well as pressure flakes removed from the lateral edges. This point was made on
a flake, and the percussion scars on this face were from the reduction of the core from which the flake was
struck, as opposed having resulted from modification of the flake after it was detached from the core. The
other face is the ventral surface of the original flake, obscured only minimally by notching flake scars and
tiny pressure flake scars on the lateral edges, tip, and base. Due to the curved nature of the original flake,
this point is likewise curved and is thus slightly asymmetrical in profile (concavo-convex). There is no
definitive evidence to indicate that this point was ever used.
FS 614.6 (proximal fragment): This point lacks its tip and one small fragment of its base, but it is
nonetheless identifiable as a Scallorn point. The specimen is slightly biconvex in cross section, and the
lateral edges are quite linear and straight in profile as a result of fine pressure- and percussion-flaking. One

of the edges is particularly serrated, while the other is just barely so. The notches are deep, created by the
removal of a single notching flake from each face and a few additional small flakes to better define the
barbs. While the fracture that detached the distal portion of the point is not a definitive impact fracture, its
overall symmetry and quality of manufacture make it seem unlikely that this point would have been rejected
without having been used.
FS 999.66 (complete): This point is made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert. It exhibits a long, straightsided, serrated blade that is slightly biconvex in cross section, with deep notches and an expanding stem.
Although the flaking is extensive and the lateral edges exhibit very little offset, the thinning of the piece was
a bit irregular, causing the blade to look as if it were slightly “twisted” along its long axis. It is unknown
whether or not this projectile point was ever used, or if it was discarded because of its irregularities.
Perdiz Projectile Point (n=1 [Figure 5.7]), Late Prehistoric, Toyah Phase ( AD 1200–1500)
FS 530.32 (distal fragment): This arrow point is missing its stem and one barb, but it is nonetheless
identifiable as a Perdiz point of the long variety. It is not particularly symmetrical, as one edge is significantly
straighter than the other, more concave edge. Likewise, one edge is straighter in profile, while the other is
offset and curved. Despite these imperfections, the blade was nicely thinned to achieve its slightly biconvex
shape, and was carefully pressure flaked in a vaguely parallel oblique orientation. Although pink from
thermal alteration, it appears to have been manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert.

Cuney Projectile Points, (n=15) , Late Prehistoric, perhaps through Historic (roughly 400–200 BP)
FS 253.11 (complete): This artifact is manufactured from Fort Hood Gray chert (raw material Type
14), and does not appear to be thermally altered. The point is missing portions of both barbs, but is otherwise
complete. Flaking is extensive on one face, while the opposite face exhibits minimal pressure flaking on
the lateral edges and base and retains much of the ventral surface of the original flake from which it was
made. The lateral edges of the blade are straight-sided, and the notches consist of broad notching flake scars
that grade into smaller pressure flake scars along the stem edges. The stem is straight-sided and expanding
with a flat base formed by the removal of one larger thinning flake and several small flakes. Edge and basal
grinding are absent.
FS 263.7 (proximal fragment): This point consists of the greater portion of the haft element and
all but the extreme tip of the blade. It is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert and exhibits reddening on its
proximal end due to either intentional or post-depositional heating. The tip of the point was truncated by a
step fracture, and the extreme tips of both barbs were snapped off, probably post-depositionally as opposed
to during manufacture or use. Consistent with Cuney point morphology, the blade is straight sided and the
notches are made with deep broad flake scars. The finely chipped base expands and terminates in a flat edge
created by the removal of several small, irregular flake scars. There is no evidence of grinding on either the
lateral edges or the base.(2004)
FS 244.171 (proximal fragment): This specimen is the stem of what appears to be a Cuney projectile
point. It was manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert, and its pinkish color suggests that it was heated
either intentionally prior to manufacture or incidentally after it was discarded. Although the distal and

117

lateral portions of the point are absent, the expanding and finely chipped nature of the stem is consistent
with Cuney point forms.
FS 530.31 (medial fragment): Although its tip and stem are absent, the presence of barbs indicate that
this is a Late Prehistoric, possibly Cuney, point fragment. The blade was carefully thinned and pressure
flaked, owing to its highly symmetrical biconvex design and markedly straight lateral edges. It has been
partially burned, rendering the raw material type unidentifiable.
FS 532.50 (complete): This biconvex arrow point is largely complete, lacking only the barb tips,
and was manufactured from heated Fort Hood Yellow chert. Although arrow points are common in the
Rockshelter A assemblage, this is the only one that clearly exhibits retouch. While most Cuney points are
relatively straight-sided, the blade retouch created a slight convexity to the speciemn’s lateral edges. This
point is also substantially more robust and heavily percussion-flaked than most of the arrow points in the
collection, suggesting that it was made by reducing a thick flake or a small percussion-thinned biface as
opposed to the generally gracile flakes from which most arrow points in the collection appear to have been
made. The comparative thickness of the point relative to other points of its type may be why this point was
retouched while other Cuney points in the assemblage were not.
FS 532.51 (nearly complete): The tip and both barbs are missing from this burned Fort Hood Yellow
chert arrow point. The tip appears to have been sheared off during impact, as is evidenced by a long flake
scar on one face that initiates where the tip should be and covers a large portion of the blade. Although the
blade is truncated by this impact fracture, it appears that the blade may have been fairly short relative to its
width, unlike many of the other Cuney points. However, stem morphology and the vaguely biconvex cross
section of the point place it firmly within this type. Because it is fragmentary, the degree of symmetry is
difficult to assess, but the linear, regular edges suggest it was relatively well made albeit not finely pressure
flaked.
FS 601.38 (medial fragment): This point, made of Fort Hood Yellow chert, lacks its tip and a portion
of the base consisting of the stem and one basal ear but nonetheless probably represents a Cuney point. It
exhibits incurvate lateral edges with slight offset, and biconvex longitudinal and transverse cross sections.
While some pressure flaking is evident, most flake scars were caused by percussion and often terminate in
step fractures.
FS 919.242 (proximal fragment): Although this fragment is part of the haft element of a projectile
point, its small size makes it difficult to confidently assign it to a particular point type. However, its slightly
expanding shape and apparently refined flaking suggest that it is the stem of a late stage or completed Cuney
point. The specimen is severely burned, so the material type from which it was manufactured could not be
identified.
FS 921.50 (nearly complete): This thin, nearly complete arrow point has the triangular blade, deep
notches, and expanding stem that are characteristic of the Cuney type. Manufactured of thermally altered
Fort Hood Yellow chert, it is very thin with fine, extensive flaking and a biplano to very slightly planoconvex cross section. While overall it appears that the piece was a finished product more than capable of
service, there is a manufacturing defect that removed a portion of one of the blade edges and may or may
not have led to its discard prior to use.
FS 918.1 (proximal fragment): This projectile point fragment has the characteristic expanding base
of a Cuney arrow point; however, the absence the basal ears and distal portion of the point make this
assignation somewhat tenuous. The fracture that truncated the blade appears to have resulted from impact,
an observation which, coupled with the extent and refinement of flaking, indicates that it was a finished
point that broke during use. It is quite thin, with a bi-plano to very slightly biconvex cross section. The
material type from which it was manufactured is an unknown whitish chert whose occasional reddish flecks
suggest that it may have been heated.
118

FS 1032.61 (proximal fragment): This artifact is the proximal portion of a Late Prehistoric Cuney arrow
point. The tip and a portion of one basal ear are both missing, apparently due to post-depositional breaks.
Despite its fragmentary state, however, it is obvious that it would have had the characteristic triangular
blade. Consistent with the type, it possesses an expanding base and deep notches. Flaking is extensive and
fine, resulting in a plano-convex cross section, the flat surface of which clearly retains remnant features
of the flake on which it was made. Although it has been thermally altered and its material type cannot be
ascertained with total confidence, it appears to have been made from Fort Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan
cherts.
FS 1032.62 (complete): This complete projectile point was likely a finished product, having fine and
extensive pressure flaking on one face. The other face, however, is smooth and largely unworked, as it is
the ventral surface of the flake on which it was made with only minimal flaking along the margins. Because
this face still retains flake properties, the point exhibits quite a bit of curvature, as the original flake had
prior to modification, resulting in a plano-convex cross section. While the blade of the point has strong
Cuney affinities such as a straight-edged triangular outline, the stem is more parallel-sided than the usually
expanding Cuney stem morphology. It appears to be manufactured of heated Heiner Lake Tan chert.
FS 1037.1368 (proximal fragment): Although this specimen is missing its tip and stem, the straightsided blade, deep notches, and and long basal ears indicate that it is a Cuney arrow point fragment.
Manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert, the extensive flaking, fine serrations, lenticular cross section, and
degree of symmetry of the piece suggest that the point was a completed product that may or may not have
broken during use. The point has been burned.
FS 1051.90 (proximal fragment): This proximal arrow point fragment consists of an incomplete stem,
one basal ear, and a small portion of the adjacent lateral edge. Although its stem is mostly straight-sided
and the basal ear is slightly incurvate, this specimen seems to be within the range of variation for Cuney
points. It is thin with a lenticular cross section, and although it is fragmentary and largely obscured by
potlids, it appears to have been well made and was probably a late-stage or completed point. The burning
was excessive, so the material type cannot be determined.
FS 532.52 (nearly complete): This arrow point is made of thermally altered Fort Hood Yellow chert
and is complete except for a small fragment of the tip. Consistent with the description provided in Turner
and Hester (2011:187), this point falls within the range of variation for the Cuney type. It exhibits straight,
serrated blade edges, with long, slighty recurved barbs. It has an expanding stem with a straight basal edge.
The point is highly symmetrical in cross section, and is largely symmetrical in plan view as well, except for
a slight incongruity in barb length.
Untyped Projectile Point Fragments and Preforms (n=16)
FS 220.17 (distal fragment): The thinness of the fragment relative to its width suggests that it is the tip
of an arrow point rather than a dart point or other biface type. It is made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert
and displays extensive flaking on both faces.
FS 224.19 (distal fragment): This fragment consists of the tip and a substantial portion of the point
blade. It is quite thin relative to its length, suggesting that it is an arrow point fragment, and the finely
serrated lateral edges suggest that it may be of the Scallorn variety, although the absence of a base makes
this determination tentative at best. Due to excessive thermal alteration, the material type could not be
identified.
FS 224.32 (distal fragment): Although thermal alteration has rendered this projectile point fragment
pinkish in color, it appears to have been manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert. The tip curves slightly to
one side, perhaps suggesting that it was discarded during the manufacturing stage; however, the long steplike fracture that severed the tip from the rest of the blade points to the contradicting yet equally plausible
scenario that the point was broken during impact.
119

FS 230.96 (medial fragment): This projectile point fragment, though lacking much of the basal portion,
is relatively straight-sided (although one margin is slightly incurvate) and retains evidence of notching
scars. While these attributes suggest that it is the stem of either a Cuney or Scallorn point, the point is too
fragmentary to be confidently ascribed to a specific type. It was manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow and
has turned pink in places as a result of heating.
FS 263.28 (unknown fragment): This peculiar specimen, made of unheated Fort Hood Yellow chert,
consists of three bifacially worked edges and a large step fracture. One of the bifacial edges also exhibits a
single notch. The degree of refinement as well as the presence of a notch indicate that it may be a projectile
point fragment; however, the fragmentary nature of the specimen and lack of a second notch make the
fragment difficult to orient.
FS 449.1 (distal fragment): This specimen is the distal fragment of what appears to be an arrow point
produced on a flake made of Fort Hood Yellow chert. It is finely pressure-flaked on both faces, although
the ventral surface of the original flake is apparent on a portion of one face. Although slightly biconvex and
highly symmetrical in longitudinal cross section, the fragment is somewhat asymmetrical and irregular in
plan view, suggesting that the projectile may have been discarded prior to use.
FS 472.71 (distal fragment): This projectile point tip appears to be made of Heiner Lake Tan chert.
Its small size and thinness suggest that it is an arrow point fragment rather than a dart point fragment. It is
plano-convex in cross section and somewhat asymmetrical in plan and profile, with a tip that bends to one
side and one slightly offset lateral edge.
FS 478.55 (preform, proximal fragment): This specimen is a proximal flake fragment made of Fort
Hood Yellow chert that has been heated, either intentionally or post-depositionally, to achieve its pinkish
color. While its dorsal surface is unmodified, half of its ventral surface exhibits collateral pressure flaking,
indicating that it was in the process of being worked into an arrow point at the time of discard.
FS 513.20 (medial fragment): Fort Hood Yellow chert was used in the manufacture of this probable
arrow point fragment, and its vaguely pink hue suggests that either the raw material was heated or the
point itself was heated post-depositionally. The tip and base of the point were severed by oblique breaks
of unknown nature, but percussion waves on these breaks loosely suggest that post-depositional fracture,
rather than impact, caused the fragmentation. Slightly biconvex in both longitudinal and transverse cross
section, this point medial fragment appears to have been well-thinned but exhibits relatively little pressure
flaking, except on one edge of one face.
FS 614.3 (distal fragment): This specimen is the distal portion of an arrow point made from heated
Fort Hood Yellow chert. It was clearly made on a flake, as an unmodified portion of one face is still
identifiable as the ventral side of the original flake. This flat, unmodified surface creates a plano-convex
cross section toward the most proximal portion of the fragment, but the distal-most portion is biconvex
from comedial pressure flaking. The blade edges are straight and finely pressure flaked, almost serrated,
to create a symmetrical blade and linear blade edges. The delicate tip of the fragment is intact, perhaps
suggesting that the point was not broken during use, but by some other mechanism.
FS 617.17 (distal fragment): This heated Fort Hood Yellow arrow point tip is too fragmentary to
describe in any detail. However, it appears to be finely pressure flaked and relatively straight sided and
symmetrical. It is biconvex in both longitudinal and transverse cross section.
FS 617.18 (distal fragment): Made from an unidentified burned raw material, this artifact is the distal
portion of what was probably an arrow point. One edge retains a portion of a notching flake scar, suggesting
that this may have been a Cuney or Scallorn that was slightly biconvex to plano-convex in longitudinal
and transverse cross section. Although both lateral edges are quite straight in profile, one of the edges is
particularly irregular in plan view, creating a highly asymmetrical blade. Although the mechanism that
fractured the point is unknown, the poor quality of the piece itself suggests that the point was discarded
during manufacture and was broken post-depositionally rather than during use.
120

FS 999.63 (preform, complete): This small, triangular piece is most likely a middle-stage arrow point
preform. It exhibits a moderate to high degree of flaking on one face and fine flaking on the distal portion of
the opposite face, while the remaining portion of the latter face is smooth and concave, still recognizable as
the ventral surface of the flake on which it was made. Its cross section is slightly biconvex toward the distal
end and concavo-convex near the proximal end. The curvature of the piece may have been the reason why
it was discarded prior to completion. It is manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert that has been heated,
either intentionally or post-depositionally, to achieve its pink color.
FS 999.208 (distal fragment): This specimen is manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert that has
been thermally altered, either intentionally or unintentionally. Although too small to determine the specific
type of projectile point that is represented by this fragment, its small size and thin, slightly biconvex cross
section suggest that it is part of a mid- to late stage arrow point rather than a dart or spear point.
FS 1002.85 (preform, lateral fragment): Manufactured from heated Fort Hood Yellow chert, this
artifact consists of what appears to be the lateral blade edge and adjacent ear fragment of a mid- to late
stage arrow point preform. The rest of the blade and base have been truncated by fractures, at least one of
which seems to have occurred during the manufacturing process.
FS 1037.190 (probable preform, lateral fragment): Although no diagnostic features are present on this
fragment, it appears to be small and refined enough to suggest that it is the fragment of a middle-stage point
preform of an unknown type. The triangular fragment consists of two bifacially worked edges that converge
at a dull point, possibly representing two lateral preform edges and an unfinished, dull tip. The third side of
the triangular outline is formed by a fracture that appears to have been created post-depositionally. It was
manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert that has been thermally altered, either intentionally or incidentally.

Bifaces
The biface assemblage from Rockshelter A is composed of 89 complete and fragmentary specimens
which display tremendous variation in terms of the type and extent of flaking and represent all phases of the
continuum of production, use, and maintenance (Tables 5.3 and 5.4; Figures 5.9–5.11). Of this assemblage,
20 (22.5 percent) are considered to be very early stage specimens and tend to exhibit minimal thinning and
an absence of pressure flaking, off-set edges, some degree of asymmetry, a relatively low flake scar count,
and wide lateral edge angles. An early/middle stage category composed of 14 (15.7 percent) specimens are
likewise unrefined but, because of slightly more modification, appear to be further along in the production
process. Middle-stage bifaces account for 15 of the bifaces (16.9 percent), while 17 (19.1 percent) were
considered middle/late stage items. Late-stage bifaces are typically quite refined with extensive percussion
and/or pressure flaking, straight edges exhibiting minimal offset, abundant flake scars, and typically smaller
edge angles. The late-stage category from Rockshelter A includes 21 (23.6 percent) artifacts. Two fragments
(2.2 percent) were too small to evaluate, and their estimated production stage is unknown.
In terms of raw material use, local materials are most abundant, with 59 (66.3 percent) being made of
Fort Hood Yellow chert. Significantly smaller numbers of Heiner Lake Tan (n=6 [6.7 percent]), Fossiliferous
Pale Brown (n=2 [2.2 percent]), Heiner Late Translucent Brown (n=1 [1.1 percent]), and Cowhouse Brown
Flecked (n=1 [1.1 percent]) are also present. Raw material types of twenty of the bifaces (22.5 percent)
could not be identified, most often because of burning. Each biface is described below in terms of the stage
of the production represented, portion present, and overall shape and morphology. A comparison between
the raw material use and stage of production of bifaces assigned to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric is
presented in Discussion.
Early-Stage Bifaces (n=20)
FS 234.3: Manufactured from an indeterminate burned raw material, this biface fragment contains
numerous grainy inclusions that may be responsible for the presence of severe hinge terminations of many
flake scars and the apparent crudeness of the tool itself. These inclusions, which adversely affected the

quality of the material, were likely the reason why the biface was discarded in such an early stage of
manufacture. The biface fragment is incomplete and poorly made, but is nonetheless significant for its
contribution to the bifacial tool inventory at the site. It is slightly plano-convex in cross section.
FS 48.1: This is a complete (i.e., all margins are present) biface that was discarded in a very early
stage of manufacture. Both faces are convex, one markedly so due to a large grainy inclusion that disrupted
the path of the flake scars. It is asymmetrical in both outline and cross section, and flaking appears to be
crude. There is no evidence to suggest that the tool was used prior to discard.
FS 523.16: This burned biface fragment, probably made of Fort Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan
chert, appears to have been made on a flake. The more heavily flaked surface, which is partially covered by
cortex, represents the dorsal surface of the flake with additional flakes removed from the lateral margins.
The reverse face is also percussion-flaked, but these flakes do not entirely obliterate the original ventral
surface characteristics. Irregular attrition on some of the edges suggests that this artifact was used even
though it does not appear to be heavily refined, and in terms of modification effort, it appears to be a simple
ad hoc tool.
FS 529.76: Although partially burned, this nearly complete, unfinished biface is nonetheless identifiable
as Fort Hood Yellow chert. It is missing a small end fragment but appears to have been an elongated ovate
biface, at least twice as long as it is wide. The flaking can be described as somewhat crude, with randomly

oriented percussion flake scars of variable shape and size, and no pressure flake scars. This, combined with
its markedly concavo-convex cross section, suggests that the biface is a discarded preform that was created
by reducing a flake.
FS 546.10: This fragment resembles a piece of angular debris that was unintentionally detached
during the early-stage reduction of a biface. It is thick and unrefined, consisting of one bifacial edge and
two fractures. One of these breaks appears to have originated at or near the now-absent edge, suggesting
that the biface was broken during reduction of that edge. Due to its highly fragmentary nature, not much
else can be said of it, save that it was made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert.

Figure 5.11. Bifaces and biface fragments from MAI excavations at Rockshelter
A: (left to right, top to bottom) FS 645.1, FS 637.46, FS 638.51, FS 605.1, FS
600.13, FS 529.61, FS 689.18, FS 591.34, FS 530.89, FS 638.52, and FS 694.34.
FS 591.35: Apparently discarded during a very early stage of reduction, this biface retains some cortex
and exhibits little flaking, particularly on one face. The more heavily modified surface consists of opposing
large and moderate-sized percussion flake scars, which give this piece a somewhat rectangular shape. The
opposite face consists of unmodified cortex, several small percussion flakes along one battered edge, and
only two flake scars of any notable size. The larger of the two is a large outrepasse flake that covers most
of the surface and almost certainly clipped off a sizable portion of the biface edge, possibly leading to its
discard. Lack of definitive attrition supports the hypothesis that the artifact was abandoned without having
been used. It is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 611.12: This unrefined bifacial implement exhibits crude, randomly oriented flake scars that do
not always emanate from the edge, causing it resemble a core fragment rather than a biface fragment in
certain respects. However, it does possess some flake scars that do initiate at the edge in a manner more
characteristic of a biface, and it also possesses some apparent attrition along the edge, suggesting that it
was utilized despite its very unrefined appearance. It is vaguely plano-convex in longitudinal and transverse
cross section and has a roughly triangular shape, with two of the three sides formed by fractures and the
third formed by the utilized edge. It was manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert
FS 634.30: This large biface may be bifacial core, or a discarded early stage biface made of Fort Hood
Yellow chert. It is plano-convex in cross section and roughly triangular, but somewhat asymmetrical, in
outline. It is unrefined in terms of degree and regularity of flaking, and a small amount of cortex is present
on one face. In terms thinness and the frequency of feather versus step/hinge terminations, percussion
thinning on one face was more successful than that which is apparent on the other face. The generally poor
flaking on that face created significant offset to one lateral edge. As one would expect of a core or early
stage implement, pressure flaking and evidence of use are absent.
FS 634.31: This unrefined biface is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert. It is asymmetrical, though vaguely
lanceolate, in outline and biconvex in cross section, with irregular edges resulting from an incomplete
thinning process. One of the edges is particularly offset, and flakes removed from that edge terminate in a
thick ridge on one face. All flaking was accomplished by percussion, and many of the flake scars fall within
the size range of flake tools in the Rockshelter A assemblage. This suggests that the biface may have been
128

used as a core, although there is also a strong possibility that it was simply a tool preform that was discarded
prior to completing the thinning process.
FS 999.81: This biface fragment is, more accurately, a large outrepasse flake that detached what
appears to be approximately half of the biface. Although the fragment is percussion flaked on both faces,
the flaking is more extensive on one face than on the other, and the irregular shape and strongly offset edges
indicate that it was early stages of manufacture when it was broken. It is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert
that has been thermally altered, probably post-depositionally.
FS 999.83: This distal biface fragment is triangular in plan, lenticular in transverse cross section, and
plano-convex in longitudinal cross section. It is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert that has turned a deep pink
color, probably due to post-depositional thermal alteration. It displays offset edges and numerous thinning
errors that were probably the primary reasons for which this biface was discarded in such an early stage of
production.
FS 1027.34: This lateral edge fragment of a biface is so small that the intended size, shape, and cross
section of the complete specimen cannot be determined. The flake scars originating at this edge are caused
by percussion, and the edge does exhibit substantial offset and a small amount of unmodified cortex, all
suggesting that the biface was fractured during a relatively early stage of production. It appears to have been
made of heated Heiner Lake Tan chert.
FS 1032.55: This is an end fragment of a crude, unrefined biface fragment . Edge angles are highly
variable, and the extent and irregularity of the percussion flaking suggest that that it was in its earliest stages
of production when it fractured. It is biconvex in transverse and longitudinal cross section; however, it
represents such a small portion of the entire biface that it is unknown what the shape of the complete piece
would have been.
FS 1032.63: This heavily burned biface appears to have been broken during an early stage of
production. It is roughly ovate in shape and ranges between biconvex and plano-convex in cross section.
One face consists largely of the original smooth, flat surface that is remnant of the ventral surface of the
original flake on which the biface was made, with only short, steep percussion flakes removed from the
perimeter, while the other face is covered with percussion flake scars. The lateral edges are crude and offset,
and one relatively small portion of the edge was removed due to a fracture of unknown origin.
FS 1037.41: This Fort Hood Yellow biface fragment is subrectangular to rhomboid in shape, consisting
of one barely modified bifacial edge and three fractures of unknown origin. Discarded during an extremely
early stage of production, modification is limited to percussion flaking, and one face retains a portion
the smooth, slightly concave ventral surface of the original flake. The bifacial edge is relatively straight;
however, the topography of one face is variable enough to cause the longitudinal and transverse cross
sections of the piece to range from biconvex to concavo-convex.
FS 1055.22: This large, unrefined biface is most likely an early stage biface discard, or possibly a
bifacial core. While an implement of this size certainly could be suitable in its present form for heavy-duty
tasks such as chopping wood, the lack of any visible use-wear on the piece suggests that this was not the
case and that it was, in fact, abandoned prior to use. It is ovate in shape and biconvex in both longitudinal
and transverse cross sections; however, one face is more convex than the other due to a large, grainy
limestone inclusion that could not be adequately thinned. Modification is limited to percussion flaking, and
the edges of the biface are rather offset as a result of the lack of extensive reduction. It is made of Fort Hood
Yellow chert.
FS 1055.23: Manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert, this artifact is either a bifacial core or a very
early stage biface. It is roughly triangular in plan and plano-convex in both longitudinal and transverse
cross sections, and exhibits curved lateral edges with substantial offset due to poor, irregular percussion
flaking. Although speculative, it seems reasonable that the biface was discarded because of its numerous
manufacturing defects.
129

FS 1057.17: This ovate to sub-triangular Fort Hood Yellow biface was in its early stages of manufacture
when it was abandoned. It was probably discarded because the irregularity of percussion thinning had
resulted in curvature of the piece and strongly offset lateral edges, creating a concavo-convex cross section.
FS 1057.113: Apparently discarded during an early stage of manufacture, this Fort Hood Yellow distal
biface fragment is triangular in plan and biconvex in cross section. Although relatively symmetrical with
straight to slightly excurvate lateral edges, these edges exhibit very different characteristics when viewed
in profile. One edge is very wavy, formed by very deep percussion flake scars that result in a fairly wide
edge angle. The other edge is much straighter and more acute, due to more successful biface thinning flakes
originating from this edge.
FS 1073.27: This is an unrefined, possibly early-stage, biface fragment manufactured from Fort Hood
Yellow chert. It represents approximately half of what would have likely been a roughly ovate biface that
was broken during manufacture, and is vaguely biconvex in cross section. It retains cortex on a substantial
portion of one face, but all worked areas of the fragment are exclusively percussion-flaked. A portion of
one edge exhibits small attrition scars that may have resulted from use, but may have just as well been from
preparing potential platforms along the edge.
Early/Middle Stage Bifaces (n=14)
FS 12.1: This early/middle-stage biface fragment is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert. Similar to FS
234.3, it is dominated by soft-hammer percussion flake scars on both faces, but the nature of the break—
post-depositional or manufacture-related in origin—is uncertain. It is plano-convex in cross section.
FS 72.1, FS 201.22, FS 223.11, FS 230.8, FS 240.21: These five fragments represent early/ middlestage bifaces that appear to have been broken in manufacture. The highly fragmentary nature of the pieces
as well as the their discard prior to completion make it difficult to identify significant technological or
functional attributes; however, they do represent a substantial part of the bifacial tool inventory and as such,
contribute to the broader understanding of lithic technology at the site.
FS 232.26: This large biface represents either a bifacial core or, more likely, an early/middle-stage
biface that was abandoned prior to completion. Numerous large and mid-sized bifacial thinning flakes were
removed from the margins of this biface, while smaller trimming or platform preparation flake scars suggest
that the biface itself was the primary intended product rather than or in addition to the flakes detached from
it. Although its outline (in plan view) is roughly symmetrical, the biface is slightly concavo-convex in
longitudinal cross section with one markedly excurvate face and one more concave face. A small amount
of cortex is also retained on the proximal portion of this vaguely lanceolate biface. Both the incongruity
between the two faces of the tool and the presence of cortex suggest the tool was discarded in a relatively
early stage of manufacture; however, tiny attrition flake scars located along the lateral edges provides some
evidence of use prior to discard. It is uncertain whether the biface was not taking its desired shape but could
still function as a tool, or if the task at hand simply did not require the production of a particularly refined
biface.
FS 530.89: This heated Fort Hood Yellow biface is highly irregular in shape, with an asymmetrical
outline; crude, offset lateral margins; and a cross section that ranges from concavo-convex to biconvex. It
was unsuccessfully percussion-thinned and is therefore not uniform in thickness or shape, suggesting that it
may be a failed preform that was discarded prior to completion. Lack of attrition on the edges of the biface
lend support to this assumption.
FS 541.40: This roughly triangular biface appears to have been discarded during its early/ middle
stage of reduction. The size, depth, and orientation of thinning flakes are highly variable and pressure
flaking is entirely absent, creating irregular and offset lateral edges and an asymmetrical profile. The raw
material has been thermally altered; however, it appears that the biface was manufactured from either Fort
Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan cherts.
130

FS 560.11: This subrectangular to ovate biface is made of heated Cowhouse Brown Flecked chert,
and is slightly plano-convex in cross section. One face consists of variably sized flake scars that trend in
both opposing and converging directions. Flake scars on the other face are more uniform in size and were
removed from opposite margins of the biface, causing it to loosely resemble a bipolar core. Although none
of the edges are refined, one edge is particularly offset while another is entirely flat and unworked. Three
edges of the biface display small dense scars; however, they appear to be the result of edge preparation
rather than use.
FS 600.21: This heated Fort Hood Yellow biface fractured when an outrepasse flake overshot the
biface surface and removed a substantial portion of the tool. The artifact is actually the outrepasse flake
itself, but it is considered a biface as three tool edges and a substantial part of the body are present. Two of
the edges are crudely percussion flaked with a random orientation, while the third is an unmodified, cortexcovered edge. The lack of refinement and highly irregular shape and cross section suggest that the biface
was broken during a relatively early stage of manufacture.
FS 670.21: This is a portion of an unrefined or early-stage biface that may have been round or ovate
in outline. It is roughly plano-convex in cross section; however, both faces are too irregular and crudely
percussion flaked to exhibit any uniformity. The bifacially worked edges are likewise highly irregular. The
fracture that severed the biface terminates in a hinge, and was almost certainly the result of a failed thinning
attempt. Though heated, it appears to be made of Heiner Lake Tan chert.
FS 960.16: This heavily burned distal biface fragment appears to have been fashioned out of Fort
Hood Yellow chert; however, this is not entirely certain. The fragment is triangular in plan and irregular
though vaguely plano-convex in cross section. Flaking on the piece is not very refined or extensive, and one
lateral edge exhibits bifacial modification only on approximately one-third of its length, while the remainder
of this edge is an unworked, patinated surface. The opposite lateral edge is rather wavy and offset. All of
these characteristics suggest that the biface was in an early to middle stage of production when discarded.
It is unknown whether the fracture that detached the proximal portion of the biface was the reason for its
abandonment, or if this fracture resulted from a post-depositional event.
FS 1002.57: This complete early to middle-stage almond-shaped biface is made of Fort Hood Yellow
chert that has been heated, probably post-depositionally. Many of the percussion flakes on one face terminate
in deep steps, while the opposite face exhibits comparatively less modification and still retains a large,
smooth area that is probably the ventral face of the original flake blank. One edge is relatively straight,
while the other is very offset. The incongruity of thinning between the two faces resulted in a plano-convex
cross section. The generally poor quality and asymmetry of this biface were likely the reasons for its discard.
Middle Stage Bifaces (n=15)
FS 229.6: This is a distal portion of a biface that is missing only its proximal-most portion. It is
manufactured from either Fossiliferous Pale Brown chert or the grayer variety of Fort Hood Yellow chert.
The biface is roughly lanceolate in outline (though the tip curves slightly to one side) and it is biconvex in
cross section. One face is nicely flaked, while the flake scars on the opposite face meet along the approximate
midline to create a thick ridge along the long axis of the biface, which may suggest that the biface is a failed
preform. There also is some evidence of grinding along the lateral margins of the biface.
FS 86.1: This appears to be a biface end fragment manufactured from an indeterminate raw material
type (possible Fort Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan) that was heated, intentionally or otherwise. It is
plano-convex to slightly concavo-convex in cross section. The biface exhibits two breaks, one near the tip
that was apparently created during biface thinning and a more severe one that detached this fragment from
the rest of the biface. Both faces of the biface are dominated by soft-hammer percussion flake scars and lack
evidence of smaller pressure or attrition flake scars.
FS 465.4: This specimen appears to be an end fragment made of Fort Hood Yellow chert that has
turned pink in color as a result of thermal alteration. It is percussion flaked on both sides, but the size
131

and orientation of the flake scars is variable, suggesting that the thinning process was incomplete. The
inconsistent thinning of the biface created a roughly plano-convex cross section and irregular lateral edges.
A large flat surface that is apparent on one face may be the ventral side of the flake on which the biface was
made. Due to the fragmentary nature of the artifact, its intended shape cannot be determined; however, the
present portion suggests that the biface may have been ovate in outline.
FS 530.88: This is an unspecified end fragment of a heated Fort Hood Yellow chert biface. Roughly
semicircular in outline, it was presumably subcircular or ovate in its complete state. It was percussionthinned by removing a combination of random and converging flakes; however, it was not pressure flaked.
The continuous edge ranges from linear with little offset to wavy and erratic around the circumference of
the piece. The fragment is slightly concavo-convex in cross section, which suggests (albeit not definitively)
that it was manufactured by the bifacial reduction of a flake.
FS 535.20: This artifact represents the distal portion of a dart point preform or other roughly triangular
biface made of Fort Hood Yellow chert. Its random flaking pattern culminates in a biconvex cross section
and a slightly asymmetrical outline formed by one straight edge and one convex edge, both of which appear
to have been ground. The fracture that detached this fragment from the rest of the biface is not a “clean”
break, but rather has two distinct facets. The presence of a potlid on one of these facets indicates that the
biface may have spalled due to excessive heat.
FS 600.13: This roughly ovate biface is made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert. It ranges from biplano
to vaguely biconvex in cross section and was shaped by the removal of randomly oriented percussion flakes.
The edges are irregular as a result of the crude and unfinished thinning process, and a portion of each lateral
edge was truncated by the removal of two adjacent but opposing outrepasse flakes on one of the faces. It is
likely that the biface’s misshapen form and manufacturing errors were responsible for its discard.
FS 600.77: The roughly triangular outline of this biface fragment is comprised of a single bifacially
modified edge, a manufacturing fracture, and another break of unknown (but possibly post-depositional)
origin. The bifacial edge was created by percussion flaking on one side and a combination of pressure and
percussion flaking on the reverse side, causing a slightly irregular profile. It is made of thermally altered
Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 602.65: Not much can be said about this biface fragment, as it is very small and replete with
potlids from excessive burning. One lateral edge is present, as is a portion of the medial fragment, but the
intended shape and function of the biface cannot be assessed. It appears to have been in its middle stages
of reduction, and the thermal nature of the fractures that detached the fragment from the rest of the biface
indicate that it was thrown into a feature before completion.
FS 605.1: A combination of pressure and percussion flaking was used to shape this triangular,
biconvex biface fragment. Edge modification flakes are quite deep, giving an almost serrated appearance
to the lateral edges, which are quite straight despite some irregularity. The fracture that broke the biface is
broad, shallow, and resembles an exaggerated thinning flake, all of which suggest that the biface was broken
during manufacture. However, contrary to these observations, the biface is burned and percussion waves
are not visible on the fracture, possibly indicating that the biface was broken (in a very unusual manner)
by intense heat rather than by a manufacturing error. Regardless of the nature of the fracture, too much the
biface is missing to assess the degree of symmetry. The raw material type of the biface cannot be identified
due to thermal alteration.
FS 689.18: Fashioned from Fossiliferous Pale Brown chert, this biface fragment exhibits two
large fractures that detached the proximal and distal portions. These fractures likely occurred during the
manufacturing process, resulting in its discard. It possesses slightly biconvex, or lenticular, cross sections.
One of the bifacial edges is only a few millimeters long, prohibiting its examination. However, the opposing
edge is straight with little offset; it was percussion thinned but lacks pressure flake scars.
132

FS 973.2: This irregularly shaped fragment consists of one bifacially modified edge and a series of
oblique fractures and potlids that detached it from the larger implement. One fracture appears to be the
result of a manufacturing defect that may have been the reason for its discard, while the rest appear to be
post-depositional in origin. The extant portion of the bifacial edge is rather straight and exhibits very little
offset, and the thinning of the piece appears to have been going rather successfully up until the point at
which the biface broke, as evidenced by the thinness of the piece and its uniform biconvexity when viewed
in profile. Although the appearance of the fragment has been dramatically altered by burning, it may have
been made of Fort Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan cherts.
FS 1002.55: This small, triangular biface has a flat base and excurvate lateral edges. In most places, it
was well-thinned; however, an unworked, cortex covered depression on one face and a bulge corresponding
to a natural flaw in the material on the other surface result in a fairly marked concavo-convex cross section.
This asymmetry, coupled with the offset exhibited by its lateral edges, likely led to the discard of the biface
before it was completed. Given its overall size and morphology, it is possible that this biface was actually
an unfinished projectile point. Thermal alteration led to a difficulty discerning the raw material from which
it was fashioned; however, it appears to be either Heiner Lake Tan or Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 1032.43: This is a bifacially modified flake that appears to be a failed arrow point preform. It exhibits
primarily percussion flake scars on the dorsal surface. The ventral surface exhibits little modification, save
for fine pressure flaking that emanates from the edges of the flake at the proximal end to form the tip of
the preform. The unworked surface of the ventral face is concave, and would have been difficult, if not
impossible, to flake to the extent that the resulting implement would not display marked curvature. This
may be the reason that the point was never completed. Made of Fort Hood Yellow chert, the piece is roughly
triangular, with two sides formed by the flake edges, and the other formed by an oblique fracture. It is
concavo-convex in both longitudinal and transverse cross sections.
FS 1056.11: Manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert, this nearly complete biface is a long, isoscelestriangle-shaped piece that lacks only its extreme tip. Although both faces are well-thinned to achieve a
plano-convex to slightly biconvex cross section, the flaking was irregular enough to have resulted in offset
lateral edges and an appearance of having been twisted along its long axis. It is very possible that this
asymmetry is what prompted its discard.
FS 1057.11: Made of Fort Hood Yellow chert, this specimen represents an estimated two-thirds of
what appears to have been a middle-stage biface. The fracture that truncated the rest of the piece may have
resulted from a manufacturing error; however, given its offset edges and asymmetrical concavo-convex
cross section, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that it was discarded for additional reasons as well.
Middle/Late Stage Bifaces (n=17)
FS 239.3: This subcircular to ovate mid- to late-stage biface was manufactured from Fort Hood
Yellow chert that was subsequently heated, probably post-depositionally, to attain its pinkish hue. It is
parallel-sided to slightly plano-convex in cross section. Both faces are dominated by percussion flake scars,
while one margin of one face also exhibits smaller flake scars resulting from either pressure flaking or use.
It is uncertain whether the biface functioned as a tool itself or was a discarded preform.
FS 228.9: This is a fragment of a mid- to late-stage biface manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert
that is plano-convex in cross section. Though a portion of the biface is absent, it appears the tool would
have been roughly ovate in shape. One face exhibits significantly more refined flaking, while flaking on the
opposite face is largely limited to broader percussion flakes. A series of tiny step fractures on one margin
suggest that the biface may have been used prior to discard.
FS 501.11: This plano-convex, straight-sided fragment may be the distal portion of a dart point or
other refined, possibly triangular, biface. The blade is predominantly percussion flaked in a somewhat
random fashion, overlapped by densely spaced attrition scars on both lateral edges that appear to have
133

resulted from some combination of edge grinding, use, and pressure flaking with a very narrowly pointed
tine. It is manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 529.61: This is an end, probably distal, portion of a mid to late stage biface made of an unidentified
high-quality chart that ranges in color from light to dark gray. Its pointed tip and broad convex lateral edges
suggest that it may have been roughly leaf-shaped or triangular in its complete state. Both faces are well
thinned, one slightly more so than the other, lending to its plano-convex longitudinal and transverse cross
section. Although not pressure flaked, one edge exhibits unifacial attrition that may have resulted from use.
FS 530.30: This is an end fragment from a middle to late stage leaf-shaped or lanceolate biface.
Though successfully thinned to achieve its biplano to slightly biconvex cross section, numerous platforms
remain on each lateral edge suggesting that the thinning process was incomplete at the time of discard. It is
made of Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 530.84: This concavo-convex fragment consists of one bifacially flaked edge and an adjacent
portion of the medial fragment, although whether it is a proximal, distal, or lateral fragment cannot be
discerned. The fragment is asymmetrical in profile and retains cortex on one face; however, the bifacial edge
appears to be more refined. It is straight-edged with little to no offset, and the presence of tiny attrition scars
suggests that the biface was used. Although the function of the biface is unknown, its overall morphology
suggests that it may have been used for cutting, butchering, or some other task that did not necessitate
a symmetrical or refined biface, but merely required a sharp, straight edge. Because it was burned, the
material type cannot be identified.
FS 591.34: Manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow chert, this fragment represents a middle- to latestage biface that may have been triangular or lanceolate in its complete state. Although it exhibits practically
no pressure flaking on its margins and retains a small amount of cortex on its tip, the presence of small
attrition scars on its edges suggests that it was not abandoned prior to completion but rather functioned as
a tool despite its minimal refinement. It is plano-convex to biconvex in cross section and terminates in an
oblique break of unknown origin.
FS 645.1: This Fort Hood Yellow biface is teardrop shaped in outline and plano-convex in cross
section. One face consists of a broad centrally located flake scar that is overlapped by converging smaller
percussion flake scars, suggesting that this biface was made by reducing a robust flake rather than a larger
biface. The opposite face exhibits numerous percussion flake scars, most of which appear to be dorsal flake
scars from the original flake as opposed to modification of the flake after it was struck. Tiny flake scars are
present on several of the edges and may be a result of edge abrasion, use, or both.
FS 670.6: Although it has been thermally altered, this biface fragment appears to have been made of
Fort Hood Yellow chert. It is symmetrical and triangular in outline with straight lateral edges; however, in
profile shows slight biconvexity and one irregular, offset edge. Pressure flaking is largely absent on this
biface fragment, indicating that it was incomplete at the time of discard. The overall size and shape of the
fragment, however, suggest that it may be a portion of a point (probably dart) preform.
FS 688.10: Made of Fort Hood Yellow chert, this biface fragment is uniformly well thinned with the
exception of a somewhat thicker area near the distal portion of one face. Aside from that irregularity, the
biface it otherwise plano-convex to very slightly biconvex in cross section. The lateral edges are biconvex,
but they are quite straight when viewed in profile. Pressure flaking is somewhat sporadic, as it is apparent
on some portions of the edge but not on others. Small shallow attrition scars and small randomly oriented
attrition scars are evident on both edges and on the flat, unmodified distal edge and appear to be the result
of a combination of use and edge grinding. Neither the intended shape of the biface nor its function can be
determined.
FS 940.30: This is the end fragment of a heated Fort Hood Yellow biface that appears to have been
in its middle stages of production when discarded. Despite its lack of extensive percussion thinning and
subsequently crude and offset edges, it exhibits a rather symmetrical lenticular cross section. The shape of
134

the biface in its complete state cannot be ascertained due to the fragmentary nature of the piece; however,
it appears that it may have been lanceolate or triangular.
FS 946.7: This is the proximal end and adjacent blade fragment of a biface manufactured of either
Fort Hood Yellow or Heiner Lake Tan cherts. It is plano-convex in cross section and an oblique fracture
along the distal edge suggests that the tip of the biface was sheared off during the middle stages of biface
thinning, probably resulting in the discard of the piece. As the thinning process was no completed, the
biface is somewhat irregular and asymmetrical in shape and lacks any evidence of pressure flaking.
FS 965.12: This is the distal lateral portion of a biface that is so badly burned as to make its raw
material type unrecognizable. The missing lateral edge and proximal end of the biface were detached by
thermal spalls, leaving only one lateral margin and a portion of the blade. Although it is highly fragmentary,
the extant portion of the biface suggests that the piece, in its entirety, would have been straight-sided and
possibly triangular in shape, and in its middle to late stages of manufacture when discarded. The overall size
and shape of the fragment are consistent with a point preform; however, this is speculative. Because most
of one face is spalled off, the shape of the artifact in cross section cannot be assessed.
FS 996.192: This small, triangular biface is quite refined and well-made, although it is not entirely
symmetrical. In terms of size and shape, it resembles a projectile point preform; however, it may very well
have been functional in its present state. It has one slightly excurvate lateral edge and one edge that is
straight to slightly recurvate, and the base is convex. Both surfaces are well-thinned and exhibit pressure
flaking, resulting in a lenticular cross section and straight edges that exhibit little to no offset. Although it
has been thermally altered, it appears to have been made of Heiner Lake Tan chert.
FS 999.64: Although this fragment is difficult to orient, its two bifacially worked edges appear to be
a proximal and adjacent lateral edge. The straightness and lack of significant offset of these edges, coupled
with the extensive flaking on both faces and overall thinness of the piece, suggest that this biface was in
its middle to late stages of manufacture when discarded. The nature of the fracture that detached the distal
portion of the biface is unknown, so it is uncertain whether the biface was broken during manufacture, use,
or as a result of some post-depositional event. It is biplano to weakly plano-convex in cross section and was
made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 999.65: This artifact is the proximal end of a mid- to late-stage biface made of heated Fort Hood
Yellow chert. Although no pressure flakes are evident on the piece, it is very well percussion-thinned to
achieve a thin, plano-convex cross section when viewed longitudinally and transversely. One face, however,
does retain features of the ventral surface of the flake on which it was made. The lateral and basal edges of
the piece exhibit minimal offset. Although a large portion of the biface is absent, the relatively straight sides
and squared-off base suggest that the biface may have been lanceolate or sub-triangular in shape.
FS 1037.348: This biface fragment is most likely the tip of an arrow point preform. The distal end of
the biface is formed by fine pressure flaking of the proximal end of the flake, so that the tip of the biface
is located where the platform and bulb area of the parent flake would have been. The specimen fractured,
apparently during manufacture, in such a way that it broke along one of the waves of force (ripples) of the
flake on which the biface was made. Both of the blade edges are incurvate; however, one of the edges has
a very acute angle and is serrated, while the other edge is significantly steeper and more incurvate than the
other. The asymmetry of the piece, in addition to the apparent manufacturing break, are almost certainly the
reasons for its discard. It is plano-convex in cross section and made of Fort Hood Yellow chert.
Late Stage Bifaces (n=21)
FS 254.7 and FS 244.7: Perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the most impressive, artifact in
the assemblage is this large biface, which was discovered in two pieces. The fragments conjoin to form an
exceptionally well made, very thin lanceolate biface that was near completion when it was broken during
the final stages of biface thinning. Its basic morphology, emphasis on soft-hammer biface thinning, and
the skill with which it was crafted cause it to loosely resemble a large unfluted Clovis point. However, it is
135

not uncommon on the Plains for Late Prehistoric peoples to make bifaces of this type, though they notably
contrast the small arrow points usually associated with this time period. To our knowledge, there is no
typology or refined chronology for these large, finely made Late Prehistoric bifaces.
FS 244.80: This biface fragment is made from a grayish variety of Fort Hood Yellow chert. Although
its fragmentary nature makes it difficult to orient, this fragment appears to be part of the base and lateral
margin of an extremely well-made late-stage or completed biface. In cross section, it is slightly biconvex
and very symmetrical with ground edges. The break, which begins at the lateral edge and extends at an
angle toward the base, occurs along a grainy inclusion that may have compromised the durability of the
biface; however, the break appears to be post-depositional in origin as opposed to a manufacturing flaw.
FS 243.262 and FS 244.75: These are fragments of apparently late-stage or refined bifaces that may
have been broken during manufacture. Although both are nicely flaked, neither appears to have been used.
Both lack substantial portions of the tool, thus the original shape of the tool and any significant technological
attributes cannot be determined.
FS 464.14: This small, delicate biface tip was made by reducing a flake of Fort Hood Yellow chert. The
more heavily refined face consists both percussion and very fine pressure flaking, while the opposite face
consists of the ventral surface of the original flake, overlapped by extremely fine pressure flakes detached
from the lateral margins. The difference in degree and type of modification on each side creates a slightly
plano-convex cross section. It is symmetrical and triangular in outline with straight to barely convex lateral
edges. Although the function of the biface is unknown, it may have been the tip of an arrow point that was
complete or near completion when broken.
FS 478.28: Triangular in outline and slightly biconvex in cross section, the fragment is relatively
symmetrical and straight-sided, with the exception of two deep, adjacent concavities on one edge that
may have resulted from errors in pressure flaking. Given the refined nature of the biface and its overall
morphology, it is possible that this is actually the tip of a projectile point, although this cannot be said with
certainty. The raw material from which it was manufactured cannot be determined, as the artifact is severely
burned.
FS 517.5: This fragment consists of one lateral edge fragment and the adjacent medial fragment of a
relatively late stage or refined biface. It is made of Fort Hood Yellow chert and is uniformly well thinned
except for a thick area on one face where a thinning flake terminated in a deep step instead of traveling
farther across the biface. Despite the lack of pressure flaking on the biface, the edge is remarkably linear in
profile, with little to no offset. A few small attrition flakes are present on the lateral edge of the fragment;
however, it is uncertain whether they are the result of edge grinding or use.
FS 598.20: This refined Heiner Lake Translucent Brown biface fragment is probably, although not
definitely, the distal portion of a projectile point. Like several other arrow points in the assemblage, it was
created by the bifacial modification of a flake, the ventral surface of which is still visible on a portion of
one face. This face is quite flat with substantially less modification than the opposite face, creating a planoconvex cross section. The convex surface is finely pressure flaked in a vaguely comedial direction, and
appears almost serrated. The difference in degree of flaking on both sides created irregular edges on this
otherwise symmetrical triangular blade.
FS 602.66: Made of an unknown white material type, this narrow, serrated biface medial fragment
appears to be a portion of a drill or heavily retouched projectile point. It is biconvex in both in longitudinal
cross section, but has a diamond-shaped transverse cross section resulting from its of its fine collateral
pressure flaking. Its lateral edges are straight and display little to no offset.
FS 617.1: Apparently manufactured from a very light, grayish-white variety of Heiner Lake Tan chert,
this very refined biface fragment may represent a dart point whose haft element is absent. It is triangular to
pentagonal in outline, due to a resharpening of the tip. It is nearly biplano in longitudinal cross section and
136

biconvex in transverse cross section. Thinning and tertiary edge modification were well executed, resulting
in very straight lateral edges that display little to no offset.
FS 637.46: This biface appears to be manufactured from Heiner Lake Tan chert. It is relatively well
flaked by percussion and pressure, creating a thin biconvex cross section and an outline that is a nearly
perfect isosceles triangle. Although the lateral edges appear straight in plan, they are slightly wavy in profile
with a few remaining platforms. There is some suggestion that the artifact was used or hafted, as there
appears to be some polishing of one edge near the proximal end of the biface.
FS 638.51: This late stage or refined biface fragment was made of Fort Hood Yellow chert and may
be the tip of a dart point or point preform. It was relatively well thinned and pressure flaked on both faces
in a collateral pattern, giving it a biconvex cross section and roughly triangular outline. The biface is
asymmetrical in plan view, with one straight lateral edge and one convex edge. The convex edge is also
exhibits minor offset when examined in profile. Very small, shallow attrition scars are apparent on the
straight edge; however, it is uncertain whether they are a result of edge grinding or use.
FS 638.52: This Fort Hood Yellow biface is quite refined and well-thinned, although apparently
unfinished as evidenced by the lack of pressure flaking and irregular outline. One edge was clipped off by
two breaks of unknown origin, two edges are convex, and the third edge appears to be deliberately straight.
It is possible that the biface was a preform for a larger, lanceolate biface, with the flat edge representing the
intended base, the convex edges as the lateral margins, and the breaks that detached the distal portion. One
of the lateral edges exhibits unifacial attrition comprised of small shallow flake scars, perhaps indicating
that was salvaged and used as a tool despite having been broken prior to completion.
FS 641.73: This is the rectangular base of a late stage/refined biface, possibly an Archaic Darl point.
it is slightly biconvex in cross section with straight, parallel sides and a flat base. The distal portion of the
biface was severed by a series of deep, stepped breaks, most of which initiate at the distal end and travel
toward the proximal end. Although this is an unusually complex series of fractures, they appear to have
resulted from impact, which lends credence to the possibility that this is, in fact, a point fragment. It is made
of Fort Hood Yellow chert.
FS 694.34: This artifact is the proximal fragment of very well made Fort Hood Yellow biface. It is
slightly biconvex (lenticular) in cross section, and although lacking its distal portion, appears to have been
triangular in outline. The lateral edges are straight to slightly concave in plan view, but they are almost
perfectly straight in profile and exhibit no offset. With the exception of a few isolated pressure flakes
along the lateral edges, most of the biface blade was shaped by percussion flaking alone. The flat base, on
the other hand, was thinned by both percussion and pressure flaking. Lack of edge-wear suggests that the
artifact was broken prior to use.
FS 920.602: This proximal biface fragment is made of heated Fort Hood Yellow chert. Although
caked with some mixture of caliche and ash, thus making the surfaces difficult to examine, it appears to be
extremely well-made and beautifully thinned with a biplano to very slightly plano-convex cross section.
Although fragmentary, the piece has a slightly concave base and lateral margins that are straight and appear
to converge toward what would have been the distal end, suggesting that it would have had a triangular
shape in its complete state. The lateral edges exhibit some offset, but it does not appear that this would have
impacted the functionality of the piece. The nature of the break, whether a manufacturing defect or postdepositional in origin, is unknown. It was probably in a late stage of manufacture when discarded, lacking
only pressure flaking, which may not have even been necessary to complete the piece.
FS 1000.12: This is the distal fragment of a heated Heiner Lake Tan chert biface. It is extremely thin
and well-made and has biplano to lenticular cross section. The lateral edges, though incomplete, are finally
pressure flaked and straight to very slightly excurvate with no offset. The fracture that broke the piece is
oblique but the nature of it is unknown. It is quite possible that this biface is part of a projectile point or very
late-stage projectile point preform.
137

FS 1002.54: This is a medial fragment of a biface that appears to have been in a late stage of production,
possibly completed, when it was discarded. Both surfaces are replete with potlids, thus obscuring most
flake scars; however, where visible, the flaking is quite refined. When viewed in profile, the piece is planoconvex. It is triangular shape and possesses straight-sides and lateral edges that exhibit only minor offset,
suggesting that this is a portion of an arrow point or arrow point preform. The extreme tip and base of the
biface are absent, however, making the specific type of point unknown.
FS 1037.1369: This is the distal portion of a very narrow biface that possibly functioned as a drill
or awl. It is triangular in plan, and the fine collateral flaking resulted in a diamond-shaped cross section.
It is quite well made, with lateral edges that are straight to slightly excurvate and that exhibit virtually no
offset. There is no visible polish on the tip, which may indicate that it was not used or that it was used only
minimally.
FS 1037.1370: This heavily burned biface fragment is unusual, in that it resembles the proximal and
middle sections of an unidentified mid to late-stage arrow point. The parallel, straight-sided blade edges
meet the stem at nearly right angles, and the parallel stem is rounded at the base, giving the entire piece the
appearance of a canoe paddle. The distal portion appears to have been broken off post-depositionally rather
than during manufacture or use, but it is unknown whether the item was ever used prior to breakage, or how
it may have been used. Although both faces are modified, one face still retains features of the ventral surface
of the flake on which it was made, resulting in plano-convex transverse and longitudinal cross sections.
Stage Unknown (n=2)
FS 919.204: This small, burned fragment exhibits minor bifacial modification on one edge, suggesting
that this may be a biface fragment. However, it is very small, potlidded, and exhibits two post-depositional
fractures; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether it is really a tool fragment or simply a flake or
piece of shatter whose minor attrition occurred incidentally. Due to extensive potlidding of the surface and
fragmentary nature of the piece, the shape of the complete item in plan and cross section cannot be assessed.
FS 919.302: This biface fragment is so small and incomplete that very little can be said about it. It
is heavily burned, making the material type indeterminable, and all but one tiny bifacially modified edge
remains, while the rest of the biface was detached by a series of thermal spalls. The shape, cross sections,
stage of production, and other descriptive and technological attributes are unable to be ascertained.

Cores
The core assemblage from Rockshelter A is composed of 63 whole and fragmentary specimens.
Thirty-six (57.1 percent) of the cores and core fragments were produced by multidirectional reduction,
11 (17.5 percent) were produced by bifacial reduction, and the remaining 16 (25.4 percent) are classified
as indeterminate “tested cobbles” because they exhibited minimal flaking (Figures 5.12 and 5.13). The
Rockshelter A core assemblage shows a preference for multidirectional core reduction, most likely for the
production of flake tools; however, this is clearly not at the expense of bifacial technology, which is strongly
represented in the biface and projectile point inventories from the site.
Given the reductive nature of stone tool production, the amount of cortex on an item tends to be
inversely proportional to the number or density of flake scars present on its surface. For example, a core
displaying little cortex and numerous or dense flake scars is likely to have been more heavily reduced
than one that possesses a large amount of cortex and few flake scars. Because of this usually predictable
pattern of increasing flake scar count and decreasing cortex amount, these variables can serve as useful
measurements of the degree of reduction of a core. This inverse relationship, and its utility in determining
the extent of core modification, is exemplified by the core inventory from Rockshelter A. Of the 63 cores
and core fragments, 10 (15.9 percent) have been completely decorticated. These cores display between 7
and 36 flake scars, with an average flake scar count of 21.4 per core. Nineteen (30.2 percent) retain at least
some cortex on up to 25 percent of their surfaces. These artifacts exhibit between 7 and 24 flake scars, with

A: (left to right, top to bottom) FS 244.6, FS 245.34, FS 238.1.

to right, top to bottom) FS 201.8, FS 222.10, FS 212.13.
an average flake scar count of 14.2 per core. On cores that have an estimated 26–50 percent of their surfaces
covered with cortex (n=18 [28.6 percent]), 4–27 flake scars are apparent, and the average flake scar count
is 11.5 per core. Cores exhibiting cortex on approximately 51–75 percent of their surface (n=11 [17.5
percent]) contain between 3 and 15 flake scars, and have an average of 8.75 flake scars per core. Finally,
cores that have been reduced only minimally prior to discard and thus have cortex on over 75 percent of
their surfaces (n=5 [7.9 percent]), have 2–8 flake scars and an average flake scar count of 4.25 per core.

139

The vast majority of the cores from the assemblage cannot be characterized as either completely
exhausted or simply “tested,” as each end of the reduction spectrum is represented by only 10 and 5 cores,
respectively. Rather, over 84 percent (n=53) of all cores from the site exhibit at least some cortex, and
nearly 76 percent (n=48) of the cores retain cortex on between 1 percent and 75 percent of their surfaces.
Most telling is that the greatest number of cores (n=18 [28.6 percent]) falls within the 26–50 percent cortex
range.

Incised Stone
The Rockshelter A assemblage included a single incised stone, FS 252.194 (Figure 5.10). It is a
subrectangular piece of limestone that measures 94.69 mm x 53.78 mm x 29.78 mm and weighs 213.39 g.
The incising or engraving of pebbles and cobbles is a longstanding tradition in Texas, apparently beginning
with some of Texas’ first Paleoindian inhabitants and continuing into the Late Prehistoric period (Chandler
1987; Collins et al. 1991; Greer and Treat 1975; Wishoff 2008). While various rectilinear and curvilinear
patterns have been reported on these items, parallel and intersecting incisions appear to be common motifs
(Greer and Treat 1975; Wishoff 2008). Such is the case with this specimen, which exhibits prominent sets
of horizontal lines along the bottom of the engraved face, which intersect a set of parallel vertical lines
that are located on the right side (assuming the orientation of the stone as it appears in Figure 5.14 is its
intended orientation). More closely-spaced vertical lines are visible above and below the widely-spaced
horizontal lines, and faint diagonal lines appear to crosscut both the horizontal and vertical lines. As the
purpose of these stones—functional, artistic, or some combination of both—is unknown, this item will not
be discussed further. However, its provenience (25R25, Stratum IV, 15–20 cm) suggests a Late Prehistoric
age.

Results: Lithic Raw Materials
Central to the structuring of lithic technological organization is the availability, quality, and quantity of
suitable raw material (Andrefsky 1994a, 1994b; Collins 1975:17–21). Lithic material is a prerequisite for the
production of chipped stone tools, although not all populations have had the luxury of occupying materialrich geographic areas. In instances where raw material is locally or regionally scarce, of poor quality, or
not available in adequately sized “packages,” persons must ensure access to lithic sources elsewhere. Any
combination of factors may dictate or influence the way in which these more exotic materials are acquired,
but the most common options are to procure it first-hand through either direct or embedded strategies, or to
engage in trade with individuals or groups living in close proximity to the desired resource.
In addition to any number of tactics that may be used to acquire materials, another common response
to short- or long-term material shortages may be to conserve those materials already in one’s possession, by
maximizing the number of tools that can be generated per unit of material, by caching, or by deliberately
crafting tools that can serve multiple functions or that may be easily maintained through resharpening
or the replacement of individual components. Extending the use-life of a tool can also be accomplished
by reworking a tool into functionally different tool when it breaks or has otherwise lost its utility, rather
than discarding it immediately. Projectile points reshaped into hafted drills are among the more common
examples of this type of conservative behavior.
While conservation is a well-researched, logical, and perhaps inevitable response to material scarcity,
the archaeological literature tends to neglect what characteristics one may expect of assemblages that
occur in areas of material abundance. If evidence of raw material conservation is common among tools
produced in areas of limited lithic resources, would those created in material-abundant regions reflect a
more wasteful economy? Alternatively, would assemblages suggest something in between conservation
and abject waste, with technological decisions carried out independently of raw material constraints? That
is, might assemblages in material-rich areas be more reflective of personal /group perceptions of energy
investment or loss, or concepts of tool utility/functionality, without being colored by restrictions imposed
by material demands? With 27 raw material types located on Fort Hood alone, the occupants of Rockshelter
A were afforded a seemingly endless supply of high-quality stone. The material types of all tools and cores,
combined with observations about the presence or absence of conservative behavior in each of the major
tool classes, serve as a means to explore the role of material abundance in technological organization.
Raw material identification in lithic analysis is important not only because of the impact of material
availability and quality on technological decision-making, but also because of its utility in tracing human
activity across the landscape. The presence of a particular lithic material in an assemblage can provide a
link between an individual/group and a raw material source, demonstrating that at some point in time a
person ventured to a given source area, be it the toolmaker him/herself, another member of the toolmaker’s
social group, or a trading partner. In a situation where the involvement of a third-party trading partner can
viewed as unlikely, an artifact made of a given material can signify a geographic range of movement for
a person or persons in that group. On one hand, it may demonstrate the residential mobility of an entire
population, wherein acquisition of materials is embedded amid broader subsistence-related or other tasks.
On the other hand, it may represent logistical forays carried out by one or several individuals in a directprocurement, task-group strategy. In terms of assemblage composition, one may anticipate that when a
person/persons locate a raw material source, they will likely “stock up” on those materials in the form
of raw nodules, bifaces, preforms, or other tools and then transport them on to their habitation area and/
or on their next foray. As those tools are continually used or broken, and in the absence of new materials
with which to replenish their toolkit, one would expect to see assemblages containing greater quantities of
refurbished or retouched tools, reflecting an effort to conserve lithic materials.
The greater the distance from the source area, or the longer the time period that has passed since the
procurement of a lithic resource, one may expect an increase in the number of tools that were retouched

Indeterminate burned; raw material type could not be identified as a result of extreme color and/
or textural changes resulting from burning

into smaller but functionally similar forms, or retooled into functionally different forms prior to final
discard. Additionally, debitage inventories may show a decrease in the number and size of flakes produced
as the time or distance away from the source area increases, while the number and size of debitage of
different material types may increase as new material sources are encountered. Thus, one may literally see
the “phasing out” of a particular material type as it is replaced by more recently acquired materials. In an
attempt to address some of the social and economic imperatives that may have shaped the ways in which
the occupants of the site structured their technology, a raw material identification was conducted for the
Rockshelter A assemblage.
Of 9,937 tools, flakes, and assorted debitage fragments for which raw material type was recorded
(Table 5.5), 1,667 (16.8 percent) were thermally altered to such an extent that raw material determinations
could not be made. Fort Hood Yellow chert was overwhelmingly dominant in the Rockshelter A assemblage,
accounting for 7,336 (73.8 percent) of the tools and debitage, followed at a distant second by Heiner Lake
Tan (n=715 [7.2 percent]). All other raw material types identified at the rockshelter comprise less than 1
percent of the total assemblage. These materials include, in descending order of frequency: Texas Novaculite
(n=63 [0.6 percent]), Heiner Lake Translucent Brown (n=41 [0.4 percent]), Fort Hood Gray (n=33 [0.3
percent]), Anderson Mountain Gray (n=20 [0.2 percent]), Fossiliferous Pale Brown (n=13 [0.1 percent]),
Cowhouse White (n=10 [0.1 percent]); Cowhouse Brown Flecked (n=8; .08 percent), Gray-Brown-Green
(n=7 [0.07 percent]), Cowhouse Dark Gray (n=6 [0.06 percent]), Heiner Lake Blue-Light (n=4 [0.04
percent]), Owl Creek Black (n=4 [0.04 percent]), Heiner Lake Blue (n=3 [0.03 percent]), East Range Flat
(n=3 [0.03 percent]), East Range Flecked (n=1 [0.01 percent]), Leona Park (n=1 [0.01 percent]), Cowhouse
Light Gray (n=1 [0.01 percent]), and Cowhouse Banded and Mottled (n=1 [0.01 percent]) cherts. Because
material determinations were based on macroscopic and low-level microscopic observation, it should be
noted that raw materials identified in negligible quantities may be misidentified variants of similar but more
abundant material types.
While chemical and elemental analyses via x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and x-ray diffraction (XRD)
would have been preferable to the methods employed here, the collection and comparison of XRF and
XRD data for both the assemblage and the potential source outcrops would have been a monumental task,
far beyond the scope of this report. For this reason, the collection of raw material samples provided by the
CRM division at Fort Hood was used as a representation of the visually and tactilely observable attributes of
these materials. The use of such collections, though common practice among archaeologists, unfortunately
offers only limited potential for locating where, in a given formation, a piece of material originated. This
complicates any discussion of mobility strategies used to target these materials, as the direction and distance
of travel may be different, depending on location from which each material type was procured. We will
145

assume, here, that the source location data associated with the comparative collection are accurate, and that
the raw materials represented in the Rockshelter A assemblage were acquired at these known locations on
Fort Hood, as opposed to outcrops lying outside the boundaries of the installation. With this assumption in
mind, the following inferences are offered with caution
A number of inferences can be made based on the relative appearances of material types in the
Rockshelter A assemblage. First, with the exception of the infrequently occurring channel gravels (Cowhouse
Brown Flecked, Cowhouse Dark Gray, Cowhouse Light Gray, and Cowhouse Banded and Mottled), all
other materials recognized in the assemblage are bedrock or other non-alluvial cherts. In particular, Fort
Hood Yellow was preferred, not necessarily because of its physical properties, but quite possibly because
of its abundance and location. This material, which outcrops along a large portion of northern Fort Hood,
would be the most frequently encountered material source for people travelling in this area. This suggests
that the occupants of Rockshelter A were largely confined to the northern part of the Fort, at least for some
duration prior to their arrival at the site.
In addition to the locally ubiquitous Fort Hood Yellow, a substantial body of Heiner Lake Tan chert and
other, less commonly used materials from the Heiner Lake area, suggest that the southeastern portion of the
Fort was visited at some point prior to the occupants’ arrival at the rockshelter. Likewise, the occasional use
of raw materials such as Fort Hood Gray, Gray-Brown-Green, Tennessee Novaculite, and Cowhouse White,
which occur in the East Range in a northwest-to-southeast trending path between the rockshelter location
and the Heiner Lake and Belton Reservoir areas, also demonstrate a connection between the southeast
and the North Fort. The abundance of local Fort Hood Yellow chert in vicinity of Rockshelter A renders it
rather unlikely that excursions through the East Range and into the areas now containing Heiner and Belton
Lakes would be made for the explicit purpose of gathering lithic materials. The relative rarity of materials
in the Rockshelter A assemblage from the East Range and the Heiner and Belton Lake areas supports this
contention that material acquisition was not the primary reason for which they were in this area.
One of two possible scenarios can explain the relative amounts of raw materials recovered from
Rockshelter A and the nature of the human linkages between their source areas and the rockshelter in
which they came to appear. On one hand, it may suggest that groups living in the North Fort (some of
whom temporarily occupied Rockshelter A) engaged in some, perhaps seasonal, migrations or more limited
task-specific forays that involved the traversing of East Range and the valleys and creeks within it, later
returning to the North Fort. The diversity of floral and faunal resources available within the mountainous
and intermontaine regions of the East Range may have been lucrative places for hunting, fishing, and
gathering, serving as the primary impetus for travels to these regions. In this situation, Rockshelter A would
have served as an intermediate stopping point for task groups to acquire lithic materials and temporarily
camp amid a broader seasonal or otherwise scheduled round. Scant but limited presence of materials from
the East Range and the Heiner Lake and Belton Lake areas beyond demonstrate the retouching of tools or
the discard of exhausted tools that were manufactured en route to the North Fort. These tools were replaced
by new tools manufactured from Fort Hood Yellow and other materials as they were encountered.
On the other hand, the presence of limited quantities of materials available in the East Range and
Heiner Lake areas may point to a more linear influx of people into the North Fort from these areas, where
the North Fort was a more permanent destination rather than a stopping point along a subsistence-oriented
round. As in the previous scenario, the tools made of these southeastern materials would be gradually
depleted, as they moved northward, resulting in a minimal presence by the time they arrived at sites in
the North Fort. Whether part of a seasonal round or as a point of origin, the Belton Lake area—which,
prehistorically, was where the Leon River widened to meet its confluence with Cowhouse Creek—appears
to be the southeastern-most extent of these journeys, at least in terms of their representation in the raw
materials inventory from the rockshelter.

146

While some movement either to or from the southeast is apparent, there is not much evidence for use
of the southern-central and western parts of the Fort. A limited quantity of Anderson Mountain Gray chert
is the only definitive link between the occupants of Rockshelter A and the western portion of Fort Hood.
Perhaps the western and central parts of the Fort had not been recently traversed prior to arriving at the
rockshelter. Alternatively, use of these areas may simply not be documented in the raw material inventory
from the rockshelter assemblage because the materials were scarcer or less desirable than those located
elsewhere on the Fort and not utilized.
Regardless of whether or not the people who transported the more distant materials were taking part
in a cyclical pattern of mobility or a more linear movement from the southeast to the North Fort, the role
of Rockshelter A, specifically, remains relatively unaffected. As is discussed elsewhere, the assemblage
contents from the site indicate that the rockshelter was not a habitation site. Instead, it appears to have
been occupied repeatedly by small task groups for the purpose of procuring tool stone or food and other
resources. The social or cultural groups of which these task groups belonged operated on a larger scale of
movement, which is what this section in has attempted to recreate.
Differences and similarities in raw material use between specific components are presented below
in the Chronology section of Discussion (below), as they may highlight consistencies or discrepancies in
material usage through time.

Discussion
Debitage
The breakdown of debitage characteristics—particularly platform preparation, platform angle, and
dorsal flake scar count—suggests that knapping activities were varied at the site, although skewed toward
the earlier stages of biface production and, probably, multidirectional core reduction.
While there are certainly no explicit guidelines that dictate where in the manufacturing process
platform preparation may or may not performed, it is a general tendency for platforms to be prepared more
frequently and with greater care toward the final stages of biface production. Grinding, specifically, is often
reserved for the terminal stages, when caution must be exercised in the preparation and removal of flakes.
That said, the evidently rare occurrence of prepared platforms in the assemblage indicate that, perhaps,
much of the debitage at Rockshelter A is the result of early and middle-stage biface production as well as
the reduction of multidirectional cores.
This is not to say that knapping activities conducted at the site were overwhelmingly geared toward
the initial stages of tool manufacture. When fashioning tools from large nodules of material, the portion of
the process that involves decortication, weight reduction, and basic shaping often results in greater debitage
quantities than do the later stages of production where platform preparation may be needed. The abundance
of unprepared platforms may indicate that so-called “early” manufacturing by-products may simply be
overrepresented in residues of the tool production process in general, as opposed to indicating differences
in the frequency with which early versus late stage activities were performed.

Flake Tools
According to Keeley’s (1980:37–61) experiments, most attrition types are present to some degree
on most types of tools. That is, in most cases, attrition types are not exclusive to any particular task or
set of tasks. This seems to be especially common with the small scalar type of attrition, which results to
varying degrees from most activities such as bone working, but is not the most noteworthy or common
attrition type associated with any one activity. In light of this, the extremely high number of tool edges in
the Rockshelter A flake tool assemblage that exhibit small, shallow flake scars may be more a function of
the occurrence of this scar type among most types of tools rather than an indicator of any specific activity
having dominated the prehistoric use of the site. On the other hand, microscopic flake scars—the second
147

most-common attrition type in the Rockshelter A assemblage—though represented among several activity
types, have significant associations with hide-scraping, meat-slicing, and butchering activities; microscopic
step fractures, furthermore, occur on antler whittling/planing tools. Small, deep, scalar scars occur on low
angled bone working implements as well as thin angled wood scrapers, while small stepped fractures are
seen on antler whittling and planing tools, bone scraping tools, and steeply angled wood scrapers.
It appears, based on a review of Keeley’s (1980:38) work, that the larger attrition scar varieties seem
to be more closely associated with particular tasks than are the smaller and apparently more generalized
attrition types that are common to a wider variety of activities. Keeley (1980:38) observes that large shallow,
large deep, and large stepped scars commonly result from wood chopping and adze use, while large deep
and large shallow scars are also frequently associated with bone sawing. Interestingly, the larger attrition
types, while perhaps the most indicative of specific activities, are the least commonly occurring attrition
varieties present on the Rockshelter A tools. This suggests that heavy-duty woodworking activities and
bone sawing, while likely conducted at some point during the site’s occupation to some degree, were not
commonly performed there. By contrast, the high incidences of microscopic edge attrition may point to
frequent butchering, slicing, and hide scraping at various points, or perhaps consistently, throughout the
site’s history.
The fact that all types of attrition identified by Keeley (1980) have also been identified in the
Rockshelter A tool assemblage, and that the most commonly observed attrition type—exemplified by
small shallow scalar flake scars—is common to almost all activity types but not conclusively indicative of
any particular set of activities—suggests that the occupation of Rockshelter A was not dominated by any
given task, and that activities conducted there were very generalized. This is also supported by the very
morphologically generalized forms of most of the tools identified in the assemblage. That is, the general
character of most tools is fairly unremarkable, consisting of one or several straight or curved edges, with
attrition most often occurring on the dorsal face. The only exceptions to this are five flake tools (FS 438.22,
601.53, 1032.54, 1037.73, and 1075.8) whose working edges meet to form small projections and may have
been used as gravers, as well as one additional tool whose attrition forms a deep semicircular notch that may
have served as a spokeshave. With the exception of these items, most of the flake tools in the assemblage
appear to be very basic, non-standardized flakes that were suited to many different tasks. It is most likely
that these tools were, for the most part, elements of a generalized toolkit that were used for expedient tasks
rather than having undergone any extensive task-specific modifications.

Projectile Points
It is difficult to make generalizations about the Archaic-age projectile points in terms of their
manufacture, as the sample of points from this period is relatively small. Unsurprisingly for dart points,
however, these items are far more robust than those associated with the Late Prehistoric/Historic arrow
points. Flaking is uniformly extensive on each of the Archaic points, with thinning flake scars covering the
entirety of their typically convex surfaces. This suggests that they were produced by reducing large, thick
flakes into bifacial preforms prior to additional modification. This is quite unlike the manner in which the
more recent Late Prehistoric points were produced. Several of the arrow points have limited flaking on one
side, retaining part of the ventral surface of the flake on which they were made. These unworked surfaces
represent where the ventral concavity of the original flake did not allow subsequent thinning or pressure
flake scars to traverse. This often results in a cross section that mimics the profile of the original flake—that
is, curved with one concave face—and thus indicates that the parent flakes would have been much thinner
than those used to produce chronologically earlier dart points. Furthermore, it appears that much of the
apparent percussion flaking visible on the Late Prehistoric/Historic points was present on the dorsal face of
the parent flake as opposed to created by thinning the preform itself.
One specimen in particular, the proximal fragment of a point preform (FS 478.55), shows how some
of these arrow points may have been produced. This preform, as described above, is a plain flake whose
148

ventral surface was in the process of being pressure-flaked into a projectile point. Small flake scars initiate
on the lateral edges of the flake’s proximal end and converge toward the center in a collateral fashion.
Interestingly, it appears that the bulb of percussion—the thickest part of the flake—was being worked into
the tip of the point, as opposed to the stem.
The abundance of Cuney projectile points from Rockshelter A stands in stark contrast to the dearth
of such point forms elsewhere on the Fort Hood installation. Nonetheless, those recovered from the site
do, in fact fall within the range of variation depicted in Turner and Hester (2011:187), most of which are
nearly identical to those shown in the bottom row of illustrations in that source. The distinctive basal
morpohology of these points is also seen on the Cuney point from the Mitchell Ridge site, on Galveston
Island (Collins 2013). While these points do make their appearance during the Late Prehistoric period,
along with other point types such as Alba and Bonham, the Cuney point is believed to have survived into the
Historic period (Jelks 1993:11; Turner and Hester 2011:187). During the period immediately prior to, and
during, European contact, Central Texas did not appear to have been occupied by any groups indigenous
to the region, but rather by late-comers such as the Comanche, Kiowa, Tonkawa, and Wichita (Collins
1995:373).  While the specific group responsible for the manufacture of these Cuney points is uknown, their
presence in the rockshelter nonetheless provides a unique glimpse into site use during a period of time that
is poorly represented on Fort Hood.

Bifaces
The breakdown of bifaces in the assemblage demonstrates, at the most basic level, that all steps in
the production and maintenance of bifacial implements were conducted throughout the occupation of the
site. This is not surprising; however, the early and late stage items are the two most common classes, and
all of the intermediate stages occur with similar frequency. Unlike a hypothetical assemblage that might be
dominated by either very early or very late stage implements, indicating the site’s function as predominantly
one of tool manufacture or food processing, respectively, the Rockshelter A assemblage indicates that the
activities performed at the site were not heavily skewed toward either tool production or tool use /discard.
That is, the site did not function explicitly as a tool production workshop, nor was it a major campsite for
the extensive processing of food over long periods or for large groups of people. The biface inventory
instead suggests that the focus of the site was more generalized, being visited en route to other locations,
perhaps, while seizing the opportunity to acquire raw materials, make tools, and process meals during the
course of their brief visits.

Cores
As noted above (see Results, Cores), the vast majority of the cores from the assemblage cannot be
characterized as either completely exhausted or simply “tested,” as each end of the reduction spectrum is
represented by only 10 and 5 cores, respectively. Rather, over 84 percent (n=53) of all cores from the site
exhibit at least some cortex, and nearly 76 percent (n=48) of the cores retain cortex on 1–75 percent of
their surfaces. Most telling is that the greatest number of cores (n=18 [28.6 percent]) falls within the 26–50
percent cortex range.
The cortex percentages and flake scar counts for the Rockshelter A cores thus indicate a strategy
wherein most cores are worked moderately, each being used to produce a few to several possible flake
tools, and are then abandoned at a point where the flakes being generated fall below the desired size. In
an area where raw materials are scarce, one would anticipate that more cores would be reduced to a much
greater extent, and flakes that are below the optimal size to complete a task would nonetheless be employed.
However, in the case of the Rockshelter A occupants, who had the luxury of occupying an area so rich in
raw materials, there was little need to work cores to the point of exhaustion or to habitually use flake tools of
a small size. The proximity to abundant and relatively high-quality materials is the most likely explanation
for why so few cores have been reduced so extensively. The portion of the core inventory that contains the
149

greatest amount of cortex, on the other hand, likely represents the practice of raw material testing, where
only a few flakes are removed simply to check a piece for quality, fractures, and other attributes that may
impact the suitability of the rock for tool production.
Conservative behavior does not appear to be a strong component of the tool production strategy at
Rockshelter A as evidenced by the rarity of exhausted cores and the minimal use of sub-standard quality
raw materials (represented by rejected tested cobbles). However, this is not to say that the technological
strategies employed there could be characterized by wastefulness, as it appears that most cores fall squarely
in the middle range of reduction continuum rather than at the low end of the spectrum. Considering that much
of the available raw material is not internally homogenous, and that some varieties of material are grainier
and/or more difficult to knap toward the interior of the nodules, this may very well contribute to the paucity
of exhausted or intensively reduced cores from the site. This would, again, support the contention that the
abundance of raw materials in the vicinity did not necessitate the use of undesirable nodule interiors for
tool production. Once the higher quality flakes were detached from the nodule exteriors, the cores could be
rejected in favor of another piece of material. Thus, rather than fostering explicitly wasteful behaviors with
respect to raw material use, it seems that material abundance simply enabled the occupants of Rockshelter
A to be more selective in their use of both material quality and flake tool size than populations in regions
of material scarcity might be.

6. Historic Artifacts
J. E. Thomas
The MAI investigation of Rockshelter A recovered 274 historic artifacts ascribed to five of the eight
functional categories following the criteria outlined in Analytical Methodology. The site assemblage is
discussed by functional designation in Results.

Analytical Methodology
The artifact classification system employed by MAI is designed to provide a standardized analytical
framework suitable for application to all types of historic sites as well as all social and economic groups.
As such, it is also designed to be easily expanded, refined, and/or modified as individual research projects
warrant. This classification system is also designed to accommodate the analysis of domestic, industrial, and
other types of material culture remains. The following provides a review of the analytical and classification
systems utilized by MAI to identify and synthesize information on historic sites and historic artifact
assemblages.
The classification system used for historic artifacts is adapted with some modification from the
classification scheme presented by Stanley South (1977). This classification system is primarily focused on
ceramic vessels, glass sherds, architectural remains, and—less intensively—on all other historic material
culture remains. Artifacts are sorted into nine major functional categories or groups: activities, architectural
remains, arms/firearms, electrical parts, furniture, industrial, kitchen, personal, and miscellaneous items
(i.e., items not included in any of the above categories). These analytical categories are further subdivided
into material classifications (classes): biological, ceramic, composite, geological, glass, metal, and plastic.
Each of these categories undergoes a separate, attribute-oriented analysis which records pertinent data
regarding artifact category, class, subclass, type, and variety, as well as metric and contextual information.
The analytical organization of each of the nine major artifact categories consists of observations
regarding contextual and provenience data (see Chapter 3), three to nine observations regarding the artifact
and its physical qualities, three observations regarding the artifact’s age, when possible, and four or five
more generalized observations. These attribute categories are briefly described and discussed below.
Pertinent observations are made for each artifact by artifact category subdivision, depending on the
importance placed on such subdivisions, in order to obtain significant temporal and cultural information.
Observations made on ceramics include major paste/glaze subclass and types, as well as decorative types,
color(s), degree of crazing, and general vessel morphology. Other artifact categories have additional
category-specific observations made depending on the types of information desired. For example, nails are
measured and placed in size categories, window glass thickness is measured, dates of coins are recorded,
bone modifications are noted, thermal alteration is recorded, makers’ marks are researched, and so forth.
As new items are recovered or a better understanding of a particular item or attribute becomes known, this
information can easily be added to the record.
Wherever possible, the artifact analysis attempts to assess the dates of manufacture and use for
individual specimens. Many ceramic and glass vessels fragments and certain other non-vessel items (e.g.,
nails, brick, electrical parts) are placed in broad age brackets when diagnostic temporal attributes are evident.
The “beginning date” refers to the date after which broad dissemination of a particular item was clearly
evident for common household usage in the region. The “ending date” refers to the date after which an item

151

was no longer easily accessible in the greater study area. Since some items are more difficult to bracket by
point estimators, an indication of the accuracy level to be placed on the chronological data is also coded.
The specific considerations employed for processing and analysis of the material culture assemblage
are outlined below by artifact group.

Activities
Materials within this category reflect the numerous activities performed by the inhabitants of a site.
Activity-related artifacts include writing or educational items (e.g., slate pencil, ink bottles, pens, sealing
wax); toys and games; sewing materials; stable and transportation items (e.g., horse shoes, curry comb,
automobile parts, license plate, boat trailer hitch); smoking items (e.g., ceramic pipes, lighter); farming
and gardening tools; fishing and hunting items; musical instruments; household/cleaning implements (e.g.,
broom, fly swatter, washtub, rug beater); photography items (e.g., camera parts, film roll); and pet-related
items (e.g., collar, leash).

Architectural Remains
Architectural remains subsume all materials associated with structures (e.g., houses, barns, sheds,
privies, wells, gazebos). These materials include nails (i.e., both whole and fragmentary as well as wire,
wrought, and machine cut); bricks of handmade and machine-pressed manufacture; window glass and
fragments thereof, as well as other flat plate glass; mortar, cement, concrete, wood, slate, tar paper, shingles,
barbed wire, tile, hinges, doorknobs, and other miscellaneous building hardware. By far the two most
important of these classes are nails and window glass, which are more fully discussed in the following.
Nails were frequently used in the construction of dwellings, barns, various types of outbuildings, and
fences, and consequently are a common constituent of yard middens at most historic sites. Nails enter the
archaeological record through several mechanisms and are not simply the product of intentional discard.
A few may be lost, bent, or discarded during initial construction. A substantial number enter as a result of
yearly occupation. Wood structures endure daily and seasonal temperature and moisture fluctuations that
play on the wood to loosen nails, gradually working some of them out of their holes after several years
(Jensen 1971; Jurney 1987; Sloane 1982). In other situations, nails are discarded when buildings are torn
down or moved to new locations. Other old buildings burn or collapse in place, leaving behind a clear
concentration of nails. All of these factors contribute to a “rain” of nails entering the archaeological midden,
primarily in the form of shake roofing nails (3.2 cm, 3.8 cm), wall board nails (6.3 cm), and wall battens
(5.5 cm). If a structure remains in place for 10–20 years, this “nail rain” will be substantial and will reflect,
in a general way, the types of buildings and construction styles once standing.
Systematic excavations of historic sites provide samples of nail rains that can be used to reconstruct
some of the former buildings no longer extant. Specific intrasite locations are analyzed and their nail sizes
are used as evidence for the type of construction. Nail densities and size ratios for dwelling and outbuilding
locations vary considerably from site to site and intrasite differences provide insight on the ages, evolution,
and types of buildings on each farmstead (Jurney 1987). Many nails excavated from yard middens and
former dwelling locations are broken. For these and whole nails, nail-length brackets are used to more fully
interpret use patterns. The pennyweight system is avoided because it does not designate the entire range of
nail size variation or accommodate slight differences in nails (Preiss 1970:9). Nail research focuses on the
holding strength of various sized nails and their association with specific architectural design elements and
the dimensions of lumber. The nail length brackets (measured in centimeters) analysis is more suitable than
pennyweights for recording nail sizes, and analyzing structures.

Window Glass
Window panes and window frames contain important information about house construction and the
socioeconomic rank of their initial owners. The frequency of window glass sherds in farmstead middens can
152

provide an empirical data base that indicates strong socioeconomic differentiation among nineteenth century
households. These differences diminished greatly for twentieth century dwellings, and although window
styles were significant, the frequency of window glass is much less important because all households could
afford at least standard windows.
The number of window glass sherds recovered from any given site can vary dramatically; however,
absolute frequencies are misleading since there are differences in the amount of excavation, length of
occupation, and even the final fate of each dwelling. All of these variables have an effect on the total number
of sherds recovered. Furthermore, many abandoned dwellings are vandalized after their occupation. Window
panes are a frequent casualty during occupation, salvage, or vandalism, adding thousands of fragments to
midden deposits in a single episode and inflating overall frequencies. Therefore, the spatial context of the
window glass assemblage rather than the number of sherds is far more meaningful.
Window glass can provide an important dating tool for determining construction dates. Mean thickness
of a sample of common window pane fragments can be used to derive a comparatively accurate initial
construction date for a dwelling, providing important requirements have been satisfied. As Moir (1987:77)
notes, “research thus far has revealed similar least squares regression lines for modeling mean thickness in
the Northeast and South for dwellings constructed between 1810 and 1915.” Thickness data from both of
these areas have produced the following equation for dating the initial construction of dwellings:
I = 84.22 (T) + 1712.7
This equation explains 93 percent (range=.965) of the variation between mean thickness (T) and initial
construction date (I) for 45 structures (Moir 1987:77). Several independent checks made using published
data have yielded similar results (e.g., Huntington 1982:33; Lees 1977).
There are, however, several important qualifications to these findings. Mean thickness for structures
built earlier than 1810 or later than 1915 is a poor indicator of construction dates. Changes in the methods
of production of flat glass and changes in window styles make thickness of little use for deriving initial
construction dates. In 1924, U.S. government specifications for common window glass set thickness of
single strength panes at 0.08–0.10 in (2.04–2.54 mm) and double strength at 0.10–0.12 in (2.77–3.18
mm) (Lees 1977; Monro 1926:95; Roenke 1978). Consequently, thickness of common window glass by
definition is restricted to values thinner than 0.13 in (3.30 mm) by the early twentieth century. Excluding
sherds with thicknesses > 0.12 in (3.20 mm) filters out special varieties of flat glass (i.e., uncommon or
special pane glass of special flat glass for non-window pane functions), and yields more reliable results.
Common window glass not used for window panes (e.g., furniture, mirror, fish tank, picture frame) can be
filtered out by limiting assemblages to sherds found within 4 m (13.12 ft) of a structure.
In summary, limiting flat glass samples to units directly associated with architectural remains and
excluding sherds thicker than 0.12 in (3.20 mm) help to filter out extraneous pane fragments and specialty
flat glass to yield a more reliable assemblage for deriving chronological information. If these two precautions
are followed, then an accurate (i.e., ± 7 years) estimate of the initial construction date of a dwelling can be
obtained in six out of ten cases. Sample sizes have to be reasonable and samples not collected from a single
context. Length of occupation also needs to be less than 60 years, and if structural additions are present,
these need to be recognized and sampled separately. Last of all, upper class dwellings, urban dwellings, and
specialized buildings are less likely to produce useful results, and the formula is not designed to be applied
to these other categories of buildings.
Context, or the precise intrasite provenience of each sherd of flat glass, for example, is the single
most important variable, requiring exact control, in order to study change in thickness over time. Poor
context generally under-represents correlations between most thickness indices and time. Other important
elements are initial construction date, likelihood of structural additions, occupation span, site function,
socioeconomic status of initial and subsequent occupants, minimum/maximum sherd count requirements,
153

criteria for identification of flat glass, and criteria for removing atypical window glass or specialty kind of
flat glass from consideration.

Firearms
Firearm remains include gun flints, shot, cartridges, shotgun shells, skeet fragments, bullets, and
plastic wadding from shells as well as gun parts.

Electrical
All battery parts, electrical wire, light bulb fragments, electrical motor parts, and insulators are
included in this category.

Furniture
Materials related to furniture and household appliances include chair, bed frame, desk drawer pulls,
wastebasket, lantern parts, coal box, awning hinge, stove, stove pipe, picture frame, etc.

Industrial
This category includes all items related to industry, business, or trade such as mining, forestry, textile
manufacturing, painting, masonry, iron manufacturing, farriery, etc.

Kitchen
All artifacts related to kitchen functions are placed in this category. This includes ceramic vessels
(e.g., plates, cups, pitchers, storage crocks); glass ware (e.g., bottles, tableware, jars, closures); refuse (e.g.,
corn cobs, egg shell, fish scales, teeth); cooking and baking vessels (e.g., pie pan, coffee pot, tea pot);
utensils (e.g., knives, forks, ladle, rolling pin); storage containers (e.g., canister, tin cans, lunch pail, baby
bottle); and tools (e.g., egg beater, cookie cutter, measuring spoon). A discussion of ceramic and glass
vessels, the two most important classes of kitchen-related artifacts, is provided below.
The classification system for processing ceramic sherds from historic sites utilizes paste/glaze
and decorative criteria to differentiate specimens. Attributes are noted for decoration type, motif colors,
glaze quality, general vessel morphology, and evidence of heat disfigurement or burning. Five ceramic
subclasses are used to sort sherds into major morphological/functional categories: redwares, yellowwares,
refined earthenwares, stonewares, and porcelains. Occasionally, a sherd or two can pose a classification
problem, but most sherds readily fit into these five classes without much difficulty. New subvarieties of
redwares and yellowwares are easily added when encountered, but most sherds can be coded within about
two dozen types of refined earthenware, stonewares, and porcelains. Coarse earthenwares specimens (e.g.,
flowerpots, drainage tile) are classified in the Activities or Architecture artifact categories. Additionally,
the manufacturing information that is available as a documentary resource provides a temporal aspect of
ceramic analysis.
The five major ceramic subclasses are devised to separate ware types into broadly related groups.
Although there are many other alternative classification systems, the divisions employed facilitate a
general sorting of sherds into several important and closely related morphological/functional groupings.
The following defines the major characteristics of each ceramic subclass based on examples commonly
represented in each of these subclasses.
Redware: Red earthenware is low-fired, resulting in a soft, porous paste that is either unglazed or
glazed with a lead oxide. Glazes often were applied on only the interior of a vessel and were often colored
white, green, yellow, black, or brown. Decorations on redware can include trailing, swirling, or combed slip
glazes (slipware) as well as decorative piercing, incising, or sprigging. Redware is a versatile ceramic that
was used for all common household vessels (e.g., fine tea wares, plates, bowls, cups, mugs, baking dishes,
storage jars, chamber pots, toys, figurines). Available at the end of the sixteenth century in Europe, redware

154

was widely used in North America into the early nineteenth century and continued to be produced to a lesser
extent by local potteries throughout the nineteenth century.
Yellowware: These specimens are typically light sandy yellow to buff, semi-refined earthenware,
often decorated with banded slips and mocha designs. Later specimens are plain, molded forms with
colored glazes. Most common are sherds of hollow vessels, especially mixing bowls, and on earlier sites,
chamber pots. Twentieth century varieties consist of harder pastes and sometimes are better classified as
semi-vitrified.
Refined Earthenware: These white to extremely light buff, refined earthenware run the full continuum
from very light, porous and non-vitrified to dense, semi-vitrified bodies typical of the better-quality
ironstones or more common twentieth whitewares and tinted whitewares. Creamwares, pearlwares,
whitewares, ironstones, and tinted and colored varieties of white paste refined earthenware (e.g., Fiesta
type wares) all fall under this subclass. Vessel forms generally relate to fine tableware vessels such as plates,
cups, saucers, bowls, but also include mixing bowls, wash basins, pitchers, pans, and chamber pots. The
evolution of paste/glaze types progressed from mostly bluish-tinted wares in the early-nineteenth century
to ivory-tinted and dark-colored wares in the twentieth century.
Stonewares: These tan, brown, gray, buff, orange, or red, semi-vitrified to vitrified wares were used as
utilitarian vessels for general household functions. Glazes vary from salt and alkaline glazes to a variety of
dark (Albany) or light (Bristol) slips. Most nineteenth century vessels exhibit throwing rings whereas more
commercial wares and twentieth century vessels are often mass molded rather than hand thrown. Vessel
forms commonly represented by sherds included jugs, crocks, and churns. Bowls, jars, and pans as well as
reed-stemmed tobacco pipes are less frequent but are also represented.
Porcelains: These specimens are white to grayish-, bluish-white, or off-white, highly vitrified,
semitranslucent wares that usually exhibit conchoidal fractures when broken. Some less-expensive grades,
however, exhibit a slightly granular texture and are commonly referred to as “hotel” wares. These wares
actually represented a coarser grade of semi-porcelain. Vessels generally are restricted to fine tableware
forms such as tea cups, saucers, plates, bowls, and mugs. The most important attribute for assigning a sherd
to this subclass is translucency when it is held against a focused light source. Thick sherds need only to
exhibit translucency along their thinner, broken edges.
Glass Vessels
Analysis of glass vessels incorporates a technomorphological classification of bottle glass that is
based on sensitive chronological indicators such as pontils, molds and seams, rim and neck finishes, and
glass coloration. An added aspect of bottle glass analysis is the manufacturing information that is available
as a documentary resource. Vessel glass is subdivided into four categories: bottles (whole and fragments);
table glass (e.g., stemware, candy dish, plate, tumbler); jars; and stoppers. Vessel glass fragments which
cannot be ascribed to any of the above categories are classified as unknown and usually include burned or
molten specimens.

Personal Items
Clothing and items used for everyday activities and adornment have also been demonstrated to
indicate temporal variability. Bone buttons, for instance, were common in frontier settings, but vanished
after the Civil War. Shell buttons continued throughout the nineteenth century, but were replaced by metal,
glass, and plastic in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The classes of personal items include
clothing items (e.g., buttons, snaps, hooks, fasteners, zippers, shoe parts, buckles); trade beads; hygiene
items (e.g., toothbrush, comb, false teeth); jewelry and jewelry storage vessels; and a general class that
includes residual items (e.g., calling card case, wig, parasol, eyeglass).

155

Miscellaneous Items
This category includes all items that could not be placed into any of the other major categories. These
usually consist of nondescript materials that are often burned or deteriorated beyond recognition. It also
includes prehistoric items such as lithics and ceramics as wells as fuel remains (i.e., slag, cinders, clinkers,
coal), fossils, and non-cultural ecofacts.

Results
The MAI investigation of Rockshelter A recovered 274 historic artifacts, the large majority (99.3
percent [n=272]) of which were recovered from the ground surface and/or the site’s uppermost strata (Strata
III, IV, V, VI, and IX). The assemblage is dominated by glass (n=144 [52.5 percent]) and metal (n=111
[40.5 percent]) specimens, most of which have been ascribed to the Kitchen and Miscellaneous functional
category (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). A catalog of all historic artifacts with provenience and description is presented

Activities
The 5 artifacts within the activity category are all metal and consist of a straight pin, a shovel part
with the blade missing, a snuff/tobacco can, an automotive machine part, and a miniature cast iron pot (4
cm diameter x 2.5 cm height) with handle (2.7 cm length). Recovered as a surface find downslope from the
rockshelter, the small pot (Figure 6.1) may represent a child’s toy or part of a traveling salesman’s sample
set of a cast iron stove that came with pots and pans. The heavy automotive part (Figure 6.2) is an arched
cast iron item with I-beam graduated grooves that measures 41 cm long x 4.5 cm (at its widest end) to 2.7
cm (at its thinnest end) wide. It is possibly a control arm or suspension part of an early twentieth century
automobile or tractor.

Architecture
The architectural assemblage (n=18) consists of clear window glass (n=10), metal (n=4), biological
(n=2), geological (n=1), and plastic (n=1). The metal category includes one cut nail, two wire nails, and
one segment of wire. The geological item is a stone that is partially covered with mortar in which is a piece
of rusted metal. The plastic is a circular washer and the biological is the remains of a wooden stake and a
piece of rubber.

Rockshelter A.

Arms/Firearms
There are 12 metal firearm-related items, including 2 lead pellets that measure 3 mm x 2 mm. Shotgun
ammunition includes one 16 gauge shotgun shell metal case with a headstamp of “Western New Chief 16”
and one centerfire shotgun shell casing with a headstamp of “Western New Chief 12.” Western New Chief
shotgun ammunition was introduced in 1898; the 12 gauge cartridge continued in production to ca. 1916
while the 16 gauge continued to be made until ca. 1940. Bullet shell casings include five .22 caliber rimfire
(two unstamped, two bearing a “U” headstamp, and one with a possible diamond headstamp). There are
3 rimfire cartridges of .25 caliber (one unstamped, one bearing a “U” headstamp, and one with a burned
and unrecognizable headstamp). The U headstamp signifies manufacture by the Union Metallic Cartridge
Company (1860s–1911), which was purchased by Remington Arms Company in 1911 and continued to use
the U headstamp on rimfire cases.

Kitchen
A total of 80 artifacts from Rockshelter A are attributable to various kitchen-related activities. This
category includes glass (n=63), metal (n=9), and ceramic (n=8). The ceramic category includes six stoneware
sherds that represent a single stoneware, cylindrical-shaped, jar/crock with a 22 cm diameter base, a 22 cm
interior aperture diameter at the lip, and a 24 cm aperture diameter measured from the lip exterior. None
of the six stoneware sherds conjoin and, therefore, the height of the vessel is unknown. The wheel-thrown,
wide-mouthed crock has a dark brown natural slip interior and a natural slip exterior that varies from dark
brown to light brown, a consequence of the kiln firing (Figure 6.3). The rim is a rounded 2.7 cm wide band

and there is an impressed number 2 capacity mark located 1 cm below the rim. The base is flat and the base
exterior is glazed only where the natural clay slip seeped onto it. The ceramic assemblage also includes one
rim sherd of undecorated whiteware. The eighth ceramic sherd in the assemblage is missing.
The kitchen glass assemblage (n=63) includes 1 whole, machine-made, clear glass bottle with a
continuous thread finish and “Made in USA” embossed on the base. There are 3 glass items that are jar
related. One is a milk glass jar liner with a fragmented zinc cap (Figure 6.4); the glass liner is embossed
with “Genuine Zinc Cap for Ball Mason Jar.” Additionally, the jar category includes a clear glass lightening
bail jar lid and a sherd of aqua glass with a continuous finish (see Figure 6.4). There is one clear glass rim
sherd of a tumbler. The remaining 58 glass items are bottle fragments. The clear glass fragment category
(n=43) includes one base with no markings; one cup bottom, oval-shaped, base with embossed “...DINE”;
31 body sherds, one of which has the partial embossed letters “…GT” over “…N”; 3 with threaded finishes;
1 sherd with an unidentified finish; and six unidentified bottle sherds. Aqua glass bottle fragments include
eight body sherds, one unidentified sherd, and two conjoining base sherds with an embossed “2” (see Figure
6.4). The post bottom base measures 11 cm in diameter. Amber glass fragments include one base and one
unidentified glass sherd. There are two manganese solarized sherds.
The kitchen-related metal items (n=9) include one ferrous metal utensil spoon head (see Figure 6.2),
one ball of aluminum foil, and 7 cans or can parts (see Figure 6.2). The metal cans include 3 lift-tab drink
cans that measure 12.5 cm in height and 6.5 cm in diameter, one of which is stamped “Schlitz.” The
assemblage also includes one can (6.5 cm in diameter and 8.2 cm in height); one can with detached lid (8.5
cm in diameter and 3.9 cm in height); one can lid that is 7 cm diameter; and one can lid (7 cm diameter)
stamped with “TURKEY LOAF Tony Downs Food Company.” The Tony Downs Food Company started
canning poultry products in 1947 in St. James, Minnesota.

Miscellaneous
The miscellaneous category (n=159) includes glass (n=71), metal (n=81), biological (n=2), ceramic
(n=4), and plastic (n=1). Table 6.2 presents the color categories of the 71 miscellaneous glass fragments.
The metal items include 1 slag, 73 unidentifiable ferrous items, 6 unidentifiable lid or container items, and a

segment of a cast iron wheel housing (see Figure 6.2). The biological items include an unidentifiable piece
of paper and a Scotch tape label. The single plastic item is a square based cap or base (2.1 cm) for a pole/
tube (1.3 cm diameter). The 4 ceramic items are pieces of unidentifiable fired clay.

Discussion
As noted above and detailed in Appendix C, the great majority of the 274 historic period artifacts
recovered from the MAI investigation of Rockshelter A are surface or upper strata (Strata III, IV, V, VI,
and XI) finds. Six glass sherds were recovered from cultural features that are recognized as historical or
historically disturbed features (see Features I, II, and VI, [see Chapter 4])). There are two exceptions where
glass sherds were recovered from deeper strata. One glass sherd was recovered from Stratum IX but was
not associated with Cultural Features II and IX. The other glass sherd was recovered from Stratum XI, ca.
75 cm below ground surface.
The distribution and the types of historic artifacts suggest that these items were lost or discarded as
trash, possibly by hunters using the site. The ammunition assemblage of shotgun casings, bullet cartridges,
and shotgun pellets directly attest to the presence of hunters. Additionally, the identifiable kitchen glass
and metal items are related to carrying food and liquids (i.e., fruit jars, beverage bottles, beer and/or soda
cans, processed meat cans, and a stoneware crock) that hunters would have brought with them. There
are very few architectural materials in the assemblage, which indicates that the thin sheet midden is not
associated with a structure. Similarly, the lack of kitchen serving and cooking items, along with the absence
of personal artifacts, suggest that this area was not used as a household trash dump. The surface recovery
of the cast iron wheel housing, the cast iron control bar, and the miniature cast iron pot downslope from the
rockshelter and may be a consequence of random disposal from the upper ridge top.
Although the parameters (i.e., context, sample size) required for calculating a building’s construction
date from window glass thickness preclude its use here, other datable artifacts recovered from the trash
midden indicate a twentieth century temporal ascription. The shotgun shell casings from the Western New
Chief company, a stoneware crock, manganese solarized glass fragments, a fruit jar with a lightening bail
lid, a fruit jar milk glass liner with zinc cap, and the miniature cast iron pot indicate use during the early
decades of the twentieth century when these items were prevalent. The lift-tab beer cans (1960s) and the
Tony Downs Food Company meat can (1947 at the earliest), however, indicate that the rockshelter was
used into at least the middle twentieth century. Although on Fort Hood property, the rockshelter is not in
a controlled access area, hence, the use by local hunters after its accession by Fort Hood or by military
personnel for the same purpose.

7. Vertebrate Faunal Remains
L. L. Cabo-Perez
The present report examines two subsamples of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal elements
recovered from Rockshelter A. Subsample A is composed of 748 faunal elements from the TRC-MA Test
Pit 3 excavations of 1994 (Trierweiler 1996). This first assemblage, from a previous excavation, lacks
precise spatial provenience data, providing information regarding mainly sample preservation and physical
characteristics, diagenetic processes, human modification, and basic utilization patterns.
Subsample B is composed of 2,211 faunal elements, mostly animal bone fragments, recovered during
the MAI excavations from 2003 to 2006. Three hundred thirty of the elements in Subsample B were
recovered and documented in situ during excavation or surface surveying, including exact provenience
data. The remaining 1,881 remains were recovered at screening, specifying the spatial coordinates of
the grid unit and level of the sediment from which they were recovered. In this manner, Subsample B
allowed for the assessment of the spatial patterning of the faunal elements across the site, as well as a
means of testing and confirming the key hypotheses derived from the analysis of Subsample A—notably in
terms of the representativeness and utility of the assemblage for behavioral inference and paleoecological
reconstruction.

Materials and Methods
All specimens were individually examined, labeled with their FS numbers and catalogued with the
appropriate provenience and supplementary data. The later included anatomical and taxonomic attribution
whenever it was possible to infer these parameters at any level within the anatomical or taxonomic hierarchies.
Specimens that could not be identified at the species or exact anatomical level (including laterality), but
displayed any recognizable anatomical trait or surface that may lead to a posterior classification of the bone
element were consigned as “identifiable” in the records. Hence, items consigned as “non-identifiable” lack
any trace of articular surface, muscular insertion or other anatomical landmark. As discussed below, the
non-identifiable category consists mostly of minute bone splinters, constituting the vast majority of the
assemblage.
Any potential signs of human modification, such as thermal alteration, perimortem fractures, or bone
surface marks were also noted and examined. In particular, Subsample A was utilized to assess the frequency
and distribution of burned bone across different levels. For this purpose, Spearman’s rank correlation was
used to test whether the amount of burned bone present at each level was dependent just on sample size, or
other factors were necessary to explain any potential differences in the frequencies of burned bone observed
at each level. The same technique was employed to assess the dependence of sample size on the proportion
of identifiable versus unidentifiable elements.
Based on the results from Subsample A, which strongly suggested a poor inferential value of the
assemblage due to its extreme fragmentation and preservation biases, quantitative analysis of Subsample
B focused primarily on the size and spatial distribution of the remains, with the goal of testing these
assumptions. In order to provide a more precise assessment of the degree of fragmentation of the assemblage,
and thus of its value for paleoecological or behavioral inference, the maximum length of all elements in this
subsample was measured, and size distribution estimated for intervals range 2–6 cm and above. The spatial
distribution of these size classes was also assessed for all elements that were recovered in situ, specifying
exact spatial coordinates.
163

Gaussian kernel density estimates were obtained for the spatial distribution of all elements recovered
during the screening of the sediments from each excavation unit. This allowed for the detection of potential
high-density locations which are tentatively indicative of higher or localized activities at those areas. The
comparison of these analyses with those performed on Subsample A allowed for the identification and
better characterization of preservation biases affecting any potential inferences regarding the original
composition and depositional history of the assemblage. For clarity and simplicity, when discussing issues
such as species or skeletal part representation in the following sections we will mainly focus on the results
from Subsample A, referring to the equivalent ones in Subsample B only when they are either significantly
different or useful to complement the former.

Results
Sample Preservation and Identifiability
Nearly all elements in Subsample A were classified as microdebitage, with total lengths under 10 cm.
Of the 748 elements in that subsample, only 55 specimens (< 7.35 percent) are potentially identifiable at
least at the anatomical level and, among those, only three specimens could be reliably assigned to a taxon
below the order level in this study (Table 7.1).
The examination of the size distribution of Subsample B confirmed this extreme level of fragmentation,
with 96 percent of the subsample (2,119 elements) corresponding to small, unidentifiable bone fragments
with maximum lengths under 4 cm (Figure 7.1). The mode of the maximum length is under 2 cm (1,841
elements, or 83 percent of the total sample), with only 22 elements displaying maximum lengths above 6
cm and identifiability frequencies similar or even below those in Subsample A.
As would be expected, the size distribution of the elements detected during surveying or excavation
(n=330) is less skewed toward small values, but even in this case close to 80 percent of the sample is

Note: Specimens were considered as potentially identifiable whenever they displayed any recognizable anatomical trait or surface that may lead
to a posterior classification of the bone element, such as portions of articular surfaces, muscular insertions or other anatomical landmarks. Similar
patterns were observed in Subsample B.

constituted by bone fragments under 4 cm in length (see Figure 7.1b), further illustrating the poor
preservation of the assemblage.
Levels rendering higher bone fragment totals in Subsample A also consistently displayed a higher
number of identifiable specimens (Spearman’s rs=0.76; p=0.021), suggesting that the local amount of
identifiable specimens is better explained by the fragmentation of large bones within the sediment, rather
than by differential utilization or deposition rates at different archaeological levels or locations. This is
further supported by the presence of outliers at both sides of the spectrum, with levels 6 and 7 displaying
larger frequencies of potentially identifiable specimens than expected from their samples sizes, and Level 3
displaying the opposite pattern (Figure 7.2).

Spatial Patterns
The observations above are supported by the spatial patterning of the elements recovered both
during surveying and excavation, and at the screens. Figure 7.3 displays the distribution of the elements
documented in situ, with exact spatial provenience data. As mentioned above, elements in the smallest size
classes are less numerous in this sample (see Figure 7.1b), and actually 75 percent of all specimens with
maximum lengths above 4 cm (69 out of 92) and all 22 items above 6 cm were recovered in this manner.
However, elements under 2 cm were still the most abundant, and close to 80 percent of the specimens in this
group were under 4 cm long (see Figures 7.1b and 7.3b). Within excavated areas, the spatial distributions
of fragments above and under 4 cm seem to overlap each other almost perfectly, with no spatial segregation
based on bone size (see Figure 7.1b). The only clear pattern observed in this sense is the expected larger
average size of the 12 elements recovered at the surface (Figure 7.3b), with half of the specimens above 6
cm and only one below 2 cm.
The Gaussian Kernels obtained from the spatial distribution, by grid unit, of the screened elements
displayed a similarly overlapping pattern, with two hot spots of high density in the units between 23-26 East
and 19-20 North, and between 22 and 23 N (Figure 7.4). These units also correspond with high-density areas
for exactly provenienced specimens (see Figure 7.3) but, in light of the reported results, must be interpreted
cautiously. These high-density spots might represent areas of higher deposition or associated to specialized
uses, but are also consistent with the hypothesis, advanced above, of higher fragmentation of large skeletal
165

Figure 7.2. Number of potentially identifiable
specimens versus sample size in each of the levels
of Subsample A. The trend line was forced through
the origin and has a non-zero slope (F1,8=6.931;
p=0.030). While the frequencies observed at the
levels close to the trend line could be explained by
differential deposition rates (i.e. the larger amount
of bones originally deposited at that level, the more
identifiable ones would have also been deposited),
the frequencies present at the three outliers (Levels 3, 6 and 7) are better explained by bone fragmentation
within the sediment. The high volume of small, unidentifiable fragments in Level 3 would be the result of
the high fragmentation of larger elements, which therefore will be less numerous at that level. Similarly,
small fragments would be less frequent at Levels 6 and 7 precisely because larger elements did not atomize,
remaining as identifiable elements.

parts within the sediment of these areas. In this manner, the atomization of just one or two large skeletal
elements could produce a similar pattern of localized high density. Additionally, the units between N16
and N17, and between N25 and N26 display relatively high densities of exactly provenienced specimens
(see Figure 7.3), but very low densities of screened elements (see Figure 7.4), which could suggest that
the spatial patterns may not be reflecting depositional history, but rather excavation effort. Therefore, any
potential interpretation of these spatial patterns for behavioral or taphonomic inference must rely on their
association with further archaeological or geological evidence.

Potential Anthropogenic Alteration and Skeletal Part Representation
Some of the larger specimens present peri-mortem fractures and surface marks which may be derived
from human activity. However, given the extremely fragmentary nature of the assemblage, with the only
episodic presence of elements suitable for that type of analysis, the best evidence to support an anthropic
origin of the deposit is provided by the presence of burned bone. In particular, more than 60 percent of
the elements in Subsample A display thermal (heat) alteration (Table 7.2). The number of burned bones
recovered at each of the archaeological levels in Table 7.1 is strongly correlated with the sample size for
that level, explaining more than 80 percent of the variance observed (Spearman’s rank correlation rs = 0.90;
p<0.01), suggesting that the distribution of the burned bone, and with it the rest of the assemblage, may be
the result of the disposal of waste elements, rather than of specialized activities at some occupation areas.

suggest a bias against the preservation of high-utility
elements and, in particular long bone diaphyses (Grayson, 1989; Marean and Frey, 1997, and references
therein).
An additional indication cautioning about the over-representation of cranial elements and, in general,
against extracting further behavioral inferences from such a fragmentary sample, is the extremely low
frequency of teeth, with only four (less than 0.20 percent) present in Subsample B, corresponding in all
cases to deer (Cervidae). Given the higher density and resilience of teeth, the ratio of these elements to other
cranial parts provides an assessment of both the real frequency of unprocessed cranial elements originally
present in the assemblage, and the general level of preservation and fragmentation of the sample (Stiner
1994).

Taxonomic Representation
As with the anatomical part representation, the low sample size for identifiable specimens and the
overwhelming preservation bias detected in the analyses above, severely limit the utility of the assemblage
for paleoecological reconstruction. In particular, these factors, as well as the extreme influence of diagenetic
processes on the composition of the assemblage that can be inferred from them, advise against any
interpretation beyond the mere reporting of the presence of the taxa recognizable in the analysis.
As reflected in Table 7.1, and further confirmed in Subsample B, the only macro-mammal clearly
identifiable in the sample are deer (Cervidae), provisionally classified as Odocoileus sp., and within the
overlapping range of size of both modern mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tail deer (Odocoileus
virginianus). Still, several of the better preserved deer elements were recovered on the surface, so the
interpretation of its archaeological relevance is dependent on the presence of other archaeological materials
at this level, such as lithics. Rabbits (Family Leporidae) are also present in both subsamples.
The only groups not detected in Subsample A (Table 7.1) that were identified in Subsample B are a
small, tight cluster of land snails (Gastropoda [see Figure 7.3a]), and a single Aves long bone diaphysis,
unidentifiable at the taxonomic level. As noted in Invertebrate Faunal Remains, the land snails may represent
an edible species, but the small size of the cluster suggests a non-anthropogenic origin.

168

Discussion
The sample is characterized by its extreme fragmentation and extremely poor diagnostic value for
paleoecological or behavioral inference. The size distribution of the sample is overwhelmingly dominated
by microdebitage with maximum lengths under 4 cm, and median and mode well under 2 cm. In this sense,
the sample is better described not as a true faunal assemblage, but as a component of the sediment in which
bone and other faunal elements appear as a trace element.
The presence and high frequency of heat-altered remains allows attributing an anthropic origin or
association to habitation levels to the sample. The anisotropic spatial distribution pattern, with overlapping
distributions for elements of all sizes, combined with the correlation between the number of identifiable
specimens and sample sizes, suggests that the degree and pattern of fragmentation displayed by the assemblage
is largely derived from trampling and atomization of larger skeletal elements within the sediment. These
characteristics would be consistent with those expected from highly trampled habitation floors. However,
the faunal materials would only serve to support this interpretation if primarily derived from other more
suitable materials, such as soil analyses or associations with archaeological features.
All factors above strongly indicate the presence of an extreme preservation bias, which invalidates
most potential analyses and inference derived from the frequencies of different skeletal areas. Identifiable
elements are also very scarce and altered, so that any taxonomic inference derived from them must be
interpreted as being as episodic as the presence of these elements in the assemblage. Keeping these
reservations in mind, at least two exploitable taxa were identified in the sample: deer, most likely from the
genus Odocoileus, and rabbits (Leporidae).
In sum, the sample is extremely fragmentary, with evident preservation biases, not allowing for any
quantitative taphonomic analysis and exceedingly limited for any other faunal interpretation. However, it
could be potentially informative with respect to diagenetic perspectives, when contrasted with information
and hypotheses derived from other materials.

In addition to the two modified threeridge mussel (Amblema plicata) specimens recovered from
TRC-MA Test Pit 3 and briefly reported by Campbell (2007:7), the MAI excavations produced 11
anthropogenically modified and/or utilized unionid shells.

Analytical Methodology and Criteria of Classification
All specimens were first assigned to taxa based on morphological attributes. Specimens which
apparently exhibited anthropogenic modification and/or wear were then scrutinized via unaided eye and,
when necessary, a variable power stereoscopic microscope. All modifications and/or wear patterns were
noted on standardized forms by genus/species of unionid represented. No formal typology was employed.
The specimens are described below by genus/species.

(range in diameter: 15.32-18.20 mm; mean diameter: 16.76 mm) on the margin and abrasion wear on the
opposite margin. The second specimen (FS 230.803) exhibits a single notch (diameter: 4.67 mm) under

diameter 1.92 mm) near the umbo. This specimen exhibits both marginal and surficial attition.

Discussion
All of the modified mussel specimens derive from excavation levels within Stratum IV (Table 8.1)
and are, therefore, Late Prehistoric in age. The age range for the five radiocarbon determinations from this
level is cal AD 742–1625. All of the specimens exhibit relatively slight modification in the form of notches
or drill holes and all exhibit moderate to heavy edge wear on the valve margin(s). As the wear is essentially
unidirectional, it suggests that these items functioned as scrapers or spokeshaves, possibly on plant fiber or
wood substrates.

Unmodified Invertebrate Faunal Remains
J. M. Campbell and E. A. Weber

Introduction
A total of 22,586 invertebrate faunal remains were recovered during the multi-year excavations at
Rockshelter A. These include 777 specimens from the TRC-MA excavations and 21,809 specimens from
the MAI excavations. The TRC-MA material was provenienced by 10 cm arbitrary levels below ground
surface. The MAI assemblage was documented by excavation unit, natural stratum, and arbitrary level

173

within natural strata (see Chapter 3, Field Methods). Additionally, some MAI specimens were individually
piece-plotted with three dimensional Cartesian coordinates.

Reprocessing of the TRC-MA Sub-Assemblage
Methods
The findings summarized herein include re-examination of previously analyzed mussel shells and
preliminary analysis of land snail shells that were recovered in 1994 by TRC-MA, but apparently not
enumerated. Broken and intact shells of Rabdotus spp. land snails were conspicuous elements of the
recovered shell materials from Rockshelter A test pits. Identification (to the species level) of Rabdotus
shells recovered in excavated soils from Rockshelter A presented special problems, since distinguishing
between the two species represented (prairie rabdotus [Rabdotus mooreanus] and whitewashed rabdotus
[Rabdotus dealbatus]) required discernment of the extent of development of pigmented bands on the shells.
Recovered specimens must be cleaned before attempting identification, and this was not done for all the
land snail shells recovered in 1994. For this reason, the rabdotus findings reported in the following data
tables for the 1994 excavations do not distinguish between the two species.
Results
Rabdotus was the dominant snail represented in samples from nearly every level below 20 cm in Test
Pit 3 (Table 8.2). A small sample of cleaned rabdotus snails examined (from Levels 3 and 10) indicated
that prairie rabdotus and whitewashed rabdotus were present at both the top and bottom of the stratigraphic
profile, with prairie rabdotus apparently dominant at both levels.
Occurrence of shells of both Rabdotus species in Levels 10 and 3 may indicate that vegetation in the
vicinity of the rockshelter included a mixture of woodland and prairie grasslands at both the beginning and
end of the late Prehistoric period, since prairie rabdotus and whitewashed rabdotus prefer open prairie and
wooded habitats, respectively (Fullington and Pratt 1974). The absence of Rabdotus shell from Level 2 of
Unit 3 likely indicates the transition to the historical period, which was characterized by changes in land use,
intense overgrazing, and fire suppression (Hayward et al. 1992 [cited in Diggs et al. 1999; Freeman et al.
2001]). The increasing prominence of the arboreal land snail (Oligyra orbiculata), presently the dominant
snail in the area, beginning in Level 3 may indicate that a shift in vegetation involving increased abundance
of cedar (Juniperus ashei) may have already been underway near the end of the Late Prehistoric period.
A temporal shift in Rabdotus species composition from dominance by prairie rabdotus to whitewashed
rabdotus, concurrent with change from grassland to wooded habitat was noted at site 41CV111 in eastern
Fort Hood (Carlson et al. 1997).
At least one freshwater mussel shell was recovered from nearly every level below 30 cm in Unit 3
(see Table 8.2). Level 6 (50–60 cm) produced the richest assemblage of mussels (3 different species), and
included two human-modified shells. Our mussel species list is slightly different from the species identified
in Trierweiler et al. (1996) for Rockshelter A. We concluded that two shell fragments previously identified
as Louisiana fatmucket (Lampsilis hydiana) were more likely to be yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres).
Threeridge mussel (Amblema plicata) was the only freshwater mussel taxon recovered from the upper
Levels (4 and 5) of Test Pit 3 (see Table 8.2). It was also the dominant taxon represented in Level 6, with
Louisiana fatmucket (Lampsilis hydiana) and pistolgrop mussel (Tritigonia verrucos) as secondary species.
fragile papershell and yellow sandshell were the main mussel species detected below Level 6. Two of the
mussel shells recovered from Level 6 of Test Pit 3, including one specimen each of threeridge mussel and
Louisiana fatmucket, presented similar 1 cm long slits indicative of modification for likely use as ornaments.
Threeridge mussel is a drought-tolerant species that was apparently abundant in both the Leon River
and Cowhouse Creek during the prehistoric period (see Chapter 1, Molluscan Fauna). Louisiana fatmucket
is adapted to slowly moving or standing water (typically found in intermittent streams), and was primarily

an inhabitant of Cowhouse Creek (as opposed to the Leon River) prehistorically. The Louisiana fatmucket
specimens may have been transported by prehistoric people to Rockshelter A from the south.
Fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis) and yellow sandshell are considered drought intolerant, and
could signal that these specimens were brought to Rockshelter A during a climate interval that was wetter
than subsequent periods. Fragile papershell and yellow sandshell are among the dominant mussels currently
found in the Leon River, and are likely benefactors of flow levels stabilized by impoundments above
Gatesville. Although the data available is not sufficient to conclusively identify a trend, a hint of a transition
in the mussel fauna is indicated in the stratigraphic profile from Level 8 (Trierweiler’s 1996 corrected
radiocarbon date of 1240 ± 40 BP) to Level 4 [820 ± 40 BP]). A shift from drought-intolerant mussel species
to more drought-tolerant taxa would be consistent with the regional climate change scenario posited for the
last 1,000 years (Blum et al. 1994; Waters and Nordt 1995), reviewed in a previous section of this report.
175

The lack of mussel shells above Level 4 could signal a decline in freshwater mussel populations related to
increased drought severity or degradation of substrate conditions in local streams during the Toyah phase at
Fort Hood (650–250 BP). Analysis of mussel shells recovered from additional excavations at Rockshelter
A may be useful to verify whether the apparent trend is real.

was analyzed during final processing by measuring and recording the counts of these taxa in three size
categories: adults >20 mm long, juveniles 10–20 mm long, and pre-juveniles <10 mm long. Due to the
abundance of intact identifiable land snail specimens in all excavated strata, the number of broken snail
shell fragments was not tabulated, although the presence of shell material was noted if no intact snail shells
were found in a screened soil sample.
Freshwater mussels shells (including fragments) recovered from Rockshelter A by MAI in 2003–
2006 were identified by comparison to shells of modern-collected specimens obtained by Mercyhurst
biologists from the banks of the Leon River near Gatesville, TX, and by close scrutiny of various umbo,
hinge, and valve characteristics as described in Howells et al. (1996). Mussel shells showing potential
evidence of modification by people were examined with a dissecting microscope, and diagnostic features
(of modifications) were photographed for each specimen.
Results

Land snails
A total of 21,809 identifiable land snail specimens were recovered from Rockshelter A by the MAI
(Table 8.3), spanning the full range of the excavated stratigraphic profile. Two species known to occur
in woodland habitats, arboreal land snail and grassland liptooth (Polygyra mooreana), were dominant in
nearly every stratum, together constituting over 75 percent of the gastropod fauna. Prairie rabdotus, a
large land snail characteristic of open (non-forested) habitats, accounted for 20 percent of the gastropods
recovered during MAI’s 2003–2006 excavation work. This taxon, with a debated status as a food source of
prehistoric humans in Central Texas, was especially abundant in Stratum IX, the main deeper (older) layer
excavated inside the modern dripline of the rockshelter, in which it accounted for 95 percent of the total
identified gastropods.
The greatest bulk (85 percent) of snail material was recovered from Stratum IV (see Table 8.3).
Although the two small woodland snail species arboreal land snail and grassland liptooth were generally
dominant at every level within Stratum IV, high numbers of the prairie rabdotus were recovered in distinctly

higher numbers in the bottom half of that layer, which directly overlaid Stratum IX (Figure 8.4). The large
Rabdotus known to inhabit woodland habitats in Central Texas, whitewashed rabdotus, was present in
low numbers in all of the well-populated strata across the stratigraphic profile of Rockshelter A (see Table
8.3). This species, like arboreal land snail and grassland liptooth, would be expected to occur at the site
incidental due to its habitation of the wooded landscape surrounding Rockshelter A.
Table 8.4 shows the results of age structure analysis of intact Rabdotus specimens of both species.
It is noteworthy that the woodland whitewashed rabdotus presented balanced numbers of adult, juvenile,
and pre-juvenile specimens, as would be expected for individuals from local population randomly entering
the rockshelter site from the surrounding forest. On the other hand, the prairie rabdotus was represented at
Rockshelter A by a disproportionately large number of adult specimens, with juveniles and pre-juveniles of
this taxon disproportionately scarce (see Table 8.4).
It is unlikely that the prairie rabdotus occurred naturally at Rockshelter A, since this land snail is
more characteristic of open, lowland (as opposed to forested, elevated) sites at Fort Hood. With two years
of searching by over a dozen Mercyhurst field biologists, the only locations on Fort Hood where colonies
of prairie rabdotus were ever observed were open grassland habitats in low-lying areas in the valley of

Cowhouse Creek (total of three colonies found in 2005 and 2006). The natural occurrence of this species
in the vicinity of Rockshelter A, a north-facing, forested slope near the top of a mesa-like feature, seems
unlikely. Evidence for a continuous wooded condition at the rockshelter site is indicated by the vertical
profile of land snails for Units 28R32 and 28R33 combined (Figure 8.4), which were both excavated all of
the way to the underlying bedrock. The two species of woodland-specialist land snails (arboreal land and
grassland liptooth) were persistent and conspicuous elements of the gastropod fauna from top-to-bottom of
the stratigraphic profile in these units.

Freshwater Mussels
The stratigraphic distribution of identifiable shells of freshwater mussels recovered from Rockshelter
A by MAI from 2003–2006 (Table 8.5) indicates a consistent presence of these creatures throughout the
excavated profile. The dominant taxon was the three-ridge (Amblema plicata), followed by the fragile
papershell, yellow sandshell and pistolgrip. Dominance by these taxa would align with prehistoric records
(from Fort Hood archaeological sites) of mussels derived from the nearby Leon River (see Table 10.1).
Minor representation of the Louisiana fatmucket, an inhabitant of intermittent streams, would suggest some
occasional transport of shell material to Rockshelter A from Cowhouse Creek.
Frequent occurrence of fragile papershell and yellow sandshell at Rockshelter A indicates likely usage
of mussels as food by prehistoric people, since the shells of these two taxa are too thin to be useful as
tools. A total of 11 of the 70 identifiable mussel shells recovered by MAI in 2003–2006 showed evidence
of modification by humans (see Modified Shell, above). As noted above, all of the modified mussel shells
were recovered from Stratum IV. Threeridge was the mussel species most frequently found in a modified
state, and most of the modifications appeared to serve purposes of facilitating hand-grip (notches), and
improving utility for cutting and scraping. Three specimens showed evidence of perforation or attempted

perforation, consistent with use of mussel shells as ornaments. Some of the unidentifiable mussel shell
fragments showed evidence (dark color) indicative of exposure to fire (see Table 8.5)
Finally, it should be noted that a handful of freshwater mussels found at Rockshelter A may be
cautiously viewed as proxies for temporal change in regional climates, as their habitat requirements are
constrained by hydrological/moisture regimes. In particular, threeridge mussel and Louisiana fatmucket are
drought tolerant species while fragile papershell and yellow sandshell are drought intolerant. The vertical
distribution of species suggests a subtle transition in the exploited mussel fauna with a modest increase in
drought tolerant species at the expense of drought intolerant species spanning the documented period of
Late Prehistoric human utilization of Rockshelter A. This is consistent with the conceptual model of climate
change in central Texas over the past 2,000 years as summarized by Madsen (see Chapter 2).

9. Macrobotanical Remains
J. M. Campbell
A total of 3,761 macrobotanical specimens were recovered during the multi-year excavations at
Rockshelter A. These include approximately 491 remains from the TRC-MA excavations (Trierweiler et
al. 1996) and 3,270 specimens from the MAI excavations. The TRC-MA material was provenienced by ten
centimeter arbitrary levels below ground surface. The MAI assemblage was documented by excavation
unit, natural stratum, and arbitrary level within natural strata. Additionally, some MAI specimens were
individually piece-plotted with three dimensional Cartesian coordinates.

Reprocessing of the TRC-MA Sub-Assemblage
Methods
Previously unprocessed macrobotanical materials recovered in 1994 from test pits within Rockshelter
A by Trierweiler et al. (1996) consisted of both carbonized (charcoal) and non-carbonized (apparently
unburned) items. The non-carbonized macrobotanical specimens included a small number of seeds, which
were identified using Montgomery (1977). To facilitate identification of charcoal samples, Mercyhurst
biologists collected fragments of dead branches from 17 “common” trees and shrubs of Fort Hood during
August 2004. Two to three small (<1–2 cm3) pieces were cut from each sample and burned to produce
charcoal reference “standards.” Variations in the anatomy of the xylem tissues observable using a dissecting
microscope were found to be distinctive for most genera of sampled trees from the fort. The unknown
samples of charcoal from Rockshelter A were identified by comparing them to the samples of “known”
charcoal. Wheeler (1996) provided additional photomicrographs of xylem tissues of other species of Fort
Hood that had not been collected, such as common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) and osage orange
(Maclura pomifera), that had not been collected. Many of the smaller charcoal specimens presenting
irregular structure or poor cross-sectional views were impossible to identify.
Trierweiler et al. (1996) had identified three samples of charcoal used for radiocarbon dating from Test
Pit 3 in Rockshelter A as white oak. Among the five species of oak collected (and converted to charcoal) by
Mercyhurst were two examples of the white oak group (Quercus stellata and Quercus sinuata breviloba),
two examples of the red oak group (Quercus buckleyi and Quercus marilandica) and one evergreen
oak (Quercus fusiformis). It was not possible to consistently distinguish between white oak and red oak
specimens for either the charred standards or charcoal examined in the 1994 samples from Rockshelter A.

Results
Table 9.1 contain taxonomic determinations made for the carbonized macrobotanical items recovered
from units 2 and 3, respectively. Juniper (Juniperus sp.) and oak (Quercus sp.) were the two most frequently
identified species of charcoal in the top three levels of both test pits. This result is consistent with a finding
of non-selective utilization of available fuels during the more recent periods of site occupation, since
Ashe’s juniper (Juniperus ashei) and red oak (Quercus buckleyi) are currently the two dominant trees in the
vicinity of the rockshelter. No samples were taken below 30 cm in Unit 2 because bedrock was encountered
at that depth (Trierweiler et al. 1996). Quercus was the only plant taxon identified in the charcoal samples
below level 3 in Unit 3 (see Table 9.1). The only identifiable seed materials enumerated in the 1994 test
pits were a single acorn from level 3 of Unit 3 and a few juniper seeds from level 6 of the same test pit (see
Table 9.1). Lack of Juniper charcoal below level 3 may be attributed to reduced abundance of this taxon
(and lower availability as fuel) in the more remote past; or it might indicate that oak was a preferred fuel

during the earlier periods of occupation. However, the fact that non-carbonized Juniperus seeds were found
below level 3 in Unit 3 (see Table 9.1) would suggest the possibility that the plant was present in the area
throughout the period of occupation. Therefore a preference for oak (as fuel) by the prehistoric people
inhabiting this site seems highly credible.
Trierweiler et al.’s (1996) radiocarbon dates for charcoal from levels 4, 8, and 9 in test pit (unit) 3
indicated ages of 820 ± 40 BP, 1240 ± 40 BP, and 1260 ± 50 BP, respectively. Level 4 of Unit 3 contained
part of a hearth feature from 30–45 cmbs (designated F1), which contained “a tight concentration of burned
rock” and “dense charcoal.” A second burned rock concentration was found at 65–80 cmbs in levels 7 and
8 (designated F2). Oak was the only identifiable species noted in the charcoal samples associated with both
of the burned rock features (see Table 9.1).
In prior analyses of macrobotanical remains associated with burned rock features at other prehistoric
sites at Fort Hood, Phil Dering (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995: G1–G4) had suggested the possibility that
prehistoric inhabitants chose oak over juniper, despite the fact that “juniper has been a preferred firewood
throughout much of its range.” Oak was the most abundant taxon identified by Dering among 18 prehistoric
sites that produced carbonized plant remains (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995: G1–G4). Perhaps the high resin
content and volatility of juniper made it less desirable than oak for “slow cooking” applications associated
with rock middens and hearths. Dering’s alternate explanation (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995:G4) for the
apparent prominence of oak charcoal at prehistoric sites was the likelihood that “the availability of juniper
during the prehistoric period was lower than at present.”
One of the sites that Dering (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995) analyzed was a rockshelter site (41BL567)
near the eastern end of Fort Hood that contains a hearth feature similar to Rockshelter A. The hearth feature
in 41BL567 was dated to 790 ± 50 BP, placing it in the same time frame as the hearth in Rockshelter A.
The carbonized wood from site 41BL567 (like 41CV115[A]) included both juniper and oak; but the oak
at 41BL567 (in contrast to juniper) was represented in carbonized remains more often than expected in
relation to its frequency of occurrence as non-carbonized remains.
The single carbonized acorn identified by Mercyhurst from level 3 of test pit 3 (see Table 9.1) suggests
that prehistoric occupants of the site may have been processing oak nuts at the site, or that the acorn
was brought into the rockshelter incidental to the transport of oak wood used as fuel. Dering (Abbott and
Trierweiler 1995:G4) cited similar botanical evidence (i.e., pecan and walnut shell fragments) to suggest
that “collecting/processing stations for nut resources” was probably a seasonal (fall) use of rockshelters by
prehistoric people. It is hoped that macrobotanical specimens recovered in the current excavation activities
by Mercyhurst at Rockshelter A may shed additional light on the use of oak resources by Rockshelter A’s
prehistoric inhabitants.

The MAI Sub-Assemblage
Table 9.2 summarizes the findings for charcoal recovered from Rockshelter A by MAI in 2003–2007.
Oak, juniper and ash were the dominant sources of burned wood identified from the rockshelter site in the
more recently excavated materials, similar to what was found in the 1994 test pits (see Table 9.1). There was
no evidence of any difference in the relative importance of the various wood fuel sources between Stratum
IV and Stratum IX in the recent excavation units (Total Chi-square=1.874; Chi-square critical value=7.815
at alpha=0.05, df=3). There is also no evidence to indicate selective utilization of any particular plant
species for fuel, based upon the modern occurrence of oak, juniper, and ash at the rockshelter site (see Table
1.3).
The counts of other macrobotanical items (seeds) recovered from Rockshelter A by MAI from 2003–
2006 are summarized in Tables 9.3 and 9.4. Most (95.9 percent) of the 3,100 seeds recovered from the
excavated units were found in Stratum IV (see Table 9.3), which is not unexpected since this stratum occurs
at the exposed surface of much of the site. The dominant plant species represented with seeds in all strata
were hackberry (Celtis), oak, (Quercus), and juniper (Juniperus). Finding several identifiable specimens

of seeds of these species in nearly every stratum
(see Table 9.3), including relatively ancient Stratum
X (well outside the protection of the rockshelter),
indicates that differential preservation cannot
account completely for the disproportionately large
number of seeds recovered from surface Stratum IV
at Rockshelter A.

The counts of seeds for the three dominant
species were compared between Stratum IV and the
other strata combined, and a Chi-square contingency test indicated no notable difference in the relative
importance of seed types related to stratum (Total Chi-square = 6.973, df = 3). The most remarkable
finding in the 2003–2006 macrobotanical data is the extremely high representation at the rockshelter site
of hackberry (Celtis laevigata) seeds, composing nearly one-third of all of the identifiable seeds and seed
fragments. The other two dominant seed types (oak and juniper) were conspicuous as expected, based
upon their dominance in the modern forest-thicket surrounding the rockshelter. Hackberry was not found
anywhere near the rockshelter during extensive botanical surveys conducted from November 2003 through
August 2004, and would not likely have occurred on the upland slopes above the rockshelter site at any
point in the past, since this species is a specialist for riparian (stream-side) areas at Fort Hood.
It is likely that the conspicuous presence of hackberry seeds can only be attributed to an intentional
human transport of these materials to rockshelter Rockshelter A for purposes of food preparation. In our
modern plant community investigation in the vicinity of Rockshelter A, hackberry was found only in the
immediate riparian zone of Shoal Creek, the nearest major stream down slope and north of the rockshelter.
At the rockshelter site, hackberry seeds were found in disproportionately higher numbers from excavation

units inside the dripline (see Table 9.4) compared to outside the dripline (Total Chi-square = 196.8, df = 3),
indicating that either hackberry seeds were better preserved within the rockshelter, or they were processed
and utilized by people inside the drip-line. Since hackberry seeds are small, hard, hollow spheres that are
relatively resistant to fracturing unless intentionally crushed, our finding of mostly fragments of hackberry
seeds (disproportionately represented inside the dripline) would suggest that the hackberry fruits were
ground up during food preparation. Among the fewer hackberry seed items found outside the dripline, it
was noted that relatively more whole seeds (versus seed fragments) were recovered in excavation units
down slope than from found excavation units higher and inside the dripline (Total Chi-square = 14.748,
df = 1). This is not unexpected, since intact hollow hackberry seeds would be more readily picked up and
transported down slope (from within the rockshelter) during occasional sheetwash erosion events than
broken (and therefore denser) seed fragments.
Besides hackberry, seeds of other edible plant fruits found within Stratum IV of Rockshelter A
include, probably wild, squash (Cucurbitaceae), grapes (Vitis sp.), Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), and
peach (Prunus persica), although the single latter specimen may almost certainly be an item left by modern
visitors to the rockshelter site. Other rarer elements of the seeds recovered at Rockshelter A by MAI confirm
that people who occupied the rockshelter likely utilized the site to process and consume seasonally (i.e., late
summer or autumn) acquired plant foods. It is notable that Cucurbitaceae (squash family) seeds (see Table
9.4) were recovered in disproportionately higher numbers inside (as opposed to outside) of the dripline of
rockshelter Rockshelter A. Like hackberry, plants in the squash family were not found in the immediate
vicinity of the rockshelter in our modern botanical survey, and would not have likely grown near enough
the site in the past for their seeds to be transported to this location by means other than human transport.
The conspicuous representation of oak acorn and juniper fragments versus whole seeds/fruits from
excavation units inside the dripline of Rockshelter A, in disproportionately higher numbers relative to whole
seeds recovered outside the dripline (see Table 9.4), could be interpreted as a consequence of mechanical
reduction during the processing of these materials by prehistoric people using them as a seasonal food
source. This finding (for acorns) is consistent with the suggestion of Dering (in Abbot and Trierweiler
1995:G5) that Fort Hood rockshelters served as seasonal sites for processing nuts, as mentioned earlier for
the findings in the TRC-MA test pit. Although botanical manuals for Central Texas and Fort Hood (Diggs
185

et al 1999 and Sanchez 2002) are silent on the edibility of juniper berries, ethnographic accounts of people
in the Great Plains and other locations in North America have substantiated the human food usage of
Juniperus berries (Brydge and Sherman 2009; Schroth 1996, Sutton 1989).

10. Discussion
Internal Correlations
J. M. Adovasio, A. M. Byrnes, and J. M. Campbell

Chronology
Several lines of evidence are potentially informative about the occupation, visitation, and utilization
trajectory at Rockshelter A. These include: the radiocarbon chronology, the stratigraphy, cross-dated
prehistoric and historic artifacts, and amino acid epimerization of terrestrial mollusk shells. As noted in
Chapter 4 (see Radiocarbon Chronology), the earliest radiocarbon assay from Rockshelter A is cal AD
680–740 from just below Feature 2 in TRC-MA’s Test Pit 3 (Trierweller 1996:218). This date is consistent
with and, in fact, overlaps a determination of cal AD 670–750 from within Feature 2. These assays, in turn,
are supported by a date of cal AD 742–894 from the MAI excavations of Stratum IX within Stratum IV.
Again, as noted in the site’s radiocarbon chronology (see Chapter 4), the latest radiocarbon determination
from the site is cal AD 1730–1926. This is consistent with, at least, four other modern dates with 50 percent
or greater intercept probabilities in the early twentieth century.
Based on the stratigraphic incidence of cross-dated projectile points, the majority (n=39) of identifiable
forms fall within the radiocarbon date range noted above. Specifically, the temporally diagnostic artifacts
appear to conform to three major stylistic and/or temporally distinct forms, all of which are ascribed to
the Late Prehistoric and, in one case, even Protohistoric/Historic periods. These include: Scallorn points,
typically indicative of the Austin phase (AD 700–1200); Perdiz points, associated with the subsequent
Toyah phase (AD 1200–1500); and Cuney points, whose initial appearance is uncertain, but which extends
into the Historic period, perhaps as recently as ca. AD 1750. This late date may be cautiously supported by
several of the lower probability (<50 percent) intercepts of some of the modern radiocarbon assays which
fall into the inferred time range of this type. These dates may also be supported by several of the amino acid
epimerization determinations reported by Trierweller (1996:221–222) on Rabdotus sp. shells. Two of these
dates yielded ages of 440 BP (AD 1510) and 460 BP (AD 1490), which fall at the end of the Toyah phase.
Parenthetically, the other amino acid dates fall comfortably, if not conformably, into the Late Prehistoric.
As discussed below (see Spatial and Temporal Intensity of Site Utilization), while the bulk of the
artifactual and ecofactual materials from Rockshelter A appear to fall between the specified radiocarbon
extremes as well as within the cross-dated time range(s) of diagnostic Late Prehistoric/Historic lithic forms,
there are indications of both earlier and later occupation/visitation/utilization of the site. Specifically, the
lower levels of the site’s deposits both within and outside the dripline do contain a number of Archaic
period points and identifiable point fragments. The oldest of the Archaic diagnostics is a single Uvalde point
recovered during the TRC-MA testing of the site. Uvalde points were once considered to be associated with
the Middle to Late Archaic (Suhm and Selks 1962:255); however, they are now considered to be diagnostic
of the Early Archaic (Prewitt 1981:76, 78). The Uvalde point from Rockshelter A was initially hypothesized
to have been “salvaged” by Late Prehistoric peoples, as at the time of the TRC-MA testing there was no
other evidence of an Archaic presence at the site. However, in light of the materials recovered during the
MAI investigations, which clearly push back the site’s age well into the Archaic, it is now considered
possible (if not likely) that the Uvalde point was both used and discarded by its Early Archaic manufacturer
rather than imported and reused by a Late Prehistoric visitor to the site.

187

Evidence of a Late Archaic occupation is represented by a single Pedernales point, found on the talus
slope, whose temporal range is typically considered to be ca. 2000–1200 BC. The remaining diagnostic
Archaic point inventory consists of one Transitional Archaic Ensor point, likely dating from about 200
BC to AD 600, and four Darl points recovered from buried contexts both inside and outside the dripline of
the rockshelter. Darl points are also Transitional Archaic diagnostics, but are believed to be slightly more
recent, and may even overlap in time with the Late Prehistoric Scallorn point (Collins 1995).
As noted in Chapter 6, visitation to or utilization of the rockshelter during the later Historic period is
well documented artifactually for the later part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Of course,
it is also supported by multiple radiocarbon determinations. However, utilization of Rockshelter A after
the latest radiocarbon determinations is also indicated. Several of the generally surface confined Historic
period artifacts clearly post-date AD 1926. These items notably include aluminum pop-tops from beer
or soda containers which represent a technology initially introduced in 1959 and subsequently employed
throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s.

Spatial and Temporal Intensity of Site Utilization
Intensity of site utilization may be defined or characterized in a number of ways. Minimally, it refers
to differential site occupation, visitation, and use. Differential site uses in turn, may include or reflect: (1)
the number or frequency of visitation/utilization events by temporal period; length of occupation/visitation
events measured in hours, days, weeks, or even months; (2) the number of visitors per event; or (3) some
combination of any or all of the foregoing. Whatever the criteria, intensity of site utilization is not directly
measurable with contemporary archaeological protocols.
Many proxies or indices may, with appropriate caution, be employed to attempt to gauge differential
utilization of Rockshelter A, both in time and through time. These include: number of temporally diagnostic
artifacts by chronological period and spatial location, frequency and horizontal distribution of directly
dated or cross-dated features, and quantification and distribution of artifactual and ecofactual material.
Unfortunately, the nature of the extant stratification and the physical configuration of the rockshelter itself
do not lend themselves to easy employment of many of these proxies. Specifically, in many areas, the
site deposits are very compressed; that is, relatively long time intervals are represented by only a few
centimeters of deposits. Also, in many areas, temporal diagnostics or directly dated features are scarce
or absent. Finally, the upper occupational horizons as well as several of the cultural features are either
disturbed by historic activities or are actually of Historic age (e.g., Feature I in Stratum III). All of these
factors often preclude the possibility of delineating discrete Late Prehistoric components let alone isolating
individual prehistoric visitation events.
Additionally, the minimal evidence for a discrete (i.e., unmixed) Toyah phase occupation and the
association of different point types within close stratigraphic proximity—primarily, the co-occurrence of
Scallorn and Cuney points in almost all levels where Scallorn points occur—make the separation of Austin
and Toyah or even later components virtually impossible in many areas of the site. Nonetheless, it is highly
likely that the majority of the recovered lithic artifact and ecofactual assemblages are associated with one
of several Late Prehistoric components. Furthermore, it is likely the most prolific Late Prehistoric materials
tend to be associated with Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric Cuney projectiles. Archaic materials do occur, but
are rare—both within and outside the dripline, as well as on the terrace located north of the site.
Despite the difficulty in segregating materials from each of the Late Prehistoric components at
Rockshelter A, based on the stratigraphic occurrence of temporally diagnostic projectile points, where
present, and the relative positioning of features and strata within and outside the rockshelter dripline, it is
possible to differentiate between levels associated with Late Prehistoric versus Archaic components, at least
in some areas. However, due to the co-occurrence of apparently Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostics in
some levels with little vertical separation, as well as conflicting diagnostics and reversed radiocarbon dates
in other areas, it remains clear that substantial portions of the site contain temporally mixed assemblages
188

of Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials. As with the individual Late Prehistoric components, it is often
the case that the Archaic components cannot always be successfully separated from Late Prehistoric
components. Of course, these problems are only compounded by later Historic Period disturbances.
All of these caveats notwithstanding, the following reconstruction of the site’s occupational history
details which strata, features, and levels may be confidently associated with each of the major temporal
periods, and those with which cultural and ecofactual materials are considered to be associated. All
materials from areas that cannot be attributed to a particular component for the reasons noted above are
considered to be of unknown age. This reconstruction in turn will be used to address potential differences in
site use, subsistence, seasonality, and related issues between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric, where such
determinations are possible.
In general, it appears that all materials in Stratum IV, from the modern ground surface to a depth of
at least 40 cm within the rockshelter are Late Prehistoric in age. Cuney points are the sole diagnostic point
types in the upper levels of Stratum IV inside the rockshelter, until they begin to co-occur with Scallorn
and Perdiz forms in the 25–30 cm level. This level produced one of the two Perdiz points from the site.
The other was recovered from Test Pit 3 during the TRC-MA testing. In units 24R19 and 25R19 (see
below), Stratum IX occurs as a substratum (see Chapter 4, Stratigraphy). Because of the co-occurrence
of Late Prehistoric and Archaic projectile point fragments in the 10–15 cm and 15–20 cm levels of this
substratum, the correspondingly deeper levels of Stratum IV (i.e., 40–50 cm) elsewhere on the site also
have the potential to contain artifacts and ecofacts of mixed ages. Cultural materials within these levels,
as they exist inside the dripline, are considered to be of unknown age. Thus, these materials are not cited
in any discussion of Archaic to Late Prehistoric transformation. On the talus slope outside the dripline,
deposits are thicker. Late Prehistoric materials are present in Stratum IV to the 60–65 cm level. The 65–70
cm level of Stratum IV outside the dripline marks the appearance of both Middle and Transitional Archaic
diagnostics, as evidenced by the recovery of a Pedernales and Darl point. Another Darl point was recovered
from the 7–75 cm level of Stratum IV.
A rockfall episode or pavement, ca. 25–30 cm within Stratum IV, which has been labeled as a
substratum of that depositional unit (see Chapter 4, Stratigraphy), produced a single non-diagnostic arrow
point fragment, presumably of Late Prehistoric ascription. Stratum VII, discontinuously confined to inside
the dripline, also produced a non-diagnostic arrow point and point preform that are, again, likely Late
Prehistoric in age.
Stratum IX is a substratum within Stratum IV inside the dripline. This depositional subunit yielded
10 Late Prehistoric arrow points and two Archaic points. Stratum IX, 0–5 cm, contained eight Cuney points
and one specimen that resembles a hybrid or cross between a Cuney and an Alba. Stratum IX, 5–10 cm,
produced one Scallorn point, an apparent Late Prehistoric arrow point fragment, and an apparent dart point
fragment, indicating that multiple components are intermixed in this level. Stratum IX, 15–20 cm, yielded
one transitional Archaic Darl point, suggesting that Darl points overlap with some Late Prehistoric forms
to some unspecified degree. Alternatively, it may signify that this portion of the site was continuously and
repetitively visited from Archaic through Late Prehistoric times with extensive anthropogenic turbation.
A radiocarbon determination of cal AD 742–894 from Stratum IX, 15–20 cm, could support either
interpretation. Because of the presence of diagnostics of different ages, the cultural materials from Stratum
IX, 10–15 cm, and below cannot be conclusively assigned to a time period.
Feature VI, identified inside the dripline in unit 25R16 within Stratum V, produced one Darl point
from the 0–5 cm level. This placement broadly corresponds to the 15–25 cm level within Stratum V. The
Darl point suggests a Transitional Archaic or slightly more recent age. However, multiple contradictory
radiocarbon ages with several dramatic reversals (see Chapter 4, Radiocarbon Chronology) suggest that this
feature is heavily disturbed and contains materials of mixed temporal ascription. It may be that the upper
levels of Stratum V and Feature VI contain Late Prehistoric materials while the lower levels may date to
189

the Transitional Archaic. However, the level at which the transition from Archaic to Late Prehistoric occurs
is unknown.
The majority of Feature III is associated with Stratum IV and Stratum IX inside the dripline. Given the
Late Prehistoric date of cal AD 742–894 from Stratum IX, this feature is probably Late Prehistoric in age.
Despite an absence of temporally diagnostic projectile points, the stratigraphic position of Strata III,
VI, and VIII and Features II, IV, and V suggest a Late Prehistoric ascription. As noted above, Feature I
in Stratum III is heavily turbated and contains both Late Prehistoric and Historic materials. Finally, basal
Stratum I and Stratum II are of unknown age.
In sum, however gauged or assessed, it appears that the Late Prehistoric component of Rockshelter
A is, by far, the heaviest or most intense. Whether measured in number of visits, length of visitation, or
visitors per event as reflected by any combination of proxies, it appears clear that the intensity of Archaic
occupation(s) is much lighter and more ephemeral than the Late Prehistoric.
Within the Late Prehistoric, it appears that the most intensive use of the site occurs during the Toyah
phase (AD 1200–1500) or, possibly, even later in the Protohistoric. The Austin phase (AD 700–1200)
utilization/occupation of the site is somewhat less intensive. Finally, the later Historic period use of the
rockshelter is as ephemeral as the earlier Archaic moment(s).
In spatial terms, some of the same proxies noted above may be employed to assess differential site use
patterns in time. However, the physical configuration of the rockshelter has a powerful constraining effect
on the horizontal distribution of cultural materials. The relatively low ceilings on the grid east and grid west
portions of the site coupled with the low headroom near the back (or grid south) wall minimize the potential
for extensive use of underlying surfaces throughout the occupational sequence. Similarly, the center of the
site’s high ceiling at the dripline accounts for the fact that the majority of the artifacts, ecofacts, and cultural
features occur in this area through virtually the entire site-use trajectory.

Subsistence and Seasonality
J. M. Campbell and J. M. Adovasio
In the present context, subsistence refers to the foods transported to, processed upon, and consumed
within the broader confines of Rockshelter A by its aboriginal and later historic visitors. Seasonality denotes
the time or times of the year when these visitation events occurred. Direct as well as indirect data exists
to address these issues. The direct data base includes vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains, a variety
of macrobotanical materials, and the associated artifact assemblage. Indirect indications of subsistence
and seasonality issues are also available from modern plant and animal surveys, associated behavioral
experiments (Appendix D), and contemporary and prehistoric climate assessments. All of these lines of
evidence may reflect, to varying degrees, the ecological circumstances which obtained at the site during
some or all of its aboriginal utilization.
Though clearly limited in terms of identifiable elements and the range of species represented, the
highly fragmentary faunal assemblage does appear to represent anthropogenic deposition. Minimally,
it also indicates the exploitation of Cervidae (probably Odocoileus sp.) and one or another of the local
representatives of Leporidae (rabbits). Both deer and rabbits occur in the study area at present and, with
obvious fluctuations in population size, were probably represented throughout the Holocene. Unfortunately,
due to the fragmentary character of the vertebrate faunal assemblage, the scarcity of identifiable elements
attributable to either Cervidae or Leporidae, and only very limited data available from the analysis of
organic residues on lthic artifacts (Appendix E), it is impossible to quantify the extent or degree of their
exploitation. It is also impossible to quantify the relative contributions of either species to the diet.
While the relative abundance of arrow heads and, to much lesser extent, dart points directly suggests
large vertebrate procurement by bow and arrow or atlatl-launched projectiles, the procurement strategy
for rabbits is not directly indicated. However, given the deep antiquity and overall efficiency of terrestrial
190

net and snare hunting in western North America (cf. Adovasio et al. 2009), it is not unlikely that rabbits
may have been secured in this fashion. However procured, the extant evidence does suggest the on-site
preparation and consumption of rabbits.
While the exploitation of various vertebrate taxa is well documented in the archaeological record
of Texas, information on the utilization of invertebrates is far less complete. As Chapter 8 indicates, both
the initial TRC-MA test excavations and the later MAI investigations yielded large numbers of land snail
shells and a smaller but still significant assemblage of unionid (mussel) shells. The unionid remains include
multiple species, none of which are found in habitats in immediate proximity (within 4 km) of Rockshelter
A. The presence of mussel shells remote from likely locations where those animals could have lived (i.e.,
Cowhouse Creek and the Leon River) can only be attributed to human transport.
The recovery of several Louisiana fatmucket mussel (Lampsilis hydiana) specimens from Rockshelter
A is noteworthy in this regard (see Table 8.5). This taxon was apparently a prehistoric inhabitant of Cowhouse
Creek, and as that creek is ca. 20 km from the rockshelter, the presence of Louisiana fatmucket at the site
appears to be attributable to long-distance transport. Most of the recovered mussel shells (threeridge mussel
[Amblema plicata], fragile papershell mussel [Leptodea fragilis], yellow sandshell mussel [Lampsilis teres],
and pistolgrip mussel [Tritogonia verrucosa]) are species that were likely to have been obtainable from the
Leon River (4–5 km away). If any of the identified unionids were brought to the site as food sources, the
capability for live transport should be presumed. Given the documented production of watertight coiled
baskets and the availability of damp mosses, such transport is more than technologically feasible.
The prehistoric and historic use of mussels by humans in Texas has been extensively reviewed by
Neck (1982) and Howells et al. (1996). Not surprisingly, these data suggest that Native Americans used
mussels as food and, secondarily, as ornaments and tools (Neck 1982). As caches of mussel shells have been
recovered at many prehistoric sites on Fort Hood, and in some cases, interpreted as remnants of subsistence
feeding (e.g., Abbot and Treirweller 1995), it is certainly not impossible nor even unlikely that many of the
mussel shells from Rockshelter A represent food debris. However, a quantitative analysis of mussel shells
collected from 12 prehistoric sites in western Fort Hood (Kleinbach et al. 1999) found six (3.1 percent)
culturally modified shells out of a total of 194 specimens collected. Half of the modified specimens had been
perforated, and all were fragmentary and judged to “represent pieces of ornaments or waste by-products
from the manufacture of ornaments or tools” (Kleinbach et al. 1999:354). Culturally modified mussel shells
numbered seven (<0.3 percent) among the total of 2,540 mussel specimens collected by Mehalchick et al
(1999) from 15 prehistoric sites on Fort Hood. At least two modified shells were recovered from Test Pit
3 in the course of the TRC-MA testing and another 11 modified specimens were collected during the MAI
excavations. All of this suggests the possibility that at least some of the mussel shells found at Rockshelter
A were brought to the site for reasons other than food acquisition. Conversely, the modified shell may have
been fashioned after consumption of the contents on-site.
If the motivation for the transport of mussels to the site remains conjectural, the presence of large
numbers of terrestrial snails, notably two species of Rabdotus, is even more problematic. This issue is further
complicated by the fact that some species of land snails, including Rabdotus sp., have been characterized as
being attracted to sites of prehistoric human adaptation, notably rockshelters (Carlson et al. 1993a, 1993b).
The archaeological significance of snails in Central Texas in regard to their potential role(s) in human
subsistence patterns has been reviewed by Baker (1993). Unfortunately, land snails (Rabdotus sp.) remain
enigmatic entities in Central Texas archaeology due to limited knowledge about feeding behavior, habitat
preferences, ecology, and documented use as food sources (Dial 2006; Malof 2007; Prewitt and Associates
2006). To partially fill the lacunae in the Rabdotus sp. record, MAI initiated a series of habitat surveys
(see Chapter 1, Molluscan Fauna) and behavioral experiments (see Appendix D). Although the behavioral
experiments confirmed the possibility of Rabdotus sp. entering rockshelters without human assistance,

191

other facts lead us to suggest that most of the specimens of this taxon recovered from Rockshelter A resulted
from subsistence activity by the site’s prehistoric inhabitants.
The most compelling evidence supporting the claim that the Rabdotus specimens recovered from
Rockshelter A were gathered for subsistence is the disproportionate representation of adult-sized prairie
rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus) in the site assemblage (see Table 8.4). Corroborating evidence is provided
by Randolf’s (1973) study of land snail population ecology in Central Texas which, in documenting the
age (size) structure of a naturally occurring population of prairie rabdotus, found that juvenile- and prejuvenile-sized snails outnumbered adult-sized snails. This population structure was consistent with the high
fecundity of Rabdotus (23 eggs/clutch) previously determined by Webb (1967 [cited by Randolf 1973]).
Thus, our finding of predominantly adult-sized prairie rabdotus at Rockshelter A is clearly in alignment
with expectations based upon optimal foraging concepts applied to food acquisition strategies by prehistoric
hunter-gatherers.
Randolf (1973) also conducted field experiments at the boundary between grassy versus wooded
areas, and demonstrated that when light, temperature, and moisture were kept constant across the habitat
gradient, larger-sized prairie rabdotus chose the “grass end” over the “woods end” of experimental cages.
This result is consistent with observations of Mercyhurst biologists (see Appendix D), who found colonies
of prairie rabdotus solely in open grasslands at Fort Hood, despite equal searching effort in both wooded and
grassland habitats. Horne (1973) reported that prairie rabdotus in Central Texas are active in the spring and
fall, and enter into often prolonged periods of estivation during the summer, which suggests that prehistoric
visitors to Rockshelter A would have been afforded the potential to gather these creatures during most of
the year, from spring through fall.
Despite an apparently unresolved debate (Hester and Hill [1975] versus Clark [1976]) on the accuracy
of translations of Spanish ethnographic accounts regarding the use of land snails for food by the Mariame
people of Texas (ca. 1529), there exists unquestionable ethnographic evidence of prehistoric people eating
snails world-wide (e.g., Mayans of Central America [Healy et al. 1990], ancient inhabitants of the CircumMediterranean [Lubell 2004], and North American peoples generally [Clark 1969]). We see no reason why
Texas’s prehistoric peoples would have behaved any differently from people in other parts of the world
when presented with an easily obtained source of nutrition. The apparent shift in subsistence utilization
of mollusk- to plant-based food at Rockshelter A during the time period that Stratum IV was deposited
suggests the possibility that the snail-eating cultural component of Stratum IX and early Stratum IV may
have phased out by the time the Spaniards entered Texas, rendering moot the above-referenced debate
(i.e., Hester and Hill [1975] versus Clark [1976]) concerning snails in Cabeza de Vaca’s sixteenth century
ethnographic account.
We find convincing evidence supporting the prehistoric gathering of rabdotus for food at Rockshelter
A in both the size-distribution of the recovered prairie rabdotus and the persistence of woodland-specialist
snail species throughout the site’s stratigraphic profile. Experiments have shown that rabdotus cooked in
water for a few minutes extrude from the shell aperture and can be easily extracted; furthermore, the shells
of boiled specimens show little or no sign of discoloration (Hester and Hill 1975). Absent ceramic vessels
for boiling snails, Edward Jelks suggested that the prehistoric inhabitants of Central Texas cooked snails “in
nests of damp leaves placed over hot stones” (Clark 1969:43 [citing Jelks 1962]).
The relative amounts of identifiable land snail and mussel shell material recovered from Rockshelter A
by MAI indicates that land snails (Rabdotus mooreanus [n=4,543]) were more important in the subsistence
diet of prehistoric visitors than mussels (n=70 for all species combined). A recently published analysis
of Late Archaic hunter-gatherer resource acquisition and use at sites in the lower Bosque River basin of
Texas (Kibler and Mehalchick 2010) found evidence of utilization of the same freshwater mussels species
that we recovered at Rockshelter A, estimating that about 200 mussels would be necessary to satisfy the
daily calorie requirements for a single person. This fact, in combination with the low number of specimens
192

recovered from Rockshelter A, suggests that freshwater mussels did not play a significant dietary role
for the site’s prehistoric visitors, especially considering the distance the mussels would had to have been
transported (minimally, 4–5 km from the Leon River). On the other hand, open, lowland sites serving as
potentially suitable habitats for land snails would have been available within 100–200 m of the site, at the
eastern base of the mesa-like feature where it is situated. Assuming that colonies of land snails inhabited
this location in the past, very little time or effort would have been necessary to obtain snails for sustenance
at the rockshelter.
Analysis of over 3,000 macrobotanical items recovered from Rockshelter A, coupled with modern
botanical studies conducted at Fort Hood by MAI, offers some new insights into subsistence use of plant
foods by prehistoric inhabitants. It should first be noted that despite the current dominance of juniper
(Juniperis ashei) in all habitats near the rockshelter, significant remnants of the pre-Euroamerican vegetation
are still present. The diverse ground cover (including grass) communities detected in more open loci, and
species-rich shrub and tree associations, especially on the north-facing slope containing Rockshelter A,
probably provided a rich variety of plant resources to prehistoric hunter-gatherers. The abundant oaks in the
area (see Table 1.4) would have been a year-round source of fuel and seasonally available acorns. Geophytes
with persistent aboveground leaves (e.g., devil’s shoestring [Nolina lindheimeriena] and twistleaf yucca
[Yucca pallida]) also could have provided a potential food source year-round. Other geophytes such as
meadow garlic (Allium canadense var. canadense), tenpetal thimbleweed (Anemone berlandieri), evening
rainlily (Cooperia drummondii), and cusp blazing star (Liatris mucronata), would have been available on
a seasonal basis and signaled by flowering. Fruits of vines (e.g., grape [Vitis sp.]) and shrubs would also
have been available seasonally. At least one plant currently observed growing near the rockshelter, Texas
mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), may have been exploited for ritual or medicinal purposes.
The actual macrobotanical assemblage from Rockshelter A includes carbonized oak (Quercus sp.),
juniper (Juniperis sp.), and ash (Fraxinus sp.) wood, all presumably used as fire fuel, as well as numerous
whole and fragmentary seeds of sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), juniper (Juniperus sp.), oak (Quercus sp.),
and grape (Vitis sp.), which probably represent potential food sources (see Chapter 9). If only carbonized or
thermally altered seed and nuts are considered as indicative of human utilization, then only grape (Vitis sp.)
may be removed from the list of possible plant food resources.
Interestingly, hackberry (Celtis sp.) was not initially reported from the TRC-MA sub-assemblage
though it is the most common potential plant food source found in the MAI sub-assemblage (which may
be a result of excavation methodology). Hackberry of several species has been recovered from many
archaeological sites in both western (e.g., Danger and Hogup Caves) and eastern (e.g., Meadowcroft
Rockshelter) North America, and is well documented as a vegetal food resource ethnographically.
Moerman (1998) has documented how various tribes of the Southwestern United States utilized
hackberry by crushing or grinding the fruits. Most of the processing methods included mechanical reduction
of the berries to a pulp that was subsequently mixed with other ingredients (e.g., fat) for roasting on a stick
over an open fire. Benfer (2013 [citing Moerman 1998]) gives a detailed account:
The Yavapai, Acoma, Laguna, Papago, Navajo, Hualapai, Pueblo, Tewa, Keres, and Omaha are all known
to have eaten dried or fresh hackberries with some frequency. The Kiowa pounded hackberries into a
paste that they molded onto a stick and baked over an open fire. Similarly, the Comanche were known to
beat sugarberry fruits to a pulp, mix this pulp with fat, roll the mixture into balls and roast them over a
fire. The Apache, Chiricahua, and Mescalero not only ate hackberries fresh, but also made them into jelly
and dried cakes. The Dakota used dried hackberry fruits to make a powdered condiment used to season
meat. The Meskwaki made porridge out of ground berries. The Pawnee made a food by finely pounding
hackberries into a powder that they mixed with fat and parched corn. [Benfer 2013]

The recovery of disproportionately high numbers of oak acorns, hackberry seeds, and juniper seeds
inside the dripline of Rockshelter A indicates that the site was a center for seasonal utilization of locally
available nuts and fruits. Considering the fact that juniper berries may be retained by their parent trees for
193

many weeks during and after ripening, and that all of these fruits could likely remain viable as food sources
following storage for several months, suggests the possibility that the rockshelter area could have offered
subsistence food resources beyond the seasons in which these plants produced their fruits. It would seem
reasonable that dry areas within the rockshelter might have been useful for intentional short-term storage of
these foodstuffs that were not consumed immediately after they were gathered.
Given the fragmentary nature of the vertebrate faunal assemblage, it is not possible to identify or trace
any trends or shifts in the procurement patterns of any of the represented species through time. There are,
however, several clear shifts in the incidence of invertebrate fauna which may reflect climate change with
attendant species selectivity adjustments. In both the TRC-MA test pit and the MAI excavation samples,
for example, there is more variety in the mussel assemblage in the deeper or older levels. Specifically,
fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis) and yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres) were the main mussel species
recovered from the deeper excavation units. These taxa are considered drought intolerant and their presence
could signal that these specimens were brought into the rockshelter during a climate interval that was
wetter than subsequent periods. Conversely, threeridge mussel (Amblema plicata) is the dominant unionid
species recovered from the upper-most levels of the site. As noted in Chapter 7, Unmodified Invertebrate
Faunal Remains, threeridge mussel is a drought tolerant species that was apparently abundant in both the
Leon River and Cowhouse Creek during prehistoric times (Table 10.1). This taxon is tolerant of poor water
quality and is able to “dig in during droughts and endure dewatering” (Howells et al. 1996:34).
These findings may corroborate a climatically conditioned or induced transition from the procurement
of drought intolerant to drought tolerant mussel species. This is consistent with regional climate change
scenario posited for the last thousand years (Blum et al. 1994; Watters and Nordt 1995) and which is
discussed elsewhere in this volume (see Environmental Background). The general decline of mussel species
in the very latest levels of the site may signal a more general decline in freshwater mussel populations

Single live specimen observed at a site on Owl Creek near the eastern boundary of the fort.
Aquatic species.

related to increased drought severity and/or degradation of substrate conditions in local streams during the
latest Toyah phase or early Historic period.
There are also potentially significant shifts in the stratigraphic incidence and frequency of taxa of
land snails represented at Rockshelter A, evident in selected excavation units shown in Figure 8.4. Though
Rabdotus sp. is overall the dominant genus of land snail recovered from the site, there is a temporal difference
in the representation of the two principal species, prairie rabdotus and whitewashed rabdotus (Rabdotus
dealbatus dealbatus). According to Fullington and Pratt (1974), prairie rabdotus and whitewashed rabdotus
prefer open prairie and wooded habitats, respectively. This distinction in habitat preferences was confirmed
during the MAI biological surveys at Fort Hood (Table 10.2).
Based on habitat preference, it may be inferred that the occurrence of both species in more or less
equal numbers in the same excavation levels may indicate that vegetation in the vicinity of the rockshelter
included a mixture of woodland and grasslands. Similarly, a higher proportion of whitewashed rabdotus to
prairie rabdotus may indicate more forested conditions while the reverse suggests a shift toward grasslands
either due to increasing aridity or fire-frequency induced changes. At Rockshelter A, both species cooccur in levels ascribed to the beginning and end of the Late Prehistoric, with whitewashed rabdotus more
common earlier. The absence of both species in the later Historic period probably reflects changes in land
use, intense overgrazing, and fire suppression with attendant vegetational changes (Freeman et al. 2001;
Hayward et al. 1992 [cited in Diggs et al. 1999]).
The increasing prominence of the arboreal land snail (Oligyra orbiculata)—presently the area’s
dominant snail—in the site’s upper levels perhaps indicate that a shift in vegetation involving an increased
abundance of cedar (Juniperis ashei) may have already been underway near the end of the Late Prehistoric
195

period. A decline of prairie grasslands and an increase in cedar woodlands in the vicinity of Rockshelter
A would have contributed to a local decline of prairie rabdotus after the end of the Toyah phase, setting
the stage for the increase in whitewashed rabdotus during the Historic period. A similar shift in Rabdotus
species composition concurrent with a change from grassland to woodland habitat was noted at 41CV111
in eastern Fort Hood (Carlson et al. 1997).
While various data sets discussed above may help illuminate subsistence behavior at Rockshelter A,
they are, generally, of more limited value in assessing seasonality of site use. The two identified potential
vertebrate food sources, deer and rabbits, are essentially available year round, though at least deer are more
common in the fall. The edible plant species suggest, if not directly indicate, a fall-focused scheduling cycle
while the invertebrate mussel and land snail species represented are not seasonally indicative—with one
significant exception. Specifically, unionids could be collected at any time when the Leon River, Cowhouse
Creek, or their tributaries were active. Further, the drought-tolerant species could even be acquired during
periods of ephemeral or even no stream flow.
The acquisition of prairie rabdotus, however, may be seasonally dependent if it is, indeed, an
exploited food source. As noted above, the only large concentrations of this species observed during the
MAI investigations occurred in the late spring and early summer. If this aggregation pattern obtained in
the past, this, in turn, suggests that this time frame may have influenced the seasonal scheduling of site
visits. However, as discussed more fully below (see General Character of Site Utilization), if the primary
function of the site is not geared toward food procurement and is, instead, related to other issues such
as lithic procurement and processing, then the season(s) of site visitation may not directly relate to food
procurement strategies at all.

General Character of Site Utilization
There are several complimentary criteria whereby the functional character of site utilization at
Rockshelter A may be evaluated. These include the number, kind, and distribution of anthropogenic
modifications at the site; the density and distribution of cultural and ecofactual materials; the geographic
and geomorphological setting of the site; and the nature of the extant artifact inventory–both in time and
through time. One of the most revealing of these indices is the relatively large durable artifact assemblage
which includes in excess of 31,000 specimens. Comparative examination of this assemblage, which dates
from Early/Middle Archaic through Protohistoric/Historic times, reveals a number of interesting features
and trends. These, in turn and in concert with other data sets, inform about the possible functions of
Rockshelter A in and through time. Using the combination of stratigraphic placement and radiocarbon
assays provided above in Chronology, it is possible to ascribe substantial segments of the flaked stone
tool assemblage into temporal periods. Based on these ascriptions, it is, then, possible to identify and
characterize transformations and continuities in the production, use, refurbishment, and discard of lithic
artifacts at Rockshelter A.
Of the 63 cores identified at the rockshelter, 36 appear to be associated with the site’s Late Prehistoric
components and 13 are associated with the Archaic period. The remaining 14 cores are from contexts
whose ages are either entirely unknown or of mixed age, and will not be discussed further. Twenty one
(58.3 percent) of the Late Prehistoric cores were produced using a multidirectional technique, while 7 (19.4
percent) were classified as bifacial. The remaining 8 Late Prehistoric cores (22.2 percent) were reduced
only minimally and their reduction strategy could therefore not be determined. Of the 13 Archaic cores,
9 (69.2 percent) were classified as multidirectional cores, compared to only 2 (15.4 percent) that were
produced bifacially. Two additional cores (15.4 percent) were of an indeterminate, minimally worked type.
The sheer numbers of different core types associated with the Late Prehistoric versus Archaic deposits
is not particularly informative, as the artifact counts in general are skewed by the varying degrees to
which these deposits were excavated. However, if the materials uncovered in the excavated areas are at all
representative of what exists in the unexcavated areas, it would appear that there is very little difference
196

in core technologies employed during the Late Prehistoric and Archaic components. Multidirectional
technology is dominant among both Archaic and Late Prehistoric cores; however, it appears multidirectional
cores form nearly 11 percent more of the Archaic core inventory than the Late Prehistoric core inventory.
By contrast, 4 percent more Late Prehistoric cores were formed by bifacial means. Arguably, however,
such a marginal difference in the appearance of particular core types between these two time periods may
be more apparent than actual. Given the particularly small sample of Archaic cores from Rockshelter A,
the extent to which the recovered sample mirrors the true technological preferences of the occupants of the
site during the Archaic period is unknown. However, if the sample is representative of the technology on
a broader scale, then it appears that multidirectional cores were used to a somewhat greater extent during
the Archaic period, while bifacial cores were produced more frequently during the Late Prehistoric, albeit
very negligibly. If these discrepancies do actually reflect shifts in technological preference, the overall
similarities in core usage suggest that any temporal changes in core use are slight.
While bifaces were clearly an important component of the prehistoric toolkit throughout the
rockshelter’s occupation, the different stages of production of the recovered bifaces were examined to
identify any differences or similarities in site use through time (see Table 5.3). Bifaces recovered from
levels believed to be associated with the Late Prehistoric period (n=59) were classified as follows: Early
(n=13 [22 percent]), early/middle (n=11 [18.6 percent]), middle (n=9 [15.3 percent]), middle/late (n=11
[18.6 percent]), late (n=13 [22 percent]), and unknown (n=2 [3.4 percent]). Archaic bifaces (n=14) were
broken down as follows: early (n=5 [35.7 percent]), early/middle (n=1 [7.1 percent]), middle (n=2 [14.3
percent]), middle/late (n=3 [21.4 percent]), and late (n=3 [21.4 percent]). Sixteen additional bifaces and
biface fragments are from levels that likely contain temporally mixed cultural materials. These bifaces are
excluded from this comparison. The breakdown of Late Prehistoric bifaces produces an inverted bell curve,
with the greatest components of the biface inventory classified as “early” and “late” stage, with slightly
fewer numbers comprising “early/middle” and “middle/late” stage categories. The “middle” stage class has
the fewest members (Figure 10.1). By contrast, among Archaic-age bifaces, the earliest stage classification
contains the greatest ­­­­­number of bifaces, followed by a dramatic drop in the early/middle stage category, and
then a sizable increase in middle bifaces. Middle/late and late stage bifaces are represented equally, and are
each comprised of the second-greatest number of bifaces.
Overall, it appears that Archaic bifaces are strongly skewed toward the earliest production stage. It is
in this stage grouping that the greatest difference between Late Prehistoric and Archaic bifaces exists, with
13.7 percent more Archaic bifaces belonging to this category than Late Prehistoric bifaces. Conversely, the
early/middle stage class is much more highly represented (by 11.5 percent) among Late Prehistoric bifaces.
Interestingly, differences in stage of production are far less significant toward the middle and late end of the
production continuum, where the discrepancies between Archaic and Late Prehistoric stage classifications
differ minimally, by between 0.6 percent and 2.8 percent.
In order to more clearly elucidate the similarities and differences between the Late Prehistoric and
Archaic bifaces, this comparison was conducted again, this time combining all early and early/middle
into a single “early stage” category, and all middle and middle/late stage bifaces into a single “middle
stage” category. This reduced the number of stage subcategories to three: (1) the earliest stage forms, (2)
completely or nearly completed products, and (3) middle stage forms. When viewed in this manner (Figure
10.2) any significant differences in stage of production between Archaic and Late Prehistoric bifaces
become obscured. Here, one sees that each category is comprised of nearly identical percentages of bifaces
from each time period, with a maximum difference of 2.4 percent.
In general, the division of bifaces into approximate production stage demonstrates that all stages of
production were carried out during both the Late Prehistoric and Archaic periods. No matter how the biface
inventories are viewed (with more refined or more condensed stage groupings), there are typically greater
numbers of bifaces toward the extreme ends of the production spectrum, with fewer bifaces in the middle
197

stage class. While far greater percentages of Archaic
bifaces belong to the earliest stage classification,
this is offset by the much greater contribution of
Late Prehistoric bifaces to the early/middle stage
class. Therefore, when categories are combined,
the Archaic and Late Prehistoric are represented
much more equally, strongly suggesting continuity
in site use between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods.
A general assessment of debitage characteristics
are presented here, with the intention of illuminating
Figure 10.1. Biface production stages noted in the

and Late Prehistoric tool production that could not
be identified by viewing the tools themselves. Of
the 6,095 flakes and flake tools believed to be Late
Prehistoric in age, only 3,686 exhibited platforms
of any kind. Of these, 2,533 retained complete
platforms. Crushed platforms were observed on
887 flakes, and 266 exhibited incomplete platforms.
Platform preparation is extremely rare, occurring on
only 453 (12.3 percent) Late Prehistoric specimens.
Of these 453 flakes, 269 (59.4 percent) displayed
evidence of platform reducing (knocking of small
chips in order to stabilize the platform and/or bring

appearing on 180 (39.7 percent) of the specimens.
Four additional flakes (0.9 percent) exhibited battered platforms, which may have resulted from a less
delicate manner of platform reducing.
Of the 1,641 flakes, flake fragments, and flake tools that can be attributed to the Archaic period, 1,173
retain complete or partial platforms. Of these, 790 possess complete platforms, 317 have crushed platforms,
and 66 have incomplete, fractured platforms. Only 76 (6.5 percent) of the 1,173 complete or proximal
flake fragments exhibit evidence of platform preparation, which is nearly half of the frequency at which
platform preparation occurs in the Late Prehistoric debitage inventory. The most common form of platform
preparation is platform reduction, which was observed on 60 (78.9 percent) of the 76 prepared platforms,
while 16 (21 percent) additional specimens displayed ground platforms. It does appear that, in general,
preparation of platforms was conducted with significantly greater frequency during the Late Prehistoric
than during the Archaic; however, the practice was relatively uncommon throughout both time periods. The
manner of platform preparation is consistent, however, with platform reducing being the favored method,
followed by grinding. The degree to which these preparation techniques were utilized, however, differs.
In the Late Prehistoric components, platform grinding occurs 18.7 percent more often than it does
during the Archaic components, while the Archaic debitage has a 20.6 percent greater incidence of platform
reducing. While this may signify overall preferences in the manner of platform preparation specific to each
time period, it is also possible that the selection of one or another manner of platform preparation would
have been preferable at different stages of tool production stages, or during the production of a particular
tool type. For example, platform grinding may have been the favored method of platform preparation
during the final stages of biface thinning, whereas platform reducing may have been more common during
earlier stages where more material could afford to be lost. In this case, differences in platform preparation
198

between Late Prehistoric and Archaic debitage may be more indicative of specific knapping activities than
of temporal shifts in platform preparation. The actual degree to which these discrepancies represent either
temporal changes or simply assemblage composition is unknown.
While cortex can sometimes remain on late-stage items, and can, conversely, be absent from flakes
detached during earlier stages of production, cortex percentage can be a useful way of characterizing
production stages represented in the debitage inventory of a site when the entire body of flakes is examined
as a whole. In general, the amount of cortex retained on debitage will decrease as the tool being produced
becomes more refined. A total of 3,749 Late Prehistoric flakes were examined for cortex percentage; that
is, they were proximal or complete specimens and therefore were subjected to the extended analysis as
explained in Chapter 5. Of these, 187 (5 percent) retained cortex on 76–100 percent of their available surfaces,
most often indicating the initial decortication of chert nodules. As the decortication process continues and
less and less of the nodule or tool retains cortex, the resulting flakes likewise tend to have less cortex.
Representative of these phases of tool production, 140 flakes (3.7 percent) had cortex on approximately 51–
75 percent of their surfaces, 282 (7.5 percent) had 26–50 percent cortex, and 615 specimens (16.4 percent)
had 1–25 percent cortex. The vast majority of flakes (2,525 [67.4 percent]) lacked cortex entirely, most
likely representing the middle and late stages of tool production and maintenance, where the item being
manufactured is completely decorticated. It is unsurprising that flakes lacking cortex are most numerous.
Cortex only covers the exterior surface of a nodule, so comparatively few flakes will retain cortex versus
those removed after decortication is complete.
Approximate cortex percentage was recorded for 1,179 Archaic-age flakes and flake fragments. Large
amounts of cortex, covering an estimate of 76–100 percent of the dorsal surface, was observed on 110 (9.3
percent) of these specimens, while smaller amounts on 51–75 percent of the available surface area were
present on 64 (5.4 percent) of the flakes. These classes are typically comprised of flakes removed during
early decortications. One hundred-seventeen (9.9 percent) specimens retained cortex on an estimated 26–50
percent of their dorsal face, largely representing later steps in the tool production process. Two hundred
fifteen (18.2 percent) of them retained a small amount of cortex on 1–25 percent of their dorsal surfaces,
and cortex was entirely absent on 672 (57 percent) of these specimens.
If cortex is used as a rough measure of the extent of reduction of bifacial multidirectional, or other
items, it yet again appears that Late Prehistoric and Archaic activities at the site did not differ significantly. In
general, the number of flakes decline as cortex percentage increases (probably more a function of the limited
portion of a nodule, per unit weight, that bears cortex), although during the Archaic there are more flakes
exhibiting cortex in the 76–100 percent range than in the 51–75 percent range. Upon closer examination,
however, flakes lacking cortex comprise a 10.4 percent greater proportion of the Late Prehistoric debitage
inventory than of the Archaic debitage class. Conversely, the Archaic debitage has between 4.3 percent
and 1.7 percent greater components in all of the remaining cortex ranges, suggesting that there may be a
slightly greater incidence of middle/late stage tool production during the Late Prehistoric and a negligible,
but noteworthy, trend toward earlier stages of decortications and production during the Archaic. These data
are similar to those seen among bifaces, proper, from each of the components, where greater percentages of
Archaic bifaces belong to the earliest stage groupings, while middle and later stages are represented more
equally between both of the major time periods.
While the overwhelming majority of flake tools from both Late Prehistoric and Archaic-age
components are simple and unstandardized, five possible gravers and a single, potential spokeshave were
also recovered, suggesting limited incising/engraving and arrow shaft production, respectively. Two of the
gravers (FS 438.221 and FS 1032.54) were found in Late Prehistoric contexts, while two others (FS 601.53
and 1037.73) were from levels associated with the Archaic. The fifth graver is from a temporally unassigned
stratigraphic package. The spokeshave (FS 1075.8) is presumed to be Archaic. The more or less equal
distribution of these specialized flake tools among both major time periods suggests that the activities they
199

represent were conducted periodically throughout the occupational history of the rockshelter, as opposed to
being restricted to a single time period, which would likely signify specialized usage of the rockshelter at
some point in time. The flake tool assemblage is, essentially, similar for both time periods, again supporting
the overall continuity in technology between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods.
In terms of raw material utilization among projectile points, no apparent differences exist between
the various Late Prehistoric components. Among Late Prehistoric points whose material types could be
identified (n=22), Fort Hood Yellow clearly dominates, accounting for 20 (90.9 percent) of the points. All
but two Cuney points, and all of the limited Scallorn, Perdiz, and Alba points in the assemblage, were made
of this locally abundant material. A single (4.5 percent) Late Prehistoric Cuney point was made of Heiner
Lake Tan, and another one (4.5 percent) appears to have been made of Fort Hood Gray chert; although these
are the only Late Prehistoric points to have been made of materials other than Fort Hood Yellow, this is
likely a function of the greater number of Cuney points in the collection compared to other Late Prehistoric
point types. Given the substantially larger inventory of Cuney points in the collection, slightly greater
material diversity is to be expected. The two projectile points probably do not represent any significant
difference in raw material exploitation between the makers of Cuney and other Late Prehistoric point types.
Only four Archaic points were adequately unaltered as to enable raw material identification. Heiner
Lake Tan and Fort Hood Yellow chert types were used in the production of both unburned Darl points,
echoing the overall patterns of raw material use seen in the assemblage at large. The Transitional Archaic
Ensor point and the Late Archaic Pedernales point were made of Cowhouse Dark Gray chert. Interestingly,
these are the only two point types made of this material, and in fact they represent one-third of the total
number (n=6) of Cowhouse Dark Gray artifacts in the entire Rockshelter A assemblage. Although the
sample of Archaic period points is small, it does appear that this material type was used more often
during the Archaic period. This may represent somewhat greater intentional selection of the material for
projectile point manufacture or it may signify more frequent movement of people from the source area to
the Rockshelter A site during these times.
Of the bifaces, 59 specimens are believed to be Late Prehistoric based on their provenience, while 14
are thought to date to the Archaic (see Table 5.3). Sixteen additional bifaces derive from contexts whose
temporal affiliations are unknown. Withdrawing 18 bifaces whose raw material types could not be identified
from the calculation, it was determined that 37 (86 percent) of the 43 Late Prehistoric bifaces whose material
types could be identified were manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow chert, compared to a nearly identical
percentage (85.7 percent [n=12]) of Archaic bifaces made of this material. The use of Heiner Lake Tan chert
is also very similar, occurring in 7 percent (n=3) of all Late Prehistoric bifaces whose material types could
be determined, and appearing in 7.1 percent (n=1) of the bifaces associated with the Archaic. Fossiliferous
Pale Brown chert is seen in 1 Late Prehistoric biface (2.3 percent) and 1 Archaic biface (7.1 percent),
demonstrating that use of this material was uniformly rare but perhaps slightly more common during the
Archaic period. Heiner Late Translucent Brown (n=1 [2.3 percent]) and Cowhouse Brown Flecked (n=1
[2.3 percent]) are seen in the Late Prehistoric biface inventory but are absent among Archaic period bifaces.
Overall, the similarities in raw material use between the Late Prehistoric and Archaic periods are striking,
with nearly equal percentages of bifaces from each period being manufactured of Fort Hood Yellow and
Heiner Lake Tan cherts. Additional materials were used infrequently for bifaces regardless of time period.
However, the Late Prehistoric bifaces demonstrate slightly greater raw material diversity, as is evidenced by
the occurrence of 5 material types compared to only 3 types that are represented among the Archaic bifaces.
The overwhelming use of Fort Hood Yellow chert during both time periods indicates that the most locally
available materials were selected most frequently throughout the occupation of Rockshelter A.
Based on site size classifications presented in Roemer et al. (1985:87–101), artifact counts present at
Rockshelter A place the site within their “medium” sized site, which they often equate with residential camps.
Larger sites, as Roemer et al. (1985:vii) note, typically functioned as lithic procurement sites. These sites,
200

which were subject to repeated use, were frequently located near lithic outcrops and are often associated
with early-stage bifaces and high debitage counts, among other artifacts (Roemer et al. 1985:105–111), but
lack a significant increase in tool diversity over smaller sites. While the survey area to which Roemer et al.
(1985) were referring does not include Rockshelter A, characterizations of both medium-sized and large
sites both appear to fit the scenario at Rockshelter A. The rockshelter, replete with usable raw materials
and a wealth of early-stage debitage and bifaces, fits well with the Roemer et al. (1985:105–111) definition
of a lithic procurement site. Likewise, it lacks specialized tools that would be required to complete most
domestic tasks performed at a long-term habitation site, as they also anticipate of lithic procurement sites.
However, the abundance of flake tools, later-stage bifaces, and the presence of hearths at the site
clearly indicate that the site was not used exclusively as an area at which to acquire tool stone. Rather,
these latter characteristics more closely resemble their expectations of a residential camp—although, in
this case, Rockshelter A appears to have been used repeatedly for short-term residence rather than longterm habitation. Similar attempts at classifying sites based on their size and composition were presented in
Skinner et al. (1981), and Rockshelter A likewise resembles both lithic procurement sites and residential
camps based on their assessments, despite the fact that the site itself is located within a rockshelter (which
is defined as another discrete site type according to Skinner et al. 1981).
In a series of tests of covariance presented in Koch et al. (1989:33–35), the relative co-occurrence
versus negative correlations between various artifact types suggested that rockshelters may have been used
differently from sites in open areas. They found that rockshelters were more commonly associated with
products of later stages of lithic production, with late-stage bifaces and hammer stones varying together,
and bifacial tool forms covarying with finished projectile points. Interestingly, early and late stage bifaces
varied inversely, indicating that early and late stages of production were not carried out at the same site.
The results from the Rockshelter A assemblage in some ways strongly fit the models presented here, while
they differ in other ways.
While the covariance tests associated rockshelters with primarily late-stage production, Rockshelter
A clearly has an abundance of both tools and debitage representative of all stages of production. Likewise,
while early and late-stage bifaces rarely appeared together in the statistical tests, these items appear with
nearly equal frequency at Rockshelter A, despite a slight tendency for greater early-stage production during
the Archaic period than during the Late Prehistoric. It appears that more varied tool production activities
occurred at Rockshelter A than in the test sample examined by Koch et.al (1989:33–35). Curiously, despite
the high volumes of materials attributed to all tool production stages at Rockshelter A, flintknapping tools
such as hammer stones are absent from the assemblage; hammer stones were, however, found at the at the
associated open site 41CV115B when it was re-recorded in 1986 by Dureka and Strychalski (in Trierweiler
1994:A-731).
One particularly interesting point raised by Koch et al. (1989) is that rockshelters may have been used
as either hunting or plant gathering/processing loci, with these activities seldom occurring at the same site
and at the same time. This possibility was highlighted by the fact that mid-stage bifaces and arrow points
loaded positively, while ground stone loaded negatively. The near-absence of ground stone at the expense of
abundant debitage and tools at Rockshelter A as well as the size of the macrobotanical assemblage seem to
support this contention, which in turn, supports the interpretation that Rockshelter A was occupied by taskgroups of hunters and toolmakers but not by the full demographic suite of the population. Contrary to this
model is 41BL671, a large rockshelter that was excavated as part of a field school conducted by Texas A&M
University (Carlson 1993). The site, located on an unnamed tributary of Bull Branch, contained Terminal
Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. The artifact inventory from this site consists of hammer stones,
significant quantities of debitage, bifaces of all stages of refinement, cores, unifaces, projectile points,
and spokeshaves, all apparently geared toward intensive tool production and hunting/butchering activities,
while a significant presence of manos and metates point also toward the frequent processing of plant matter.

The lithic data summarized above directly suggests that the primary functions of Rockshelter A did
not change through time though the frequency/intensity/duration of visitation may have fluctuated (see
above). Specifically, it appears that the site served as a tool production workshop and short term residence
or campsite through the occupational sequence. The functional ascription based on durable artifact context
is supported by a general scarcity of cultural features, the absence of carefully prepared (i.e., lined or
rimmed) or reused features, and the relatively modest density of floral and faunal materials. In fact, the
extant ecofactual data base suggests sufficient hunting/foraging and attendant transport, preparation, and
consumption to serve only the immediate needs of the task groups who visited the site. Put another way,
there is no indication that the site was primarily a locus of food procurement and processing let alone a base
camp or central place occupied for long periods of time.

When viewed in the broader context of the Fort Hood archaeological landscape, Rockshelter A is, in
some ways, both ordinary and atypical. Based on the reports included in the United States Army Fort Hood
Archaeological Resource Management Series, this portion of the discussion provides a brief review of
previous findings on the Fort and a comparison between the inferences presented therein and those derived
from the analysis of the Rockshelter A materials. Initial inquiries into the prehistory of Fort Hood (Skinner
et al. 1981, 1984) have focused largely on identifying settlement shifts and deducing changes in prehistoric
population size. Discussion of the Paleoindian period was all but absent from those reports, given the scant
Paleoindian presence observed during survey, while evidence of a human presence was much more visible
in the Archaic. The Early and Middle Archaic, as discussed respective to the area north of Cowhouse Creek
(Skinner et al. 1984:8), saw the appearance of grinding implements, celts, and fishing gear, while population
increases led to a shrinking of territory size and a settlement pattern focused on local environments. This
conclusion was based on an increase in regionally specific projectile point types and a shift toward local raw
material exploitation in contrast to heavy use of exotics during the preceding Paleoindian period.
According to Skinner et al. (1984:8), population apparently increased into the Late and Transitional
Archaic periods, leading to an expansion of habitation sites into previously unoccupied areas and an increase
in large campsites located on major waterways. Task-specific sites are also more common during this time.
Cemeteries appear on the Gulf Coastal Plain with exotic materials, tools, and shell items often included
in the burials of high-status individuals. This social stratification suggests a chiefdom-level organization
and what Skinner et al. (1994:8) refer to as a “central-based wandering system” wherein group mobility
entails the following of a seasonal round, presumably in response to seasonal and geographic availability
of resources (Binford 1980:5–7; Kelly 1995:117–118). In this scenario, most of the food resources acquired
by a given group are obtained through the dispersal of task groups from a centrally located camp, to which
they later return. Increases in logistical mobility typically coincide with a decrease in residential mobility,
or frequency with which the central camp itself is relocated. Because the resources available nearest to the
basecamp are generally consumed first, the time and energy required in the food quest increases the longer a
basecamp is inhabited. Residential moves generally take place when the energy/time expenditure involved
for the logistical foragers to obtain and return with food becomes inefficient or counterproductive. The
basecamp is moved, and the process repeats.
The succeeding Late Prehistoric, or “Neoamerican” period, although formerly associated with trends
of increased sedentism, plant husbandry, and population growth, in more recent years has been viewed as
one of population decrease, with an increase in small sites, low assemblage diversity, minimal agriculture,
and the abandonment of tributaries for settlement placement (Skinner et al. 1984:9). During the Austin phase
(ca. AD 900), specifically, trade of ceramics is common between the Caddo of East Texas and populations
on the Fort, demonstrated by a wealth of pottery found along the Leon, Little, and Brazos Rivers (Perttula
et al. 2003:7; Skinner 1981:16). The appearance of obsidian at some sites also supports the extensive
202

trade networks at this time. Possibly due to a drying climatic trend, Skinner (1981) cites a reduction in site
size, with an increased use rockshelters at the expense of open-air sites in more marginal areas during this
phase. This increase in rockshelter use during the Late Prehistoric may, however, be partly a function of the
relatively young age of most rockshelters, as erosion and rockfall often destroy shelters that may contain
residues of chronologically older occupations as explained in Mehalchick, Kibler, Holmes, Ringstaff,
and Boyd (2003:190). Carlson et al. (1986:61) also note that rockshelters are more commonly associated
with Late Prehistoric components than they are with Archaic sites, which they tentatively attribute to
changing trends in seasonal mobility and settlement patterning during this period. While the increased use
of rockshelters has been noted for the period, the observation in Carlson et al. (1986:61) rightfully points
out that the increased visibility of rockshelter occupation during the Late Prehistoric may be a product
of differential site use, settlement patterns, or a number of other factors. Rockshelter A, containing both
Late Prehistoric and Archaic components, does not offer any insight into this matter; however, based on
chronological diagnostics and the stratigraphic distribution of ecofactual material, the Late Prehistoric does
appear to be more highly represented.
Perhaps the most archaeologically visible hallmark of Late Prehistoric period, however, is the advent
of the bow and arrow, and the replacement of dart points with arrow points, specifically of the Scallorn
type (Prewitt 1981; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985). According to Collins (1995:385), there
is little differentiation in the subsistence or technology of the Austin phase peoples and those in the Late/
Transitional Archaic, save for the adoption of this new hunting technology. He states that the Archaic–Late
Prehistoric boundary could just as accurately be drawn between the Austin and Toyah phases. The latter of
these occurs during a drying period (see Chapter 2), during which bison return to the area (Acuna 2006)
and putatively become a more significant contributor to diet of Late Prehistoric peoples. The abandonment
and return of bison to the Southern Plains is discussed at length in Dillehay (1974). The Perdiz point is
associated with these Toyah phase populations. However, there is no evidence of bison procurement at
Rockshelter A.
Based on observations made during a survey conducted by Skinner et al. (1981), the heaviest
prehistoric occupations were during the Middle and, to a lesser extent, Late Archaic, based strictly on the
number of components of each period that were identified during the survey. In an explicitly statistical
approach, Carlson et al. (1983:22) took into account the length of each time period and found, instead, that
there were more components associated with the Late/Transitional Archaic period than with the Middle
Archaic. The 1979 survey, to the north of Cowhouse Creek, also addressed site and/or population increases
of the Late/Transitional Archaic, as they identified twice as many components of this age than any other
time period. In the survey of western Fort Hood and the statistical re-examination of the previous surveys
discussed in Carlson et al. (1983), Austin and Toyah phase components are uniformly rare. The survey of
the Fort Hood’s Eastern Training Area detailed in Carlson et al. 1986 (41), on the other hand, reports that
components peak during the Middle Archaic, with relatively low densities during the Late and Terminal
Archaic and extreme scarcity during the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period. This
finding was also echoed in surveys of the Northwestern Perimeter and Southwestern Training Area at Fort
Hood (Koch et. al 1988:17, 48; Koch et al. 1989:23–24). Despite how human presence may have varied
through time in various regional and topographic settings, as the various surveys have demonstrated, it does
appear that Austin and Toyah phase components were uncommon irrespective of location by all accounts.
It should be noted, however, that what appears to be a somewhat higher proportion of Toyah-phase Perdiz
points was recovered during the testing of rockshelters along Spicewood Creek (Carlson et al. 1992:81).
Based on the chronological history outlined in the initial reports cited above, it appears that
Rockshelter A and its immediate environs stand out as somewhat unusual. While preliminary reports cite
an explosion of components dating to the Middle Archaic, this time period is not represented at Rockshelter
A. Consistent with the observations of Carlson et al. (1983), however, is the relative abundance of Late/
Transitional Archaic projectiles at the site, which, in the present case, are chiefly those of the Darl type. The
203

northern Cowhouse Creek survey (Skinner et al. 1984) also recovered a wealth of Late/Transitional Archaic
points. Interestingly, 41CV111 has components dating to the same time periods as Rockshelter A does,
albeit they are represented in most cases by altogether different diagnostics, including the Bulverde, Lange,
Castroville, and Fairland point types. Additionally, the site is estimated to contain nearly 800 Pedernales
points, based on the excavated sample (Carlson et al. 1997), while the Middle Archaic is, as mentioned,
not visible at Rockshelter A. Clearly, the examination of sites with components of different ages, as well
as inter-site comparisons between sites where the same temporal periods are embodied by morphologically
different diagnostics, would be strong contributors to future understanding of landscape use and cultural
relationships between groups at various points in prehistory.
The greatest difference between Rockshelter A and sites encountered during these early surveys is the
scale of the Late Prehistoric components. While Toyah phase materials (or, at least, points) are equally scarce
as they are elsewhere on the fort, Austin phase Scallorn points are plentiful; this suggests repeated and/or
more intensive use of the site during this time, a change in site use resulting in high rates of point discard,
or extensive projectile point manufacture. None of the previous reports lend significant attention to the
succeeding Protohistoric period, however, presumably suggesting that materials from this time period are
rare or absent across much of the fort. However, at Rockshelter A, there are more protohistoric Cuney points
than any other point type. These Cuney points strongly resemble those identified as a variety of Scallorn
points pictured in Mehalchick, Killilan, Caran, and Kibler (2003:118); however, they are consistently found,
stratigraphically above other Scallorn points at Rockshelter A and are thus believed to be a distinct Cuney
form, rather than a Scallorn variant. Unfortunately, because of the compressed stratigraphy at Rockshelter
A, the non-diagnostic artifacts from the Late Prehistoric cannot be differentiated as belonging to one or
another component, so specific characteristics of the site’s Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric occupations
cannot be deciphered. Despite this, the sheer volume of diagnostics from this period does suggest that other
rockshelters in the vicinity of Rockshelter A should be explored in hopes of finding more data to contribute
to the otherwise limited understanding of this time period (a problem noted in Collins 1995:373).
Carlson et al.(1986:56–58) attribute apparent temporal fluctuations in site density to some combination
of changing population size, shifting settlement patterns, differential discard of diagnostic tools based on
subsistence choices, and site visibility. That the reasons for such variation in observed site frequency through
time is the result of multiple, complex and, probably interrelated factors is almost certainly the case. A
problem that plagues archaeology in general, as well as research on Fort Hood in particular (including this
study), is that the identification of sites and/or components of particular time periods—and assumptions
regarding the intensity to which these sites were occupied—are often based on the presence and number
of diagnostic artifacts. Given the large numbers of chronologically mixed assemblages, surface surveys,
and sites on unstable land surfaces that are so frequently encountered during archaeological fieldwork as a
whole, it is little wonder that diagnostic projectile points serve as the primary temporal indicators, and that
the numbers with which they occur at a site be correlated to the intensity of site occupation.
The reality is that, as Carlson et al. (1986:55–58) note, projectile points are not uniformly discarded
at each site occupied by their manufacturers. As such, any notion that the frequency of diagnostics alone
can be uniformly attributed to population size and/or occupation intensity is probably a falsehood. Large
numbers of diagnostic points at a site can, in fact, be indicative of any number of possible scenarios: a
large occupying population, repeated use of a site, site function oriented toward the making of hunting
implements or the processing of game, a high incidence of failure in the point-making process, or simply,
taphonomic events. Unfortunately, in the absence of well-stratified, undisturbed sites, there is often no other
recourse than to estimate the size, activities, or entire settlement and mobility structures of a population
based on the projectile points they have left behind. This appears to be the case at Fort Hood in general,
and, admittedly, in the interpretation of Rockshelter A; that is, although protohistoric points are the most
numerous, while Middle Archaic and Toyah phase points are scant, this reality offers little contribution
204

to the understanding of these groups on a broader scale, given what is known about the stratigraphy and
taphonomy of the site.
Conversely, groups whose projectile points are represented minimally (or not at all) may have had a
strong presence at the site, but perhaps not a presence that resulted in the discard of projectile points. If the
site were frequently used as a place for raw material acquisition, as is presumed to be the case, there were
likely multiple visitors who engaged solely in the quarrying and early decortication of materials at the site
without ever producing or discarding a single point. How this problem may be resolved—save for the focus
on identifying and interpreting archaeological gisements as suggested by Collins (1995)—is unknown;
however, its effect on this and other sites should not go unmentioned.
It is also very important to note that mixed-age surface assemblages are often used as the samples by
which site type classifications were made. In light of this, it stands to reason that the archaeological residues
from these mixed settings are the result of hundreds or perhaps thousands of years of accumulation. As
such, endeavors to categorize sites so long in the making into a single site type relies on the assumption
that these sites were used in a consistent manner throughout their occupation, which may or may not be
the reality. Despite attempts to differentiate between Late Prehistoric and Archaic assemblages on a gross
level at Rockshelter A, the fact that repeated use has culminated in the creation of palimpsests rather than
discrete occupational levels at the site results in similar oversimplifications as are found in the Skinner’s
(1981:63–67) and Roemer et al.’s (1986:105–111) assessments of site type.
In sum, Rockshelter A exemplifies both the similarities between and diversity among other sites
currently known on Fort Hood. On one hand, it is unique in that it contains a strong representation of
protohistoric materials that are otherwise rare or absent from other sites, while the observed presence of
diagnostics dating to previous occupations is generally consistent with those found in most surveys and
subsurface tests conducted in the area. Rockshelter A interestingly lacks many of the artifact types commonly
found at other sites, however, which suggests (as noted above) that it is not primarily a habitation area. Nor
does it exclusively resemble sites defined as lithic procurement areas, although (again, as noted above)
this does appear to be its primary function. Instead, it appears to mainly be an area of short-term, repeated
occupations focused on the manufacture of tools from immediately available materials and the on-site
subsistence activities of small task groups. Activities geared primarily toward lithic procurement were likely
performed at the associated open site, while temporary shelter for eating, sleeping, and toolmaking was
sought at the rockshelter. In line with sites recorded elsewhere on the Fort, the apparently greater presence
of Late Prehistoric people versus Archaic people seems to fit the trend of increasing rockshelter use during
the Late Prehistoric (or, at least, the increased visibility of rockshelter use because of geomorphological
reasons). The paucity of grinding implements at Rockshelter A also seems to support the idea (Koch et al.
1989) that rockshelters were generally used for hunting /butchering or plant processing, but rarely served
as sites of both tasks at the same time.
The sheer number of sites on Fort Hood and the myriad site types, functions, and temporal and cultural
archaeological residues represented therein, speak to the complexity of the populations who inhabited the
region. Despite the difficulties inherent in trying to piece together such a varied prehistory, the trends in
human settlement patterns, site use, and technology that have been identified to date indicate that a clearer
understanding of this complexity is well on its way to becoming a reality. Rockshelter A exemplifies both
what is believed to be understood as well as what is yet unknown about Fort Hood’s rich prehistory.

Overview
Because of its occupational history and the material recovered from it, Rockshelter A can make a
significant contribution to what is currently understood about the area’s prehistory. The site may be
especially useful in terms of exploring settlement patterns and site use parameters during the protohistoric
period, as sites of this age are largely undocumented on the rest of the Fort. Unfortunately, because of the
compressed deposits within the rockshelter, the Protohistoric and other Late Prehistoric assemblages cannot
205

be untangled to the extent necessary to identify the specific characteristics of each. A similar situation
exists with the Late/Transitional Archaic period, whose representative Darl points within the rockshelter
were recovered from stratigraphic contexts that are extremely close to those of some of the site’s Late
Prehistoric points. This may represent the persistence of this point type into Late Prehistoric times; however,
the inability to differentiate between non-diagnostic items of Transitional Archaic versus Late Prehistoric
age in the rockshelter necessitated the disqualification of most Transitional Archaic materials from the
comparison of Late Prehistoric and Archaic assemblages provided in this report. This reduced the sample
of definitively Archaic materials to those recovered from outside the dripline of the rockshelter itself, while
at the same time restricting study of the Late Prehistoric periods to those components situated above the
questionable levels in which both Late Prehistoric and Archaic materials were found.
Despite the essentially rational chronostratigraphic placement of diagnostics at the site, taphonomy
has clearly had an impact on Rockshelter A. The west-east dispersal of refit pieces in the western portion of
the rockshelter suggests water flow into the rockshelter from the west, while refits distributed between units
located inside and outside the dripline appear to represent the flow of water and artifacts out of the shelter
and down the talus slope, where the refits then shift to a more north-south orientation as the water flows out
of the rockshelter and off of the dripline, carrying artifacts down the talus slope. Conversely, in many other
instances the refit and conjoined artifacts were recovered from apparently close contexts, suggesting that
the site was not disturbed uniformly, nor to any significant degree, which is supported by the context of the
recovered diagnostics. Because of the apparent slopewash that affected portions of the site, it is naturally
wise to exercise caution when interpreting the site and its contents on a small scale (another reason why
the isolation of discrete Late Prehistoric components within the rockshelter was not afforded); however, the
lack of severity of this post-depositional disturbance led to increased confidence in differentiating between
generalized Late Prehistoric and Archaic-age materials in other parts of the site.
Overall, as noted above, there appears to be strong continuity in technology and fundamental siteuse parameters between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Throughout the duration of the site’s
occupation, conservative durable artifact-related behaviors (e.g., core exhaustion, tool retouch, and the
salvaging and re-use of broken tools) are rare, probably in response to a raw material abundance that permitted
inhabiting groups to be selective in the raw material choice and, thus, did not require the maximization of
tool-production from a given nodule of material. Additionally, both multidirectional and bifacial reduction
strategies were employed during each of the major temporal periods represented at Rockshelter A, with
no significant preference for one or the other at any time. Despite oft-cited links between core technology
and degree of residential mobility, it seems that the frequency and breadth of group mobility had little
bearing on the technological choices of the site’s inhabitants, at least in the broad sense. Rather than being
mutually exclusive tool production strategies, versatile bifaces for the highly mobile, and cumbersome but
simple cores for the sedentary, both bifacial and multidirectional technologies appear to have been integral
components of the technological system.
The archaeological vestiges of both bifacial and multidirectional tool production strategies associated
with each occupation suggest these techniques were consistently used in conjunction with one another
throughout the use of the rockshelter. Most often, multidirectional cores were used to generate flakes for
ad hoc tool production, although it is also possible that flakes produced from multidirectional cores were
subsequently modified using a bifacial strategy. This later modification, however, would have obscured the
signature multidirectional flake scar patterns, thus rendering this hypothesis difficult to confirm. Bifacial
reduction was used for the manufacture of hunting-oriented and other bifacial implements, while the
presence of utilized biface thinning flakes at the site suggests that flake tools were also sometimes generated
incidental to the production of bifaces.
It should be reiterated that the site never served as a long-term habitation area at any point in its
history. While flake tool density is high, all but a small handful of these tools are simple tools that were
206

likely employed for a variety of on-site subsistence-oriented tasks, such as butchering. The few tools that
do appear to be task-specific, namely gravers and a single possible spokeshave, were distributed nearly
equally between both Late Prehistoric and Archaic components. Also, while the occasional non-subsistence
oriented task was conducted at the site at various times (as evidenced by the modified shell artifacts), such
activities comprised a minimal percentage of the overall activities performed over the course of the site’s
use. The paucity of specialized tools points to the site’s primary use as a very temporary camp, utilized by
small task groups in search of raw material and the food resources necessary to support their visit(s). During
these brief intervals, tools were fashioned, typically out of immediately available materials as discussed
below, and food—probably in quantities sufficient only to support the travelers on their excursions—was
processed.
In contrast to the site types defined during early archaeological surveys of Fort Hood, which
distinguish between campsites, rockshelters, lithic procurement areas, etc., it should also be noted that
this site obviously contains a number of characteristics of several of the previously defined site types. It
is doubtful that this is because Rockshelter A is somehow completely unique among sites on the Fort, but
rather because the supposed characteristics of the site types themselves are not as mutually exclusive as
they have been defined. The wealth of production debris, including that from initial decortication of chert
nodules, is consistent with the definition of a lithic procurement site, while the presence of hearths and a
sizeable quantity of tools are more typical of so-called campsites. As noted above, in all reality, Rockshelter
A likely served several but limited functions. The site is a camp, although not one that appears to have been
inhabited for long periods of time or by the entire suite of ages and genders of the population. Rockshelter
A is also clearly an area of lithic material procurement and tool manufacture, but that its proximity to tool
stone somehow precludes its ability to contain features or substantial numbers of flake tools (as is suggested
in earlier reports) is unlikely. Surely, groups stopping at the rockshelter would need fire, food, and shelter—
even if the stays were limited in duration. The general simplicity of the tools found at the site, however,
suggest that activities were largely restricted to those of subsistence and tool manufacture/maintenance,
while the rarity of tools specific to clothing manufacture and most other domestic tasks clearly indicate the
site’s occupation for relatively short periods. An absence of pottery at the site also supports this contention.
While deciphering the demographic composition of the site’s occupants is not a focus of this discussion,
it is possible (as noted above) that the occupying segment of the population may be composed entirely
or primarily of adult men, as many of the tasks that are not represented in the flake tool assemblage are
those often associated with young and/or female members of foraging and early horticultural societies.
This surmise would, of course, be obviated if the collection of prairie rabdotus and/or the netting/snaring
of rabbits were predominately individual female and/or female task group activities. Alternatively, the
presence of a variety of seed remains of edible species at Rockshelter A does attest to some seasonal plant
food collection and consumption on-site. However, such consumption apparently did not require extensive
use of grinding apparatus.
Of course, it is also possible that due to the tyranny of preservation, perishable artifacts directly
indicative of a female presence at the site were simply not recovered. This is a distinct possibility, particularly
given the relatively large numbers of edible plant remains as well as the presence of presumably collected
and transported unionids and land snails. Of course, it should also be noted that in dry caves and rockshelters
throughout Texas, perishable artifacts usually occur in profusion and often are actually more numerous than
durable materials (Andrews and Adovasio 1980).
When the bifaces and debitage from each of the two major time periods are examined, the overall
consistency in site use through time is clear–without regard to the gender composition of visiting groups.
The percentage of retained cortex on debitage and the degree of refinement of recovered biface fragments
demonstrates little difference in the specific types of knapping behaviors employed through time. There is
some suggestion (based on both biface and debitage data), however, that the Archaic occupants may have
207

done slightly more early-stage tool production at the site, while the subsequent stages of manufacture are
represented to a somewhat higher degree among Late Prehistoric debitage, specifically.
There is also a clear emphasis on the use of local raw material types throughout all occupations of
the rockshelter, which in many ways is not surprising. Given the proximity of the shelter to abundant and
relatively high-quality materials, the use of the site as a locus of material acquisition and tool manufacture
almost goes without saying. However, the comparatively light presence of materials located at greater
distances from North Fort Hood suggest that the area may have been sufficiently productive to warrant
extended stays in the greater area (if not at this particular site), with relatively limited movement to and
from the Heiner Lake and East Range areas. As people move, they continually manufacture, use, refurbish,
and discard items of their toolkit, causing a need to replenish those discarded tools with new ones made of
lithic materials encountered along the way. If the occupants of Rockshelter A returned to the rockshelter
after more far-flung subsistence or raw material driven excursions, there should be a small but noticeable
representation of lithic materials not readily available on the Fort itself, such as Alibates, or at least greater
percentages of materials other than Fort Hood Yellow chert. The relative absence of non-local materials
suggests that, prior to the occupation of the rockshelter, the site’s inhabitants may have remained in or
near North Fort Hood for quite some time. As a result, both Archaic and Late Prehistoric toolkits and
the debris from their manufacture and maintenance were dominated by lithic materials available nearby.
The absence of exotic materials, in addition to suggesting limited macro-geographic movement of the
occupying populations, also stands in contrast to the relatively extensive trade that is said to have occurred
during the Late Prehistoric, specifically during the Austin phase. This is yet another reason to suggest that
the groups visiting Rockshelter A did not stay there for long; if Austin phase habitation sites frequently
contain evidence of trade, then the absence of such materials point toward a much more limited duration
of occupation.
In this regard, while the nature of Austin-Toyah transition has sometimes been couched (e.g., Rickliss
and Collins 1994) in stark techno-genesis, lithic language (i.e. the appearance of arrow points, end unifaces,
and “drills” made on flakes as well as “beveled knives”) and/or in terms of major macro-faunal changes
and attendant procurement shifts (i.e., the return of Bison sp. and bison hunting), it may be that the more
nuanced and far less dramatic subsistence adjustments discussed above, are, in reality, the more subtle
hallmarks of this transition.
Despite some apparently contradictory data (see Chapter 2), it seems clear that a shift from more
mesic to dryer conditions occurred in the greater Fort Hood area perhaps as early as 2000 cal yr BP,
and almost certainly, by 1000 cal yr BP. During the last 1000 years, there appear to have been episodes
which may reflect increased or decreased precipitation within an overall trajectory of drying. One of these
episodes at ca. 675 14C BP ago or 650 cal yr BP is not only marked by a widespread vegetal discontinuity
but also corresponds rather precisely with the currently posited Austin-Toyah boundary. The fit may not be
coincidental.
Rockshelter A, in conclusion, offers important data regarding the prehistory of Fort Hood for two
primary reasons. Despite some apparent taphonomic issues, the site is valuable for its deep chronological
history, beginning with the Early Archaic (though this component is poorly understood) and extending
into the Protohistoric and, perhaps, early Historic periods. Because of the sheer time depth represented
at the site, as well as a presumably dense Protohistoric/Historic occupation that is practically unknown
elsewhere at the Fort, the site has the potential to illuminate cultural and technological behaviors that
might otherwise remain poorly understood or unknown. Secondly, the extensive subsurface excavations
conducted here permits a significantly more detailed trans-temporal examination of materials than the
mixed surface assemblages studied during most of the larger surveys. This has enabled the consistencies
and, to a lesser extent, differences, in technological strategies between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods to be identified and explored. With all of its merits and shortcomings, the artifactual and ecofactual
208

assemblage from Rockshelter A will almost certainly contribute to the picture of prehistoric human activity
on the Fort Hood archaeological landscape, which will become increasingly complete as more sites are
systematically examined.

Appendix A: Results of the Analysis of Materials from the 1994
Testing of Rockshelter A
According to Trierweiler (1996:218), the testing of Rockshelter A by TRCMA resulted in the recovery
of 3,495 pieces of debitage, 22 stone tools, seven arrow and dart points, and an abundance of bone, shell,
and burned rock fragments. The lithic artifact inventory, as re-analyzed by MAI, differs significantly from
that reported by Trierweiler. Some of this is likely due to differences in tool classification, as well as the
possibility that some of the artifacts may have become broken prior to their arrival at Mercyhurst, thus
increasing the number of artifacts that we recorded. Regardless of the reason(s) for these discrepancies,
our analyses found that there were 3,008 unmodified flakes, 72 flake tools, 18 bifaces in varying stages
of production, an apparently multifunctional tool, 5 projectile points, one multidirectional core, and
1,522 pieces of shatter, for a total chipped stone artifact count of 4,627 items. One groundstone artifact of
unknown function was also recovered, and an additional 60 items recovered by TRCMA were determined
to be non-cultural in nature and were thus omitted from the results of this report. The items were distributed
between two test pits, within which were identified 10 arbitrary levels and two cultural features. Test Pit 3
produced all cultural materials from this testing, with the exception of pieces of unmodified debitage. The
purpose of this re-examination is to integrate, to whatever extent possible, materials from the initial testing
of the site with those from the more extensive subsurface investigations conducted by MAI. More detailed
inquiries pertaining to this testing, specifically, should be directed toward the initial field report (Trierweiler
1996). As there was no consistency in the collection and analysis of debitage between the Mariah and MAI
excavations, it is only suitable that the discussion of chipped stone items recovered from these years be
presented separately. However, the criteria with which various tool and debitage forms were identified for
this re-examination are identical to those employed for the extended analysis of the materials recovered in
subsequent excavations by MAI, and are thus outlined in the main body of the report.

Debitage
Of the modified and unmodified flakes (n=3,080) from the 1994 testing of the site, 1491 (48.4%) are
complete or nearly complete, 833 (27.0%) are distal fragments, 44 (1.4%) are medial fragments, 65 (2.1%)
are proximal portions, 59 (1.9%) are lateral portions, and 587 (19.1%) represented small, unorientable
fragments. The fragments whose portions could not be determined were typically extremely small, as
evidenced by the fact that only one of them had a weight greater than 0.3g and that 495 of them (84.3%)
weighed .1g or less. During later years, an analytical size-cutoff of 1 cm2 was implemented for screen
bag artifacts, which greatly reduced the number of flakes in this weight range. However, at the time this
reanalysis of the 1994 material was conducted, no cutoff was in place, and as a result, the number of
extremely small, unorientable fragments was substantial.
Platform preparation was observed on 268 specimens, and was conducted in two primary ways.
Platform reduction is most common, occurring on 142 (53.0%) of the flakes that exhibit prepared platforms.
Occurring with only slightly less frequency is platform grinding, which was noted on the remaining 126
(47.0%) prepared platforms. The stage of production during which flakes are removed can be estimated by
their approximate cortex percentage as well as their platform angles (the latter applying most specifically to
bifacial reduction debris). Of all of the modified and unmodified flakes in the assemblage for whom cortex
percentage was recorded (n=2521), the vast majority—1,804 (71.6%)—lacked cortex. Flakes removed
during earlier stages of production typically have greater portions of their dorsal surface covered in cortex.
Three hundred seventy-two (14.8%) flakes retain minimal cortex, in the range of 1-25%, while 142 (5.6%)
231

exhibit cortex on 26-50% of their surfaces . Between 51 and 75% cortex is displayed on only 64 (2.5%)
flakes, while the earliest phases of decortications—those whose resulting flakes exhibit in excess of 76%
cortex—are represented by 139 flakes (5.5%). A decline in platform angles, most often observed during
the biface production process but also applicable to some forms of core reduction, is sometimes used as a
measure of the degree of refinement (production stage) that a flake represents. Although platform angles
can vary dramatically in all phases of biface or core manufacture, it is frequently the case that the angles
of bifaces (and sometimes cores) become increasingly acute as more and more flakes are removed from
their edges. Platform angles recorded for debitage range between 25º to in excess of 90º. When divided into
ranges, the number of flakes in each range increases until it peaks at the 60º-69º range, and then declines
steadily, as follows: ≤ 29º (n=4; .3%); 30º-39º (n=22; 1.9%); 40º-49º (N-87; 7.6%); 50º-59º (n=231;
20.1%); 60º-69º (n=354; 30.8%); 70º-79º (n=295; 25.7%); 80º-89º (n=129; 11.2%). The middle ranges
(whose angles fall between 50º and 79º) account for 76.5% (n=880) of all platform angles observed on
the debitage. While the constuent specimens were almost certainly derived from the production of various
tool types and at multiple stages, a large portion of the likely represent the early and early-middle stages of
production, as the lateral edge angles of most bifaces in the (cumulative) assemblage fall within this range
as well.

Projectile Points
For the most part, the projectile points from the 1994 testing of the site are similar to those found
during later years (Table A.1). Test Pit 3, from which all of these points were recovered, produced points
dating to the Austin Phase (Scallorn) and Toyah Phase (Perdiz) of the Late Prehistoric period, both of
which were identified during the MAI investigations. Interestingly, the initial testing of the site discussed
here produced the only Early Archaic projectile point from the site, while later excavations uncovered only
Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric diagnostics.
FS 3.1 is manufactured raw material type 66. The artifact has a narrow blade with fine comedial to
parallel-transverse pressure flaking resulting in a biconvex cross-section and finely serrated lateral margins.
In profile, the artifact is highly symmetrical, however this is not the case when viewed in plan. One lateral
margin of the blade is more convex, while the other is significantly straighter. A small but deep flake scar
initiates at the tip of the point and terminates in a step, a feature that may have resulted from impact. As
only the distal portion of the point is present, its type and cultural affiliation could not be determined. It was
recovered from Level 3 of Test Pit 3.
FS 4.1 is made of raw material type 55. Although the tip of the point and one barb are absent, this
otherwise complete specimen appears to be a Perdiz point. The portion of the blade that is present is planoconvex in cross-section, with one face being convex and heavily pressure-flaked while the other represents
the ventral surface of the flake from which the point was made. The latter surface exhibits only pressure
flaking, as the flat surface of the flake did not permit larger soft-hammer flakes to be removed. The flake
scars on the more heavily-worked face are oriented somewhat randomly and are partially obscured by small

pressure flakes that initiate at the lateral margins. The point’s tapered base is thicker relative to the blade and
is biconvex with heavy modification on both sides. The point was found in Test Pit 3, Level 3.
FS 6.1 is made of raw material 55, and its vitreous appearance and pinkish color indicate that it had
been heated, either intentionally or post-depositionally. It is biconvex in cross-section with pressure flaking
that ranges from comedial to parallel-transverse, suggesting that the point began as a flake thick enough for
soft-hammer and pressure flakes to be driven successfully from both sides. This nearly-complete specimen
is extremely well-made, in terms of its high degree of symmetry in both plan and profile as well as in its fine
serration, all of which suggest that this is a Scallorn point. The notching flake scars are broad and diffuse,
indicating their removal by indirect percussion. Given the lack of evidence for use (attrition on the lateral
margins or impact fracturing) and the absence of one barb, it is likely that the point was broken during the
notching stage and was discarded prior to use. It was found in Level 5 of Test Pit 3.
FS 7.1 is a completed Uvalde dart point dating to the Early Archaic period that was recovered from
Level 6 within Test Pit 3. It is the type specimen for raw material 67 in MAI’s comparative collection of raw
materials from this site. The blade is biconvex in cross-section and is largely symmetrical in both plan and
profile. The base is slightly asymmetrical in plan view, with one ear being slightly longer and broader than
this other. The flaking pattern consists of large flake scars from soft-hammer biface thinning superimposed
with pressure flake scars that range from parallel to random, often terminating in steps. The presence of
this point was originally attributed to the salvaging of older materials by more recent occupants of the
site. However, the identification of a legitimate Archaic component during the MAI excavations raises
the possibility that occupation of the rockshelter may have actually occurred as during the Early Archaic
(although no other materials of this antiquity have since been recovered).
FS 8.1 is made of material type 16, and is likely the tip of a Scallorn point although this cannot be
confirmed due to the absence of the biface’s basal portion. The point fragment is moderately symmetrical
in plan view, however when viewed in profile it is noticeably curved. Like FS 4.1 in the biface Type 1a
category, this point appears to have been made from further modifying a thin, curved flake that prohibited
substantial percussion and pressure flaking on a large portion of one face. The more highly worked surfaces
exhibit long, parallel pressure flake scars that initiate at each margin and travel obliquely toward the center,
where they overlap slightly with the pressure flake scars that from the opposite margin. This pressure
flaking obscures any previous percussion flake scars. It was found in Test Pit 3, Level 6.

Bifaces
The bifaces from recovered during the 1994 testing of Rockshelter A are consistent with those found
during subsequent excavations (Table A.2). They appear to span all stages of manufacture, from the earliest
forms to those that are, likely, non-diagnostic fragments of projectile points.
FS 5.1 is the distal portion of a late-stage biface made of material type 55. It is slightly asymmetrical in
plan view, but generally symmetrical in profile. There is at least one unused platform on each lateral margin,
suggesting that the thinning process was not quite finished when the item was discarded. The unfinished
biface thinning appears to be the primary reason for the specimen’s asymmetry. Along the broken surface
of the specimen, marked percussion waves are visible. These percussion waves initiate at the approximate
center of one face and dissipate, resulting in the fracture of the biface. The blow that caused the biface to
fracture was thus directed at the middle of the biface, either in an intentional effort to break the item, or
accidentally by trampling or some other means. Although the absence of a proximal portion makes this
interpretation tentative, it appears that it may be the tip of a dart or spear point.
FS 9.1 is the distal portion of a very late-stage or completed biface made of material type 65. It
is symmetrical in both plan and profile, and while biconvex in cross section, one face is slightly more
excurvate than the other. The flaking pattern consists of broad soft-hammer percussion flake scars overlain
by moderately sized pressure flakes along both margins. The material is clearly patinated, although it is
interesting to note that the surfaces exposed by pressure flaking are less severely patinated than those areas

exhibiting only soft-hammer percussion. This may indicate that the biface was scavenged from an older site
and re-worked some time later. The biface was broken by uncertain means. The fracture resembles a severe
step termination but is not consistent with fractures generally caused by impact or by manufacturing errors.
While this interpretation is speculative, it appears that this biface fragment represents a spear or dart point
may have been snapped post-depositionally, or was broken on impact in such a way that caused the biface
to fracture farther away from the tip than would be generally expected.
FS 13.1, 14.1, 54.309, 57.781, 78.62, and 79.13 are miscellaneous fragments of late-stage bifaces
that may represent portions of projectile points or other small, thin bifacial implements, while FS 1.1, 11.1,
15.1, 16.1, 17.1, 20.1, 62.13, and 78.62 middle-stage biface fragments that appear to have been broken
during manufacture. While little can be said of fourteen items due to their fragmentary nature, metric
attributes and average lateral edge angles are presented here nonetheless. The presence of these artifacts in
the assemblage is important in itself, as it significantly increases the total number of bifacial implements
in the assemblage and thus highlights the importance of middle- and late-stage biface production and/or
discard in the occupations of Rockshelter A.
FS 12.1 and FS 77.7 are minimally flaked, and represent either early-middle stage bifaces or possible
bifacial cores. On specimen FS 12.1, one margin is worked to a significantly more acute angle than the
other. Both angles are provided in the table.

Multifunctional Tool
FS 10.1 was recovered from Level 3, and is a small, asymmetrical ovate bifacial tool made of raw
material type 31. It measures 27.85 x 26.52 mm, has a maximum thickness of 4.96 mm, and weighs 3.18 g.
It was flaked by both percussion and pressure flaking and exhibits two projections, both of which have been
234

snapped. One projection is formed by unifacial pressure flaking and protrudes 2.55 mm from the biface
edge. Its maximum width, 3.83mm, occurs at the base and tapers away from the biface. The projection was
probably only slightly longer prior to breakage, as the snap break is very small and only sheared off the
extreme tip. The second projection is longer, extending 4.14 mm from the biface edge. It was formed by
extensive bifacial pressure flaking to create relatively parallel sides, and terminates in a snap fracture that
is equal to the width of the projection, 4.76 mm. As neither the extant projection fragments nor the biface
margins show signs of wear, the missing portions of projections were most likely the only utilized features
on the tool. The specific function(s) of this biface is (are) not known, however the snapped projections
suggest it was used as a drill or graver and was broken during use.

Cores
During the 1994 testing of the site, only one multidirectional core (FS 2.1) was found, in Level 7
within Feature 2. The core was exhausted, and made of heated raw material type 20, weighs 5.92g and
measures only 23.39 mm in length, 19.78 mm in width, and 12.28 mm in thickness. It bears eight flake
scars, the largest of which is 16.30 mm x 12.80 mm, and no potential platforms exist on any surface. These
observations indicate that the core was discarded when it could no longer produce usable flakes.

Flake Tools
During reanalysis of the materials recovered from the TRCMA testing of Rockshelter A, seventy-two
flake tools were identified, with a total of 89 distinct used edges. These tools include 68 utilized flakes, two
retouched flakes, and two flakes that exhibit evidence of both retouch and use (Table A.3) Of the 89 tool
edges, 55 (61.8%) exhibit Parallel Small, Small Scalar, or Random Small flake scars, which as noted in the
main body of this chapter, are associated with myriad activity types. Larger flake scars (Parallel Moderate,
Scalar Moderate, Random Moderate, and Moderate Overlain by Small) appear on 34 edges (38.2%). While
Keeley (1980) discusses the difficulty in attributing small attrition scars to particular functions because of
their presence on most tools (irrespective of function), the smallest of these flake scars are typical of meat
processing and hide scraping activities. The larger attrition types typically are often associated with the
working of harder materials, such as wood and bone. When attrition type is regarded relative to edge angle,
it is apparent that all of the most common attrition patterns occur most frequently on edges that that have
angles between 50-79º, with significantly fewer incidences occurring on edges with angles greater or lesser
than those in the most common range. Parallel moderate and Random moderate flake scars, though rare in
general, also peak in the range of 65-79º, while moderate to large scalar scars exist only on two edges, both
in the 50-64º range.
Although direct comparisons between the 1994 flake tools and those from the MAI investigations
cannot be made in all cases because of changing analytical methods, it appears that the tools from the initial
testing of the site are representative of those recovered in later years. They are, most likely, of the same
generalized, subsistence-oriented sort as those recovered by MAI.

Groundstone
During the 1994 testing of the site, a single groundstone implement was recovered, in Level 8. The
sandstone artifact is roughly triangular in plan view and, in general shape, resembles a pie slice. It has a
maximum length of 145.38 mm, a maximum width of 140.73 mm, is 43.14 mm thick, and weighs 0.85
kg. Both surfaces are worn smooth, with one surface being slightly concave and the other being slightly
convex. Neither side shows any discoloration, however the concave side is replete with tiny depressions,
perhaps from use or intentional pecking. Although the specific function of the artifact is not known, it seems
probable that it served as a metate upon which to grind plant matter.

Raw Materials
At the time of the reanalysis of the 1994 materials, MAI had not yet received the comparative collection
of material types from Fort Hood. In lieu of a standard comparative collection of samples, each material that
was encountered that appeared to be distinct in texture, color, or other attributes was considered a separate
raw material variant. In doing so, sixty-nine raw material types were identified in the 1994 41CV115 lithic
assemblage (see Lithic Artifacts, Table 5.6). These sixty-nine raw material types undoubtedly suggest much
greater variability than actually exists in the assemblage. Much of the apparent variation is more likely a
reflection of the heterogeneity the materials and/or the result of differential thermal alteration rather than
true variability in material types used at the site.
As the 1994 materials lent to MAI for reanalysis had been returned prior to receiving the collection and
associated descriptions from the Cultural Resource Management division at Fort Hood, there was no direct
way to correlate the 69 materials identified by MAI to their analogs in the Fort Hood collection. It must
therefore be assumed that initial determinations of raw material types made by the TRCMA investigators
were correct. Although there are discrepancies in the artifact counts provided in the initial TRCMA report
and those generated during MAI’s reanalysis of those materials, it would be reasonable to assume that the
material determinations provided by TRCMA are nonetheless representative of materials present in the
larger artifact assemblage defined by MAI. Thus, the initial report, which chronicles the testing and analysis
of Rockshelter A should be consulted in the case of any further inquiries regarding the lithic resources
present in the 1994 lithic assemblage.
Macroscopically, all or most of the raw materials appear to be locally-available (non-exotic) resources
that can be found on or in close proximity to the site location. Based on photos of the Fort Hood raw material
types provided to MAI by the Fort Hood archaeologists and descriptions thereof taken from Abbott and
Trierweiler (1995) and Treirweiler (1994), the predominant lithic materials appear to be Fort Hood Yellow,
Heiner Lake Blue (light), Anderson Mountain Gray, Heiner Lake Tan, Cowhouse Light Gray, Cowhouse
Mottled with Flecks, Table Rock Flat, and Cowhouse Brown Flecked. Smaller percentages of East Range
Flecked, Cowhouse Shell Hash, and Cowhouse Dark Gray also occur.

Refitting
During the reinvestigation of the materials recovered during the 1994 testing of the rockshelter, eight
refit numbers were identified, with a total of eighteen refit and conjoined artifacts. Three of the fits are
refits, proper, while the other five are conjoins. None of the three refits are particularly conclusive in terms
of the reduction process of which they are a result, as each could have plausibly been the product of either
238

multidirectional core reduction or very early stage bifacial core preparation. The flakes are somewhat blocky
and vary in shape and size, characteristics common to both multidirectional flaking and early bifacial core
preparation. Two of the refits (Fit Numbers 7 and 8) contain artifacts with platforms initiating from the same
core margin, which may give slightly greater credence to the latter. This, however, is inconclusive given the
small sample size of fit artifacts. It is nonetheless clear that the flakes are too robust and irregular in shape
to be results of late-stage biface production or pressure flaking activities.
Two of the refits (Fit Numbers 6 and 7) contain constituent pieces recovered from different levels. The
artifacts in these fits were recovered from Levels 1 and 2, and Levels 7 and 8, respectively. The distribution
of refit artifacts between two levels can be explained in two ways. First, it is possible that occupations
cross-cut multiple arbitrary 10 cm levels. In this scenario, artifacts in Levels 1 and 2 resulted from a single
occupation, and the same is true for Levels 7 and 8 within Feature 2. The other possibility is that the artifact
concentrations in each of the arbitrary levels do have some relevance to distinct occupations, and that postdepositional disturbance is the mechanism responsible for dispersing artifacts from a single occupation
throughout multiple arbitrary levels. While sufficient evidence to confirm or deny either is presently lacking,
the former explanation seems the most likely.

Discussion
The lithic artifacts recovered during the 1994 testing of the site by TRCMA were recovered from two
Test Pits. TP 2 only yielded eight artifacts, all of which are unmodified debitage. One item was recovered
from Level 1, four artifacts were found in Level 2, one was found in Level 3, and FS 51.1 and 51.2 are and
two were found in Level 6. Six additional pieces of unmodified debitage from Level 1 were found, but no
information was provided regarding the test pit from which these items were recovered. The remaining
99.9+ % of the assemblage was found within Test Pit 3.
While Test Pit 2 represents consistently low activity throughout the occupation, Test Pit 3, occurs
in what was clearly an intensely-used area of the site. While the temporal and occupational relationships
between the arbitrary levels used in the excavation are unknown and the number and nature of specific
occupation events therefore cannot be determined, the recognition of these lithic concentrations is
nonetheless useful.
Level 1 produced scant chipped stone artifacts, all of which are unmodified debitage with the exception
of a single utilized flake. The paucity of artifacts in this level does not allow for any inferences about site use
to be generated. Level 2 contained 124 unmodified artifacts, five utilized flakes, and one biface, probably
representing a brief and/or low-intensity occupation focused on the production or maintenance of tools and
the limited processing of unknown materials. Level 3 contains, by far, the densest concentration of flaked
stone implements and debitage within the test pit. 1,570 pieces of unmodified flakes and shatter, fifteen
utilized flakes, and 9 bifaces were recovered from this level, representing a major tool production and
material processing locus in the rockshelter. Based on the presence of a Perdiz projectile point fragment that
was recovered, this level can be assigned to the Toyah Phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Levels 4 and 5
collectively form Feature 1, a hearth containing 1,210 pieces of unmodified debitage, 17 utilized flakes, one
retouched and utilized flake, and five bifaces representing varying stages of production. This demonstrates
fairly intensive or repeated activity in this area. An Austin Phase age for this feature is suggested by the
nearly-complete Scallorn point found within it.
Level 6 contains only 447 pieces of unmodified debris, but seemed to also yield an unusually high
number of formal and informal tools. Five bifaces representing all stages of production, eight utilized
flakes, and two retouched flakes were recovered from this level. The relatively high numbers of flakes to
tools suggests that Level 6 functioned, in part, as a campsite where prepared early, middle, and late stage
bifaces were made and modified. Although most of the tested area of rockshelter is consistently associated
with Late Prehistoric projectile points, a complete Early Archaic Uvalde dart point was among items found
in Level 6. As suggested by the TRCMA investigators (Treirweiler 1996), this projectile point may have
239

been manufactured much earlier and prehistory and later discovered and curated by the Late Prehistoric
occupants of 41CV115, however the later MAI investigations have noted an other Archaic materials from
the site. This Uvalde point may, therefore, represent a very early occupation of the site rather than a re-use
of an older point by Late Prehistoric people.
Levels 7 and 8 are in Feature 2, a hearth yielding 748 stone artifacts, including 12 utilized flakes and
the only multidirectional core in the assemblage. It is interesting to note that the only multidirectional core
was found in a feature entirely devoid of bifacial tools. It is uncertain whether this excavation unit is simply
not representative of the whole feature or if the site’s occupants had a true preference for multidirectional
reduction as opposed to bifacial reduction. Level 8 also produced the only groundstone tool, suggesting the
processing of floral resources during the occupation.
Level 9 contains a moderately-sized concentration of lithic artifacts, including 421 pieces of
unmodified production debris, three utilized flakes, and a single early-stage biface or possible bifacial core.
Level 10 yielded scant artifacts, only 52 flakes and a single utilized flake. It is possible that Level 10 is an
extension of the Level 9 occupation, and that they collectively represent a brief or low-intensity activity
locus for the production and use of miscellaneous tools.

Conclusions
While it is not the intention of this section to detail the specific characteristics of the cultural
materials found testing (as these may be found in Trierweiler 1996), it is important to determine the extent
to which they are temporally and technologically consistent with those found during the subsequent
MAI excavations. Although the raw material determinations were conducted differently because of the
lack of access to a comparative collection of materials at the time which this reanalysis was conducted,
it appears that all artifacts from the initial testing of the site were manufactured from locally available
sources. Multidirectional and bifacial technologies both appear in the assemblage, which is likewise the
case in the assemblage from the 2003-2003 investigations. Multiple stages of production are represented
by the bifaces, proper, and the debris from their production, as is typical of the assemblage at large. Cortex
percentage and platform angles retained on debitage similarly speak to the full spectrum of tool production,
from initial decortications of nodules to the terminal trimming and maintenance of finished tools. The flake
tool assemblage found during testing is also similar to the contents of the rest of the site in both its lack of
diversity and its overwhelmingly simple, unstandardized nature.
The 1994 testing of Rockshelter A appears to be, in almost all aspects, representative of the site’s
assemblage as a whole. It differs only in that it produced an Early Archaic projectile point, where later work
at the site failed to produce diagnostics older than those associated with the Middle Archaic period.

Key: Level: surf.=surface; FS #: All items are utilized flakes except: *=percussion–retouched flake; _=retouched and utilized flake; _=modified colluvial pebble; ‡=modified potlid; _=possible
graver; #, Location of Used Faces: 2=dorsal and ventral faces modified; 1(D)=modification on dorsal face only; 1(V)=modification on ventral face only; A & B are used to denote faces
of modified colluvial pebbles in lieu of V & D.   Location of Modified Edge: P=proximal; D=distal; L=lateral. Edge Angle: (A)=angle varies across edge, measurement is averaged.
Attrition Density: D=dorsal; V=ventral; IN=indeterminate due to extremely high density of tiny flake scars; (E): Used edge is less than 1cm, attrition density is estimated;  Attrition Pattern:
MoS=moderately–sized flake scars overlain by smaller flake scars; Ls=Large shallow scalar flake scars; Ld=large deep scalar flake scars; Ss=small shallow scalar  flake scars; Sd=small deep
scalar flake scars; L step=large stepped flake scars; S step=small stepped flake scars; ½ moon=half–moon breakages; Lr=large randomly–oriented or variable  flake scars; Sr=small randomly
oriented or variable flake scars; Micro=microscopic flake scars (<.5mm).

Appendix D: Experimental Analysis of Prairie Rabdotus behavior
J. M. Campbell and M. J. Campbell-Weber

Introduction
Preliminary observations of Rabdotus land snails made by MAI biologists at Fort Hood and
summarized in Chapter 1 of this report confirmed the possibility suggested by Carlson (1993a, 1993b)
that these creatures might be naturally attracted to the moist shady conditions presented by rockshelter
environments. The archaeological significance of snails in Central Texas in regard to their potential role(s)
in human subsistence patterns has been reviewed by Baker (1993). The prolonged enigmatic status of this
taxon in the literature of Central Texas archaeological studies might be partly attributed to “taxonomic
confusion” with the species in the genus (Rabdotus = Bulimulus), for which Perez (2008) suggests that “a
thorough modern treatment is necessary.”
Exemplary of this issue is Randolf’s (1973) paper on the ecology and population characteristics
of Bulimulus dealbatus (subspecies mooreanus) at a site near Austin, Texas. The detailed description
of the snail offered by Randolf clearly matches the description we used for prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus
mooreanus) throughout this report, and is the land snail species of greatest interest at Rockshelter A, due
to the large numbers found during excavation work at the site and questions about whether the snail was
brought to the rockshelter to be eaten. Besides Randolf’s (1973) useful information on the basic population
ecology of prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus), Horne (1973) has provided useful details regarding the
physiological ecology and aestivation behavior of the species.
The purpose of the following work was to determine the effects of environmental factors relevant to
Fort Hood rockshelter sites on the orientation behavior of prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus) and to
briefly discuss alternative explanations for occurrence of the snail in these habitats.

Methods
We located a single large colony of prairie rabdotus on the west side of Old Georgetown Road near
South Fort Hood in early June 2005. Approximately 200 live specimens were collected and taken to a the
MAI processing laboratory on base to conduct experiments on the feeding ecology, substrate preferences,
and responses to environmental factors—including light, temperature, and moisture.
The first set of experiments conducted indoors at the Fort Hood laboratory involved placing active
snails at the midline of 80 cm x 35 cm plastic containers. Within these containers, environmental gradients
of temperature (heating pad versus ambient), moisture (water-soaked towel versus ambient), and light (heatshielded 40W incandescent lamp versus darkness) were established. The second set of experiments were
conducted outdoors at the Fort Hood laboratory using prairie rabdotus in 80 cm x 35 cm plastic containers
half exposed to full sunlight on a hot sunny day at approximately noon.
The next set of experiments conducted at the fort tested the substrate preferences of prairie rabdotus
(Rabdotus mooreanus). In these experiments, snails were placed in the bottom center of an 80 cm x 35 cm
container (covered with a lid) surrounded by equal quantities (based on surface area) of various substrates
including grass clippings, bare twigs, twigs with leaves attached, twigs with lichens, dead leaves, and plantfree sediment. The snails were left overnight to select their preferred substrate.
After two days of experimentation at the fort, the snails were released at the point of original capture
and a second random sample of 40 individuals was obtained and relocated to Mercyhurst University
265

for additional behavioral experiments conducted during late June and July 2005. During transport and
acclimatization for behavior experiments in the laboratory, the live prairie rabdotus specimens were
maintained in 80 cm x 35 cm plastic containers on bedding of moistened live oak (Quercus fusiformis)
leaves, which also served as a food source for the snails.
The final series of experiments conducted at Mercyhurst University evaluated the response of prairie
rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus) to specific colors of light (from colored bulbs) at constant temperatures in
a T-maze apparatus that presented individual snails with a choice between either light or darkness.

Results and Discussion
The results of experiment 1 (Figure D.1) suggested a preference by snails for cooler over warmer
areas and moist areas over dry areas. The response to incandescent light versus darkness was equivocal. The
results of experiment 2 also indicated a general tendency for the snails to move away from a brightly lit,
warm (34º C) area toward a shaded, cooler (27º C) area (Figure D.2). The T-maze experiments conducted
at Mercyhurst demonstrated that the snails were not responsive to red or violet light, but exhibited negative
phototaxis to white and green light (Figure D.3). The results of all of these experiments provided evidence
that prairie rabdotus exhibits intrinsic behavior patterns that could result in their presence in rockshelters
for non-anthropogenic subsistence-related reasons.
The demonstrated shade-seeking behavior
of Rabdotus sp. is but one alternative to aboriginal
exploitation. A second possibility is that empty
(buoyant) shells from upslope areas were
transported into the rockshelter by sheet or rill
wash during major precipitation events. As noted in
Chapter 4, this possibility is supported by both the
overall drainage topography of the site as well as
the cobble deposits on the western margin.

Figure D.1. Results of gradient preference
experiments with prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus
mooreanus) conducted in June 2005 at Fort Hood,
Texas. Ambient conditions in laboratory were 26°
C and 20 percent humidity.

The substrate preference experiments were
carried out to evaluate the suggestion by other
researchers that Rabdotus sp. snails may have
been naturally attracted to human refuse areas as
food sources (Malof 2007), which has never been
confirmed. Nearly 75 percent of the tested snails
ended up on the sides and “ceiling” (underside of
the lid) of the container (Figure D.4). Among the
substrates offered to prairie rabdotus, twigs with
leaves were the most frequently selected followed
by dead leaves.
During behavioral experiments conducted at
Mercyhurst University, prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus
mooreanus) specimens were maintained for two
months on a diet of freshly collected oak (Quercus
sp.) and apple (Malus sp.) leaves, and the snails
were observed feeding on materials scraped from
surfaces of moistened Live Oak leaves. These
observations may support the idea that snails
might be attracted to human refuse piles or midden
deposits if those deposits contained suitable plant

Figure D.2. Results of outdoor shelter-seeking
behavior experiments with prairie rabdotus
(Rabdotus mooreanus) conducted outside in full
sunlight at noon, within 80 cm x 35cm containers
in June 2005 at Fort Hood, Texas. Temperatures in
the fully lit and fully shaded areas of the container
were 34° C and 27° C, respectively.

debris. Of course, such habitats are also available
outside of human habitation sites.
Besides the demonstrated tendency for
prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus) to move
onto walls and ceilings in the substrate preference
experiment, the natural tendency of Rabdotus sp.
to climb was also indicated serendipitously by
snails which escaped confinement in the laboratory.
These “escapees” were inevitably found climbing
the nearest wall. Thus, an apparent affinity for walls
and ceilings may provide yet another reason why
these land snails might congregate in a rockshelter.

Figure D.3. Results of T-maze experiments with
prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus mooreanus) conducted
in Mercyhurst University laboratory, evaluating
preference of individual snails for darkness versus
different colors of light, at constant temperature
and humidity.

All of the foregoing arguments indicating
possible “voluntary” entry of prairie rabdotus
(Rabdotus mooreanus) to a rockshelter do not prove
that these programmed behaviors account for the
presence of large numbers of the prairie rabdotus
(Rabdotus mooreanus) in Rockshelter A. The
following two facts argue against the hypothesis of
natural congregation of prairie rabdotus (Rabdotus
mooreanus) in Rockshelter A: (1) the rockshelter
is situated on a densely forested elevated site,
rather than a more sparsely vegetated lowland area
(the typical habitat of prairie rabdotus [Rabdotus
mooreanus] at Fort Hood), and (2) a consistent
conspicuous presence of woodland-indicator land
snail species was found at all depths in stratigraphic
profile of Rockshelter A.
The size distribution of prairie rabdotus
(Rabdotus mooreanus) excavated from Rockshelter
A is also not what we would expect from a natural
population of land snails that should include
significant numbers of immature individuals (see
Chapters 8 and 10). This leaves us with the final
alternative explanation that the presence of large
numbers of this species in the rockshelter was the
result of human collecting for consumption.

Appendix E: Organic Residue Analysis of Flaked Stone Tools from
Rockshelter A, Fort Hood
D. C. Hyland, C. Troskosky, and B. Seath

Introduction
Organic residues present on flaked stone tools can provide direct evidence reflecting patterns of tool
manufacture and function. Results of procedures designed to determine the species of origin of ancient blood
residues can also corroborate and compliment information on tool utility derived from more conventional
lithic analyses such as typologic, stylistic, and technological attribute determination; use-wear analysis;
petrological analysis; and ethnographic and experimental analogy. Obviously, a combination of these
analytical efforts could yield the most robust interpretation of tool manufacture and function. In addition
to lithic function studies, preserved blood specimens can furnish clues on other cultural and environmental
parameters such as dietary composition and preferences, faunal inventory, and prehistoric climate. It is with
these aims in mind that during the past dozen years molecular biologists and archaeologists began applying
recently developed biomolecular techniques to the identification and characterization of archaeological
organic residues.
As applied to this somewhat intractable artifact class, these techniques must overcome the formidable
limitations to analysis presented by the study of organic residues which have suffered degradation under
extremely poor and unknown “storage” conditions; are of ancient age; and are severely limited in quantity.
Taphonomic studies concerning those factors affecting the preservation of residues and their capacity to
retain some amount of biological activity have been of limited number and scope (Barraco 1978; DeJong et
al. 1974; Gurfinkel and Franklin 1988; Gürtler et al. 1981; Pinck and Allison 1951; Sensabaugh et al. 1971).
These few studies also lamentably offer dissimilar results (for an overview of these studies see Hyland
and Anderson 1990; Hyland et al. 1990). Fortunately, these preservational limitations, however they may
affect the quantity and biological activity of organic residues remaining in the archaeological record, have
been in part overcome via the development and implementation of a powerful suite of assays based on the
principles of immunology and biochemistry. A number of such procedures have been adopted and adapted
for archaeological purposes and include: double-immunodiffusion (Downs 1985, 1993), crystallography
(Loy 1983, 1987a), cross-over electrophoresis (CIEF) (Barr 1989; Newman and Julig 1989), isoelectric
focusing (IEF) (Loy 1987a, 1987b; Loy and Nelson 1987; Nelson et al. 1986), radioimmunoassay (RIA)
(Lowenstein 1980, 1985, 1986; Lowenstein et al. 1982), and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Hyland and
Anderson 1990; Hyland et al. 1990; Hyland et al. 1994) (for an overview of these assays see Hyland et al.
1990).

Data Base
As shown in Tables D.1 and D.2, the flaked stone tool sample selected for organic residue analysis
includes 59 artifacts. This total includes all utilized flakes and formed tools excepting those identified as
manufacturing breaks or burned. Forty-six of these specimens derive from the 1 m2 x 1 m2 unit excavated
and identified by TRC Mariah Associates, Inc (TRC-MA), as Test Pit 3. This unit was excavated in 1994
as part of the initial investigations conducted at the site. The remaining 13 specimens (see Table D.2) were
recovered during subsequent excavation efforts conducted by Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute (MAI).
Unfortunately, many of the specimens exhibit evidence of having been heated or burned, many were
previously washed and all specimens were labeled and catalogued. This operation, performed previous to

residue analysis, obviously may have disrupted the integrity of some adherent residues. However, the dorsal
surface of the artifacts, where the likelihood of adherent residue is highest, remained unmarred.

Analytical Methods
Organic residues are extracted from the flaked stone artifacts via sonication. To begin the residue
extraction process, each tool is individually placed in a beaker with a diameter minimally larger than the
greatest dimension of the artifact. In practice, the beakers employed in this process are generally quite small,
20 ml and 50 ml. Next, each specimen is barely but completely covered with a Tris-buffered saline solution
(50mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.6). For this assemblage, the amount of solution required for
immersion varied between 2–13 ml with one exception. Specimen FS 623.9 required 20 ml. Each vessel,
containing the artifact and the solvent, is then suspended for a minimum of 15 minutes in a Branson (model
#B2200R–1) ultrasonic unit. Generally, five specimens are placed in the ultrasonic bath simultaneously.
The resulting solution from each artifact is decanted in labeled microcentrifuge tubes, refrigerated, and
allowed to settle.
The next step in the identification process involves a simple preliminary screening procedure.
Specifically, this procedure consists of a hemoglobin presence/absence test using commercially available
Hemastix® reagent strips. A minute portion (10–12 µl) of each decanted elution is applied in two forms—

as a supernatant and as a vortexed solution—to separate test strips and viewed under low power (25–80x)
magnification using a Leitz zoom stereomicroscope. The test area is compared with the color chart supplied
with Hemastix® 60 seconds after application, as recommended in the technical notes provided with the
reagent strips (Miles, Inc. 1992). When present, the heme group of hemoglobin (or myoglobin) catalyzes
a reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine on the reagent strip,
resulting in a color change from yellow/orange to dark green and even blue (Miles, Inc. 1992).
Although Hemastix® also reacts with other substances exhibiting peroxidase-like activity (e.g.,
chlorophyll) all positive-testing samples are subjected to the species identification procedure outlined
below. Since the enzyme immunoassay is immunologically based, samples testing positive, which are in
fact false positives due to the presence of chlorophyll or some other such environmental contaminant, do
not react with any of the test antisera and are recorded as negatives. This eliminates the need for a separate
step to distinguish plant from animal residues.
It should be noted that this preliminary procedure in and of itself is not and does not represent a
definitive study of blood residues (see Custer et al. 1988). However, it does provide an indication of the
potential presence of blood or its products and can lend some corroborating confidence to subsequent
identificatory analyses.

Results
Initially, a 46 specimen set of lithic artifacts collected from Rockshelter A was selected for organic
residue analysis based upon the criteria enumerated above. Thirteen additional artifacts were separately
selected as part of a comprehensive re-analysis. This entire analytical subassemblage was subjected to
the hemoglobin detection procedure. After removing all residue from the tool surface microcrevices via
sonication, Hemastix® reagent strips were used in a preliminary fashion to detect the potential presence of
blood.
Positive results indicating the potential presence of hemoglobin were obtained from 2 of the 59 artifacts.
This included specimens FS13.1 and FS 76.149. This is not a surprising outcome given that the specimens
had previously been washed and/or exhibited some degree of burning.
