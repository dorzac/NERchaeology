ABSTRACT

An archaeological survey of a wetlands area (approximately four acres) within
the Brazos Fee Former Arrowhead Gun Club in central Brazos County, Texas was
conducted on February 28, 2001 by Brazos Valley Research Associates of Bryan,
Texas under the stated requirements of the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
Fort Worth District. The area was investigated by shovel testing. No archaeological
sites were found in the project area, and it is recommended that the removal and
cleanup of hazardous and toxic waste in this area be allowed to proceed as planned.
Copies of the report are on file at the Corps of Engineers; the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas; Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (CRA), and
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA).

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by CRA to conduct a Phase I cultural resources survey of a
four acre wetlands area in central Brazos County, the site of the Former Arrowhead Gun
Club. The project area is located within a 107 acre tract, of which approximately 25
acres were used for the gun club which was in operation from 1983 to 1995 (Figure 1).
Prior to 1983, the property was used as a dairy farm and as pasture. The property has
been used intermittently for cattle grazing since the closure of the Arrowhead Gun Club
in 1995. No other activities are being conducted at the site.
The current survey is part of a preconstruction notification (PCN) being prepared
for Thousand Oaks Development Company of Houston, Texas for the former
Arrowhead Gun Club in accordance with 33 CFR ยง 330 of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permit Program. The objective of the PCN is to enable
the Corps of Engineers District Engineer to review scheduled project activities and
authorize work in wetlands under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act in accordance
with the Regulatory Program of the Corps of Engineers. The scheduled work will be
conducted under Nationwide Permit 38 that regulates specific activities required for the
removal and cleanup of hazardous and toxic waste materials and the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission Voluntary Cleanup Program.
The project area is depicted on United States Geological Survey topographical
map Ferguson Crossing dated 1962 and photorevised 1980 (Figure 2). The wetlands
examined during this investigation are formed by an unnamed tributary of Cedar Creek.
The confluence of this tributary and Cedar Creek is approximately one mile to the south.
The fieldwork was accomplished on February 28, 2001.
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded within the current
project area. It was discovered that significant sites have been recorded in Brazos
County, although no significant sites were encountered at this site. Prehistoric sites in
this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close proximity to
dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. No prehistoric sites in the
county have been reported on clay hills, active floodplains, or wetland areas. Therefore,
the current project area was viewed as a low probability area for the presence of
archaeological sites.

FIELD METHODS
The project area was examined on February 28, 2001. BVRA was represented
by William E. Moore (Principal Investigator), Arthur F. Romine, and Bobby Jemison.
CRA was represented by Brad Alker. Together, this team walked the entire wetlands
area, delineated areas to be surveyed, and excavated shovel tests. In addition,
exposed areas were examined for the presence of cultural materials. Surface visibility
was poor except in a few areas on the eroded slopes of adjacent hills.
Shovel tests were dug to clay when possible. The size of each test was 30 x 50
cm and varied in depth from 20 to 90 cm below the existing ground surface. All
excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from
shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log, and the approximate location of each
test was plotted on a project area map prepared by CRA (Figure 1). In all, 20 shovel
tests were dug.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area. There was also
no indication that any part of the project area had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. As stated above, the entire project area is located within a wetlands
area as defined by CRA. Overall, soils were shallow, and clay was encountered at all
but three shovel tests, these tests being in disturbed areas adjacent to berms
surrounding Pond 1 and Pond 7. Overall, the sandy and clayey soils form a thin mantle
overlying clay with an average depth of 34 cm. In several areas, small natural gravels
were observed eroding from the surface, and they were found in shovel tests, usually
directly over the underlying clay stratum. The poor drainage in the area was evidenced
by very wet soils in virtually every shovel test excavated. There are three principal
reasons that explain the absence of archaeological sites in the project area. First,
prehistoric sites are typically located on well-drained sandy hills. Second, the survey
area was confined to known jurisdictional wetlands at the site; the tributary that flows
through the project area is the lower end of what was probably an intermittent stream in
prehistoric times at best. Third, sites are usually found at the top of landforms not on
slopes or in creek beds, the focus of this study.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no
archaeological sites within the current project area as defined by jurisdictional wetlands.
Therefore, it is recommended that the removal and cleanup of hazardous and toxic
waste materials in the area investigated be allowed to proceed as planned.
