ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an
intensive pedestrian survey on a total of six hectares (15 acres) of property in Montgomery
County, Texas. The property is proposed for development of a new Conroe Independent
School District (CISD) elementary school. The survey was conducted entirely on property
owned by the CISD. Therefore, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required. The survey area is
composed of mixed forest with some areas that have been recently cleared of vegetation.
All fieldwork and reporting activities were conducted with reference to the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4874, issued by the Texas
Historical Commission in April of 2008. Fieldwork was conducted on April 9, 2008 and
required 16 person hours to complete. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed
with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) law and guidance for conducting
cultural resources surveys in the state of Texas.
As a result of the investigation, a total of 33 shovel tests were attempted within the
project area. Of these, 27 were successfully excavated; the remaining six shovel tests were
not completed due to visible disturbances including cleared vegetation and fill overlying
disturbed soils, as well as inundation. No new or previously identified archaeological sites or
historic standing structures were recorded during the investigation. Based on the negative
results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work
and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
In April of 2008, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas,
performed an intensive pedestrian survey on a total of six hectares (15 acres) of property in
Montgomery County, Texas. The property is proposed for development of a new Conroe
Independent School District (CISD) elementary school. The survey was conducted entirely
on property owned by the CISD. Therefore, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archaeological investigation will be defined as
all land within the 6-hectare (15-acre) property proposed for development of the school. The
archaeological survey strategy developed for the project included pedestrian walkover survey
and systematic shovel test excavation. All fieldwork and reporting activities were conducted
with reference to the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
4874, issued by the Texas Historical Commission in April of 2008. Fieldwork was
conducted on April 9, 2008 and required 16 person hours to complete. All fieldwork and
reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas)
law and guidance for conducting cultural resources surveys in the state of Texas.

PROJECT AREA
The surveyed area is located on the Tamina United States Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map in Montgomery County, Texas (see Figure 1). The
project is located just north of Riley Fuzzell Road and east of Interstate Highway (IH) 45 in a
developing area. The surveyed area consists of mixed forest with some areas that have been
recently cleared of vegetation. A small intermittent drainage of Woodson’s Gully is situated
approximately 130 meters (400 feet) west of the western project boundary. The eastern edge
of the project boundary is situated on the slope of a natural ovoid-shaped landform with an
elevation of 33 meters (110 feet) above mean sea level.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Crew Chief Kerry McGuire and Senior Field Technician Beth Spaulding conducted
fieldwork for this project under supervision of Principal Investigator Kristi Soltysiak and
Project Manager James Hughey. Kristi Soltysiak completed site file research prior to
fieldwork mobilization and prepared the content of the report. Tony Scott and Julia
Balakirova produced graphics. The report was edited and produced by Jessica Campbell.

GEOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Montgomery County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations
in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. Montgomery County is underlain by
relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the
Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Aronow 1992; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term
human occupation in modern-day Montgomery County include the Willis, Lissie (also called
Montgomery) and Beaumont formations, and younger Late Pleistocene to early Holocene
units such as the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the
Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date to between one hundred thousand to four
thousand years ago, and are characterized as consisting “of up to three inset fluvial
terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of
watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater than that seen today
(Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits are relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits,
laid down in the Montgomery County area by alluvial or eolian factors.

SOILS
Albany fine sand (Ab) has a surface layer approximately 15 centimeters (6 inches)
thick that is composed of dark grayish-brown fine sand. The next layer is brown fine sand
with a few light-gray mottles. The following layer is fine sandy loam divided into two parts;
brown in the upper layer and light yellowish brown in the lower part. Included in this soil
are areas of Tuckerman loam and areas of Fuquay loamy fine sand. These soils make up less
than ten percent of the total acreage (McClintock et al. 1972).
Sorter silt loam (So) has a surface layer of gray silt loam. The subsurface layer is light
brownish-gray silt loam. The following layer is light brownish-gray silt loam. The next layer
is light-gray silt loam mottled with yellow and brownish-yellow. The final layer is light gray
fine sandy loam. Waller loam and small amounts of Boy fine sand or Leefield loamy fine
sand are included with this soil and make up less than five percent of the total acreage
(McClintock et al. 1972).

CULTURE HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Despite these differences, the chronologies developed by researchers are
based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies within the region and the
introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based hunting and gathering
lifestyle was used throughout all time periods.
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation; much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state of
Texas and across North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed
the Bearing Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson
1993; Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993)
and were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from
mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths.
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna, upon
which the Paleoindian peoples depended, gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply
is seen as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Culberson
1993; Biesaart et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961). Culberson (1993) places the beginning of the
Early Archaic at 8000 B.C. Aten (1984) states that the transition from Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100. There are three progressive stages
recognizable during the Archaic period: Early, Middle, and Late.
Currently, research indicates that Early Archaic peoples were small, isolated bands of
hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984). With the loss of
the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the hunting of smaller
game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging (Culberson 1993).
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of
stone tools used. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs
(Culberson 1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and
procurement.
4

The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of
Native American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna
intensified, as did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late
Archaic peoples began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small
game such as deer, rabbits, raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became
socially more complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing
intercommunication with neighboring groups.
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester
(1993) see the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary
stages of Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by
most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993) to be from this
period, though some place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations, the
first evidence of pottery began to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and
variety of pottery intensified during the Late Prehistoric, pottery is an excellent way of
determining the terminus post quem of a site.
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from
the end of the Archaic period to the historic period brought in by the Spanish Missions and
Anglo-American settlers. It is during this period that peoples known today as the Caddo,
Atakapan, and Bidai, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the
historical sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the
reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.
In order to better understand the complexity of the region’s cultures, researchers turn
to historical sources for an understanding of the peoples who first occupied southeast Texas.
Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his expedition in
1542; it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples. The first expeditions by La
Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth century by Europeans
continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the area (Aten 1984).
French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also known as the Neches
Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache tribes (Newcomb
1961).
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native
American groups as pawns in the two nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961).
Most destructive for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases.
When Euro-American settlers began moving into the area en mass around the 1850s, disease
and warfare decimated the groups to near extinction.

SITE FILE SEARCH AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was
conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites, historical markers and historic structures eligible
for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Site file research was used to
provide a historic context to the archaeological survey.
No previously recorded sites were located within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study
radius of the project area. However, three previously recorded sites (41MQ46, 41MQ45, and
41MQ158) and six previously recorded surveys are documented within approximately 3.2
kilometers (2 miles) of the project area (see Figure 1). D.B. Moore recorded prehistoric sites
41MQ46 and 41MQ45 in 1967.
Site 41MQ46 is located on a low sandy ridge with Adkins Creek as the southern
boundary and is approximately 0.8-hectare (2 acres) in size. Several ceramic sherds and
stone tools were collected. 41MQ45 is located on a high sandy knoll approximately 336
meters (1102 feet) southwest of 41MQ46 and approximately 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) in size.
Two points were collected from Site 41MQ45. Both sites were revisited in 1977 for a
proposed Tennessee Gas pipeline right-of-way. Heartfield, Price, and Greene, Inc revisited
both sites again in 1984 for an archaeological assessment of sites located within an existing
Tennessee Gas Pipeline right-of-way (Dieste, 1984).
Site 41MQ158 was observed in 1997 by Southern Archaeological Consultants during
a survey for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is located on a finger ridge overlooking
White Oak Creek in a forested area with little undergrowth. The size of the site is
approximately 120 meters (394 feet) by 60 meters (200 feet). Three flakes and one small
ceramic sherd were collected.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources within the defined project
boundaries. The APE was subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey.
Archaeological investigations included a combination of pedestrian walkover and systematic
shovel testing.
Texas minimum survey standards call for one shovel test per two acres in projects
between 11-100 acres in size. For this survey, a total of 33 shovel tests were planned for
6

excavation (Figure 2) along a set of eight transects (Transects A through H) spaced 30 meters
(100 feet) apart and oriented south to north. Shovel tests were placed judgmentally within the 6hectare (15-acre) project area. The project area is situated between a small intermittent drainage
of Woodson’s Gully and the edge of an ovoid landform located east of the drainage. These
areas are considered to have a higher probability for containing archaeological deposits than the
flat-low-lying terrain located in the center of the project area. Therefore, shovel testing was
conducted at between 30 to 60-meter (100 to 200-foot) intervals along the western and eastern
edges of the project area closest to the drainage and landform. These areas included the
outermost four transects (A, B, G, and H). In the center of the project area, the innermost four
transects (C, D, E, and F) were shovel tested at intervals ranging from 100 to 130 meters (300 to
400 feet) apart since these areas are thought to have lower archaeological potential.
Excavated shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated to a maximum depth of 90 centimeters (35 inches) into the underlying
substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil or the water table was encountered. Removed
soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil
texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts. Additional information
concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each
excavation.

RESULTS
Site file research resulted in three previously identified archaeological sites outside
the 1.6 kilometers (1-mile) study radius of the project area (see Figure 1). As a result of the
archaeological investigation, 33 shovel tests were attempted on eight transects running in a
south to north direction. A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated, while the excavation of
six shovel tests was precluded due to visible disturbances including cleared vegetation, the
presence of fill in the cleared areas, and standing water approximately 15-30 centimeters (612 inches) deep. The majority of the southwest portion of the project area has been
previously cleared and covered with a gravel-and-sandy-clay mix that was approximately 10
centimeters (4 inches) in depth. Approximately six shovel tests were excavated in the
cleared area to determine whether intact soils may have been present under the disturbed fill.
The six shovel tests placed in the cleared area were excavated to depths between 50
and 75 centimeters (20 and 30 inches) below surface. All soil profiles in the cleared area
appeared to be disturbed due to the presence of heavily mottled clay soils and charcoal. All
shovel tests throughout the rest of the project area ranged in depth from 35 centimeters (14
inches) to 90 centimeters (36 inches) below the ground surface. Shovel tests were generally
terminated at the presence of the water table at an average depth of 70 centimeters (28
inches). All tests were negative for cultural resources. Detailed descriptions of all shovel
tests are provided in Appendix A.
Shovel tests located along the western boundary within proximity of a small drainage
of Woodson’s Gully were spaced at an interval of 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet). The
same interval was used along the eastern boundary because of a landform with higher
elevation than the rest of the project area. These areas were considered to have a higher
likelihood of containing buried resources than the center of the project area. The center
section of the project area was surveyed at an interval of 100 to 130 meters (300 to 400 feet)
because of low-lying topography.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted on six hectares (15 acres) of property associated with the proposed development
of a new Conroe ISD elementary school in Montgomery County, Texas. Initial investigation
consisted of a background literature and site file search to identify the presence of recorded
sites in close proximity to the current proposed project. No previously recorded sites were
located within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area or within the surveyed
area.

9

Field investigation consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing within the
project area. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of a total of 27 shovel tests
within the project APE. An additional six shovel tests were attempted but not excavated due
to visible disturbance and/or inundation.
The results of the intensive pedestrian survey indicate that no previously unidentified
cultural resources are located within the surveyed area and no newly identified
archaeological sites of historic structures were recorded. Based on these results, HRA Gray
& Pape recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
