The Clovis Paleoindian Occupation of Texas:
Results of the Texas Clovis Fluted Poh t Survey
David Y. Meltzer

ABSTRACT
A survey of private and public archeological collections in
Texas produced data on 205 Clovis points. Areas with high densities of Clovis points are the High Plains, or Llano Estacado, the
Balcones fault zone, and the eastern and coastal region of the state.
Areas low in Clovis points are the lower Plains and the Trans-Pecos
region. These patterns result from differences in site exposure and
from the differences in the amount of careful archeological work in
the areas, but may also reveal differential land use by Clovis groups.
Analysis of functional and technological attributes in this sample of
points convirms that Clovis adaptive strategies varied across the
state and indicates the strong possibility that Texas Clovis points
had multiple uses: many functioned as knives, and some may not
have been projectiles at all.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most striking facets of the North American Clovis Paleoindian
archeological record is that it comprises largely isolated fluted points not in site
contexts. What is true of North America is true of Texas as well; here the Clovis
archeological record is dominated by scattered, isolated surface finds (Hester
1977; Mallouf 1981). In general, Clovis Paleoindian sites are uncommon,
though admittedly less so on the western Plains than in the forests of eastern
North America (Meltzer 1984).
This pattern may be the result of 10,000 years of erosion and other natural
and cultural destructive processes that have irretrievably drowned, buried,
dispersed, or destroyed the visibility, integrity, or cohesion of later Pleistocene
Clovis sites. Certainly one cannot account for the Clovis archeological record
without recognition of these processes.
Yet there is a second, more intriguing possibility to consider: it is
conceivable that the archeological record of isolated fluted points accurately
reflects the structure of Clovis subsistence and settlement strategies. Clovis
groups may have participated only rarely in the highly structured spatial behavior
that produces sites. This possibility raises some significant questions: what
kinds of adaptive strategies produce an archeological record that comprises
primarily largely scattered isolated points?, why no other tools?, and what

implications does this have for Clovis subsistence strategies? are just a few.
Clovis studies have not yet reached the point where answers to these questions are at hand, but although as yet unanswered, they guide researchers to potentially valuable lines of inquiry. For one thing, they highlight the importance of
careful study and analysis of all the Clovis fluted points that litter the landscape.
This consideration prompted the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey.
Studies of fluted points are not uncommon, particularly in the eastern
United States (for the most recent ones see Brennan 1982; Seeman and Prufer
1982). However, with the notable exception of an unpublished paper prepared
some 20 years ago (Hester 1967) and a survey of the published record for Clovis
points (Prewitt 1985), recent systematic studies do not exist for Texas or, for
that matter, for any area west of the Mississippi. Indeed, as Dee Ann Story has
noted (1981:142), our views of the Clovis occupation of Texas are based more
on speculation than on substantive information; there has not been in the last
two decades a systematic study or even inventory of Texas Clovis materials. So
the first aim of this study was to compile information on the amount and distribution of Clovis remains from Texas, beginning with Clovis points, their most
readily identified element.
Just as there is no current inventory of Texas Clovis points, so too there is
no study of their typology. It has long been known that Clovis points show
marked morphological variability across the continent and even in single sites
(e.g. Haury 1953, Haury et al. 1959). But what causes the variability, whether
in use or in style, is unclear and probably will not become clear until, as Alex
Krieger noted (1954), the problem is addressed on a large scale through statewide
and state-by-state detailed typological studies of Clovis points. So the second
aim of this study is to document the morphological diversity in Texas Clovis
points. In order to insure that this effort was not constrained by the writerâs or
othersâ biases as to what constitues a Clovis fluted point, the analysis included
all non-Folsom fluted points. Basally thinned Plainview points were not included in the study.
Such a study has implications that go beyond simply detailing point
diversity. Take, for example, the matter of Clovis subsistence strategies. Although Clovis groups probably scavenged or occasionally killed mammoths,
there is no evidence that Clovis groups were solely specialized big game hunters.
But this is not surprising. As a host of authors have argued (Bryant and Sharer
1977; Collins 1976; Johnson 1977; Johnson and HoUiday 1984; Meltzer 1984;
Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1981), there are good theoretical reasons to hypothesize that Clovis groups probably practiced a mixed foraging or
generalized hunting and gathering, adaptation rather than a specialized big-gamehunting adaptation.
This suggestion, in turn, has significant archeological implications. It has
been assumed that the Clovis archeological record of scattered, isolated surface
finds represents the remains of highly mobile hunters. Yet the points themselves are rarely found in unequivocal association with faunal remains (Hester
1977:173). More important, the points may not be hunting implements. So the

third aim of this study was to detect whether these points were used as anything
but projectiles and whether their distribution, when combined with paleoenvironmental data, would provide a glimpse into the foraging and gathering strategies in which they once functioned.
It was for these reasons that the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey was
undertaken.
THE TEXAS CLOVIS FLUTED POINT SURVEY:
METHODS AND BIASES
Any research project that aims to gather data on the abundance, distribution,
and diversity of Texas Clovis fluted points faces certain obstacles. The distribution of Clovis points in public and private collections is similar to their distribution in archeological settings, and the points often occur in isolation without meaningful contexts, so few archeologists are able to see many of them.
For these reasons collection of data for this study moved along two fronts.
All available published information on Texas Clovis points was recorded,
and as many points in private and public collections as was feasible were examined. These collections include the Haynes Collection at the Institute for the
Study of the Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, the collections at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of
Texas at Austin, the Bissell Collection at the Museum of the Southwest in Midland, and the collections at the Plains/Panhandle Historical Society Museum in
Canyon. These collections included Clovis points from several sites, though it
should be noted that many of the Clovis points found in archeological sites in
Texas are intrusive. See, for example, the Clovis points at the Crockett Gardens
(Hays 1982), Doering (Wheat 1953), 41SP69 (Chandler 1982), Fred Yarbrough
(Johnson 1961), La Perdida (Weir 1956), Meier (Meier and Hester 1972, 1976),
and Obshner sites (Crook and Harris 1955), to name just a few that have been
published.
In addition, in order to obtain information from unpublished collections
throughout the state a questionnaire was sent to the membership of the Texas
Archeological Society in the April and July 1985 (Vol. 29, Nos. 2 and 3) issues
of the Societyâs newsletter Texas Archeology. This source provided the bulk of
the data used here.
Any conclusions drawn in this kind of analysis are constrained by the degree
to which the sample is reliable and representative. It is therefore important to
identify and assess potential biases in the data that might skew interpretations.
Use of published data on Clovis points is complicated by two potential
biases. First, because not all researchers are aware of what kind of information is
useful, data needed for my purposes were not always available. This bias should
not unduly influence the analysis, since most published reports provide data on
point location, size, and shape, as well as a photograph or drawing.
Second, the published record of Clovis material tends to emphasize areas
where more extensive archeologieal survey and fieldwark have been conducted.
Indeed, a map of Clovis finds based solely on the published record is likely to

30

conform closely to the distribution of major reservoir and highway projects
undertaken in the last few decades. This bias is largely offset by the inclusion of
unpublished data from private collections.
Data gathered by questionnaire through the TAS Newsletter comes from an
extensive network linking avocational and professional archeologists throughout
the state, but it has its own biases. There are the usual problems that plague
any effort to gather data by questionnaire. Will everyone with Clovis points respond to the survey? Will they fill out the forms correctly? Collecting data by
questionnaire limits the quantity of information received for each artifact.
There are also limits on the kind of data available. It would be wholly
unreasonable to burden survey participants with an extensive list of functional,
morphological, and technological attributes to identify, measure, and calculate
and to demand precise drawings and technical quality photographs. The information requested in the questionnaire was therefore kept to a minimum, focusing
largely on the measurement and description of attributes that carry important
functional, technological, and stylistic information (Meltzer 1984). A copy of
the survey form is included here as Appendix A, and the data compiled in this
study are available from the author. (Any readers who have data on so-far-unreported Texas Clovis points are urged to fill out this form or a facsimile and send
it to me.)
There are additional more subtle biases that attend the use of this data set.
For one, the questionnaire directly reached only TAS members. Yet, as Elton
Prewitt has observed (1985), nonmembers--casual collectors and "hard-core"
pothunters--probably control the bulk of the private archeological collections in
Texas. Although many TAS members worked to record Clovis points in
undocumented collections of nonmembers, most of that material remains
unrecorded. (Let me urge again the continued effort to document the collections
that exist in the archeological twilight zone.)
Collections of TAS members also may not comprise a representative
sample of the Clovis archeological resources of Texas. Visibility of archeological remains varies by region, according to several factors, including vegetation, degree and kind of cultivation, the age of the surface, rate of erosion, and
so on. Similarly, the intensity of collecting and survey also varies by region.
Because of these biases, blank spots on an archeological distribution map may
not reflect the absence of Clovis occupation, but rather the absence of archeological collections or fieldwork. Similarly, areas of high density may well reflect
particularly vigorous collectors rather than abundant archeological resources. Interpreting the distribution of Clovis material is complicated by the fact that not
all parts of the state have been under the same degree of archeological scrutiny.
Although one can never wholly correct for these biases, they are offset to a
certain extent here; part of the bias is eliminated by the splendid and enthusiastic
participation of TAS members in completing the survey forms. Equally important, certain biases will fade out as "background noise," owing to the spatial unit
(the county) used in the analysis of the distribution of Clovis points. Using the
county of discovery as the basic unit for spatial patterning compensates for often

Meltzer m Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

incomplete data on the precise location of many Clovis points, insuring that uneven data do not unduly influence the analysis.
More specific matters of bias are addressed in the discussion of spatial
patterning below.

THE TEXAS CLOVIS FLUTED POINT SURVEY: RESULTS
The Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey produced data on 205 points,
distributed rather evenly among 95 (37 percent) of the 254 counties in Texas
~able 1, Figures 1, 2). This number is probably on the low side, but what

proportion of Texas Clovis materials it represents cannot be determined in any
statistical sense since so tittle is known of the relevant population parameters.
However, although 205 points may be only a fraction of the points
recovered or recoverable in Texas, it nonetheless becomes a substantial sample
when compared with tallies from two other surveys of Texas Clovis fluted
points. Systematic examination by Prewitt (1985) of 428 published and unpubfished site, survey, and salvage reports for the state of Texas resulted in a
list of 14 sites and 16 Clovis points. Thomas R. Hester has made a distributional study of Paleoindian points in Texas (Hester 1967), based on an inventory
of the published record and public and private collections. He recorded 50 Clovis
fluted points scattered among 31 counties in Texas. Although the Texas Clovis
Fluted Point Survey may not have produced data on all Texas Clovis points, the
sample is at least a fourfold increase over previous tallies.

The Spatial Distribution of Texas Clovis Points

Of the 95 Texas counties with Clovis points, only three have produced more
than six points: two of these, Gaines and Crosby, are High Plains counties, and
the third, Jefferson, is a coastal county. In Crosby and Jefferson counties the
points come from relatively small sites, 41CB64 and McFaddin Beach respectively. In Gaines County the points were not in site contexts but were dispersed
throughout the county. The large number of points from Gaines county is apparently due to the fact that this county has been under more intense scrutiny
than have other areas of comparable size.
The three counties just mentioned notwithstanding, Clovis points are fairly
evenly distributed. Indeed, the average comes to roughly two points per county,
though the statistical mean in this case is somewhat misleading, inflated as it is
by the high numbers of points in the three counties mentioned. The modal
tendency in this case is more informative (Table 2); 51 of file 95 counties (54
percent) have only one Clovis point, and 87 percent (82/95) of all counties with
points have three or less.

Oddly enough, not only do isolated Clovis points fail to cluster
significantly in any one county, they do not even appear to reflect the
distribution of Paleoindian sites--sites dated between 12,000 and 7000 B.P.
(Biessart et al. 1985:40) across the state. A comparison of the distribution by
county of isolated Clovis points with the distribution of Paleoindian sites (data
from Biessart et al. 1985:107-200, 203-214) reveals that there is no concordance
or correlation between the two (Kendallâs W=.0001 [n=95]; Kendallâs W was used
in this instance because of the large number of tied observations). For comparative purposes, there was nearly complete agreement in the frequency distribution
by county of Paleoindian sites and the total number of sites of any age (Kendallâs
W=.957 [n=95]). The distributions of isolated Clovis points and Paleoindian
sites by county across the state are unrelated.
One must exercise caution in drawing any conclusions of great moment
from this result, given the nature of the data being analyzed and possible distributional biases in the record of Paleoindian sites. But it is worth speculating
that this analysis lends credence to the suggestion raised earlier that there might
be something distinctive about the distribution of isolated Clovis points in comparison with the distribution of later Paleoindian material. Perhaps this in turn
indicates differences in settlement systems through the Paleoindian period.
Obviously this possibility warrants further inquiry, though such inquiry is
beyond the scope of this paper.
The number of points by county is also unrelated to collector activity, as
seen in a comparison of the distribution of Clovis points and collector activity

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

(where TAS members reside is used as a proxy measure of where collecting
activity takes place, on the assumption that collecting tends to be done near
where one lives). If the distribution of points were a function of the intensity of
collector efforts (Hester 1977:173; Lepper 1983), then a map of the distribution
of Clovis points by county 0~igures 1, 2) would correspond to a map of TAS
aember residence by county ~igures 3, 4, Table 3 ). Comparison of Figures

Figure 3.

1 and 2 with Figures 3 and 4 shows little overlap between Clovis finds and
membership. The two distributions are statistically unrelated(Kendallâs W=.221
for counties with both points and TAS members In=61]; Kendallâs W=.179 for
all counties with either TAS members or points [n=171]); one would expect the
reverse if the number of Clovis points were a function of the amount of

collecting activity. There may be a relationship between the distribution of
archeological finds and collector activity, but the relationship is not evident in
this analysis. Low numbers of fluted points in counties of high membership
density (e.g. Bexar, Dallas, Denton, Harris, and Travis) are probably not a result
of recovery bias. But although the presence or abundance of Clovis points per
county is not a direct function of the presence or abundance of TAS members per
county, there still remains the possibility that the absence of TAS members in a
given county may account for an absence of Clovis points in that county.

In a plot of Clovis points by county certain broad patterns emerge. Points are
found from southernmost Cameron County to far northwestern Dallam County, so
in a general sense they cover the entire state of Texas. But they do not cover the state
evenly; there are clusters of contiguous counties with and without Clovis points.
Briefly, the pattems are summarized below (see Figures 1 and 2). Regional designations Figure 5) follow the geographic and cultural boundaries in The Handbook of
Texas Archeology (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954).
1) There is an apparent concentration of Clovis points in the Plains/Panhandle
region, specifically in the Llano Estacado or High Plains of West Texas (Brown et
al. 1982).
2) There is a scarcity of Clovis points on the lower Plains (Brown et al. 1982);
Clovis points are uncommon in a north-south swath 100-km (60-mile) wide and
more than 600 km (400 miles) long just to the east of and below the Llano Estacado.
3) The Trans-Pecos region is lowest in the state in both abundance and density
of Clovis points.

4) Clovis points occur frequently and are rather evenly distributed in a slightly
elliptical pattern of contiguous counties extending through Central Texas, from
Uvalde County in the southwest to Bell County in Central Texas.
5) Clovis points appear at first glance to be relatively scarce in the coastal
region, but some concentrations are found there together with some areas of
apparent high versus low densities of point materials.
6) An apparent abundance of Clovis points has been recorded from East Texas.

The density of Clovis material (Table 4) in the Plains/Panhandle area of West
Texas is the highest, by an order of magnitude, in the state. Archeological visibility
in the area is high, owing to low vegetation cover and extensive tracts of wheat, grain
sorghum, and cotton (Arbingast et al. 1976). S urveys and collecting for Paleoindian
remains in the area have also been more common here than in other parts of the state.
It was on the Llano Estacado that the Clovis occupation was first discovered and
systematically described (e.g. Howard 1935, Sellards 1952). Since that time the
area has been scrutinized by archeologists on almost an annual basis.
As a result, there is an extensive record of Clovis material from the High Plains,
indeed over one-third (73/205) of all Clovis points in Texas come from this region.
In late Pleistocene times the area was undergoing substantial vegetational change.
As parklands gave way to extensive grasslands (Bryant and Holloway 1985), a wide
variety of Plains floral and faunal resources would have been available, particularly
in well-watered settings. Based on both site data and admittedly sketchy information from this survey, Clovis points in this area are found near fossil lakes and
marshes and, of course, in association with the draws that today are dry but in the
Pleistocene carried substantial amounts of water, perhaps in the form of beaded
lakes, across the Plains.

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

Lithic resources on the Llano Estacado, an area blanketed by extensive Quaternary deposits, are limited to highly localized outcrops or exposures of the Caprock
along its west, north, and east margins (Collins 1971:92; Hester 1975:254; Johnson
and Holliday 1984:67; Holliday and Welty 1981:202). Clovis projectile points
from the Llano Estacado recorded by the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey were
made from a variety of rocks including Alibates agatized dolomite, Tecovas (or
Quitaque) jasper, Edwards chert, and, in the northern counties, Dakota quartzite
(see also Hester 1975:254,255). Unidentified cherts cover a veritable rainbow of
colors and a wide range of quality, but no points made from obsidian were recorded
(see also Holliday and Welty 1981).
But more important than the diversity of the raw material is the condition of the
Clovis points. Johnson and Holliday (1984:67) have suggested that the limited
availability of lithic resources on the Llano Estacado led Paleoindian groups to
conserve their raw materials through reworking and reuse of artifacts. The data
gathered here support this suggestion.
The relative scarcity (Table 4) of Clovis points in a broad, north-south swath
on the lower Plains (east of and below the Caprock of the Llano Estacado is
intriguing, but the lack of Clovis debris may be more apparent than real. Examination of the data (Table 4, Figures 3, 4) reveals that there are few TAS members living
in this 100-to-660-km (60-to-400- mile) corridor, which stretches from Hall and
Childress counties in the north to Sterling and Coke counties in the south. The
rolling plains and mesquite savanna here probably have not been as intensely
surveyed as have other parts of the state.
Perhaps equally important is the fact that even Archaic sites in this corridor are
covered by thick overburden. The most striking example of this is a series of hearths
associated with chipping debris buried some 8 to 9 meters (24 to 27 ft.) below the
surface in the Elm Creek Drainage (see Ray 1930:50, 51; Ray 1940; Figure 6). If
this extraordinary report is correct, it demonstrates the potential depth of deposits
in the alluvial valleys of the region. In these areas of deeply buried Pleistocene
deposits Clovis materials will be less visible than in other parts of the state.
Obviously, further work is needed on the surface age and amount of deposition in
this corridor.
Fewer Clovis points have been found in the Trans-Pecos region than in any
other part of Texas and, given its size, these few points translate into an extremely
low Clovis point density (Table 4). The significance of the low frequency and density figures is unclear. It is conceivable that Clovis materials are there in abundance
but simply havenot yetbeen found, since surface visibility is low from the TransPecos eastward onto the Edwards Plateau, a region where livestock ranches
occupy large tracts of desert scrub and (further east)juniper-oak-mesquite savanna.
In addition, many large tracts in this area simply have not been surveyed for
archeologieal remains (Hedrick 1985) and research in the area has been concentrated on sites of later periods (Hester 1967). So the blank spot on the map may result
from incomplete sampling.
Nonetheless, it is possible that Clovis groups did not occupy the area in great
numbers. Clovis Paleoindian remains are scarce even in the more intensely surveyed parts of the Trans-Pecos (Collins 1976; Mallouf 1981, !985), suggesting that

44

Texas Archeological Society

further survey work may not produce a substantial addition to the Clovis record.
Perhaps this should be expected, for, owing to severe environmental constraints on
human adaptation, later Paleoindian and prehistoric occupations are only "scattered
thinly" throughout the region (Mallouf 1985:100). During the terminal Pleistocene
the Trans-Pecos had more water and was more habitable than it is today (Mallouf
1985:16), but theprocess of PoStglacial warming and drying was already underway,
and by latest Pleistocene times the area probably could support only the kinds of
dispersed and fairly mobile populations that occupied the Trans-Pecos in later
periods (MaUouf 1981:134).
The distribution of Clovis points through Central Texas forms an ellipse along
the east edge of the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Fault zone. During the glacial
period the area supported a mosaic of deciduous and boreal plant and animal taxa,
but toward the end of the Pleistocene there was steady warming with a corresponding reduction in forest cover and expansion of grasslands (Bryant and Shafer
1977:14). The Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey produced little data on the precise
settings of Clovis point finds, but the evidence suggests that most were found along
streams or on terraces. Prewitt (1984:8) found a similar pattern in the San Gabriel
drainage where most sites were on terraces near springs.
In fact, S hiner (1983) has observed that many Clovis and later Paleoindian sites
and high concentrations of Paleoindian lithic materials occur along the Balcones
Fault zone, particularly at spring heads that emerge at intervals where aquifers
breach the fault. He infers that the high density of archeological material at these
sites is the result of continuous occupation by Clovis groups who exploited the
water, plant, and animal resources that were available yearround at the springs
(Shiner 1983:5, 6). Shinerâs suggestion is a provocative departure from the common belief that Clovis groups were highly mobile, and appears to rest on sound theoretical principles: sedentary occupations, although uncommon among hunting and
gathering groups, are possible when resources in a small area are abundant, reliable,
and readily available.
However, an additional, equally important resource occurs along the Balcones
Fault zone that influences the character of the archeological record, raising a
question as to the validity of the evidence for a sedentary occupation. The same
geological process that created the springs also exposed extensive deposits of chertbearing Cretaceous limestone of the Fredericksburg Group, producing an abundance of high-quality chert in the area. Data collected by the Texas Clovis Fluted
Point Survey on rock types used in point manufacture in this area confirm the dominance of the local Edwards cherts. It would be unreasonable to suggest that Clovis
settlement patterns were determined by the presence of chert deposits, but certainly
the chert deposits would have been a focal point in the settlement system and, more
important, would have survived as a highly visible, spatially concentrated component of the archeological record.
When stone is abundant, a substantial archeological record can be produced by
a series of brief periods of occupation. Repeated visits to quarry or spring sites will
produce interleaved components that, in terms of the sheer amount ofarcheological
debris, mimic a single more sedentary, longterm occupation. Confirmation of the

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

45

provocative suggestion that Clovis and later Paleoindian groups were almost
sedentary (Shiner 1983:6) can be achieved only by an empirical demonstration that
goes beyond the observation that lithic materials are there in abundance. Johnson
and Holliday (1984:67) reach a similar conclusion.
The figures (Table 4) for the abundance and density of Clovis materials on the
Coastal Plain are relatively high. Roughly half of the points came from McFaddin
Beach in Jefferson County, an extensively collected locality that has yielded a
startling diversity of projectile points and a late Pleistocene fauna (Long 1977).
Although it is now on the shoreline, it was far inland during Clovis times, on a vast
plain crossed by the Sabine-Neches, Trinity, and smaller rivers (Long 1977:6).
Artifacts are not in situ, but are found on the modem beach, where they have been
deposited after being eroded out offshore and carried in by currents.
Like the McFaddin Beach material, most of the Clovis points recorded from the
coastal region were found in counties bordering the Gulf (Calhoun, Cameron,
Jefferson, San Patricio), often just inland, on the beaches, or by drainages that run
into the Gulf (e.g. Chandler 1982). The modem Gulf beaches are a Holocene
phenomenon, representing the high water mark ofpostglacial sea levels; the Pleistocene coastline is under water. So any association between Clovis points and modem
beaches is significant only for what that association reveals about Clovis materials
now lying beneath coastal waters on drowned river terraces and other landforms.
Unfortunately, the paleoenvironmental habitat of the Coastal Plain during the
Pleistocene is virtually unknown (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
So the relatively high density of Clovis remains in the coastal region (Table 4)
is both an underestimate and an overestimate: an underestimate insofar as there is
probably a substantial coastal Clovis record under the Gulf waters; an overestimate
insofar as the count from McFaddin Beach significantly inflates the density figure
for Clovis remains from the inland counties (Bee, Harris, Victoria) of the presentday coastal region, which, in Pleistocene times, were even farther inland. For if the
density of Clovis remains is calculated for only the inland counties, the figure--3.9
points in 2,600,0000 hectares (10,000 square miles)--is less than half the figure
for the entire coastal region.
It is relevant to add here that although the bulk of the Clovis points from the
coastal region are made of Edwards chert from Central Texas (Long 1977), Clovis
groups may not have traveled to the Central Texas outcrops for their stone supplies.
Several rivers that empty into the Gulf traverse the Edwards Plateau and the
Balcones Escarpment, transporting cobbles and gravels of Edwards chert downriver. Although these gravels rarely reach the Gulf Coast (Story 1986), Edwards
chert used on the coast may have been transported substantial distances from the
outcrops by nonhuman means. It would be valuable to determine whether Clovis
lithic debris in Coastal Plain sites shows evidence of rounded, water-smoothed, or
pebblelike cortical flakes (Meltzer 1985).
A Clovis point made of Alibates "flint" that has been reported from McFaddin
Beach (Long 1977:7) shows little of the wear and attrition that is routinely seen on
points that are far from their sources, so it seems oddly out of place on the Gulf Coast
of Texas.

The pine and oak forests of East Texas, particularly those in Marion, Harrison,
and Panola counties along the Louisiana border, have yielded a number of Clovis
points. But 64 percent (14) of the 22 Clovis points from the area recorded in this
survey have only minimal documentation, and eight of those have no documentation at all (Hayner 1955). In 1955, using Suhm, Krieger, and Jelksâs just-published
Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology (1954), Hayner (1955) identified
eight Clovis points from Marion and Harrison counties, together with 23 Meserve
points that he thought, based on the presence of flutes (Hayner 1955:241), were
reworked from original Clovis forms. Unfortunately, none of the pmlgorted Clovis
points are illustrated. There is no reason for immediate rejection of Haynerâs point
identifications, but there is room for question. The three Marion County points were
purchased from farm hands and could not be documented. Moreover, since the
frequency of points for these two counties is rather high (Table 1), a substantial
number of Clovis points should have turned up in the 30 years between his report
(Hayner 1955) and this survey. Recent work in this area has yielded but one Clovis
point, certainly not what is expected from Haynerâs report, so these data should be
used with caution.
At the time of the Clovis occupation the paleoenvironmental setting of East
Texas was probably a complex woodland with a wide variety of deciduous trees and
perhaps an occasional boreal species such as spruce. In all likelihood this forest did
not support large herds of megafauna (Shafer 1977), save on the north and east
edges, where the forest gave way to prairie (Story 1981). Clovis points, together
with later Paleoindian material, have been reported from along the North Sulphur
River in Lamar County, in an area that has yielded and continues to yield fossils of
late Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, horse, and bison, but
there are no associations of Clovis points with the megafauna. If we accept Shaferâs
(1977) argument (independently developed in Meltzer and Smith 1986), it is likely
that any such associations will be rare in this area. Clovis groups in complex forests
were probably generalized foragers.
Function, Technology, and Style in Texas Clovis Points
The patterning evident in the distribution of Texas Clovis points raises an
interesting question. Are there corresponding differences in point style, function,
or technology? Based solely on paleoenvironmental data, one would anticipate
significant differences between the Clovis occupations of, for instance, the Llano
Estacado andthoseofthe forestedeast (Bryant and Shafer 1977). Those differences
could be manifested in any of a number of ways, including point function or use,
technology, and style.
FuncHon

Ideally, a study of the function of Texas Clovis fluted points would include
analysis of macro- and microwear patterning. Unfortunately, such analysis was
impossible, since most of the data were compiled from questionnaires. This constraint does not preclude the possibility of making statements about tool use, but
instead forces the consideration of alternative, less direct clues for information on

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

wear, such as grinding, breakage, and reworking patterns.
In keeping with pattems in other regions--grinding is present on virtually all
Clovis points, east and west (Meltzer 1984)--basal and lateral grinding was
reported on 96 percent (147/153) of the points recorded for the survey. Grinding is
an important element of point function, for it prolongs the life of hafts by preventing
the edges of hafted tools from cutting the bindings that attach the tools to the shafts.
Judge (1973:263, 264) has suggested that the purpose of grinding---especially
lateral grinding--is to allow the final fitting of the point to the haft, and in their
studies of the manufacturing process of Folsom points, Tunnell (1977) and others
(e.g. Frison and Bradley 1980) support this suggestion, showing that grinding is one
of the last stages in point production.
It has also been argued (Frison 1978; Goodyear 1974) that heavy basal and
especially lateral grinding is necessary where a biface is used for cutting. When a
halted tool is used as a knife, the haft area is under extreme lateral stress while the
blade is being worked back and forth in the process of cutting, so butchering tools
require strong hafts with heavy binding (Frison 1978:336).
By contrast, a projectile does not make the same demands on the haft, for the
projectile haft has only a split second of critical use-life. The stress in a projectile
is directed predominantly against its base, making basal--but not lateral--grinding
a critical need for effective use.
Heavy lateral and basal grinding on Texas Clovis points suggests their use as
knives as well as projectiles. This is not to suggest that all laterally ground points
are knives. The fact that heavy lateral grinding would enhance the value of these
points as knives does not mean that it did serve that purpose. Rather, instances of
heavy lateral grinding on projectiles are important because they indicate that the
points may have been used as knives as well as, or instead of, projectiles. But it
should be noted here that the sharp-bladed points from the Casper site, a Hell Gap
bison kill in Wyoming, although heavily ground along their lateral edges, were used
as projectiles and have impact fractures, and they have no wear patterns indicating
their use as knives (Frison 1974:71, 82).
Analysis of the breakage patterns in Texas Clovis fluted points revealed that
only 37 percent (66/180) were complete; the remaining 63 percent (114/180) were
broken (Table 5). This frequency of breakage is comparable to fluted point samples
from other areas (Meltzer n.d.). If anything, the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey
recorded fewer broken points than would be expected in a sample of this size, but
it is not suprising when the difficulty of identifying Clovis fragments is considered.
Although 10 breakage categories used here are largely morphological (a
limitation imposed by the available data), they do have implications for technology
and use. Broken tips, bases, and comers, for example, result from actions that occur
when points are unprotected by hafts, during both manufacture and use; tips and
corners are structurally the weakest parts of a point. In contrast, lateral snaps,
reworking, and impact fractures most often occur when the points are buried in the
hafts and commonly result from actions that occur while the points are in use. The
pattern of use-related breaks supports the suggestion that these points may also have
been knives, and reveals variation across Texas in point use.

Lateral snaps (Figure 6) were the most common breaks recorded in this sample
(Table 5) and also in a larger sample of points from the eastern United States
(Meltzer n.d.). A lateral snap commonly results when an artifact is bowed beyond
the limits of its tensile strength (Frison and Bradley 1980:43), which can happen
during either manufacture or use (Bradley 1974:197). In the Texas Clovis Fluted
Point Survey sample nearly all of the snaps occur at the furthest extent of fluting

and lateral grinding, indicating that the breaks occurred during use, while the basal
parts of the points were anchored in hafts.
Determining the kind of use that caused these breaks is not a simple task, since
lateral snaps can result from use of hafted points as either projectiles or knives
(Frison 1974:90, 91; Frison and Stanford 1982:105-107; Purdy 1975:134, 135).
However, breakage patterns in Hell Gap projectile points from the Casper site
(Frison 1974:72-80) shed some light on this matter. Frison (1974:90, 91) convincingly argues, based on independent evidence including site context and impact fractures, that the Hell Gap points are projectiles that snapped as a result of impact and
shock. Examination of the Hell Gap points revealed that less than 15 percent broke
at the widest part of the blade, which would coincide with the furthest extent of the
haft; most snapped across the lower part of the tang, which would have been buffed
deep inside the haft; and a smaller percentage snapped above the haft (Frison
1974:90).
Without claiming that this pattern is universal, for much more data and,
perhaps, experimentation are needed for such a claim, it is reasonable to assume that
all lateral snaps caused by impact and end shock do not occur at the same place on
the point, and only rarely do they occur at the distal end of the haft. Based on that
assumption, breakage patterns in the Texas Clovis points take on some significance,
since in that sample lateral snaps almost uniformly occur at or just beyond the distal
end of the haft. In other words, although impact-caused snaps occur at virtually any
place along the point--but most often within the haft--Texas Clovis points
routinely broke at or just beyond the edges of the hafts. This is the break pattern that
would be expected in points that were levered in hafts. If the levering that produced
these breaks occurred when the hafted points were used as knives, it can be inferred
from their breakage patterns that the Texas Clovis points were multifunctional.
Judge (1974:126) has suggested that resharpening and reworking is indicative
of multifunctional points. These attributes also occur in areas where stone supplies
are scarce. Several reworked points were recorded in the Texas Clovis Fluted Point
Survey (Figure 7), but 12.8 percent (23/180) is probably low, since in many cases
it was dificult to determine from the sketches and photographs whether a point had
been reworked or resharpened. The obvious clues: abrupt changes in thickness,
interruptions in the flaking patterns, distal ends that taper asymmetrically in outline
and cross section, and remnants of breaks (Bradley 1982:196), were not always
evident. When there was any doubt, points were not included in the reworked
category.
Reworking generally took place while the points were still set in the hafts.
Statistical analysis, using the T test, indicates that width and basal width are
identical in points with and without reworking (Table 6, a, b), but that points with
and without reworking differ significantly in their overall length (Table 6, c),
clearly demonstrating that reworking affects the point length. The constancy in
width of points with and without reworking is explained by the fact that reworking
took place while the points were still socketed in the hafts, so the sides were
protected.

This finding is corroborated by Bradley (1982:196, 197), who states that the
width:length ratios might be useful for distinguishing points with reworking from
those without. Statistical analyses of Texas Clovis data indicate a significant
difference in the width:length and base-width:length ratios of points with and
without reworking (Table 6, d, e). Overall, width:length ratios are higher in points
that have been reworked (Figure 8). These data indicate that it may be possible to
use measures of point width:length ratios to determine reworking when direct
examination of the points is not possible.
Impact fractures, "small to medium-sized flakes originating at the tip of the
point and extending along the face of the blade toward the base" (Wheat 1979:90;
Bradley 1974:194), are rare in the Texas Clovis point survey (seen on only two
percent of the points). Impact fractures (Figure 9) result from the kind of compressive stress that would be applied to the distal end of a point that made forceful impact
with a highly dense material such as bone. Frison (1978:153, 173) indicates that
such fractures can result from the use of both hand-thrust spears and thrown spears,
suggesting that the angle of attack and impact is as important as the degree of force
in producing this breakage pattern. However, experimental work by Dennis Stanford (1985) indicates that hand-thrust spears may not produce sufficient force to
cause impact fractures, so more work is needed on this problem.

Impact fractures are common in Plains Paleoindian and Archaic bison-kill sites
(e.g. Bradley 1982:197; Frison 1974:83; Frison 1978:125, 153, 167, 173, 200;
Frison et al. 1976:44-46; Stanford 1978:92; Wheat 1979:90), even in those that
predate the earliest record--ca. 9000 B.P. (Wheat 1979:135, 136)--for use of the
atlatl. Yet impact fractures are rare, often absent, in most of the classic Clovis

(Sellards 1952:25, 26), and Naco (Haury 1953:8, 9).
The scarcity of impact fractures among Texas Clovis points again implies that
few of these points were in fact used as projectile points. All points with impact
fractures have been subsequently reworked and repointed, as is common on bisonkill sites (Frison 1978:200; Wheat 1979:90).
Points from the Llano Estacado have been reworked more often (20 percent)
than have points from any other region, and impact fractures on Clovis points occur
only in those from the Llano Estacado. This hints at possible functional differences
in Clovis points from different parts of the state, differences that could be easily
explored by analyzing breakage patterns by regions (Table 7),

distinguishing between use and nonuse breaks (see Bradley 1982:197, 198 for a
similar discussion).
Chi-square analysis of the data in Table 7 indicates that breakage patterns do
not differ significantly by region, but there is some variation in certain regions.
Adjusted residual values 0~veritt 1977), read as standard normal deviates, reveal
that two regions vary significantly from the expected pattern: in the PanhandlePlains region, use breaks occur more often than would be expected by chance
(adjusted residual value=2.12, p=0.0170). By contrast, in the coastal region, whole
points and points with nonuse breaks occur more often than would be expected by
chance (adjusted residual value=2.73, p=0.0032).
Those data indicate that reworking is relatively high among points from the
High Plains and further corroborates the suggestion by Johnson and Holliday (1984)
that a shortage of abundant raw material in the region led to use and reuse of the
existing supplies. The disproportionately high number of whole points and nonuse
breaks from the coastal region may be a function of more abundant raw material, a
tendency to collect and record data only on complete or nearly complete points, or

54

different uses for these points.
One feature not identified in Table 5, but worthy of mention, is that none of the
points examined had the needle-sharp tips and blade edges characteristic of points
in kill sites Orison 1978:337,338).

Based on the heavy grinding of the edges and bases of these points, the high
frequency of lateral snaps and bend breaks, the scarcity of impact fractures, the
incidence of reworking, and the absence of sharp tips or blades, there is a strong
possibility that many of the Texas Clovis fluted points had multiple uses as projectiles and as long-handled hafted knives. Following a different line of argument,
Judge (1973:128, 1974:126) reaches a similar conclusion, but it is here suggested
that at least some of the High Plains Clovis points were used primarily as projectiles,
as evidenced by substantial impact fractures. This conclusion must be considered
tentative, based as it is on only indirect evidence of tool function. Further intensive
work is needed on wear patterns on Texas Clovis points.
Technology
Only half a dozen points recorded in the Texas Clovis Fluted Point S urvey
were manufacturing rejects, so few direct clues were provided concerning Clovis
point technology and manufacturing processes. It is curious that so few unfinished
points or preforms were recorded by the survey; the scarcity of unfinished Clovis
points from Central Texas is especially puzzling since point production often took
place at stone sources, resulting in deposits of manufacturing debris and failed
efforts. In areas without abundant stone sources, manufacturing failures probably

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

55

were carried along and used as other tools in order to stretch the supply of the scarce
resource. So it is likely that careful examination of stone source localities will yield
evidence of point manufacture as well as a record of used-up points abandoned at
the quarry after replenishment of the stone supply (e.g. Gramly 1980).
There are three different techniques for fluting projectile points: (1)
Enterline or multiple fluting using guide flakes, (2) straight-based fluting from a
beveled edge, and (3) fluting from a prepared nipple or striking platform (see
Meltzer 1984:277-282 for a detailed discussion). Multiple fluting of the sort that
produces three flute scars--two of which guide the third and main flute--appears
to be characteristic of reworking and refluting or perhaps of less proficiency on the
part of the knapper. In any case, multiple fluting--three or more flutes--is rare in
Texas Clovis points (Table 8).

Most Texas Clovis fluted points are singly fluted. Single flutes can be produced
from a straight base or from an isolated raised platform. Fluting from a straight base
begins with the preparation of a striking platform by beveling one of the faces of the
base. On this prepared platform a blow is struck, detaching the flute from the face
of the point. This procedure is repeated on the opposite face. In the other process,
fluting is accomplished after the careful preparation of a convex or nipple-shaped
striking platform on the base. This platform serves as the seat for indirect percussion, which removes the channel flake and creates the flute scar ~oberts 1935;
Tunnell 1977).
The primary distinguishing attributes of these techniques are the slriking
platforms, which are commonly lost in the process of point production. However,
the process used for fluting can be recognized from the morphology of the flute scar
(Judge 1973:250). In general, short, flakelike---length less than twice the width-flute scars result from striking a straight base; long, bladelike---length twice the
width--flute scars result from fluting off a prepared nipple.
Among the points reported in this study, each of these techniques is represented
in roughly equal numbers. Of the 205 points, 59 have bladelike flute scars and 57
have flakelike flute scars. In 10/205 cases both blade and flake fluting are present;
no data are available for the remaining 79 points in the sample.
Summary statistical data are presented for length, maximum width, maximum
width to base, basal width, and thickness (Table 9). Two of these--base and width
thickness--clearly are dictated by the technology of hafting and demonstrate that
the manufacture of Texas Clovis points was a remarkably precise activity. There
were evidently very specific limits within which the finished products could vary.

Table includes all points for which measurements are available.
All values except number of observations (n) and kurtosis are in
centimeters.
Broken points are included in these calculations. Reanalysis excluding broken
points significantly changes the values only forLength, since most breaks affect
the length of the point. Mean value of Length in unbroken points is 7.42 cm,
standard deviation, 2.13 cm.

This is most readily seen in the positive kurtosis values. Kurtosis measures the
relative peakedness or flatness of cases distributed about a mean. Normal distributions have a kurtosis value of zero; in distributions where the curve is flat (cases
spread widely about the mean), kurtosis values are negative. In cases where the
distribution is more akin to a spike (cases clustered narrowly about the mean),
kurtosis values are positive. As is evident in Table 9, kurtosis values for width, base
width, and especially, thickness are significantly positive. As mentioned above,
because of the reworking of the points, length values vary much more.
These statistics indicate that substantial precision was required in the manufacture of Clovis points; certain dimensions of the points are remarkably standardized.
But why the precision? Judge (1973:264) and others, among them Keeley
(1982:800), have argued that more time was required to produce a haft than to make
a tool, at least when that tool was flaked rather than ground. The obvious implication
of this argument is that points were made for hafts, and not vice versa, and that hafts
were maintained and curated through the lifetimes of several points. Making a new
tool was more efficient than making a new haft.
The disparity in cost between tool making and haft making would have selected
for production of many points to fit a few hafts. The resulting standardization in the
manufacturing process is reflected in the high kurtosis values for the hafting
dimensions: width, basal width, and thickness.
Style
Analysis of stylistic diversity in Texas Clovis fluted points and of the
relationship of Texas Clovis points to fluted points in other regions is incomplete,
but some preliminary comments can be made.

Meltzer ~ Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

The great diversity in the morphology of Texas Clovis fluted points (Figure 10)
covers forms that mimic both the classic Clovis style and other fluted points.
Someofthe Texas forms resemble points from the east and particularly the southeast

(though there are no Cumberland forms in Texas), but it is noteworthy that the most
common point form in the eastern United States----parallel-sided, flake-fluted,
elliptical-based points with no "ears"-- is not well represented in Texas, comprising
less than 5 percent of the points in the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey. The Texas
sample is dominated by points with tapered sides, and bases that are significantly
narrower than the widest parts of the blades.
Presumably this morphological diversity reflects changes in point styles over
space and time, but analysis of attributes such as base size and shape failed to
produce any significant spatial patterning that might in turn reveal variation in time.
The presence or absence of"ears" on the points may have a nonrandom distribution
in space. Apparently there are no "ears" on the points from Central Texas, but the
significance of this is unclear. Fluting technology is the attribute of fluted points that
has the greatest promise for significant variation over space and time. Certainly,
fluting from a prepared nipple--producing bladelike flute scars--appears to come
late in the Clovis sequence, and by Folsom times it was the dominant fluting
technology. However, as noted earlier, fluting from a straight base and from a
prepared nipple occur in roughly equal frequency in the sample of Texas Clovis

58

Texas Archeological Society

points, and there is no apparent difference in the distribution of blade and flake
fluting. Blade and flake fluting appear to be as common on the High Plains as in
other parts of the state.
The fact that blade and flake fluting overlap in space does not mean that they
necessarily overlap in time. It would be interesting to pursue--through further
analysis of the points and through excavation--the hypothesis that flake fluting
occurs earlier than blade fluting in Clovis points. If this could be demonstrated, it
would provide a valuable indicator of age in the absence of other dating.
It has been suggested that certain exotic fluted point styles, specifically
Cumberland points, are found in Texas. In 1935, E. B. Howard (1935: Plates 30(1)
and 37(1) illustrated two Clovis points from Texas. One was a classic Cumberland:
a large, blade-fluted, fish-tailed point, but no information was given on its provenience, though Howard credited Cyrus Ray and W. E. Baker as having provided him
with Texas specimens. Hester (1967:13) later reported that the Galena site in Harris
County yielded a point"quite similar to the so-called Cumberland Fluted point" of
the eastern United States. There is no way to determine whether the points
mentioned by Howard and Hester are one and the same. Whether they are the same
or not, this identification poses a problem, for there is no evidence that any other
Cumberland forms have been found in Texas. Since Cumberland points are
restricted largely to Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky, they would be well out of their
range in Texas, so in both cases an effort should be made to determine whether the
points were actually found in Texas.
SUMMARY

AND

CONCLUSIONS

Aided by the membership of the Texas Archeological Society and through
studies of museum and private collections, the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey
recorded data on 205 Clovis points from 95 Texas counties. It is not known how
representative that sample is of Clovis material recovered in Texas, since an
unknown number of points lie out of sight in undocumented collections. And it is
not known how representative that sample is of the Clovis archeological record in
Texas, since not all parts of the state have been under the same degree of archeological scrutiny, nor do all areas have equivalent exposures of Pleistocene deposits. These limitations notwithstanding, the Texas Clovis Fluted Point S urvey data
provide a measure of the density and distribution of Clovis points across the state.
Texas Clovis points are distributed evenly by county (mode of one per county).
Only a few counties have disproportionately large samples; these are probably
counties in which there are particularly active collectors. Texas Clovis points are
concentrated generally on the High Plains ~lano Estacado), along the Balcones
Fault zone, and in north-central and East Texas. The concentrations in north-central
and East Texas may reflect the high intensity of collecting activities there.
However, the dense concentration of points on the High Plains and along the
Balcones Escarpment probably has archeological significance.
In contrast, Clovis points are relatively scarce off the caprock in the lower
Plains (Brown et al. 1982), in the Trans-Pecos region, and perhaps in the coastal

Meltzer m Clovis Paleoindian Occupation

59

area. These patterns may simply reflect sampling patterns or, in the case of the
coastal regions, geological processes that have obscured the archeological record.
There is a great deal of morphological diversity in Texas Clovis points, but no
clear-cut patterns can be found in the distribution of particular attributes across the
state. This does not preclude the possibility that such attributes may ultimately
reveal temporal patterning, but the possibility remains that differences such as
differences such as those in fluting technology will help sort out some of the
temporal variation in the Texas Clovis occupation.
It appears from this study that many or most of the Texas Clovis fluted points
were multifunctional, serving as both handled or hafted knives and projectiles.
These uses are in keeping with the patterns of breakage, reworking, fracture, and
grinding evident in this sample. Obviously, more detailed macro- and microwear
studies are needed.
Although the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey has uncovered a substantial
sample of data on the Texas Clovis occupations, much is still unknown. Attention
should be paid to several parts of the archeological and paleoenvironmental record,
including documenting the now undocumented collections of Clovis Paleoindian
materials, gathering detailed paleoenvironmental data on Texas in the late Pleistocene (Hester 1977), gathering more precise information on locations of Texas
Clovis material and relating that information to paleotopography and paleoenvironments, identifying primary and secondary sources of lithic raw material and
documenting the use of those sources by Clovis groups, examining macro- and
microwear traces on Clovis points in order to understand tool use better, and
continuing to explore the spatial and temporal variation of the Texas Clovis
Paleoindian occupation through stylistic variations in the points.
The call then is not simply for new data, but also for better refinement of
existing data. Obviously many of the most pressing issues regarding the Clovis
Paleoindian occupation can be answered only by the discovery and careful excavation of Clovis sites. In the interim, much can be learned from the distribution of
Clovis points across Texas.
