TER"RACE SITES - INTRODUCTION

David 0. Brown

The sites referred to in this section are those lying on the
lower stream terraces of Aqui I la and Ha~kberry creeks. Bates and
Jackson {1980:617) define a stream terrace as:
One of a series of level surfaces 1n a stream valley,
flanking and more· or less para I lei to the stream channel,
originally occurring at or below, but now above, the level
of the stream, and representing the dissected remnants of an
abandoned flood plain, stream bed, or valley floor produced
during a former stage of erosion or deposition.
Such a definition describes several landforms of different or1g1ns,
including just about everything in the Aqui I la and Hackberry drainages
outside of the floodplain.
Both the Bailey (41HI77) and Pi I grim
(41HI124) sites, classified here as upland sites, are located on the
remnants of ancient stream terraces.
The definition of terrace used here is intended to separate the
higher and older terraces, which are at equivalent elevations to the
Cretaceous uplands and environmentally similar, from the lower and
more recent terraces at elevations intermediate between the floodplain
and the uplands. Not only are these landforms different biotical ly
and hydrologically from the adjacent uplands and floodplains at the
present, but at some time during the prehistoric occupation of the
Aqµi I la and Hackberry creek basin, these may have been active
landforms. Thus, basically, this category includes sites located on
tltrraces that may have been actively forming floodplains at some time
since the Late Pleistocene.
Because such sites offer the promise of buried, stratified
cultural material dating to periods prior to the formation of the
modern floodplain, they are an extremely valuable resource
1n
archeology.
Intermediate landforms between the modern floodplain and

TERRACE SITES -

INTRODUCTION

the older Pleistocene terraces are not common and are often present
only as smal I remnants. What sites exist on these landforms are not
always adequate for research purposes. In many cases, these sites
considerably post-date formation processes, while 1n other cases,
older sites have been heavily disturbed by a variety of natural and
cultural impacts.
Although it is generally not possible to date the formation of a
floodplain
by a single section, evidence from several of the
floodplain sections suggests that aggradation, at
least
along
Hackberry Creek, has been rapid, with four meters of sediments at the
McDonald Site representing a bit over 3000 years of time, and three
and a half meters at the McKenzie Site representing perhaps 1500
years. Although lateral accretion of point bar deposits at the outer
edge of forming terraces comp I icates the derivation of an age for the
whole landform, the density of cultural materials observed in dam
borrow pit profiles suggests that the entire floodplain is Holocene
and perhaps very recent Holocene.
Patton (this report) has discussed the formation of terraces
within the Aqui I la Lake area. His Tl terrace may correspond to the T2
terrace defined along the Brazos River by Epps (1973). An examination
of the landforms along Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks shows several
apparently continuous surfaces lying at intermediate
elevations
between the Pleistocene T2 terrace upon which the Bailey (41HI77) and
Pi Igrim (41HI124) sites and 41HI76 are located, and the modern
floodplain in which the McDonald (41HI105), Reps Davis (41HI58) and
McKenzie (41HI115) sites are buried.
Two apparent terrace surfaces are most obvious, one located
between two and four meters above the floodplain and the other between
one half and one and a half meters above the floodplain.
These two
surfaces are found along both Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks. The
former occurs most commonly as a narrow ledge along the creekward edge
of higher terraces, but occasionally occurs as a finger ridge or
isolated remnant. Both 41HI125 and 41HI74/114, which Watson (this
report) classify as examples of the Tl terrace, are located on narrow
projecting ridges along Aqui I la Creek.
The lower of these two terraces is found in at least three broad
flat outcrops along Aqui Ila and Hackberry creeks. It may also occur
as narrow ledges along higher terraces, but is difficult to recognize
because it is so close to the modern floodplain. Two of the sites
reported in this section, the Sul I ivan Site and the Brazi I Site, are
apparently located on this landform.

TERRACE SITES -

INTRODUCTION

Investigations at five sites are detailed in this section:
the
Brazi I
Site
(41HI75) and 41HI125, excavated 1n 1978 by SMU;
41HI74/114 and 41HI76, excavated in 1980 by TAS and the Sul I ivan Site
(41HI117) from the 1982 TAS season. Three of these, the Brazi I Site,
the Sul I ivan Site and 41HI76 had also been investigated previously by
SMU (Lynott and Peter 1977; Skinner et al. 1978). Investigations at
al I of these sites are considered part of the final mitigation plan
for Aqui I la Lake.
Of these sites, the Brazi I Site may have had the greatest
archeological promise and was appropriately the scene of the most
intensive overal I effort. This site, which shows evidence of a buried
Early
Archaic
component and which figured prominently 1n the
definition of the Waco Sinker type artifact, is, or at least was at
one time, apparently eligible on its own individual merit for the
National Register of Historic Places.
Unfortunately, the site had
been collected and perhaps potholed for many years. Most recently,
after purchase of the land by the Corps of Engineers and prior to
inundation, the site was badly vandalized. Portions of the surface of
the site were bul I dozed during vegetation clearing and the site is now
inundated.
Al I of the rema1n1ng sites are, or were, valuable cultural
resources, but perhaps less so than the Brazi I Site. The 1980 sites,
41HI74/114 and 41HI76, both yielded intact features despite sandy soi I
ordinarily subject to intense mixing. Many of the artifacts excavated
from these sites may have been in a partially mixed context.
Excavations at the Sul I ivan Site yielded some buried materials but no
features or indications of unmixed stratigraphy. In Chapter 34, Peter
suggests that the stratigraphy of 41HI125 has been destroyed by
plowing and soi I erosion.
With the exception of the Sul I ivan Site, which lies at the upper
margin of the maximum flood pool on the upper end of Aqui I la Creek,
At low water
al I of the sites wi I I be inundated most of the time.
levels, parts of the Brazi I Site and 41HI76 may appear as islands in
the lake. Plowing and accelerated erosion have disturbed al I of these
sites and reservoir vegetation clearing has damaged 41HI76 and the
Brazi I Site. Dam construction borrow activities have disturbed almost
al I of the potentially intact portions of 41HI76 and sand borrow
activities by the owner have destroyed a large part of the Sul I ivan
Site.

bank of Aqui I la Creek, 5.3 kilometers upstream from the confluence of
Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks. It is at an elevation of from 160 to
166 meters MSL on an area of Si lstid loamy fine sand, Pulexas loamy
fine sand (frequently flooded), and Gasi I fine sandy loam.
The site
covers an area approximately 190 meters north-south by 110 meters
east-west. It is in the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone in an
abandoned field.
Most, if not al I, of the site has been cultivated
unti I fairly recently and is presently overgrown in a variety of
grasses. Figure 30.1 shows a plan map of the site. Figure 30.2a is a
view of the large oak at the southern end of the site where the datum
was placed.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site was originally designated by Frank Bryan as his Site 1
in the 1930s (Bryan 1931:Map 4). Frank Watt also collected materials
from this site in the 1930s (Watt 1938, 1953) and it is known to at
least one local collector who was collecting here in the 1970s
(Skinner et al. 1978:174). Unti I the work of TAS, no systematic
investigations had been undertaken.
The materials collected from
these investigations indicate that the site was probably the scene of
multiple occupations extending over several thousand years. During
the 1980 investigations, the site was numbered 41HI114. Later it was
discovered that it had previously been recorded as 41HI74. Both
designations have been retained.
Note that this site was also
assigned two numbers by SMU (x41Hl98 and xHI170), as it was thought to
be two separate sites. It has proved impossible to maintain this
original separation.

DATA COLLECTION
Using the procedure described 1n Chapter 8, 41HI74/114 was
systematically sampled using spatially stratified 20 by 20 meter
sampling units, each of which contained a single, randomly placed, 4
meter diameter collection unit (Fig. 30.1).
Three 1 by 2 meter
excavation units were dug using selected collection unit center stakes
as the northwest corner of the excavation unit. Al I removed f i I I was
screened through 1/4 inch mesh. Only a portion of each unit was
excavated to the sterile clay, 70 to 80 centimeters below the surface.
Each unit was dug in arbitrary 30 centimeter levels. A single unit,
EU 1, was expanded 50 centimeters to the south in order to more fully
expose Feature 1. In al 1, a total of 29 person-days were expended at
this site during December 1979 and January 1980.
A total of 53 grid squares were originally designated at the
site. Seven squares (nos. 5,8,9,27,33,40 and 51) fel I beyond the site
boundaries and were not laid out or collected. Three other collection
units (46,38 and 26) were designated as excavation units 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Only 23 of the 43 actual surface. collection units
yielded any cultural materials.
Material density ranged from 1
specimen per unit (in 5 of the 23) to a high of 26 specimens in CU 10.
Excavation Unit 1
This 1 by 2.5 meter unit was located with its northwest corner at
the center stake of CU 46, N625/W637. The work was carried out in two
stages. Initially, a 1 by 2 meter unit was dug which was later
expanded 0.5 meters to the south. The original 1 by 2 meter unit was
excavated to a depth of 30 centimeters below the surface in the north
half (1 X lm) and to 60 and 80 centimeters in the western and eastern
sections (0.5 X lm) respectively, of the ~outhern half of the unit.
At a depth of approximately 80 centimeters, a significant increase in
clay content was noted along with a substantial reduction in the
frequency of artifacts (Table 30.1).
The original excavation unit was expanded an additional one half
meter in order to more fully expose a concentration of oxidized
sandstone encountered at about 55 centimeters below the surface. This
southern extension was dug to a depth of 60 centimeters except in the
area of Feature 1, which was pedestaled (Fig. 30.2b).

Excavation Unit 2
Excavation Unit 2 was located with its northwest corner at
N650/W655, the center of CU 38. The northern half of this unrt, 1 by
1 meter, was excavated to 30 centimeters below the surface.
The
southern 1 by 1 meter half was excavated to the sterile clay layer 70
centimeters below the surface.
Excavation Unit 3
This unit was placed with its northwest corner at the center of
CU 26, N686/W635. The southern 1 by 1 meter portion was excavated to
a depth of 30 centimeters below the surface.
The northern 1 by 1
meter section was excavated to 80 centimeters below the surface across
its entire area, and an additional 5 centimeters (to 85cm) was removed
from the northern half of this section, 1 by 0.5 meters. The sterile
clay lay between 80 and 85 centimeters below the surface in this unit.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Cultural Features
FEATURE 1
This feature was a concentration of oxidized tabular (Woodbine?)
sandstone fragments encountered at a depth of approximately 55
centimeters below the surface in EU 1 (Fig. 30.2b).
The feature is
slightly arcuate in form, but as it was not exposed in its entirety,
it cannot be determined if this form is only a function of incomplete
excavation.
The exposed portion of the feature covers an area of
approximately 50 by 50 centimeters and is about 8 centimeters thick
from the highest to lowest points.
The sandstone fragments were
randomly oriented and were not associated with any charcoal or other
materials indicative of burning. Some fragments, however, exhibit in
situ fracturing that may have resulted from exposure to intense heat::"
The- sandy soi I is not conducive to the preservation of organic
materials, and it is I ikely that any such remains would be removed
from the soi I horizons by natural pedogenic processes.
No cultural materials were directly associated with this feature,
the majority being recovered from above it. On the basis of its
topographic position and associated sediments, it is uni ikely that
such an accumulation of sandstone could result from any of the natural
30-6

41HI74/114
processes affecting the site. It is virtually certain, therefore,
that this feature resulted from aboriginal activities. The oxidation
of the sandstone and the in situ fracturing, suggest that Feature 1
functioned as a hearth-.- The absence of charcoal and other burned
organic materials does not preclude this possibi I ity.
An additional
comp I icating factor is that the locally available Woodbine sandstone
that composes the feature oxidized naturally when exposed at the
surface.
This significantly increases the difficulty of determining
whether or not a given stone or feature has been burned.
The age of this feature cannot be wel I established due to the
absence of datable carbon and associated diagnostic artifacts. A
Godley dart point was recovered from level 1 above Feature 1, which
places the feature in or prior to the Late Archaic Period (Jelks
1962:40-41).
Such a placement is not inconsistent with
other
materials recovered from this site.

Lithic Debris
The I ithic debris recovered from this site is from two primary
contexts: materials exposed on the surface and collected from 4 meter
diameter collection units, and materials recovered from the excavation
of units 1 1 2 and 3. It is inevitable on a multicomponent site that
such a sample wil I include materials
from
several
different
occupations and time periods.
In an attempt to define potentially
significant temporal variation in the lithic debris, these materials
were divided into two groups for analysis: surface and subsurface. A
fuller discussion of the implications and limitations of this division
wi I I be presented in a subsequent section. The materials from these
two proveniences, surface and subsurface, were analyzed separately to
investigate temporal variation, and were then re-analyzed as a single
unit in order to characterize the entire I ithic assemblage.
The total I ithic assemblage consists of 1317 specimens, of which
96.9% (1276) are flaked debitage. Modified debitage comprises 2.3%
(30) 1 and the remaining 0.8% is made up of 6 projectile points or
point fragments and 5 bifacial tools or tool fragments. Only 11.4%,
150 specimens, of the entire assemblage was recovered from the surface
of the site.
As noted previously, only a few more than half of the surface
collection units yielded any cultural materials.
A total of 146
specimens was recovered from the 23 collection units with material
present, yielding a mean of 6.3 specimens per unit. The overal I site
mean, including the units with no material, is 3.4 specimens per unit.
The distribution of the material is skewed toward the northern end of

the site, including several areas where erosion is greatest due to
plowing and a field road cut through the terrace slopes. Two-thirds
of al I surface collected material (66.9%) comes from units north of
and including CU 19. Figure 30.3 shows a contour plot of the density
of surface materials at the site.

Secondary Flakes (208 specimens)
Secondary flakes comprise 45.9% of the flakes recovered, with
15.4% secondary flakes (32) from the surface and 84.6% (176) were from
excavations (Table V.50). The vast majority are of chert (92.8%). Of
the remaining 7.2% are 12 are quartzite flakes (5.8%) and 3 si licified
wood flakes (1.4%) (Table V.51). Secondary flakes show al I four of
the platform types found at this site. Multifaceted platforms are the
most common, comprising over half of the platforms (57.2%).
Cortex
platforms occur on 23.1% (48), while single facet platforms are found
on 17.3% (36), and crushed platforms are found on only 2.4% (5) of the
secondary flakes.
Almost one-fourth (23.1%) of the secondary flakes have ventral
platform I ips, the remaining 76.9% having no evidence of platform I ips
(Table V.52). Only two I ipped secondary flakes were collected from
the surface. The remaining 46 I ipped and 5 crushed platform secondary
flakes were al I recovered from excavations (Table V.52).

Tertiary Flakes (242 specimens)
Tertiary flakes comprise 53.4% of the entire flake assemblage.
Three platform types occur in this sample: single facet (16.1%),
multiple facet (79.3%) and crushed (4.5%).
The high proportion of
multiple facet platforms can be partially attributed to the nature of
tertiary flakes. There is no statistically significant difference
between the occurrence of. single and multiple facet platforms on
secondary and tertiary flakes (Table V.~O).

Flakes:

Discussion

In an attempt to determine if there are any
significant
differences, possibly reflecting temporal variation, between flakes
collected from the surface and those excavated from units 1, 2 and 3,
chi-square analyses were run on the various flake characteristics
grouped by the provenience categories, surface and subsurface.
The
primary goa'I of these ana Iyses was to test the hypothesis that
materials recovered from these two proveniences are samples of a
single population of archeological materials. In other words, both
surface and subsurface materials are representative of a single

41HI74/114

assemblage, probably composed of debris from multiple occupations, and
that their separation into two groups, solely on the basis of
provenience, is fortuitous.
These analyses, with one exception, generally support such a
hypothesis (Tables 30.2, 30.3, 30.4). A comparison of the chi-square
values resulting from these analyses
provides
an
interesting
perspective on the I ithic technologies represented at this site. The
very smal I chi-square value for the comparison of the various platform
types (Table 30.2) suggests that little or no change occurred in the
methods of platform preparation during, or between, the periods when
the site was occupied, or that any differences are obscured by
thoroughly mixed deposits. The larger, but sti I I not statistically
significant,
value
for the comparison of lithic materials by
provenience suggests that there may be slightly more variation in
materials between these proveniences than in platform types (Table
30.4).
The chi-square analysis comparing the frequency of ventral
platform lips yielded a statistically significant value (Table 30.3).
These results indicate that the surface and subsurface samples are
distinctly different and, 1n all likelihood, were derived from
different populations. A comparison of the observed and expected
values in Table 30.3 and the percentages of lipped and uni ipped flakes
for these proveniences in Table V.52 indicates that this difference is
the result of fewer I ipped flakes from the surface or, conversely,
greater numbers from the subsurface.
The formation of ventral platform I ips is probably a function of
several factors. The hardness of the hammerstone, the angle at which
the flake was struck, and the lithic material may al I have an effect.
Since each of these factors is highly variable, the proportion of
I ipped flakes may be as much the result of idiosyncratic behavior as
of culturally patterned technology.
Technological changes do, however, offer a plausible explanation.
Although ventral platform lips do not have a one-to-one relationship
with bifacial thinning
flakes
(Shiner
1970:32;
Skinner
et
al. 1978:25), bifacial thinning does produce a high proportion of
I ipped flakes.
The change in frequency of I ipped flakes may,
therefore, be due to a change in I ithic technology that occurred
between the deposition of the subsurface and surface materials.
Skinner and Gallagher (1974) have proposed that just such a change,
from a core or bifacial reduction technology to a flake technology,
did occur between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods.

It is not necessary, however, to postulate a major change in
overal I
flaked
stone technology to account for this apparent
difference. The change can probably be attributed to a reduction in
the size of an important artifact class, projectile points, between
the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
The production of dart
points requires certain amounts of thinning, whether or not the point
is produced through a biface reduction sequence or merely from a large
flake.
For artifacts the size of dart points, the thinning was

----·------

41HI74/114
probably accomplished by percussion flaking, resulting in a higher
proportion of I ipped flakes.
The smaller arrow points of the Late
Prehistoric, on the other hand, were produced from flakes primarily by
pressure flaking, since bifacial reduction and percussion thinning are
very inefficient means of manufacturing smal I arrow points.
This
technique
results
1n significantly fewer I ipped flakes, since
percussion flaking was I imited to only a single stage in the
manufacture of arrow points, whereas in the manufacture of dart
points, it could be abandoned only in the final stages. Although the
relative frequency of I ipped flakes may be the result of the type of
hammer (soft versus hard) used in their production (Henry, Haynes and
Bradley 1976), the former explanation, I inked to a known technological
change (i.e., dart point to arrow point manufacture) is somewhat more
satisfying.
CHIPS (814 specimens)
Over 70% of the I ithic assemblage consists of chips, of which
9.6% were recovered from the surface and 90.4% from excavations. The
vast majority are of chert, the rema1n1ng chips being composed of
quartzite (5.1%), si I icified wood (0.4%), chalcedony (1.0%) and
macro-crystal line quartz (0.2%). The presence or absence of burning
was recorded for al I chips, but neither the distribution nor frequency
of burned chips appears to vary significantly.
CORES (9 specimens)
Eight of the nine cores recovered
from
this
site
are
multi directional. The single exception is a unidirectional core. Al I
were produced by freehand percussion from either chert (7) or
quartzite (2) cobbles (Table 30.5). They vary in size from 31 to 74
mi I limeters in length, 27 to 47 mi I I imeters in width, and 16 to 27
mi I limeters in thickness. Six of the nine specimens come from EU 2,
while the remaining three were recovered from EU 1. Cortex and single
facet platforms predominate, with multiple facet platforms occurring
on only a single specimen.
Multidirectional Cores (8 specimens)
The multidirectional cores from 41HI74/114, with one exception,
are al I of chert. The exception is a quartzite core from EU 2. Both
materials originate as cobbles 1n the local exposures of Uvalde
gravels.
The smal I size of these cores (tables 30.5 and 30.6).
resu I ts from the sma II size of the orig i na I cobb I es rather than from
core exhaustion to conserve scarce raw materials. Only a single
multidirectional core has a multifaceted platform indicative of
platform
preparation.
The
rema1n1ng seven platforms show no
indication of such preparation.

Unidirectional Cores (1 specimen)
A single quartzite unidirectional core was recovered from the
surface of EU 1 (Table 30.5). This is the smallest core recovered
from this site and does not show evidence of platform preparation.

Cores:

Discussion

The analysis of the nine cores from 41HI74/114 generally supports
the conclusions of the flake and chip analyses.
Chert is the
predominant material and faceting is the most common means of platform
preparation on both flakes and cores (see Tables V.50, V.52 and 30.6).
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
The modified debitage from 41HI74/114 consists of 37 flakes (5
secondary and 9 tertiary), 13 chips and 1 indeterminate lithic
fragment. This comprises 2.0% of the entire I ithic assemblage.
Type
1 and Type 2 attrition, as wel I as abrasion, occur on this debitage.
Type 1 attrition comprises over 90% of al I facets, with only one facet
each exhibiting Type 2 attrition and abrasion.
TYPE 1 ATTRITION (26 specimens, 31 facets)
Four of 26 specimens with Type 1 attrition have two separate
facets.
Type 1 attrition is most common on chips (13 facets) and
tertiary flakes (12 facets); secondary flakes having only 5 facets,
and a single fragment having only one.
Scraping facets are five times more common than cutting facets
and are found most often on straight lateral edges, but also occur on
irregular, concave, and convex edges, and on distal and indeterminate
edges.
The five cutting facets recorded on Type 1 modified debitage
have straight edge outlines and occur on lateral (4 facets) and
indeterminate edges (1 facet). Both soft ~nd soft medium materials
were worked, soft materials accounting for 77% of the Type 1 attrition
with 23% attributed to soft medium materials. Seventeen (56.7%) of
the Type 1 attrition specimens show no abrasion.
Ten (33.3%) have
I ight abrasion, and three (10%) show a I ight polish on the facet and
surrounding flake surface.
A T-test comparing mean lengths, widths, thicknesses and size
(length x width x thickness) of cutting versus scraping debitage
indicates that the mean size of Type 1 modified debitage with cutting
facets is significantly larger than that with scraping facets.
TYPE 2 ATTRITION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
A single chip has the only Type 2 facet recorded on debitage from
this site.
This specimen appears to have been used to cut soft
mater i a Is; it has on Iy I i ght abrasion on a sing Ie facet.

30-16

41Hl74/114

ABRASION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
One indeterminate lithic fragment has a single bifacial abrasion
facet which may have resulted from sawing a soft medium material.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE:

DISCUSSION

Scraping facets comprise about 80% of al I facets identified on
the modified debitage.
Modified debitage was recovered from 11
proveniences in seven surface collection units and three excavation
units.
The proportion of cutting to scraping facets is the same for
both surface and subsurface contexts in spite of the difference in
unmodified debitage noted between these contexts. Excavated materials
account for approximately 72% of al I modified debitage.
Excavation
Unit 2 contained 44% of al I facets and may represent an area of food
or other non-lithic raw material processing.
Formal Tools
BIFACES (7 specimens)
Only one complete bi face, other than the projectile points, was
recovered from 41HI74/114.
Six biface basal fragments, ranging in
size from 7 by 15 by 2 mi I I imeters to 33 by 53 by 9 mi I limeters, were
also recovered.
Form 10 (1 specimen)
A single ovate implement with percussion shaping and secondary
edge retouch (Fig. 30.4a) was recovered from level 2 of EU 2. This
specimen has a continuous sinuous edge produced by retouch.
Several
large flakes have been removed from one edge, possibly as the result
of use. Areas of original implement edge show evidence of significant
rounding with some very smal I step fracturing. This attrition most
probably resulted from cutting soft to soft medium materials.
Form 11 (1 specimen)
A basal fragment of what appears to have been a large triangular
implement (Fig. 30.4b) was recovered from EU 2, level 1. It was
shaped by percussion flaking and finished by pressure flaking of the
edges. This implement has heavy abrasion on one lateral edge and Type
1 attrition and moderate abrasion on the other.
There are also
several areas of apparent flake ridge abrasion on both sides. The
edge attrition and surface abrasion on this specimen may have resulted
from hafting, but its use to cut grasses or other silica rich plants
is also possible.

Form 6(?) (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 30.4e) from EU 2, level 2, may be a basal
fragment of a Covington knife (Jelks 1962). It shows evidence of use
in the form of Type 1 attrition and edge abrasion.
The edge damage
suggests that it was used to tut soft materials.
Unclassified (4 specimens)
One circular to ovate basal fragment was recovered from level 2
of
EU
2
(Fig. 30.4d).
This specimen probably represents a
manufacturing failure while it was being shaped by percussion flaking.
There is no evidence of edge damage suggestive of use.
Two basal fragments too smal I to identify as to original form
were recovered from EU 3, levels 1 and 2. The larger fragment, from
level 2, was shaped by percussion and finished by pressure flaking of
the base and lateral edges (Fig. 30.4e). The lateral edges and base
al I have smal I step fracturing and abrasion, indicative of their use
to cut soft medium materials. The second, much smaller, specimen was
made on a flake and has very delicate retouch on the base and lateral
edge.
This specimen may be the base of an arrow point, possibly a
Granbury, but is too fragmentary for identification (Fig. 30.4f).

flaking.

show any evidence of shoulders. It was probably used to cut soft to
soft medium materials. The surfaces opposite the abraded edges also
show polish extending approximately three-quarters of the way to the
unabraded edge.
Microscopic examination indicates that a very smal I
quantity of residue may be adhering to the biface surface.
Bifaces:

Discussion

Al I seven bifaces from this site were recovered from excavations
1n units 2 and 3, which also produced 50% of the modified debitage.
The materials worked with the bifaces are the same as those worked
with the modified debitage, although the bifaces show only evidence of
cutting activities, while the modified debitage shows evidence of both
cutting and scraping.
The evidence provided by the bifacial tools
supports the reconstruction of site activities derived from analysis
of the modified debitage.

41HI74/114
Projectile Points (4 specimens)
Three of the four points recovered are from EU 1, level 1
(Fig. 30.4h, i) and EU 3, level 2 (Fig. 30.4j). The fourth specimen
was from the surface. Al I specimens are complete or partial dart
points.
No arrow points were recovered during our investigation;
however, Bryan (1931, ms.) reports arrow points, probably Perdiz, from
this site (Bryan site 1).
DART POINTS (4 specimens)
Each of the four specimens may represent different but not
unrelated styles, but have been grouped into three types for this
discussion.
Yarbrough (1 specimen)
asymmetrical
A single specimen (Fig. 30.4h) with a slight
triangular blade with straight to slightly convex edges, a very
slightly expanding, wedge shaped and beveled stem, and slightly convex
base was excavated from level 1 of EU 1. It is assigned to the
Yarbrough type (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Gary (2 specimens)
A fragmentary midsection and basal portion of a long contracting
stemmed, convex base point with squared shoulders and stem edge and
basal grinding was recovered from EU 3, Level 2 (Fig. 30.4i).
A
second specimen (Fig. 30.4j) is also the midsection and stem of a long
contracting stemmed and convex based point.
This point, however,
shows wel I defined but short rounded barbs, and the presence of I ight
stem edge and basal smoothing.
Godley
A single Godley type dart point (Jelks 1962:40-41) was recovered
from level 1 of EU 1 (Fig. 30.4k). This specimen has a triangular
blade with pronounced shoulders, a slightly expanding stem and convex
base. Grinding occurs on both the stem sides and base.
PROJECTILE POINTS:

DISCUSSION

The
projectile
points
recovered
during
the 1980 TAS
investigations indicate that the site was occupied during the Late
Archaic and perhaps even somewhat earlier. Previous collections from
the site (Bryan 1931) have yielded a much wider variety of specimens
30-20

41HI74/114
spanning a longer period of time, throughout the Archaic and into the
Late Prehistoric.
This emphasizes the potential error involved 1n
estimating the age of a particular site from a smal I sample of
projectile points.
The sample from the excavations might suggest an
occupation restricted to the Late Archaic. Clearly, this is not the
case.
Several interesting technological
features
can
be
noted
concerning the projectile points from 41HI74/114. One observation is
that the stem edges of al I these specimens are ground. Although stem
grinding 1s not restricted to the Paleoindian and Early Archaic time
periods, most of the projectile points from these early periods show
some evidence of grinding, occasionally pronounced. Stem grinding is
generally thought to be infrequent during the later periods.
Besides
the four possible Late Archaic points described here, numerous
examples of late projectile points from the Aqui I la Lake area show
some evidence of stem grinding. While a few of these may represent
misidentif ications of early points, the majority are felt to be
accurately typed.
One notable difference in this late grinding
technology is the intensity. It is never as heavy as the most marked
In many cases, it may be the
examples from the earlier periods.
result of hafting wear rather than intentional smoothing.
Another interesting observation at this site relates to the two
Gary points.
Despite the fact that the Gary type is one of the most
divergent (in fact, often, any dart point with a contracting stem is
termed a Gary), these two specimens are extremely similar in many
respects, including base form, thickness and manufacture style.
Both
are even made from similar material and appear to be thermally
altered. These two points are so nearly identical that one could
imagine them being made by the same individual at the same time. Such
an occurrence is generally rare at Aqui I la Lake where a collection of
points from a site rarely seems to yield two specimens of any one
type, and where it does, the specimens are usually only vaguely
similar.
This variety of styles and idiosyncratic variants serves to
emphasize these similar specimens. These finds may represent little
more than a hunter repa1r1ng several of his shafts at once, but
unfortunately, none of the proveniences are tightly control led enough
in these individual cases (many of these represent general surface
finds, as does one of the specimens at 41HI74/114) to determine this.
Flaked Stone:

Discussion

The flaked stone at 41HI74/114 1s the result of multiple
occupations spanning an estimated 3000 to 5000 years. While the TAS
investigations recovered evidence only of the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric stages, surface collections recorded by Bryan (1931, ms.)
30-21

41HI74/114
indicate a much longer occupation, including at least portions of the
Early
Archaic
and
Middle
Archaic and possibly the terminal
Paleoindian.
The flaked stone technology represented seems to show a marked
conservatism throughout, perhaps indicating nothing more than the
thorough mixing of materials.
The significant difference in the
occurrence of I ipped flakes between the surface and subsurface
contexts argues that this is not the case and is supported by the
collection of Late Prehistoric materials from the surface and Archaic
materials from subsurface contexts.
The flaked stone technology was based on a freehand percussion
reduction
of predominantly local materials, with no consistent
preference for core form.
There is no evidence of a systematic
bifacial reduction sequence, although the very low frequency of
primary flakes suggests that the initial processing of
I ithic
materials was not conducted on the site, or at least not in the areas
sampled during our investigations.
The analysis of attrition on the materials suggests that the
modified debitage and bifacial implements were used to work soft and
soft medium materials. Included in these classifications would be
most foodstuffs, both animal and vegetable, and various plant and
animal products, such as hides, used in the manufacture of uti I itarian
items.
In addition, one large biface fragment shows significant
polish that may have resulted from cutting grasses or other silica
rich plants, either to harvest seeds or to provide thatch for the
construction of houses (Roemer 1935:200-201;
Swanton 1942:148-154;
Watt 1969).

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The materials recovered from both surface collections
and
excavations indicate that 41HI74/114 has a long history of use, in
excess of 3000 years, and probably served as the locus of a variety of
exploitive, manufacturing and maintenance activities. Some of the
activities suggested are food procurement and processing, including
both animal and vegetable products, and manufacturing activities
related to stone working, hide working and the working of soft woods.
The concentration of modified debitage used to cut and scrape soft and
soft medium materials, in association with a feature interpreted as a
hearth, suggests an area of food preparation.
Within the smal I
excavation unit, however, no patterned distribution could be seen.

30-22

------------

41HI74/114
The sandy texture of the soi Is and the presence of obvious gopher
activity in some portions of the site are strong indications of
potential disturbances to the integrity of cultural materials.
A
preliminary analysis of the material from the excavated units showed
no differences between units or levels.
This result may
be
misleading, however. Excavation in arbitrary 30 centimeter levels may
have combined several different occupations,
making analytical
separation difficult or impossible.
The only evidence for in situ occupation zones 1s the hearth
found 1n level 2 of EU--r.---rreservation of such features in sandy
sites is not uncommon. A number of such hearths have been recently
excavated to the south in the Blackland Prairie region near Bastrop
(Bement 1984). There, as at other such sites, artifact distribution
was found to be skewed vertically. This vertical skewing may be the
case at 41HI74/114 but the evidence is circumstantial at best.
The sole evidence for spatial patterning 1s the significant
difference in lipping between the surface and subsurface units. Two
cautions are added here. In the first place, the recording of ventral
platform I ips has been found to be the most subjective of al I
variables in the Aqui I la Lake material analysis.
Secondly, the
surface sample is relatively smal I and represents materials primarily
from the north end of the site. The cause of this skewed distribution
is not primarily cultural but greater erosion and perhaps more rodent
activity at this end of the site.
In general, 41HI74/114 has yielded I ittle of general interpretive
value.
The projectile points suggest a more intensive occupation
during the Late Archaic, offering some support to the hypothesis of
Late Archaic population growth postulated by Skinner et al. (1978).
While disturbances are evident at the site, the extent and intensity
of disruption is unknown.

CHAPTER 31
THE BRAZIL SITE - 41Hl75

Duane E. Peter, David 0. Brown, Jack M. Jackson

INTRODUCTION
Like many of the sites in the Aqui I la Lake area, the Brazi I Site
1s situated within the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone. The site is
on the west side of Aquil la Creek, approximately 2.75 kilometers north
of the confluence of Aquil la and Hackberry creeks, encompassing the
ridge and slopes of a Pleistocene terrace remnant and adjacent
floodplain (Fig. 31.1).
Non-contiguous scatters of artifacts on the
surfaces of these landforms define a site area of approximately 30,000
square meters.
Although the Brazi I Site was I ikely once covered by overstory
vegetation characteristic of the Cross Timbers region, the vegetation
today is composed of weeds, sand stickers, bul I nettles, grasses and
mesquite trees. The entire site area has been cultivated for over 50
years; however, the slope of the terrace remnant has lain fallow for
a much longer time than the adjacent floodplain.
The eastern
periphery of the site is bounded by a slough or channel overflow scar
running para I lel to Aqui I la Creek. This erosional feature bisects a
constructed terrace or levee situated between the base of the terrace
slope and Aqui Ila Creek. The western extremity of the site is marked
by the crest of the upland slope and the presence of an abandoned
house and two stock tanks.
The northernmost stock tank marks the
location of a spring that ceased to flow only within the last five
years.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
The Brazi I Site was first reported in the 1930s by Frank Bryan
(1937:72-75) and Frank Watt (1938:Fig. 2). The site is wel I known for
the large number of Waco Sinkers and late Paleoindian projectile
points collected, and was relocated in 1972 by the Archeology Research
Program of SMU. Due to the heavy vegetation cover at that time and

BRAZIL SITE
the lack of contact with local collectors, the Brazi I Site was
originally recorded as two separate sites: (1) X41HI66 on the terrace
slope and (2) X41HI72 on the floodplain.
In 1975, a research team from the Archeology Research Program
tested the site by means of postholes and eight 1 by 1 meter test
excavation units. Only the floodplain portion was investigated, as
access to the terrace slope was denied by the landowner. Subsurface
testing revealed loamy fine sand sediments with cultural deposits
present to at least 40 centimeters below the ground surface (Lynott
and Peter 1977:60-63). The lack of diagnostic artifacts from these
units precluded any temporal designations.
The surface artifacts
defined a site area of approximately 24,000 square meters.
Limited access to the terrace portion of the site was obtained
during
the 1977 field season.
Limited testing, involving six
postholes and two 1 by 1 meter excavation units, was conducted to
determine the vertical extent and context of the cultural materials on
the terrace slope. This effort revealed artifacts to a depth of 1.1
meters in fine, yellowish-brown sandy loam sediments. Areal extent of
the cultural deposits was estimated to be approximately 6200 square
meters.
Diagnostic artifacts of the Early Archaic, Late Archaic and
Historic periods were recovered (Skinner et al. 1978:92-93).
Since
one-third of these artifacts were recovered from beneath the plow zone
in the floodplain (Lynott and Peter 1977:62), it was recommended that
further investigation would aid in the recognition and delineation of
functionally and temporally distinct components.
DATA COLLECTION
Definition of the horizontal limits of the Brazi I Site and
determination
of
the presence of intact buried deposits were
accomplished through a variety of methods during the 1978 field
season.
Control led excavation units, backhoe trenches, shovel tests
and surface examination fol lowing plowing were used.
Particular
emphasis was placed on isolating temporally separate components since
a local chronology for the Archaic Period is lacking.
The extent of the surface materials on the terrace slope was
revealed through plowing.
Since the site area had been plowed many
times, this additional plowing did not destroy any undisturbed
features.
The dryness of the clayey sediments precluded the plowing
of the floodplain to the north of the fence I ine bisecting the site.
Elsewhere on the site plowing was not essential, for the horizontal
extent had been previously established (Lynott and Peter 1977).
Plowing was conducted during the first week of June in anticipation of
a summer rain that would expose artifacts. Unfortunately, it did not

rain during the summer; hence, a viable sample of surface artifacts
could not be collected as planned.
Backhoe trenches were used both on the terrace slope and in the
floodplain to examine the stratigraphy and determine whether or not
deeply buried cultural deposits were present. Backhoe trenches A, C
and D (Fig. 31.1) were placed near the base of the terrace slope in
areas where buried deposits were suspected.
Trench B was used to
determine if the natural levee within the floodplain had been occupied
also. The remaining trenches, E, F and G, were placed to gain a
better understanding of the depositional dynamics of the floodplain.
After plowing of one strip across the northern portion of the
floodplain had revealed cultural deposits, shovel tests were used to
delineate their horizontal extent. Test excavation units 20 and 21
were placed near the center of the cultural materials. Excavation
Unit 20, a 2 by 2 meter square, was excavated to a depth of 40
centimeters below the surface while EU 21, a 1 by 1 meter square, was
terminated at a depth of 50 centimeters below the surface.
To the
south, a 2 by 2 meter square, EU 22, was excavated to sample the
cultural deposits which BHT E had indicated were much deeper than
previously documented (Lynott and Peter 1977). Excavation Unit 22 was
dug to a depth of 110 centimeters below the surface. Excavation Unit
23 was excavated farther west in the floodplain to determine if
artifact density decreased with distance from the modern creek channel
or if it increased in relation to the swale, that may have been a

terminated at 90 centimeters below the surface.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Since the Brazi I Site encompasses several
geomorphological
features, stratigraphic correlation among the separate areas is made
quite difficult. The lack of I iving floors and associated features
within these deposits also hinders correlations on the basis of the
cultural stratigraphy. Due to these difficulties, the stratigraphy of
the site wil I be discussed for each topographical area tested: (1)
the eastern ridge and slope, (2) the central floodplain and (3) the
southern floodplain (Fig. 31.2). The latter two areas are part of the
same geomorphological feature;
nevertheless, the distance between
them requires that each be discussed separately.
The terrace remnant and slope of the Brazil Site were regularly
plowed as a peanut field unti I approximately 1950. While the field
lay fallow, artifacts were collected from the surface but no digging

occurred.
The sandy matrix of the terrace ridge, however, has likely
contributed to the mixing of artifacts from several occupations.
There is no visible evidence of natural stratigraphy in the pit wal Is
nor is there any evidence of cultural stratigraphy within the meter of
sandy matrix.
Downslope, near the edge of the stock tank, EU 13
revealed that the cultural deposit
is
50
centimeters deep.
Unfortunately, this entire deposit contains historic artifacts dating
about 1900 indicating thorough mixing of the cultural material. These
materials likely represent the dump area of the initial occupation of
the abandoned house on the terrace ridge.
It is only along the lower reaches of the terrace slope that
natural stratigraphy is observable. The profile of BHT A (Fig. 31.3)
reveals five major stratigraphic units. The three sandy units either
pinch out or are truncated as they approach the base of the slope.
The underlying deposits contain gravel and rest on a clay shale that
yielded no cultural materials. In fact, very I ittle cultural material
was noted in any of the fi I I from BHT A.
The sandy units on the ridge slope also pinch out to the east and
south.
BHT D, at the base of the terrace slope, revealed three
stratigraphic units:

(1) Stratum 1 - a gray (7.5YR5/0)

sandy loam;

depth from 10 to 30 centimeters, artifacts are present.

(2) Stratum 2 - a brown (7.5YR5/4) sandy si It, no artifacts
are present, appears to be a channel or slough fi II at
base of the terrace.
Unfortunately, this suggested
f i I I deposit was not revealed by any of the other
profiles. Trench G, excavated to determine if the low
swale in the field to the south might be related to
this channel fi II, did not reveal asimilar profile.
(3) Stratum 3 - reddish-yellow (7.5YR6/8) sandy si It, maJor
stratigraphic unit within the central portion of the
floodplain. Where this stratum occurs almost at the
surface in EU 19, no cultural material was recovered.

material can be expected. The distribution of diagnostic artifacts in
EU 20 (Table 31.1) suggests the disturbed nature of the upper portion
of these deposits. Artifacts spanning much of the Prehistoric Period
are apparently intermixed in the upper two levels. The integrity of
the lower portion of this deposit remains unknown.
The stratigraphic situation within the southern portion of the
floodplain is different.
Several sandy alluvial units are present.
The soi I descriptions for this area are derived from the profile of EU
22 (Fig. 31.4 and Table 31.1). Artifacts are present throughout this
profile;
however, they are most numerous between 20

A hearth may be represented, but clear definition was not possible
within the confines of the excavation EU. Grain size analysis of the
sediments from EU 22 (Table 31.2) revealed the entire deposit to be a
relatively homogeneous sand. Separate soi I horizons (Fig. 31.4) were
recognizable however.
Trenches E and F (Fig. 31.5) reveal the
stratigraphy of the slough that yielded numerous surface artifacts.
As in EU 22, the deposits are basically sandy. The lack of artifacts
in the wal Is of BHT F corresponds to the absence of surface artifacts
on the east side of the slough.
On the west side of the slough
artifacts are present only in the upper three strata. Horizon Cl is a
sandy loam that contains no artifacts. The cemented sands and gravels
below this horizon suggest the presence of a former channel.

The stratigraphic situation in the southern portion provides the
best situation within the site for the presence of in situ cultural
material.
The distribution of diagnostic artifacts within
the
isolated test excavation units lends support to this conclusion (Table
31.2). EU 22 is the only unit in which diagnostics of the Late and
Early Archaic periods appear in the proper stratigraphic sequence.
Levels 6 through 9 of EU 22 yielded a consistent sample of Early
Archaic projectile point styles, such as Wei Is, Uvalde and Gower. A
Yarbrough point appears in level 4 above ·these specimens.
Only two other units are tentatively recognized as yielding
materials from an unmixed context. Unfortunately, this determination
is based upon negative rather than positive evidence. Units 14 and 16
each revealed a single diagnostic of the Late Archaic Period. Given
the position of these units on the sandy terrace ridge, such
recognition is risky. EU 18 also yielded a single diagnostic artifact
of the Late Archaic Period.
The stratigraphic situation, together
with the mixed assemblages from nearby units 20 and 21, suggests that

the contextual integrity of the central floodplain 1s questionable at
best.
It is therefore apparent that the contextual integrity of much of
the
Brazi I
Site
is suspect.
Both the natural and cultural
stratigraphy indicate that the southern portion is the only area were
in situ assemblages are definitely present. In situ materials may
exist in isolated areas on the terrace ridge, but"""the--probability of
mixed assemblages is exceedingly great.
The stable or possibly
eroding surfaces of the terrace ridge and slope al lowed for the
mixture of the debris of a series of occupations. The alluviation
within the floodplain, however, provided a sequence of distinct
surfaces for those same occupations.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
The total I ithic assemblage recovered from the Brazi I Site
consists of 4036 specimens. The flaked stone debitage comprises 95.7%
(3860 specimens) of this assemblage.
Modified
debitage
{120
specimens) is only 3% of the entire I ithic assemblage. The remaining
1.3% consists of bifaces {32), projectile points (29) and hammerstones
(5).
No ground stone was recovered. As noted above, most of the
I ithic assemblage from the Brazi I Site is from a disturbed context.
Therefore, except for the lower levels of EU 22, the I ithic debris
wi I I be discussed as a single assemblage.
FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage constitutes the most common category of
artifacts recovered from the Brazi I Site.
Flakes (52.1%), chips
(47.1%) and cores (0.8%) comprise this class of material remains.
FLAKES (2010 specimens)
Primary Flakes {63 specimens)
Of the 2010 flakes recovered, only 3.1% are primary flakes.
The
highest proportions were recovered from units 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, and
23 (Table 31.3). Of these, only EU 23 is within the southern portion
of the site.
Chert is the most common raw material (87.3%) (Table
V.53). Quartzite (9.5%), si I icified wood (1.6%) and quartz (1.6%) are
only minimally represented.
The primary flakes exhibit only three
types of platforms. Cortex (38.1%) and single facet platforms (44.4%)
are equally common. Crushed platforms appear on only 11 specimens or
17.5% of the sample {Table V.54). The remaining attribute, that of
thermal alteration, was observed on a single specimen.
Secondary Flakes (786 specimens),
Secondary flakes comprise 39.1% of the flake assemblage from the
Brazi I Site. Five raw material types are represented: chert {94.4%),
quartzite (4.7%), chalcedony (0.4%), si I icified wood (0.3%) and quartz
(0.3%).
Almost one-third of al I the secondary flakes were recovered
from EU 14. The production of secondary flakes was not I imited to the
northern portion of the site, however.
The two units from the
southern portion yielded 18.1% of the total sample.

BRAZIL SITE

Platform preparation of the secondary flakes involved four
platform types (Table V.56). Although cortex platforms (37.3%) are
wel I represented, single facet platforms (51.1%) are most common.
Crushed platforms appear on 7.9% of the secondary flakes, while
multiple facet platforms (3.7%) are only minimally represented.
Ventral platform lips are very poorly represented, appearing on only
2.3% of the secondary flakes (Table V.57).
Evidence of thermal
alteration is present on only 39 specimens (5.0%).
Tertiary Flakes (1161 specimens)
Tertiary flakes constitute the major portion (57.8%) of the flake
assemblage (Table 31.3).
Only EU 19 did not yield any tertiary
flakes. Chert is again the predominant raw material with quartzite
(3.9%) a distant second.
Chalcedony, hematite-limonite and quartz
together constitute less than 1% of the tertiary flakes (Table V.58).
Only three platform types are represented among the tertiary
flakes.
Single facet platforms (69.9%) are most common, while
multiple facet (14.6%) and crushed platforms (15.4%) are equally
represented (Table V.59). Ventral platform lips are more common among
this sample of tertiary flakes (Table V.57), but sti I I occur with less
frequency than that of other assemblages such as the McDonald Site.
As with the primary and secondary flakes, evidence of thermal
alteration is infrequent. Only 43 specimens (3.7%) exhibited crazing
and/or pot I id fractures.
Flakes:

Discussion

Only a few stratigraphic units at the Brazi I Site can be
convincingly assigned to any particular period. The most important of
these are the lower levels of EU 22 where three recognizable Early
Archaic and one reworked Paleoindian projectile points were recovered.
These levels are discussed together as the Early Archaic component.
In contrast, the upper levels at the site are thought to be disturbed
and mixed in every instance. As previously noted, examination of the
rema1n1ng units and levels implies unmixed cultural stratigraphy only
by default, i.e., from the presence of only a single temporal
diagnostic per unit.
An examination of the flakes from the Early Archaic component
shows a total of 173 (86% of the total flakes - Table 31.3) divided
between 56 corticate (32.4%) and 117 decorticate (67.6%) specimens.
As in many cases throughout this report, the primary flakes are
combined with the
secondary
because
of
their
statistically
questionable sample size.
Flakes from the remainder of the site
totaled 1837, including 793 corticate (43.1%) and 1044 decorticate

BRAZIL SITE

flakes (56.8%). A chi-square analysis of the difference between these
two samples yields a value of 7.58, significant at the .01 level
(Blalock 1979:613).
This result supports the isolation of these
levels as a separate component.
The lack of multiple diagnostics from other presumably unmixed
contexts at the site complicates the identification of other cultural
stratigraphic units. One possible separation includes the mid-range
of levels across the entire site (levels 3,4 & 5) that exhibits a
series of projectile points tentatively assigned to the Late Archaic.
(The smal I, Yarbrough-I ike projectile points are thought to be
primarily Late Archaic in the Aqui I la Lake area, as is the Godley
type, but the Kent-I ike specimen remains questionable; it wel I be the
fragmented remains of a Middle Archaic point.) A total of 642 flakes
(31.9% of the total flakes) were recovered from these middle levels,
broken down into 259 corticate (40.4%) and 383 decorticate (59.7%)
specimens.
A chi-square analysis of this assemblage of flakes versus
the remaining purportedly mixed assemblage (not including the Early
Archaic specimens) yields a chi-square value of 3.20, less than the
tabular value of 3.84 (p=.05, df=l), and therefore not significantly
different from the mixed group (Blalock 1979:613).
A chi-square analysis of the Early Archaic component flakes
against the mixed group minus the possible Late Archaic specimens
sti I I yields a chi-square value of 9.33, significant at the .01 level
with one degree of freedom (Blalock 1979:613). However, a chi-square
comparison of the Early versus Late Archaic components does not return
a significant value.
A chi-square value of 3.68 is sti I I slightly
less than the tabular value chi-square at the .05
level
of
significance, 3.84 (Blalock 1979:613).
Thus, the evidence for the
separation of this Late Archaic component is weak from a statistical
point of view.
This is not surprising, given the number of diverse
units combined from a large area of the site.
Even if the levels
represented an undisturbed series of Late Archaic campsites, a variety
of activities represented by differing percentages of debitage remains
would be combined in the sample. What is perhaps surprising is that
this diverse sample actually comes so close to being statistically
different;
in both cases, there is much less than a 10% probabi I ity
that difference between the Late Archaic sample and the other samples
is due to chance.
Among the notable differences between the Early Archaic sample
and the remainder of the materials is the infrequency of non-chert
materials. Quartzite is the only other material type present in the
Early Archaic levels.
Three specimens comprise 1.7% of the total,
while in the remaining levels, 100 non-chert specimens comprise 5.4%
of the total. Quartzite alone accounts for 85 of these, or 4.6%. A

31-15

BRAZIL SITE

chi-square comparison of chert versus non-chert material usage for the
Early Archaic, versus other proveniences, yields a value of 4.51,
significant at the .05 level with one degree of freedom (Blalock
1979:613).
Inspection of the possible Late Archaic levels reveals a
figure of 5.5% non-chert usage in the remaining units and levels not
included in either the Early or Late Archaic totals.
Platform types within the flake assemblage are limited to cortex,
single facet, multiple facet and crushed. Even though a large number
of multiple facet platforms might be expected within the tertiary
flake
sample,
single
facet
platforms predominate the entire
assemblage. The extremely low percentages of I ipped platforms within
the flake assemblage may reflect the use of a hard hammer or the lack
of extensive bifacial thinning. Given the large proportion (42.2%) of
secondary and primary flakes within this sample, the latter may be
likely.
CHIPS (1819 specimens)
Chips comprise only 45.1% of the total I ithic
assemblage
recovered from the Brazi I Site. Chips, I ike flakes, are primarily of
chert (87.9%). However, quartzite (11.1%) is a more frequent raw
material among the chips than the flakes. Such an increase in the
chip assemblage may reflect the differing fracture characteristics of
the raw materials.
The remainder of the raw materials (si I icified
wood, chalcedony, hematite, and quartz) are represented by less than
1% of the chip assemblage.
As with the flakes, a much smaller
percentage of non-chert materials is present 1n the Early Archaic
context.
The distribution of the chip assemblage (Table 31.4) 1s very
similar to that of the flakes. The frequency of the chip covar1es
with that of the flakes among the separate units. A total of 8.2% of
the chips exhibited evidence of thermal alteration as compared to only
4.1% of the flakes.
This suggests fragmentation of previously
discarded debitage.
CORES (31 specimens)
Al I six core types were recovered from the Brazi I
Site.
Multidirectional cores (45.2%) are most common. Although undefined
core fragments (24.8%) constitute the next most frequent category,
bifacial cores (16.1%) are also wel I represented. Bidirectional,
unidirectional, and ninety degree cores comprise the remainder of the
core assemblage (Table 31.5). As usual, chert (90.3%) is the primary
raw material uti I ized. Only three specimens are of quartzite (Table
31.5). None of the six cores recovered from the Early Archaic context
are quartzite.

Multidirectional Cores (14 specimens)
The multidirectional cores are of chert (86%) or quartzite (14%).
Cortex (36%) or single facet platforms (64%) are the only platform
types represented. Battering is not evident on any of these cores.
The sizes of these cores varies;
some were apparently nearly
exhausted, while others have a great deal of cortex rema1n1ng,
reflecting the sizes of the available chert cobbles (Table V.61).
Bidirectional Cores (1 specimen)
A single bidirectional core of chert was recovered from EU 20.
Only cortex platforms are represented. No battering is evident on
this specimen. Since the cobble was I ikely relatively smal I (69 mm
length, 42 mm width, and 15 mm thick) initially, it may have been
exhausted of flake blanks of adequate size. On the other hand, it may
have been judged unsuitable for further reduction.
Unidirectional Cores (2 specimens)
Two unidirectional cores were recovered from units 21 and 22 of
the Brazi I Site. Both are of chert and exhibit only cortex platforms.
Battering of these specimens is not evident.
Both cores are smal I
(Table V.61) and the knapper may have decided that an adequate tool
blank could not be obtained from them.
Bifacial Cores (5 specimens)
These bifacial cores are all of chert.
Single facet platforms
are evident on four specimens. The platform type on the remaining
core is indeterminable. Battering is not present on any of the
bifacial cores. The smal I sizes of these cores (Table V.61) suggests
that they were either considered unsuitable for further bifacial
reduction of a core tool or too smal I for the continued production of
flake blanks. Given the bifacial mode of flake removal, the former
seems more I ikely.
Ninety Degree Cores (1 specimen)
Single
A single ninety degree core was recovered from EU 22.
facet platforms are present on this quartzite cobble. As with the
other cores, battering is not present.
The dimensions of this
specimen are 67 millimeters by 48 mi I I imeters by 44 mi I limeters and
weighs 191.1 grams.

Cores:

Discussion

From the analysis of the cores it is apparent that the locally
avai I able cherts were the primary source of raw material. A wider
variety of material, as indicated by the quartzite cores and the
lithic debitage {Tables V.53, V.55, and V.58), is present primarily
outside of the Early Archaic horizons of the site. The large number
of cores from the isolated excavation units suggests that core
reduction was an important activity; however, the distribution (Table
31.5), does not reflect the use of I imited areas for such activities.
Multidirectional and bifacial cores are
the most common
identifiable core types. Except for the bifacial cores (Table V.61),
the size variabi I ity is great. This variability is partially due to
the fact that not al I of the cores were totally exhausted prior to
their discard. Many of the cores merely reflect the size variability
of the locally avai I able chert cobbles, for only a few flakes have
been removed from them.
Modified Debitage/lnformal Tools
The modified debitage from the Brazil Site comprises 3.0% of the
entire I ithic assemblage. The modification, consisting of both types
1 and 2 attrition facets, appears on secondary (n=46) and tertiary
(n=19) flakes, chips (n=49), cores (n=2) and one indeterminate
fragment. Type 1 attrition facets appear on 56.7% of the informal
tools.
Both types 1 and 2 attrition facets occur on an additional 47
specimens (39.2%). Five specimens exhibit Type 2 attrition only
(Tab I e 31. 6) .
TYPE 1 ATTRITION (68 specimens, 77 facets)
Of this large group of specimens exhibiting Type 1 attrition
facets, only nine have more than a single facet. Al I nine exhibit two
attrition facets. Secondary flakes (42.6%) were the primary source of
blanks for these informal tools. Chips (35.3%) were also commonly
used. The remainder of the Type 1 attrition facets (22.1%) appear on
tertiary flakes.
Al I but two of these blanks are of the locally
available cherts. Chalcedony and quartzite are the raw materials for
the remaining two specimens.

The modification of al I of these specimens is unifacial.
The
position of this modification is most commonly the dorsal surface
(69.1%) of the blank. The ventral surface (20.6%) is also frequently
modified. Three specimens exhibit modification on both the dorsal and
ventra I surfaces, wh i Ie the positions of the remaining four . specimens
are indeterminable.
The location of the Type 1 facets is primarily
the lateral edges (52.9%) of the blanks.
Distal edges account for
only
one-fourth
of
these specimens.
Four specimens exhibit
modification on both their lateral and distal edges. The position of
the modification on eleven of the chips is indeterminable.

31-21

BRAZIL SITE
Six types of facet edge outlines were recognized within this
sample.
Straight facet edge outlines that may have served cutting or
scraping purposes appear on 28 specimens (41.2%).
An additional
specimen exhibits a straight edge outline in association with a notch.
Convex outlines which may have served as cutting edges, but more
I ikely as scraping edges, comprise more than one-fourth (26.5%) of the
Type 1 facet edge outlines. Concave edge outlines (14.7%) occur less
frequently.
Combinations of concave and convex outlines appear on an
additional five specimens.
The rema1n1ng six specimens exhibit
irregular edge outlines.
If it may be assumed that the concave and
convex edge outlines were more suited for scraping activities, then
combined frequencies within this sample suggest that scraping and
cutting were equally important extraction activities.
TYPE 2 ATTRITION (5 specimens, 5 facets)
Type 2 attrition appears on two secondary flakes and three chips.
Al I of the blanks are of chert. Unifacial modification is present on
three specimens while bifacial modification is present on
the
rema1n1ng two.
Position of the modification, where determinable, is
equally divided between the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The lateral
edges are the preferred location for this modification. Al I edge
outlines of these specimens are straight.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (67 specimens, 56 facets)
Sixty specimens (85%) exhibit a single facet with types 1 and 2
attrition.
The remaining seven have two facets apiece. Chips (n=25)
served as the primary source of blanks for these informal tools.
Secondary (n=15) and tertiary flakes (n=4), cores (n=2), and one
unidentifiable fragment comprise the remainder of
the sample.
Modification is unifacial except for a single specimen that possesses
both a unifacial and a bifacial facet.
Since so many of these facets occur on chips, the location of a
large
proportion is indeterminable (38.3%).
Fourteen specimens
exhibit facets on a lateral edge only, while nine exhibit facets on a
distal edge. Only two specimens have facets on both their lateral and
distal edges. Another specimen exhibits retouch and use-wear along a
lateral edge and an associated projection.
The remaining three
specimens exhibit retouch and use-wear along their proximal edges.
Location of the modification was certainly more varied on those pieces
that were intentionally modified prior to their uti I ization.
The preferred position of this modification 1s typically the
dorsal surface (70.2%) of the blank. Types 1 and 2 attrition also
appear on the ventral surfaces of three specimens and on both the
ventral and dorsal surfaces of another three specimens. The position

MODIFIED DEBITAGE:

DISCUSSION

The number and variety of informal tools recovered from the
Brazi I Site indicate that a wide range of extraction and maintenance
activities were conducted. Interestingly, the distribution of these
tools (Table 31.7) does not indicate that such activities were limited
to a particular area of the site. In fact, the distribution of the
modified debitage closely parallels that of the flake debris (Table
31.3). The need for such tools was apparently directly related to the
intensity or duration of the occupation of the various areas of the
site.
Secondary flakes and chips were the primary sources of blanks for
the informal tools. Less than half of these blanks were intentionally
modified (39.2%) prior to their utilization.
The sizes of these
blanks according to attrition type is remarkably consistent. Only
flake thickness is significantly different among the three attrition
types (Table V.62). It should be noted, however, that this difference
is I ikely significant only in the statistical sense and not from a
practical standpoint.
Modification of the informal tool blanks is primarily uni facial
1n nature (Table V.63) and occurs most often on the dorsal surface of
the blanks (Table V.64). The characteristic edge outlines - straight,
concave, and convex - dominate this assemblage and are found primarily
on the lateral edges of the blanks. The variety of edge outlines and
locations (tables V.65, V.66) within this assemblage, suggests that a
wide range of extraction and maintenance activities were conducted at
the Brazi I Site. The typical informal tools apparently did not meet
the needs of the inhabitants.

BIFACES (32 specimens)
Thirty-two bifaces and biface fragments, excluding projectile
points, were recovered from the Brazi I Site (Table 31.8). Two-thirds
of these specimens were recovered from the test excavation units
within the floodplain.
The remainder were recovered primarily from
units 13 and 14, near the top of the terrace slope.
Only those
bifaces from the lower levels of EU 22 can be assigned to a given
temporal period with any certainty. The discussion of Early Archaic
bi faces wi I I be presented separately. Those bi faces from units of
unknown or uncertain temporal context wi I I be discussed as a single
group.
Early Archaic Period
Only three bifaces were recovered from an Early Archaic context.
A dril I tip fragment (Form 12), a circular biface (Form 4), and a
preform fragment (Form 10) were recovered from EU 22. The drill tip,
which is diamond shape in cross section and 25 mi I limeters long, was
recovered from the uppermost level, 6, of the Early Archaic horizon.
The rema1n1ng two specimens were recovered near the base of this
horizon (Table 31.8).
The circular biface, which is 46 mi I limeters in diameter and 7
mi I I imeters thick, exhibits pressure retouch and use-wear along its
circumference. The high quality flint that served as the raw material
for this artifact is more commonly found on sites to the northwest in
Eastland County. The preform from level 11 was made from a large
flake blank of locally available chert. Cortex is present on the
dorsal surface. Thinning of the bulbar area and minimal edge trirrvning
were the only modifications accomplished on the ventral surface before
a flaw in the material al lowed the piece to snap in half.
Unknown Temporal Period
Most of the rema1n1ng 29 bifaces and biface fragments are
probably
from an Archaic context.
Unfortunately, the lack of
stratigraphic separation within the several units precludes a reliable
determination.
These specimens wi I I therefore be presented as a
single assemblage.

FORM 7 (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 31.6b) is triangular in shape with straight
edges.
The fine flaking pattern has produced a serrated effect along
the blade edges.
The specimen has been basally thinned and is
slightly recurved in form. In preliminary studies of this site, this
bi face was identified as a Tortugas projectile point (Suhm and Jelks
1962:249), but its style of manufacture and extreme thinness show no
resemblance to the generally thicker and often beveled triangular
point found throughout South Central and South Texas. It is much
closer in form to the Friday knife as defined by Jelks (1962).
If
this is true, this specimen would be one of only two Late Prehistoric
diagnostics recovered from the site. The other is an arrow point tip
found in level 2 of EU 20 located, interestingly enough, adjacent to
EU 21 where this specimen was recovered from level 3.
FORM 8 (10 specimens)
These thick and irregular shaped bifaces represent the rejected
pieces of an early stage of bifacial reduction. Six are fragments
exhibiting transverse breaks. Five of these fragments exhibit cortex.
Pressure retouch and use-wear is present on only one fragment.
The remaining complete bifaces are very different 1n shape and
size.
One is very thick in cross section (12 mm) and exhibits cortex
along one edge. Two edges of its form also exhibit considerable
use-wear.
Another specimen is much thinner in cross section (7 mm)
and very irregular in shape. No use-wear is evident.
FORM 9 (2 specimens)
Even though these biface fragments exhibit cortex on one or more
surfaces, both exhibit well shaped, lenticular cross sections. The
fragment from EU 20 was produced from a flake blank, for the cortex
platform is sti I I present. The transverse breaks exhibited by both
specimens indicate that they were discarded fol lowing production
errors.
FORM 10 (5 specimens)
Four of these five specimens were recovered from units 20 and 21
(Table 31.8). The only complete Form 10 biface was recovered from the
surface of EU 21. Al I of the specimens are moderately thick in cross
section (5-10 mm) and exhibit pressure retouch and/or use-wear. Some
of these specimens might be recognized as Form 8 bifaces;
however,
their overal I symmetry of cross section and shape are more compatible
with the Form 10 criteria.

Four of these specimens represent portions of finely flaked
tools.
Two specimens from EU 20 and one from EU 21 may be fragments
of dart points, while the fragment from EU 18 is either a portion of
an arrow point or a smal I dart point. The remaining specimens are
less wel I finished. The single specimen from EU 19 has been badly
burned.
Three fragments were apparently discarded prior to the
preforming stage.
FORM 14 (2 specimens)
This additional category has been included to characterize two
biface fragments with scraper retouch and use-wear along one or more
edges.
The smaller fragment, with a single scraper edge, was
recovered from level 6 of EU 13.
The other, which exhibits two
working facets, was recovered from the floodplain (EU 20, level 1).
Unfortunately, neither of these tools is associated with temporally
diagnostic artifacts.
Bifaces:

Discussion

Eight categories of bifacial forms were recovered from the Brazi I
Site.
Three categories are represented in the Early Archaic context
of EU 22 alone. It is also only within this Early context that
non-local f I int serves as the raw material for bi facial tools. This
type of f I int is more commonly found in sites lying northwest of the
Brazos River drainage. The limited sample of bifaces from the Early
Archaic horizon is dominated by specialized forms (12 and 4).
The larger sample (n=29) of bifaces from an unknown or mixed
temporal context contains six forms. The several specimens of forms
8, 9, and 10 represent the discard of blanks and preforms that were
not suitable for further reduction. Only five of the specimens of
this larger sample represent portions of finished tools. In addition,
two bifaces with scraper retouch along one or more edges are unique to
this sample.
Given the concern of the previous investigations (Lynott and
Peter 1977; Skinner et al. 1978) with the modes of bifacial reduction
represented within the Aqui Ila Lake assemblages, it is noteworthy that
two of the bifaces retain evidence of the initial blank form. One
specimen from a definite Early Archaic context in EU 22 and another
from a mixed Archaic context in EU 20 exhibit definite traits of flake
blanks. It is therefore evident that bifacial core reduction and
prepared core reduction were both uti Ii zed during the Archaic Period.
Given the present analytical framework, however, the dominance of

either mode cannot be documented.

Projectile Points (19 specimens)
With the exception of a single possible arrow point distal
fragment, al I of the specimens described here are dart points or dart

analysis of the projectile points from the Brazi I Site, typological
assignments were made for almost three-fourths of the specimens.
Although most of the specimens can be wedged into existing categories,
they are generally atypical and at the extreme ends
of
the
distribution of forms and varieties found in the standard Central
Texas projectile point typology. In keeping with the stated intent of
this report to understand the relationship of the Aqui I la area to the
surrounding region, a more conservative typology has been fol lowed.
Although more than half of the specimens have been typed, qualifiers
have been added in half of these cases to reflect the extreme ranges
of form and potential misidentification represented by these points.
The artifacts described 1n this chapter include only those
collected during the 1978 excavation season. Nine dart points and
dart point fragments collected 1n previous
investigations are
described in a few paragraphs at the end of this section. Most of
these specimens are from the surface or from shovel tests and their
relationship
to the excavated specimens is unclear.
They are
described here in order to increase the overal I sample of projectile
points from the site. They are not, however, included in the counts
of material from the site, so as not to bias those numbers.
ARROW POINTS (1 specimen)
This fragmentary specimen, recovered from level 2 of EU 21, is
the apparent distal portion of an arrow point. It is made from chert
and is finely chipped bifacial ly. Identification as a probable arrow
point is based on its extreme thinness.

Bulverde-I ike (1 specimen)
The fragmented distal portion of this specimen, recovered from
level 2 of EU 20, exhibits some small flake scars and may have been
reworked or utilized after being fractured. The specimen (Fig. 31.6b)
has a triangular, asymmetrical blade with slightly irregular edges.
One shoulder is weak (perhaps reworked after a previous fracture?),
while the other has a short barb. The squarish stem has straight
edges and a slightly concave base. Stem edges and base are slightly
ground. The stem is wedge shaped in the characteristic manner of many
Bulverde specimens (Suhm and Jelks 1962:169).
In general, the
specimen, which also shows some affinities with the Carrollton type,
is somewhat smaller and I ighter than the Bulverde type of Central
Texas.
Although this variation may simply be the result of smaller
local source materials in the Aqui I la Lake area, it is thought best to
retain the qualifier with the type name.
Dari-I ike (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 31.6c), recovered from level 1 of EU 20, has
a narrow triangular blade, prominent, but somewhat asymmetrical
shoulders and a rectangular stem.
One lateral edge of the blade
appears to have been reworked. Stem edges and base are straight and
slightly ground. Although this relatively small projectile point fits
wel I within the Dari category, with its ground stem edges and slightly
rectangular stem~might be taken as a variant of the Dawson type.
Its position in the apparently disturbed level 1 1s no clear
indication that it belongs to the later period.
Gary (1 specimen)
This fragmentary specimen, recovered from level 2 of EU 13,
possesses a slender triangular blade with straight to slightly convex
edges. The unbroken shoulder is quite prominent and the base of the
long, narrow contracting stem is unaltered, exhibiting the cortex
platform of the flake blank. The presence of such an unaltered stem
base is not unusual from the Blackland Prairie region of Central
Texas. Several contracting stem specimens from the Aquil la Lake area
exhibit this technological trait.

BRAZIL SITE
Godley (1 specimen)
This smal I fragmentary point was recovered from level 5 of EU 16
1n the upper terrace area of the site. The distal portion was broken
and subsequently retouched. The narrow triangular blade has straight
edges and strong shoulders. The smal I bulbous stem has concave edges
and a strongly convex base. The base is beveled, twisting slightly.
Although smal I, the basal form of this specimen fits well with other
Godley specimens from the Aqui I la Lake area.
Gower (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 31.6d), from level 9 of EU 22, is the deepest
diagnostic artifact recovered from any of the excavations at the site.
Manufactured from a I ight tan, waxy chert, this point has a narrow
triangular blade with a broken tip. The blade is beveled, twisting to
the right.
Shoulders are asymmetrical, one is weak, the other
prominent.
The long, slightly expanding stem has a deep concavity in
its base. As in many other Gower specimens, this concavity is
unifacial ly chipped from one face.
Stem edges and base are wel I
ground.
Kent-like (1 specimen)
This unusual specimen, recovered from level 5 of EU 21, appears
to be the stem and a portion of blade which snapped off of a larger
projectile point. It appears, however, than an attempt was made to
remanufacture the fragmentary specimen into a smaller point. Whether
it was ever used in this fractured and partially reworked state is
unclear.
The stem is heavy and square with slightly convex edges and
base, giving it a rounded appearance. Stem edges are slightly ground.
Although the type assignment cannot be anything but tenuous, the
somewhat crudely shaped stem suggests the Kent style, although without
the original blade, it is difficult to be certain.
Plainview (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 31.6e) was recovered from level 8 of EU 22,
just above the Gower point described above. Its distal portion is
missing, apparently from impact.
The lateral snap fracture shows
signs of being shattered and several impact scars originate at the
fracture edge. Blade edges have been reworked with a slight alternate
bevel.
The reworked portion, which begins a little more than a
centimeter above the base, is slightly indented from the original
blade shape. The base is slightly concave and wel I ground, as are the
lateral edges of the base below the remanufacture.
Although this
projectile point has been termed a Meserve in preliminary reports of
this excavation, the Meserve type, which may be related to Dalton and

other Paleoindian projectile point types (Goodyear 1982; Myers and
Lambert 1983), could easily be misidentified. Since it only occurs at
this site as a single specimen overlying an Early Archaic Gower type,
it was thought more proper to label this specimen as a reworked
Plainview.
Uvalde (1 specimen)
:his badly fragmented specimen (Fig. 31.6f), from level 6 of EU
22, 1s tentatively assigned to the Uvalde type. It has a narrow
triangular blade with the distal portion missing. The irregular edges
may have resulted from reuse as a scraping tool, judging from the
unifacial flake scars along the uneven edges.
Both
shoulders
(barbed?) are broken. The stem expands slightly to a concave base and
stem edges are ground.
Wei Is (1 specimen)
This smal I specimen (Fig. 31.6g), from level 6 of EU 22 with the
Uvalde point described above, 1s fragmentary, missing the extreme
distal portion and one shoulder. The blade, narrow triangular and
short, would have been about the same length as the stem. The
remaining shoulder is slight but may also have been broken somewhat.
The long contracting stem is relatively wel I made with ground edges.
Yarbrough-like (3 specimens)
These three smal I expanding stem projectile points represent
perhaps the single most common projectile point type at the site.
Although somewhat different from each other, and not quite approaching
the form of the classic East Texas Yarbrough point (Johnson 1962),
they exhibit some definite similarities and may be related in some
manner.
The largest of the three (Fig. 31.Sh), and perhaps the most
like the classic type, was recovered from level 2 of EU 20, the same
level as the arrow point fragment and two possible Middle Archaic
specimens.
It has a triangular blade with straight edges and

straight, slants strongly upward to one side. Stem edges and base are
ground.
The third specimen (Fig. 31.6i), from level 4 of EU 22, is
the smallest dart point recovered from the site. Although the blade
of this specimen may have been reworked slightly, it was undoubtedly
originally quite small and is only tentatively included with this

The blade is short and triangular with slightly convex edges
and prominent shoulders. The stem expands slightly to a slightly
convex base. Stem edges do not appear to be ground.
Miscellaneous Barbed (1 specimen)
This specimen, from level 5 of EU 18, has a short triangular
blade with slightly concave edges and one prominent barb remaining.
The stem expands but the base has been snapped off, making it
difficult to assign this point to a formal type. In many respects,
however, this well made specimen resembles a Marcos point.
Miscellaneous Notched (1 specimen)
This small fragment, recovered from Level 6 of EU 14, is missing
its distal portion, including most of the midsection of the point. It
has a narrow blade with weak shoulders formed by shallow side notches
just above the base.
The base itself has a slightly recurved look
because of a large single thinning flake removed from the center of an
otherwise apparently convex base.
Inside edges of the notches are
slightly ground. It is manufactured from a reddish-brown grainy chert
or fine grain quartzite. It is difficult to assign this point to any
known type. If its depth in the site is a val id indicator of its age,
it may date from the Middle or Early Archaic. Its basal form does
show some similarities to Uvalde and Hoxie projectile points recovered
from the Aqui I la Lake area.
Miscellaneous Stemmed (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 31.6j) was recovered from level 2 of EU 20.
It has a short, broad asymmetrical blade with wide strong shoulders.
The thick heavy stem expands slightly to a straight base with a
shallow notch removed from its central portion. Although the form of
the point is essentially untypable, the base resembles a crude effort
to duplicate a Montel I point. The heavy feel of this point and its
thickness compare well with Middle Archaic or early Late Archaic
specimens from the project area such as Bulverde, Carrol Iton,
Castrovi I le and Pedernales, although it cannot be taken as an
unquestionable diagnostic of that period.
Dart Point Fragments (3 specimens)
Three unidentifiable dart point fragments were collected from the
site.
Two of these specimens are stem bases and the third is a
lateral notch fragment. The deepest of these three was recovered from
level 5 of EU 21, the same level as the Kent-I ike point described
above. This fragment is the base of a smal I expanding stem point with
a convex base.
Given the distinctiveness of this form and its
31-34

BRAZIL SITE
relatively common occurrence in the Aqui I la Lake area as only one
type, this stem fragment can be tentatively suggested to be from a
Godley point.
A second base was recovered from level 1 of EU 14.
It 1s
slightly wider than the previously described specimen, with expanding
stem edges and a straight base. This specimen, made from a beige
grainy chert, is similar 1n form to the stem bases of the smal I
Yarbrough-like points from the Brazi I Site and elsewhere in the
Aqui I la Lake area. Since this basal form is not unique to this point,
however, such an assignment is highly speculative.
The
third
fragment, a lateral notch, was recovered from level 2 of EU 20. It is
apparently one side of the stem and a portion of a strong shoulder or
barb.
The stem would have apparently been generally rectangular with
straight edges and a straight or very slightly convex base. The edges
are slightly ground. This fragment is thermally altered.
Previously Defined Dart Points
A total of nine specimens were found in the previous collections
and these are briefly mentioned here as a comparison to the points
recovered from the 1978 excavations. Note again that these specimens
are not included in any of the site totals. Three specimens were
collected during the 1977 excavation season, while the remainder came
from the 1972 survey and the 1975 testing. These include Godley,
Wei Is and Yarbrough. The Godley specimen is large, with shoulders
just slightly more prominent than is usual for the type. The Wei Is
point (labeled incorrectly but i I lustrated in Skinner et al. 1978:81,
Fig. 27m) is very wel I made, with slight projections for shoulders, a
long contracting stem and a squarish base. Two projectile points from
the group are similar to the Yarbrough-I ike points described above.
Both have narrow triangular blades with moderate shoulders and
expanding stems with straight, but slightly slanted, stem bases.

Two are side notched. One of these, with deeper

notches and a stem slightly narrower than the blade, is reminiscent of
the Palmi I las type. A third specimen (also labeled incorrectly but
i I lustrated
in Skinner et al. 1978:81, Fig. 27n) has a narrow
triangular blade with weak shoulders, slightly concave stem edges and
a slightly concave base. This point may have been reworked. Stem and
basal edges are lightly ground. Its poorly defined, large base is
similar to the Travis type common to Central Texas, but it is much
shorter than is usual for this type. Nonetheless, it is thought to be
a probable Middle Archaic diagnostic. Two other points from the site
have smal I, squarish stems. One, made of quartzite, has a smal I
triangular blade with strong shoulders and a narrow stem, from which

PROJECTILE POINTS:

DISCUSSION

Projectile points represent only about 0.5% of the total I ithic
assemblage, only slightly lower than the 0.6% average for al I the
intensively investigated sites at Aqui I la Lake.
How much of this
percentage has been affected by known collecting activities at the
site is unknown. Two floodplain sites with the greater portion of
their cultural material protected by burial (Reps Davis and McDonald)
are tied for the second highest percentage of projectile points with
On the other hand, at 41HI109, a site almost totally surficial
0.8%.
and certain to have been collected over the years, projectile points
were 1.2% of the total.
In any case, it is clear that projectile points, which perform
such a critical function in archeological interpretations, were
discarded only infrequently at the major sites 1n the Aquilla Lake
area.
Of the 18 dart points from the 1978 excavations at the Brazil
Site, only four are complete. It is assumed that these four were lost
rather than discarded. Of the 14 remaining specimens, it would have
been impossible to resharpen only four.
These are assumed to be
discarded.
The rema1n1ng ten specimens al I have some potential for
reuse, missing a barb or a distal end or both. Had these been hafted,
most could have been refinished without removing them from the shaft.
This leads to the speculation that perhaps these specimens represent
cases
where the hafting may have loosened or broken and the
combination cost of repair of hafting and point were greater than the
cost of beginning anew. Alternately, and perhaps more likely, these
specimens may have been unintentionally lost just as the complete
specimens were.
More importantly, it is suggested that rehafting dart points was
not a common activity at the Brazi I Site or at many of the main sites
investigated at Aqui I la Lake.
Despite the presence of
large
quantities of lithic debris at the site, suggesting the manufacture of
stone tools in some quantities (certainly more than the fifty odd
projectile points and bifaces recovered), basal fragments of obviously
discarded and rehafted projectile points were rare.
The projectile point collection represents a long span of time,
perhaps as much as 5000 years or more. Although much work is needed
to fully understand the spatial and temporal implications of the
diagnostic points of the Central Brazos region, most of the Brazi I
Site diagnostics seem to represent the Late Archaic Period.

increase in numbers may represent the Late Archaic population increase
postulated by Skinner et al. (1978).
While Early Archaic points are not present at the site 1n any
great numbers, they are definitely present.
More Early Archaic
diagnostics were excavated from this site than from any other in the
project area.
Moreover, these specimens were recovered from wel I
below the plow zone in a stratum that yielded no diagnostics of later
periods, suggesting a possibly intact Early Archaic cultural zone.
Such intact buried strata are extremely rare in the Aqui I la Lake area.
In contrast, recognizable Middle Archaic diagnostics are somewhat
rare at the site.
Two specimens from the 1978 excavations, a
Bulverde-I ike point and another broad stemmed point (the miscellaneous
stemmed specimen above), were recovered from level 2 of EU 20, along
with other apparent Late Archaic types and a possible arrow point
fragment.
These plow zone levels are certainly disturbed, but it
cannot be determined whether Middle Archaic debris is mixed with the
Late Archaic debris or whether these earlier points may have been
undisturbed
Late
picked up, as the Bulverde-like specimen in
Prehistoric levels at the McDonald Site appears to have been. In any
case, the Middle Archaic seems under represented at the Brazi I Site,
as it does to some degree throughout the project area. It is
currently felt that this is partially due to a lack of recognition of
Middle Archaic diagnostic styles in this area, but there may also have
been a tendency toward less frequent use of the area during that time.
Another period under represented at the Brazi I Site is the Late
Prehistoric.
Only one tentative arrow point fragment was recovered
during the several seasons of investigations. No ceramics are known
to have been recovered. This paucity of Late Prehistoric diagnostics
is mirrored in the other Aqui I la Lake site which yielded a significant
Early Archaic component, the Sul I ivan Site. The large and almost
uniquely Archaic private collections from each of these sites suggests
that some critical settlement pattern variable had changed by the
onset of the Late Prehistoric, making these areas less desirable
habitation loci.
HAMMERSTONES
Five quartzite hammerstones were recovered from the Brazi I Site.
Two were recovered from the surface and the remainder from units 14
and 22 (Table V.67). The battering has caused the removal of smal I
portions (5-10~) of two of the cobbles. Two facets are present on
three of the cobbles, while the remaining specimens exhibit one and
three facets, respectively. The mean weight of these specimens is 327
grams.

BRAZIL SITE
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
The Brazi I Site included portions of two historic farms with a
fencel ine bisecting the site.
The upland portion of Mr. Sessum's
property was originally recorded as a separate site with a second,
larger site recorded downslope on the Brazi I property. At the time of
the original survey, there were standing
structures
on
both
properties.
The Brazi I house (Fig. 31.7a) appears to have been a
balloon frame structure with board and batten siding.
The structure
on
the Sessum's property may have been a dwelling, however,
information recorded on it was minimal.
The photograph in Figure
31.7b shows it to be a modest structure, whatever its use.
In addition to the standing structures and the fencel ine, a wel I
and a manmade earthen levee are easily identified historic features.
The levee was bui It to protect the lower portion of the field, where
the floodplain portion of the site lies, from overbank flooding. The
historic artifacts described below were mixed with
prehistoric
material in a context that may have been a dump or trash pit area, or
may have resulted from repeated plowing over a rubbish
heap.
Twenty-eight of the 141 artifacts are from a subsurface context, with
the remainder collected from the surface.
The assemblage contains
smal I sherds of bottle glass, ceramics, and some window glass and
building hardware. This material was excavated from units 10, 13, 14,
clearly close enough to either the Brazi I house or the other structure
to be associated with them.
One rather remarkable find, a Chinese brass coin dating from the
1850s, is shown in Figure 31.8a. These coins may have come in with
the Chinese who were hired by the various rai I roads as construction
workers.
Between 1879 and 1905 no fewer than seven rai I roads built
lines through Hi II County. It would seem that either a Chinese worker
engaged on one of these projects, or an Anglo worker who had some
contact with the large Chinese rai I laying crews that worked in West
Texas (Briggs 1974), traded the coin to the landowner or one of his
children as a curiosity. No doubt it was lost and not intentionally
discarded.
Of the 141 historic artifacts in the site assemblage, 72~ were
from the surface of the terrace ridge and slope. The remainder was
recovered from test excavation units 10, 13, and 14 (Table 31.9).
Glass fragments (n=81) constitute the major portion of the historic
assemblage. Metal objects consisting of nai Is, bolts, sheet metal
fragments, and more finely finished items, such as clothes fasteners
and a gear from a watch, are the second most frequent class. Domestic
earthenware and stoneware (n=12) are the only other class of artifacts
represented by more than a single specimen.

Clear glass fragments predominate the glass assemblage, but
brown, amethyst and aqua glass are also wel I represented. One broken
flask was reconstructed and identified as

It is of brown glass with a rectangular inset panel
that once contained the label. It was blown in a two piece mold and
has a hand turned neck. This type of medicine bottle dates prior to
World War I and is described in detail by Brose (1967:100).

BRAZIL SITE
Although most of the metal objects are either nai Is or sheet
metal fragments, the presence of clothing fasteners and eyes, gears
for a watch, and a Chinese coin suggest that the site served as a
discard area for a domestic structure.
The Chinese 1 cash coin
(Fig. 31.Sa) is particularly interesting.
The coin was minted at
Peking (Pei Ching) and issued during the reign of Emperor Hsien-feng
Tung Pao (1851-1862).
The historic occupation of the site area probably occurred
between the last quarter of the nineteenth and the early part of the
twentieth century. A variety of artifacts supports this conclusion.
Wire nai Is, which became the dominant nai I type in the 1890s, are the
predominant type recovered. The several fragments of amethyst glass
were also most common between 1880 and 1914 (Kendrick 1966:57). In
addition, the reconstructed medicine bottle dates prior to World War I

terrace ridge was occupied between 1890 and 1914. The lower portion
of the slope around the house apparently served as the dump area for
broken and unwanted objects.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The limited test excavations have revealed that the Brazi I Site
was primarily occupied during the Archaic Period.
An Historic
occupation of the terrace ridge also occurred around the turn of the
century.
Artifact collections suggest that the site was utilized
during the Paleoindian and the much later Neo-American periods.
Unfortunately, testing has revealed that few areas contain in situ
assemblages. The ridge portion, which yielded both the earliest and
latest prehistoric artifacts, contains no areas with definite in situ
assemblages. Only the lack of Early Archaic diagnostic artifacts----irl
units 14 and 16 suggests that an undisturbed Late Archaic assemblage
may be present. The churning of the sandy deposits by both cultural
and natural processes certainly limits the potential of the terrace
ridge to yield significant data.
The central portion of the floodplain has also yielded a mixed
assemblage of Late and Early Archaic artifacts. Only within the
southern portion of the site are the deposits over a meter 1n depth
with clear evidence of cultural stratigraphy. The sample from this
area is relatively smal I, but certain patterns for the Early and Late

almost the sole source of raw material. Some of this chert, however,
is a very waxy material that is commonly found on sites in the
Eastland County area and not in the Aqui I la drainage. During the Late
Archaic chert is sti I I the dominant raw material, but a wider variety
of materials (si I icified wood, chalcedony and quartz) is also

minimally represented. Although the overal I assemblage composition is
consistent throughout the site, more specialized bifacial tools are
represented within the Early Archaic deposits. A dri I I and a circular
bi face were recovered from the Early Archaic context, while blanks and
preforms were the primary bifacial forms recovered from the Late
Archaic contexts.
Other than these differences, the activities conducted at the
Brazi I Site were remarkably consistent throughout the Archaic Period.
Core reduction was an important activity at the site, although a
higher proportion of primary flakes were recovered from the terrace
ridge and slope and the central portion of the floodplain.
Since
unfinished bifacial forms also form such a large portion (39.5%) of
the tool assemblage, it is evident that the initial reduction of
cobbles was a primary activity. The large proportion of hammerstones
(2.8%) in the tool assemblage reflects such activity. The presence of
a large number of tertiary flakes (57.8%), however, indicates that the
final shaping of bifaces was also conducted.
Although the heterogeneity of the modified debitage from the
Brazi I Site suggests a very broad range of cutting and scraping
activities, the tool assemblage exhibits I ittle diversity.
Modified

stone was recovered. This limited assemblage is slightly misleading,
however. Previous investigations of the southern portion of the site
(Lynott and Peter 1977:62) revealed the additional presence of
gravers, notches and scrapers. Nevertheless, the limited range of
tools together with the relatively low artifact densities across this
expansive site, suggest that it was intermittently utilized as a short
term hunting camp.
The lack of features, a wel I developed midden
zone, and a diversified tool kit certainly are not characteristic of
intensive or long term uti I ization.
The two smal I historic structures and their associated debris
seem to date to after the rai I road economic development of the region.
Smal I farms worked by one man and his mule could make a modest living
for a family. That this I ife was not totally devoid of the luxuries
is evidenced by the gear from a watch, fragments of good ironstone
tableware and patterned glassware sherds. As farming developed into
more of a sharply competitive business and less a way of I ife, these
smal I family farms ceased to be economically viable as independent
operations and have fallen into ruin.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI76 is on top of an isolated terrace remnant on the
modern
floodplain,
approximately
2.4 kilometers north of the
confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks.
The site 1s largely
confined to the upper surface of the terrace at an elevation of about
163 meters MSL. On the south and west sides of the terrace remnant,
however, cultural materials are found to an elevation of about 155
meters. The entire site covers an area of about 29,000 square meters
on Coving-Vaughan Complex loamy fine sand to fine sandy loam.
The site is in the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic province and 1s
surrounded by the modern floodplain. It is approximately 300 meters
west of the modern Aqui I la Creek channel and 150-300 meters east of an
active seep spring on an adjacent tributary stream. This location
provided an ideal base from which to exploit both the upland Cross
Timbers environment and the lowland forests, while providing a wel I
drained campsite with easy access to water.
41HI76 has been subjected to a variety of post-depositional
impacts that have differentially affected the cultural deposits. Most
of the site has been plowed and the top of the terrace is heavily
eroded, approximately 30-40 centimeters of top soi I has been removed.
A farm road was cut through the southern portion and a substantial
accumulation of soi 1, resulting from downslope movement, is apparent
along a partially buried fenceline running through the western third
of the site.
The northern and eastern sides of the terrace are
presently overgrown with post oak and scattered mesquite.

41HI76
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site has been known to local collectors for many years and
has been subjected to intensive surface collection (Skinner et
al. 1978). Lynott and Peter (1977:65) report that, according to the
former land owner, "a large collection of projectile points, manos and
metates was removed from the site in the 1930s".
The site was originally recorded by SMU personnel (x41HI62) 1n
1972 (Skinner and Henderson 1972).
Subsequent work by SMU was
undertaken during 1975 when 16 shovel tests were excavated to define
the I imits of the site and determine whether any buried deposits
remained intact. Only a single flake was recovered from a subsurface
context by these excavations.
DATA COLLECTION
The Texas Archeological Survey undertook controlled surface
collections and limited excavation on 41HI76 during 1979, expending 42
person-days at the site 1n November.
At that time two areas
previously designated as separate sites were grouped together as a
single site.
Surface collections were conducted by first spatially stratifying
the site into 69 20 by 20 meter units with a sample circle 4 meters in
diameter randomly selected 1n each and completely collected, as
described in Chapter 8.
To facilitate collection, each circle was
cleared of vegetation.
Collection units were
established
and
collected 1n 58 of these units (Fig. 32.1). The other 11 sampling
units were not collected either due to their highly disturbed nature
{in the road cut) or because they were so overgrown with brush,
greenbriar and mustang grapes as to require inordinate amounts of time
to establish and clear them.
Once al I units had been collected, seven 1 by 1 meter test pits
were located on various parts of the site. Areas that showed the
greatest potential for the definition of disturbance factors and
intact deposits were specifically selected.
Al I test pits were
located in accordance with the procedures presented in Chapter 8.
Excavations were conducted in arbitrary 20 centimeter levels.
Excavation Unit 1
This unit was placed at the northeastern edge of the site in a
group of large oak trees on the assumption that this area was less
I ikely to have been disturbed by agricultural activities (Fig. 32.1).
The northwest corner of this unit corresponds to the center of surface

CU 3. Five centimeters below the surface, a very compact argi I lie
horizon was encountered, that appears to be a remnant B horizon. From
its position on the T3 terrace, a wel I developed B horizon would
predate any possible occupation of this area. The very low yield of
cultural materials from this unit supports such an interpretation.
This unit was therefore abandoned after excavating only 0.05 cubic
meters.
Excavation Unit 2
The center of surf ace CU 10 served as the northwest corner of TU
2.
It is 1n the north central part of the site near the edge of a
large, previously cultivated field. Cultural materials were recovered
only in very smal I quantities. A total of 0.8 cubic meters of fi I I
was removed.
Excavation Unit 3
This unit was placed in an area that appeared to have been only
minimally disturbed by agricultural activities (Fig. 32.1).
The
northwest corner of the unit was located at the center point of
surface CU 11. No materials were recovered from the surface of this
unit, and only seven pieces of lithic debitage were recovered from the
excavated fil I. Five of the pieces were found in or above a level at
the base of the excavation that contained significantly more gravel
than the overlying strata. This horizon probably represents a stratum
deposited when the terrace was a part of the active floodplain.
The
presence of cultural materials from 60 to 80 centimeters below the
surface in association with a stratum that must predate the earliest
possible occupation can probably be attributed to the intense rodent
activity found at this site. A total of 0.8 cubic meters of f i I I was
excavated from this unit.
Excavation Unit 4
Located with its northwest corner at the center of surface CU 2,
this excavation unit is in a previously cultivated field. The surface
collection of CU 2 did not yield any cultural materials, and only 16
pieces of debitage were recovered from the excavations. At about 50
centimeters below the surface, a compact, sandy clay horizon was
exposed.
Lithic debris was recovered from this level, but did not
extend below 60-65 centimeters into a second, more compact, zone.
In
both of these zones there was an increase in manganese concretions and
iron oxide mottling with depth. These strata probably represent a
remnant B horizon that may correspond to the one exposed in EU 1, 31
meters to the northeast.

32-4

41HI76
Excavation Unit 5
The northwest corner of this unit corresponds to the center of CU
34, in an area that has been previously cultivated. The quantity of
lithic debitage is significantly greater than that from any of the
previous units.
A concentration of oxidized sandstone from about 35
to 45 centimeters below the surface was designated as Feature 1.
The
majority of the debitage was concentrated above the base of Feature 1.
This unit was excavated to a depth of 80 centimeters.
Excavation Unit 6
This unit was located along the southeastern edge of the site
with its northwest corner at the center of surface CU 47. The
excavated fi I I produced the greatest quantity of lithic debitage of
any of the seven units in spite of the fact that only 0.6 cubic meters
were removed.
A concentration of oxidized sandstone, designated
Feature 2, was encountered at a depth of from 40 to 45 centimeters
below the surface. It extended into the south wal I and was further
exposed in EU 7.
Excavation Unit 7
In order to more fully expose Feature 2, this unit was opened as
an extension of EU 6, southward.
It also had a relatively high
density of lithic debitage.
Feature 2 was
found
to
extend
approximately 40 centimeters into this unit, and as in EU 6, most of
the I ithic debitage was concentrated above the feature. Both units 6
and 7 were excavated to a depth of about 60 centimeters below the
surface. Due to the gradually sloping surface from north to south,
slightly less than 0.6 cubic meters of fi I I was removed from EU 7.
Surface Collection Units
The frequency of materials recovered from the surface collection
units was very low, with only 19 of 58 units (32.8%) containing lithic
debris. Of these 19 units, two contained 40%, while the remaining 17
units had a mean frequency of only 2.8 pieces of I ithic debris. The
80 pieces of lithic deb~is recovered from the surface constitute 13.8%
of the chips, and 46.7% of the modified debitage. Figure 32.2 shows
the distribution of surface materials at the site.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Cultural Features
Two features were encountered during the testing of this site.
Both
consist
of concentrations of oxidized sandstone and are
associated with general lithic debris, but no diagnostic materials or
charcoal.
FEATURE 1
This feature was a poorly defined concentration of oxidized
sandstone that occurred at a depth of from 30 to 50 centimeters below
the modern surface in EU 5 (Fig. 32.3a).
The disposition of the
sandstone
fragments
indicates
that
there
has
been minimal
post-depositional displacement. The feature appeared to have been
deposited on a sloping surface similar to that of the modern ground
surface. The high degree of oxidation of the sandstone indicates an
exposure to high temperatures.
The absence of charcoal or other
carbonized materials is most I ikely the result of natural pedogenic
processes t,hat could remove these materials from the upper horizons of
the very sandy soi I. The pale brown stain present below the heaviest
concentration of sandstone in the northeast corner of the unit may be
organic, but probably represents iron staining from the oxidized
sandstone comprising the feature.
The dispersed nature of this feature and the smal I area exposed
by
excavation
make
interpretation
difficult.
The
primary
concentration of sandstone seems to have a southwest to northeast
orientation.
This feature 1s interpreted as the remains of one or
more hearths.
FEATURE 2
This feature was located in units 6 and 7 at a depth of 31 to 48
centimeters
below the surface (Fig. 32.3b).
It consists of a
concentration of oxidized sandstone
with
little evidence of
post-depositional disturbance. The presence of an iron nail from the
level immediately below 1s probably the result
of
a
rodent
disturbance, but its recovery from the screen precludes a definite
determination. Rodent activity did not appear to have seriously
disrupted this feature. No charcoal or organic staining are present;
however, the basal fragment of a dart point, one unifacial scraper,
one ovate thin biface, one quartzite hammerstone and a variety of
flakes and chips were recovered from the vicinity of the feature.
Feature 2 closely resembles Feature 1 in that it is a concentration of
oxidized sandstone with a southwest to northeast orientation.

Feature 2,

41HI76

feature 1s somewhat less dispersed than Feature 1, but like that
feature it exhibits evidence of in situ fracturing, probably as the
result of exposure to high temperatures. The presence of an obviously
heat fractured quartzite cobble and a significant proportion of burned
flakes and chips also support a conjecture of in situ burning. The
overwhelming evidence, therefore, is that this feature"Ts the remnant
of a hearth which, due to the sandy nature of the soils on this site,
does not include charcoal or other organic remains.
FEATURES:

DISCUSSION

It is not possible on the basis of the avai I able evidence to
securely date these features.
The presence of a dart point basal
fragment from Feature 2 suggests the feature can be assigned to the
Archaic.
Both features can be interpreted to be the remains of
hearths.
Skinner (1971) has reported a series of very similar, but more
extensively excavated, features from sites in the Possum Kingdom
Reservoir which he also interpreted as hearths.
Hearth features at
the Aiken, Bluebonnet and Lowden sites are associated with secondary
features, circular middens and circular arrangements
of
stone
surrounding central hearths that together suggest the remains of
structures (Skinner 1971:168-171, 190-198, 211-216). The hearths at
41HI76 may be similarly associated but the I imited excavations do not
al low a definitive determination.
Lithic Debris
The lithic assemblage from 41HI76 comprises both flaked and
battered stone.
In general, there appears to be little difference
between the materials collected from the surface and those excavated
from units 1 through 7, but a chi-square comparison of the lipped
versus uni ipped flakes from the surface and subsurface samples
indicates that there may be a significant difference between these two
contexts (Table 32.1).
These chi-square results indicate that
substantially lower proportions of I ipped flakes were found in the
surface sample than would be expected.
To further evaluate any
potential differences between the surface and subsurface collections,
the analysis presented here wi II deal with these contexts both
separately and as a single assemblage, to better characterize the
lithic debris from the site.

FLAKES (239 specimens)
Primary Flakes (6 specimens)
No primary flakes were recovered from the surface.
Primary
flakes comprise only 2.5% of the entire flake assemblage, chert being
the predominant material (4 of 6 flakes). None of the primary flakes
have ventral platform lips.

Secondary Flakes (102 specimens)
Secondary flakes comprise 42.7% of the flakes, with 83.3% (85
flakes) from a subsurface context.
Four platform types occur on
secondary flakes, but multiple facet platforms comprise over 50%.
There is no significant difference in the frequency of platform types
between the surface and subsurface contexts (Table 32.2).
Ventral
platform lips occur on approximately one-third of al I secondary
flakes, but do not exhibit significant contextual differences (Table
Chert is the predominant material, only six quartzite and one
V.68).
chalcedony flake being recovered from the entire site (Table V.69).
There is no significant difference in the distribution of lithic
materials between the surface and subsurface contexts.
Tertiary Flakes (131 specimens)
Tertiary flakes were the most common flake type, comprising 54.8%
of al I flakes, and were recovered from both surface and subsurface
contexts. Three platform types occur on tertiary flakes;
however,
only a single example of a ground platform was recovered. Almost 90%
of the tertiary flakes had multiple facet platforms (Table 32.2).
There are no contextual differences in the distribution of platform
types. Of the tertiary flakes, 98% (128 flakes) are chert.
Two
quartzite and one chalcedony flake were also recovered. More than
one-third of al I tertiary flakes had ventral platform I ips.
The
contextual variation in the ventral platform I ips, noted above, is
most apparent in the tertiary flakes, as can be seen from a comparison
of the row percentages in Table V.68.
Flakes:

Discussion

The analysis of flakes from 41HI76 was limited by the relatively
smal I sample size. The results, however, are potentially significant.
The comparison of the various flake characteristics from the two
general contexts at this site, surface and subsurface, indicates that
only the frequency of ventral platform lips differs significantly by
context.
If this variation is the result of cultural differences
rather than an artifact of the smal I sample size, it may reflect a
change
in lithic technology between the periods of occupation
represented by those contexts.
It can be postulated that the higher proportion of lipped
platforms from the subsurface context is the result of a soft hammer
technology. It is also possible that this difference reflects an
Archaic technology based on the bifacial thinning of medium to large
artifacts that would produce a higher proportion of I ipped flakes.

The I ithic materials represented are overwhelmingly
cherts
collected from the local Uvalde gravels. Two chalcedony flakes may
represent non-local materials.

CHIPS (327 specimens)
Approximately 55% of the entire lithic assemblage consisted of
chips from both surface and subsurface contexts. The ratio of flakes
to chips is substantially larger in the surface sample than in the
subsurface one.
This is probably the result of a collection bias
which favored the larger, more easily located flakes on the surface.
The contextual and sample distributions of chip I ithic categories
closely mirror those of the flakes.
The analysis of the chips
supports the results of the flake analysis.

TYPE 1 ATTRITION (10 specimens, 13 facets)
Three specimens with Type 1 attrition have two separate facets,
the rema1n1ng seven specimens have only one. Facets attributed to
cutting activities comprise 42~ of the Type 1 facets, with scraping
facets compr1s1ng the rema1n1ng 58%.
Soft, soft medium, and hard
medium materials al I appear to have been worked.
Type 1 attrition
occurs most frequently on convex lateral edges but also occurs as
straight facets on lateral, distal and indeterminate edges, and as a
convex facet on a distal edge. Most Type 1 attrition shows light or
no abrasion and a single facet has polish.
TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 ATTRITION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
One secondary flake has a single facet with both Type 1 and Type
2 attrition. This specimen appears to have been used for scraping of
soft medium materials and has a concave facet on the distal edge that
shows only a light degree of abrasion.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS:

DISCUSSION

Five of 13 facets on the modified debitage were determined to
have been the result of cutting activities.
This represents a
somewhat higher proportion of cutting facets than was recovered from
the other sites investigated. This may be only a reflection of the
smaller sample size. Only one cutting facet was recorded on excavated
materials, the remaining four facets (two specimens) were from surface
collection units.
Two of the eight scraping facets were also
recovered from surface units.
It is unlikely that there 1s any direct association between
materials collected from the various surface collection units and
excavation units 6 and 7. The two closest collection units containing
modified debitage are more than 49 meters apart, while the collection
unit nearest to excavation units 6 and 7 is 34 meters away.
Such
large separations would seem to preclude any direct association.
With the exception of some materials from units 6 and 7, the
modified
debitage
from
41HI76
probably represents individual
occurrences that are unrelated.

include:
food processing, evidenced by cutting and scraping facets
used on soft and soft medium materials; hide processing, represented
by cutting and scraping facets used on soft and soft medium materials;
and woodworking, possibly represented by the cutting and scraping
facets used on soft medium and hard medium materials.
Formal Tools
BIFACES (4 specimens)
Four bifaces, one complete and three fragments, were recovered.
Three of the specimens are from excavated contexts and the fourth was
collected from the surface.
Form 1 (1 specimen)
One subtriangular, percussion shaped gouge, finished by pressure
retouch along the lateral edges and bit end (Fig. 32.4a) was recovered

lateral edges show substantial edge rounding, possibly as a result of
hafting.
The bit end shows only a light degree of attrition
indicative of use.
Two large step terminated flake scars on the
distal end may have resulted from use and the ultimate discard of this
implement.
The lack of any evidence of wear on these scars further
supports this interpretation. This implement was most I ikely used on
soft or soft medium materials for only a short time prior to its
discard.
Form 2 (1 specimen)
A single large triangular biface fragment (Fig. 32.4b) was
recovered from level 3 of EU 5 in association with Feature 1. This
implement 1s similar to the beveled knife described by
Jelks
(1962:46-47) from the Kyle Site. The original form of this specimen
could not be reconstructed. One lateral edge is steeply beveled by
secondary retouch and has heavy edge abrasion. The opposite edge also
shows edge abrasion, but to a lesser extent and has more step
terminated Type 1 attrition on the face opposite the beveled edge.
Both of these facets appear to have been used to scrape hard medium
materials.
Irregular (2 specimens)
Two specimens are included in this category because they could
not be assigned to either a functional or a morphological group. The
first specimen, from the surface of EU 48, probably was a perforator
(Fig. 32.4c) for use on soft or soft medium materials, but does not

show sufficient evidence of use to conclusively assign it to a
category. The second specimen, from level 2 of EU 6, appears to be an
aborted attempt to produce a smal I biface (Fig. 32.4d).
The flaking
pattern and size of the flake scars suggest that an unsuccessful
attempt was made to thin this specimen by percussion flaking.
There
1s no evidence of retouch, but there is a smal I area of Type 1
attrition on one edge which probably resulted from scraping on a hard
medium material.
Projectile Points (4 specimens)
No complete specimens of projectile points were recovered from
this site by either of the SMU investigations nor the TAS collections
and excavations. The 1972 SMU selective surface collection yielded
only a single non-diagnostic projectile point tip, while the 1975
investigations failed to locate any formal tools.
Four projectile
point fragments (2 tips, 1 midsection, and 1 possible dart point
base), al I non-diagnostic, were recovered from the TAS excavations
(2from EU 6, 1 from EU 7 and 1 from EU 5). These points add little to
our understanding of this site other than to suggest the presence of
an Archaic component.
Flaked Stone:

Discussion

The flaked stone from this area is not conclusively assignable to
a single occupation or even to a particular stage. Skinner et al.
(1978:188) report that collectors have recovered both dart points and
arrow points from this site, indicating multiple occupations. The
technology represented by the I ithic debitage seems to have been very
conservative, changing I ittle from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
Period.
A potentially significant difference in technology may
be
represented in the higher frequency of flakes with ventral platform
lips from the subsurface context.
This context is interpreted to
correspond
to an Archaic Period occupation, while the surface
materials are believed to represent a Late Prehistoric occupation.
This association is not conclusive, but suggests a potentially useful
relationship that may prove helpful in differentiating Archaic and
Late Prehistoric occupations when other diagnostic materials are
lacking.
The I ithic technology throughout the occupation of this site was
oriented toward the exploitation of local lithic materials most I ikely
derived from primary exposures of Uvalde gravels, or from reworked and
redeposited secondary exposures along the streams and drainages. The
flake morphology, with the exception noted above, is uniform and
32-17

41HI76
suggestive
of
little change in the technology of stone tool
manufacture during the occupation of the site. The smal I number of
formal tools and bi faces provides very I ittle evidence regarding the
final products of the flaked stone technology.
The production of
flakes suitable for use for cutting and scraping activities certainly
occurred and may have been an important goal of the technology
represented.
A higher proportion of debitage on this site is modified than on
any
of
the
other sites investigated.
The reasons for this
circumstance are not clear, although it
may
relate
to
the
post-depositional impact of intensive cultivation. Alternatively,
this difference may relate to prehistoric cultural differences or
perhaps to the nature of the occupations, i.e., a short term, single
occupation resource procurement site
versus
a
permanent or
semi-permanent habitation site.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Limited investigations by SMU and TAS have been made on three
occasions at 41HI76. In each case, the data recovery was low and the
disturbed nature of the surface deposits was demonstrated.
Only the
TAS investigations showed the presence of a buried culture-bearing
horizon which, from a very I imited sample, was tentatively assigned to
the Archaic Period. Materials exposed at the surface are most likely
related to a Late Prehistoric occupation, indicated by arrow points
recovered by local collectors and the reported removal of a large
collection of materials from the surface during the 1930s (Lynott and
Peter
1977:65).
Clearing and cultivation have contributed to
significant erosion that probably accounts for the very low density of
surface materials. In addition, the site is wel I known to ·many local
collectors (Skinner et al. 1978:176) and has apparently suffered
intensive collection for a number of years.
By assuming that surface materials represent predominantly Late
Prehistoric debris, a comparison with the earlier subsurface materials
suggests that the flaked stone technology was very conservative.
The
potentially significant difference in the low frequency of ventral
platform lipping is attributed to the low occurrence of percussion
thinning required in the production of arrow points versus the higher
frequency found in the production of dart points.
Processing activities represented include cutting and scraping of
soft, soft medium and hard medium materials. These activities were
probably related to food processing, hide processing and woodworking.
Modified debitage and use-wear on the single bifacial tool from the
surface indicate that hide working and food processing are probably
represented by surface materials. Food processing, hide working and
32-18

...,...........------- - - - - - -

41HI76
woodworking may account for the wear from attrition or use present on
the
modified
debitage and bifacial tools recovered from the
subsurface. The presence of features 1 and 2, interpreted as hearths,
in association with modified debitage and bifacial tools having
evidence of use in cutting and scraping soft and soft medium
materials,
further
supports
the inference of food processing
activities in this context.
The fact that one-third (2 of 6) of the areas tested yielded
intact features in spite of the smal I excavation unit size suggests
that the evaluation of this and similar sites as being of little or no
value due to extensive erosion has been premature. Certainly the
uppermost strata have been largely, if not completely, removed.
However, unti I there has been a program of systematic testing,
particularly of terrace sites, similar sites must not be too hastily
evaluated.
The association of both formal and informal tools with
intact features provides the possibi I ity of defining activity areas
and, perhaps, I iv i ng surfaces.
On the basis of the available data, I ittle can be said concerning
the length of the occupation or occupations, the definition of
specific site components or subsistence activities conducted at
41HI76.

THE SULLIVAN SITE - 41Hl117

David 0. Brown

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is on a broad low terrace on the west bank of Aquilla
Creek just over 0.7 kilometers above its confluence with Little
Aqui I la Creek. It is approximately 8.5 kilometers north-northwest of
the confluence of Aquil la and Hackberry creeks and is near the
northwesternmost extent of Aqui I la Lake at its maximum.
With
elevations ranging between 550 and 560 feet (166-169 m) MSL, it is
located directly on and wi I I be impacted by the shoreline of the
maximum flood pool of the lake at 556 feet.
The site apparently does not extend onto the modern floodplain of
Aqui I la Creek, being 75 meters from the modern creek at its closest
point. Surf icial cultural materials extend back from the scarp of the
lowest terrace from 50 to 100 meters, paralleling the creek for some
300
meters.
Preliminary
testing
indicates
that
subsurface
manifestations of the site may be larger than this. Figure 33.1 shows
several views of the site.
Geologically, the surrounding region 1s mapped as being Upper
Cretaceous Woodbine Formation, as is most of the lower drainage basin
of Aqui I la Creek (Barnes 1970). The actual site area, however, 1s
located primarily on alluvial terrace deposits of Aqui Ila Creek. The
lowest and clearest terrace is marked by a low scarp and an elevation
difference of about a meter. At the northeastern end of the site is a
higher ridge that may be a second and older terrace whose surface is
perhaps a meter higher than the first, or a low flat bench at the
upland edge. A possible terrace scarp, obscured by historic erosion
and land modification, is visible 1n a few places.
The primary soi I type mapped at the site is Bastsi I loamy fine
sand, occurring on 0 to 3 percent slopes. This soi I, classified as a
fine-loamy, sif iceous, thermic Udic Paleustalf, corresponds wel I to
the area of the low terrace and is reported by the SCS (1978:14,54) to

have formed in loamy sediments on high terraces along major streams.
The typical profile described has 16 inches (40 cm) of I ight brown,
loamy, fine sand A horizon over a deep, red or strong brown, sandy
clay loam B horizon.
The second terrace or upland edge soi I is mapped as Konsi I fine
sandy loam, a soi I supposedly formed in weathered beds of loamy
material and interbedded sandstone on upland areas (Brooks 1978:64).
In observations of other patches of Konsil fine sandy loam throughout
the Aqui I la Lake area, most are unquestionably upland, but there are a
few instances, as is the case here, where a terrace origin is
possible. The SCS notes that the Konsi I map units include smal I areas
(up to 10%) of Axtel I, Bastrop, Gasi I and Travis soi Is, al I of which
except Gasi I soi Is are associated with stream terraces (Brooks 1978:28
et passim).
The typical profile given shows 13 inches (33 cm) of
yellowish-red, fine sandy loam A (and partly upper B) horizon
overlying a deep, red and reddish yellow sandy clay loam B horizon
(Brooks 1978:64). The soi I is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous,
thermic Ultic Paleustalf, identical in classification to the Bastsil
soi I except for the dryer moisture regime (Ultic) in the Konsi I, not
unexpected because of its higher and presumably dryer elevation.
The site lies within the Cross Timbers biotic region, although
parts may have been covered by alluvial hardwoods rather than the
Cross Timbers oak forest. At present the site is primarily cleared
pasture land, with mixed post oak and riverine forest to the north and
south. To the east, the modern floodplain is covered by pecan trees.
Disturbances at the site are relatively extensive.
The greater
portion has been plowed for many years, and a sizeable percentage has
been mined for sand to a depth of up to one meter. The site has been
extensively collected by both the previous owner and the present one

collection of projectile points from the site that includes specimens
of every cultural period from the Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric.
In addition to surface collection, he has reportedly intentionally
plowed and stripped the site to increase his yield of artifacts
(R. Watson, personal communication).
Along with the numerous human
disturbances, there is considerable evidence of intensive rodent
activity in the upper sandy horizons of the soil.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH
This site was initially recorded by the 1972 SMU Aqui I la Lake
survey as x41Hllll, described as a "dense concentration of camp
refuse, 100x15 m" dating to the Middle Archaic (Skinner and Henderson
1972:28). At that time, 117 artifacts were collected from the surface
and the type of activities indicated included tool manufacture, plant
processing and hunting (Skinner and Henderson 1972:28). Lynott and
Peter returned to the site in 1975, excavating five test pits and nine
posthole tests, that apparently yielded no subsurface cultural
material. At the time they tested the site, it was covered 1n dense
coastal
bermuda grass so that no good surface exposures were
avai I able. Despite these drawbacks, they concluded that:
The site is certainly a def lated multiple occupation site,
and its size and location between two major creeks suggest
it is one of the few seasonal reoccupation camps in the
upper Aqui I la drainage. (Lynott and Peter 1977:103)
DATA COLLECTION
Despite Lynott and Peter's (1977) assessment of the site, it was
thought to be potentially important because of its size and the number
of Paleoindian projectile points that, which according to Lynott and
Peter, included Clovis, Folsom, Eden and Meserve types. In addition,
it may be slightly endangered by its location along the maximum flood
pool shoreline. For these reasons, TAS was asked to return to conduct
further excavations.
Although it was not possible to conduct
subsurface testing there during the 1980 season, several brief visits
were made by the field archeologist, the principal investigator and
the Corps of Engineers archeologist, and at that time a portion of the
site collection was photographed.
During the 1982 season, consisting of 63 person-days in March,
the emphasis was on a broad view of the site's natural and cultural
stratigraphy.
To implement this broad perspective, 20 backhoe
trenches were excavated on and adjacent to the site (Fig. 33.2).
These trenches provided a valuable look at the complex depositional
history of the site, but yielded little in the way of subsurface
cultural stratigraphy. A few artifacts observed in the backdirt and a
few flakes found just below the surface in the trench profiles were
the only indications of a buried site.
Two 2 by 2 meter test units, excavated in arbitrary 10 centimeter
levels, were located in potentially undisturbed areas that had yielded
cultural materials at the northern and southern extremes of the site.
In addition to artifactual materials observed at or near these test

units, both contained dark lower soi I horizons that were thought to be
possible buried paleosols. A third 2 by 2 meter test unit was placed
adjacent to the second unit at the northern end after cultural
materials were found to extend more than a meter below the modern
ground surface.
In addition to the three 2 by 2 meter excavation units, test pits
1, 2 and 3, three 50 by 50 centimeter control led shovel tests were dug
at the extreme western site edge in an area that could not be reached
by the backhoe, but which was forested and potentially less disturbed
by historic activities than other portions of the site.
These three
units, designated test pits 4, 5 and 6, were excavated to varying
depths up to one meter in approximate 10 centimeter levels.
Test Pit 1
Test Pit 1 was placed just west of BHT D where the buried dark
soi I horizon was first observed. Several chert flakes were noticed in
the dark soil in the trench profile and a crude biface, with dark soi I
matrix adhering to it, was found in the trench backdirt. An increase
in stream gravels was also noted in this dark horizon. Eight complete
10 centimeter levels were excavated from this unit and dry screened
through 1/4 inch mesh hardware cloth. After cultural material dropped
off in levels 7 and 8, excavation was reduced to the northeast one
meter quadrant and five more 10 centimeter levels removed, extending
to a depth of 130 centimeters (level 13). These latter levels were
water screened through 1/4 inch mesh because of the difficulties
encountered dry screening the sandy clay matrix. A total of 3.7 cubic
meters of f i I I was removed from this unit.
Very I ittle cultural material was found below level 6, as Table

level 2, at the bottom of the plow zone, and the other in level 6,
within the dark soi I zone. Whether the latter increase is indicative
of a buried cultural horizon, as might be supported by the congruence
with the darker soil horizon, (see the fol lowing section on site
stratigraphy) is unclear. An observed increase in stream gravels and
manganese concretions, and in soi I compaction in these lower levels
suggest that it might only be the natural terminus for objects moving
downward through the soi I due to bioturbation.
Test Pit 2
This excavation unit was 183 meters north (magnetic) of Test Pit
1 on the second terrace or upland edge area just north of the large
sand quarry that has disturbed a large portion of the northern half of
the site. It was located just over 20 meters west of the south end of
BHT H. Deep sandy soi I showing some indications of stratification was
the primary rationale for placement of this unit.

Thirteen 10 centimeter levels were removed from the 2 by 2 meter
unit, with six additional 1 meter square, 10 centimeter levels removed
from the southeast quadrant after an initial marked decrease in
cultural material.
All of the 5.6 cubic meters of fi I I removed was
dry screen through 1/4 inch mesh. Because of ground surface slope
there was no level 1 in the eastern half of the unit.
Table 33.2 shows the distribution of cultural materials in Test
Pit 2.
Although the total amount of material is small, the depth of
the deposit was considered potentially significant and a second unit
was dug adjacent to this one to test the possibility that this deposit
might be an old alluvial terrace with cultural materials buried at a
depth of more than a meter.
Test Pit 3
This unit was excavated adjacent to Test Pit 2 in an attempt to
determine if the possible cultural stratigraphy observed in Test Pit 2
was real or simply sampling error. Thirteen complete 10 centimeter
levels were excavated.
The upper eleven levels, varying in soil
texture between sandy loam and loamy sand, were dry screened through
1/4 inch mesh, while the lower two levels, with increased clay
fractions, were water screened through the same mesh size. Because of
the ground surface slope on this upper terrace surface, only the
northwestern quad of level 1 was close to a complete 10 centimeter
unit, with the southwestern quad barely present at al I in that level.
Total excavated fi I I from this unit was about 5.2 cubic meters.
Table 33.3 shows the distribution of material in this unit. This
material includes 44 flakes, 37 chips, 3 specimens of modified
debitage (from levels 5, 8 and 11) and one hammerstone (from the
northeastern quadrant of level 7).
Shovel Tests
Three 50 by 50 centimeter shovel tests were excavated in a wooded
area inaccessible to the backhoe, to determine if larger control led
excavations were warranted in this western portion of the site. These
units, designated test pits 4, 5 and 6, were excavated in arbitrary 10
centimeter levels and all fi I I was dry screened through 1/4 inch mesh.
Test Pit 4 was located just inside the treel ine across the old
Sul I ivan property fence.
This area is just west of the limits of
surface artifact distribution at the site but relatively dense
vegetation prevents good visibility.
Ten arbitrary levels were

excavated with debitage recovered from levels 1 through 4 (6, 16, 15
and 7 specimens, respectively) and level 8 (4 specimens) where a
possible buried soi I was observed.
Thirty meters southwest of this unit and across a small shallow
drainage, TP 5 was excavated to a maximum depth of 70 centimeters.
The same possible buried soi I was observed at a depth of 50
centimeters but no debitage was recovered from any level.
Test Pit 6 was located another 30 meters north-northwest of TP 5
on a low rise, apparently indicative of the next higher alluvial
terrace.
As expected, this unit, excavated to a depth of 30
centimeters, hit clay at 25 centimeters. One flake was recovered from
the upper level, in the plow zone.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Prior to control led excavations, 20 backhoe trenches were dug as
an aid to understanding the overal I stratigraphy and depositional
history of the Sul Ii van Site. Initially, two lines of trenches (A
through F), oriented to magnetic north and spaced 50 meters apart,
were placed on the first terrace of Aqui I la Creek (Fig. 33.2).
These
six trenches were fol lowed by seven more to the north along the edge
of the second terrace (G through M). An additional three trenches (N,
0 and P) were located on the first terrace at right angles to the
first five trenches. Subsequent to this, one trench (Q) was located
on the floodplain, two (R and S) to the west of the known site area
and one (T) back from the edge of the higher terrace where gully
erosion had exposed subsurface gravels. Profiles of seven of these
trenches are illustrated in Fig. 33.3, and brief descriptions of the
strata are given below.
Profiles equivalent to those found in the
southeastern portion of the first terrace and the northernmost edge of
the second terrace are i I lustrated by the wal I profiles of test pits 1
and 2, respectively, which are also described below (figs. 33.4 and
33.5).
Backhoe Trench A
Soi I Profile Descriptions
Zone 1. Yellowish-brown (10YR5/4) sandy loam - Ap horizon.

Zone 3. Yellowish-brown (lOYRS/4) sandy loam and
red
(2.5YR4/6) loamy sand.
This stratum is a highly
disturbed boundary area between the visibly distinct
zones 2 and 4. Rodent burrows (not drawn) are common.
Zone 4. Red (2.5YR4/6) loamy sand. The upper part sti I I
has some mixing from the stratum above and is slightly
browner in color. The lower part has smal I alluvial
pebbles and manganese concretions. Although there is
intense mixing between this zone and that above it,
there is no true transitional horizon between the two,
suggesting a depositional break. The oxidation of the
sand
in this stratum, as wel I as the manganese
concretions, suggest that this may be an older terrace
soi I horizon covered by more recent alluvium or even
col luvium from the higher terrace.
Zone 5. Red (2.SYRS/6) loamy sand with some clay.
This
stratum is similar to Zone 4 with the exception of a
slightly yellower color and an increase in
clay
content.
Manganese concretions and smal I alluvial
pebbles present in upper part of this zone. The lower
boundary is slightly wavy and diffuse.
Zone 6. Yellow (10YR7/6) Sandy clay loam.
Color grades
from red to yellow, and there 1s a corresponding
increase in sand, moving to the north in this stratum.
The lower portion is mottled with gray at the southern
end.
Zone 7. Yellow (10YR7/6) loamy sand. White mottles present
at bottom.
Soi I moisture unevenly distributed at
bottom; in places this stratum is very dry and hard,
while in other places the soil is soft and moist.
Backhoe Trench A is a good ii lustration of the soi I strata along
the creekward edge of the first terrace of Aqui I la Creek. The north
wal I profile of TP 1 (Fig. 33.4) shows another facies of this same
brown/red/ye I low loamy sand sediment that appears to be a levee
To the north of the
development along the edge of the terrace.
terrace edge the trenches demonstrate increasing clay content and are
increasingly mottled with gray, white, red
and
yellow.
The
predominance of gray and white mottles in these areas suggest some
degree of gleyed soi I development. In addition, the red and yellow

oxidation mottling suggests that the soi I is relatively old. Lenses
of gray clay present in some trenches suggest ponding on this surface
as it was developed, perhaps even indicating a swampy environment
during portions of the year. North of this area the trenches show
increasing clay content. Trench L, illustrated in Figure 33.3, is a
good example of this. Zone 1, the uppermost stratum, is a loose brown
sand which overlies a more compact, brown sand with manganese
concretions (Zone 2). Separating these two strata is a thin band of
gray clay (shown as a dotted line in Fig. 33.3). Zone 3 is a plain
gray clay, while Zone 4 is a gray sandy clay mottled with yellow and
red.
Increased clay content is particularly obvious near the top of
this stratum, while the mottling is more intense near the middle of
the stratum.
Not more than 50 meters west of BHT L, BHT M (Fig.
33.3)
exhibits a much different profile. More than any other trench at the
site this unit shows a wel I developed and apparently complete soi I
profile grading from a dark yellowish-brown (10YR4/4) sand A horizon
(Zone 1) down into a yellowish-red (5YR4/6) loamy sand (or sandy
loam).
The loamy sand Zone 2 grades into a strong brown (7.5YR5/6)
sandy loam horizon (Zone 3) which in turn grades downward into a
yellowish-brown
sandy
clay loam (Zone 4) mottled with white,
brownish-ye! low and very pale brown. Al I of the transitions in color
and texture are gradual and suggest an old, wel I developed soi I which
has been little disturbed. Its color and graded stratigraphy do not
match at al I the stratigraphy of other trenches on the first terrace.
There is a slight elevation difference along the northern edge of the
first terrace that might indicate a different terrace, but this seems
uni ikely. The origin of this area, which includes at least the area
around BHT N) remains a mystery.
While this upper terrace demonstrated very I ittle potential for
the existence of subsurface cultural remains, the area to the west,
across the Sul Ii van property fence, was thought to hold some promise
as a less disturbed portion of the site. The Sul I ivan portion of the
site has been plowed and quarried for years. Initially, a series of
backhoe trenches were planned for this part of the site, but access
problems due to dense wooded growth, limited exploration to two
trenches actually located somewhat south of the area originally chosen
to sample. These two trenches, BHT R and BHT S, showed wholly
different profiles than any yet observed on the eastern portion of the
site. In some respects, they resembled the modern floodplain BHT Q
described below, but had a number of unique characteristics as wel I.
Unquestionably, some of the strata, particularly the upper ones, in
these trenches are related to modern flood deposits. Other strata
seemed to be composed of sediments from the older terraces.
It 1s
33-16

41HI117
clear that these two trenches are near the interface between the
modern floodplain and the lowest terrace. It is thought that near the
base they are composed primarily of older terrace sediments, some or
al I of which may be col luvial ly deposited from the scarp of the older
terrace, or the eroded base of this formation, and modern alluvial
deposits near the surface.
These two trenches (ii lustrated 1n
Fig. 33.3) are described briefly below.

Backhoe Trench Q was located south of TU 1 and 1s an excel lent
example of the stratified deposits of the modern floodplain. This
trench was excavated near the bank of a f i I led in channel of Aqui I la
Creek, and near the opposite end of the trench from the end
i I lustrated here it was possible to see the strata dipping downward
into the channel. The strata in this trench are all modern deposits
and may be recent. It is no surprise that Lynott and Peter (1977)
found little subsurface cultural material when they tested in this
area. The strata in BHT Q (Fig. 33.3) are described below.

A low (ca. 50 cm) but easily distinguished scarp separates the
floodplain at the Sullivan Site from the first low terrace where much
of the cultural material has been found.
During the trenching
operation, this area was singled out as promising for control led
excavations on the basis of the discovery of occasional flakes in the
trench profiles and a dark subsurface soi I horizon recognized in
trenches C and D.
This stratum 1s an apparent paleosol and an
indication of either very rapid deposition capping a relatively recent
A horizon soil or limited subsurface disturbances in this area.
Because of these indications, TP 1 was excavated just west of BHT 2.
The stratigraphy of this area is ii lustrated by the profile of this
test unit (Fig. 33.4).

SOIL STRATA DESCRIPTIONS, TEST PIT 1
Zone 1. (Al)
Very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) fine sandy
loam, mottled with some brownish-ye! low (10YR6/6) fine
sand; massive structure; soft and friable; very many
roots of al I sizes;
clear to abrupt, slightly wavy
lower boundary, possibly discontinuous in
places.
Apparently the modern plow zone; great variation in
stratum thickness.
Zone 2. (82 or C)
Dark yellowish-brown (10YR4.5/6) loamy
fine sand throughout with smal I indistinct stratum of
slightly darker yellowish-brown (10YR4/6) sand in top
10 centimeters; massive structure; very soft, loose,
friable; few roots;
some smal I gravels and black
concretions; clear, smooth lower boundary.
Zone 3. (IIAl?)
Dark yellowish-brown (10YR4/5) loamy fine
sand with slightly more clay than above stratum;
massive structure; slightly compact, friable;
very
few
roots;
some cementation
of
sand
grains
(manganese?); pea gravels, some in dense pockets, and
black
concretions;
clear to gradual, wavy lower
boundary. This may be either a buried A or a truncated
and altered older B horizon.
In either case, the
gravel pockets indicate considerable microf luvial
activity
during deposition.
Although there 1s a
definite increase of prehistoric cultural material, it
is not clear if it is a paleosol which dates to the
prehistoric era or to early historic agricultural
activities at the site.
Zone 4. (IIB2)
Dark yellowish-brown (10YR4/6) fine sandy
loam prominently mottled with relatively smal I patches
of yellowish-brown (10YR5/8) loamy sand and light
brownish-gray (10YR6/2) clayey fine sand or fine sandy
clay loam; massive structure; slightly more compact
than Zone 3, friable; very few roots; pea gravels and
black concretions.
The area around Test Pit 1 and backhoe trenches C and D was
thought to have potential for recovery of in situ prehistoric cultural
remains because of the discovery of
apparent
paleosol
in
conjunction with subsurface lithic debris. Only one other portion of
the site was considered to have this potential after extensive backhoe
trenching.
This area, first noted because of a buried dark soi I
horizon in BHT J, was selected for the second 2 by 2 meter test unit.

Although no cultural material was observed in the wal Is or backdirt
from this trench, I ithic debris occurred in moderate density 1n the
disturbed floor of the sand borrow pit just south of the trench. In
addition to the nearby presence of lithic debris, albeit possibly
disturbed and transported in from elsewhere, the deep sands noted in
this trench suggested an old alluvial terrace and a potentially high
probability area for the preservation of Paleoindian materials such as
had previously been collected and observed. One of the Paleoindian
projectile points observed at the site by archeologists was from very
near this area; the other was west of BHT N.
(D. Dibble, personal
communication).
The deep sandy soi I profile recorded in TP 2 supports the
identification of this landform as an ancient alluvial terrace
remnant, set against the upland edge just to the north, and covered
with a relatively recent sandy col luvium off of the uplands. A buried
A horizon was defined at a depth of approximately 40 centimeters and
cultural materials were recovered from this unit to a depth of wel I
below a meter.
Unfortunately, these
cultural
materials
were
infrequent, particularly when compared to the relatively high density
of mater i a I from TP 1.
In addition
pedoturbat i ve disturbances,
particularly in the upper half meter, were extensive, suggesting
possible artifact movement.
Nonetheless, the extent of
deeper
disturbances in the unit could not be ascertained, and the presence of
cultural materials in these deeper levels led to the excavation of a
third 2 by 2 meter test unit adjacent to the second. The presence of
deeply buried cultural material was once again confirmed, but no
diagnostics were recovered and there was no indication of an intact
occupation surface or features of any kind. The soi I profile of TP 2,
which is also essentially the same as that of TP 3, and similar to
profiles of backhoe trenches J and H, 1s described below and
i I lustrated in Fig. 33.5.

SOIL STRATA DESCRIPTIONS, TEST PIT 2
Zone 1. (Al) 0-9 cm Yellowish-brown (10YR5/6) loamy fine

friable; clear, wavy boundary. This stratum may be
washed in on top of the stratum below rather than
developed in situ.
Zone 2. (!!Al) 9-16 cm Dark yellowish-brown
(10YR4/6)
loamy fine sand; massive structure; more roots than
Zone 1, including very dense grass roots; soft, loose
clear to gradual, wavy boundary. This
and friable;
stratum is apparently a fairly recently buried Al.

Zone 3a. (IIB2t) 16-27 cm Strong brown (7.5YR4/6) fine
sandy loam;
weak, medium to coarse subangular blocky
structure; moderate amount of fine roots;
soft and
friable, but slightly more compact than zone above;
few smal I pea gravels and black concretions; clear to
gradual, smooth lower boundary.
There is a slight
increase in clay, weak structure and a slight reddish
coloration in this zone which indicate this as a weak
B2t horizon.
Zone 3b.
(IIC or
IIB22t or

structure; few fine roots;
soft, slightly compact,
friable;
few black concretions and some pea gravels;
clear to gradual, smooth lower boundary. This zone is
generally transitional between zones 3a and 3c and is
mottled with soi I from both
there is a slight
possibility that this zone may represent another older
and less distinct buried A horizon.
Zone 3c.
(IIIC) 37-40 cm Dark yellowish-brown {10YR4/5)
loamy fine sand; massive structure; few fine roots;
soft, friable; few black concretions; abrupt and very
convoluted lower boundary. The origin of this zone of
highly variable thickness is difficult to ascertain.
It is clearly discontinuous with Zone 4 below but it is
not clear if it is part of the same depositional unit
as the other two subdivisions of Zone 3 or a separate
alluvial wash. It may even represent another buried A
horizon.
Zone 4.
(IVAl) 40-45 cm Dark brown (10YR3/3) fine sandy
loam;
weak, medium to coarse, subangular blocky
structure; few fine roots; few pea gravels and black
concretions;
abrupt, wavy lower boundary. This is a
very dark, distinct buried A horizon which is not only
separated by an abrupt discontinuity above, but by an
abrupt transition below as wel I. The lower boundary,
marked by one of the thin microstrata of Zone 5, is
distinct but probably i I luvial rather than depositional
(see Zone 5 below). Zone 6 below this may be part of
the same depositional unit as Zone 4.
Zone 5.
(Very) dark grayish-brown/dark
(IVB2) 45-46 cm
brown
(10YR3/2 .5) fine sandy loam with a slight
massive
increase In clay from the zone
above;
more compact than above, friable; abrupt,
structure;
wavy lower boundary. This zone is actually a thin
33-21

41HI117
microstratum, appearing as no more than a dark line in
the profile, which occasionally splits
into
two
separate lines, the upper of which bisects Zone 4 (but
never rises higher than this). Where there is a single
I ine it usually marks the lower boundary of Zone 4;
where there are two, the lower I ine fol lows this
boundary.
It is not, however, totally congruent with
this boundary in al I places.
Careful observation of
this microstratum indicates that it is actually made up
of two thinner microstrata, the lower only a mi I limeter
or two thick and stil I darker in color. Judging from
the evidence presented by this I ine crossing through
the center of and swirling around post-depositional
disturbances such as rodent burrows, it cannot be
depositional, but 1s, rather, illuvial in character.
Zone 6a.
(IVB22
or
IVC) 46-115

Yellowish-brown
(10YR5/4) loamy fine sand grading to strong brown
(7.5YR5/6) color near bottom of stratum (with
a
possible corresponding increase in clay content);
massive structure;
slightly

friable;
moderate amount of fine roots; few pea gravels and
possible ferric oxide and clay
black concretions;
cementation of sand grains in lower section; gradual,
wavy lower boundary.
Zone 6b.
(IVB22 or

brown
(7.5YR5/6) fine sandy loam (close to but not a sandy
clay loam); massive structure; slightly more compact

above
zone;
prominent manganese staining;
gradual, wavy boundary. This zone is discontinuous,
existing only 1n the north half of the unit, running
from the middle of the west wal I north around to just
south of the middle of the east wal I.
Zone 7.
(?B2t) 115-125 cm
Light brownish-gray (10YR6/2)
fine sandy clay loam mottled with many large strong
brown (7.5YR5/6) mottles; moderate to strong, medium
to coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, compact,
slightly friable; very few roots; increase in black
concretions;
gradual, wavy lower boundary. There is
some lateral variation in overal I matrix color and
mottling within this stratum. Along the south wal I the
stratum is much less gray in color, being dominated by
the strong brown and only mottled by gray. This
continues around to about where 6b begins on the east
wal I,
where
the

content and manganese staining in this stratum indicate
that it is a B horizon development, although it cannot
be clearly related to the strata above.

moderate, medium subangular blocky

Again, pedogenic alteration of this stratum suggests
that it is some form of B horizon.

This zone was
difficult to describe as the lower portion of the test
unit quickly filled with water after excavation, but it
seems to be less pedogenical ly altered than the strata
above and may represent unaltered alluvial terrace
deposit.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
Excluding fire cracked rock, 646 specimens of I ithic debris were
collected from the site.
Seven of these were collected from the
surface during a brief reconnaissance on March 28, 1980.
Four more
specimens
were collected
from
the
surface during the 1982
investigations, while the rema1n1ng 635 are al I from subsurface
excavations.
All but two of the ten surface finds are tools or tools
fragments.
Table 33.4 shows the distribution of general artifact categories
at the site. The lithic debris is broken down into 641 specimens of
flaked stone and 5 specimens of ground and battered stone. Six of the
former and one of the latter were collected from the surface in 1980.
FLAKED STONE
The 641 flaked stone artifacts comprise 99.2% of all lithic
debris.
As noted above, six (0.9%) specimens were from the 1980
surface collection. Four additional surface specimens were collected
in 1980, leaving a total of 631 specimens of flaked stone (98.4%) from
the excavation units. The majority of these 631 specimens (425
67.4%) are from TP 1, the most productive unit at the site (see Table
33.4)

Flaked stone can be broken down into 603 specimens of unmodified
debitage (94.1%) and 38 tools or tool fragments. Flaked ston~ from
the excavation units only includes 601 pieces of unmodified debitage
(95.2%) and 30 tools or tool fragments. The distribution of debitage
versus tools from the excavation units closely parallels that of. the
total artifactual sample from those units, with 403 specimens (67.1%)
from TP 1.
. ...
Unmodified Debitage
A total of 603 specimens of unmodified debitage were collected
from the Sullivan Site, al I but two of them from the 1982 excavation
units. This sample includes 323 flakes (53.6% of al I the unmodified
debitage), 276 chips (45.8%) and 4 cores (0.7%). Exclusion of the two
surface specimens of unmodified debitage yields similar percentages:
322 flakes (53.6%), 276 chips (45.9%) and 3 cores (0.5%).
FLAKES (323 specimens)
The sample of flakes includes 11 primary flakes (3.4 % of al I the
flakes), 136 secondary flakes (42.2%) and 175 tertiary flakes (54.3%).
Table 33.5 shows the distribution of flake types at the site.
There
are marked differences in type percentages among al I of the major
excavation units, and while only TP 1 has a really adequate sample
size for valid statistical evaluations, comparison of al I four shows a
trend toward lower corticate (primary and secondary) flake percentages
on
the
lower terrace.
Test pits 1 and 4 combined yield a
corticate/decorticate flake ratio of 0.68:1, while test pits 2 and 3,
both on the upper terrace-upland edge, have a ratio of 1.55:1. Since
potential source material gravels are shallowly buried (and eroding
out in places
but these gul I ies may be historic) on the upland
surface (in and around BHT T - see Fig. 33.1), it may be that activity
areas on this upper terrace surface were more concerned with the early
stages of tool manufacture than the lower terrace areas.
A two way
chi-square test of this distribution, matching first versus second
terrace against corticate versus decorticate flakes, yields a value of
9.68, which, with one degree of freedom, is significant at the .01
level of probabi I ity (Blalock 1972:569).
Platform type distribution among the various flake classes is
shown in Table V.70.
As at many of the Aqui I la Lake sites, single
facet platforms predominate, occurring on 37.9% of al I flakes.
Simpler platform types (cortex and single facet platforms combined)
form the majority of al I platform types from the site (51.8%).

Table V.71 shows the distribution of ventral platform lips by
flake class at the Sullivan Site. While these figures are more in
I ine with lipped percentages given elsewhere in this report, they may
be biased toward a slightly greater percentage of I ipped flakes
because of a change in laboratory personnel during this analysis.
As
expected, however, lips are more common on tertiary flakes than on any
other type, and absent on cortex platform primary flakes.
The distribution of thermally altered material by flake class 1s
shown in Table V.72. As might be expected, there is I ittle variation
in thermal alteration among these categories.
The distribution of
material types by flake class is shown in Table V.73.
As is
relatively common at the Aqui I la Lake sites (see 41HI109 and 41HI110
debitage discussions), non-chert materials become less common at
advanced stages of reduction. When these categories are combined into
corticate and decorticate versus chert and non-chert, a chi-square
value of 6.746, significant at the p=.01 level with one degree of
freedom (Blalock 1972:569) is obtained.
Primary Flakes (11 specimens)
The eleven primary flakes comprise only 3.4% of al I the flakes
from the Sul Ii van Site.
Al I are from the three 2 by 2 meter units
(Table 33.5). Although the percentage of primary flakes from the
Sul I ivan Site is smaller than at many sites in the Aqui I la Lake area,
the absolute sample size is so smal I as to preclude conv1nc1ng
statements as to the amount of primary reduction conducted here. Six
of the eleven specimens come from the upper terrace/upland edge
explored in test pits 2 and 3, that only yielded a comparative 24.6%
off lakes from the site. This distribution appears to support the
upper terrace area as an earlier stage I ithic reduction workshop, as
discussed in the preceding section.
By definition, al I of the primary flakes have cortex platforms.
None are lipped. Only one, from TP 3, is burned. Three, 1 each from
test pits 1, 2 and 3, are quartzite.
Secondary Flakes (136 specimens)
These 136 specimens comprise 42.2% of al I the flakes.
This
percentage is about average in the Aqui Ila Lake area, but note the
discussion above on apparent areal differences at the site in flake
classes.
Ninety-three of these secondary flakes are from the first
terrace units (38.6% of the 241 first terrace flakes) and 42 are from
the upper terrace area (53.2% of the 79 upper terrace flakes).
Distribution of these flakes is shown in Table 33.4.

33-27

41HI117
The distribution of secondary flake platform types by unit 1s
shown in Table V.74. Nearly half have cortex platforms, while more
than half of the remaining specimens have single facet platforms.
Cortex platforms are most common in TP 1, while faceted flakes are
much less common in this unit. Table V.75 shows the distribution of
ventral platform lips on secondary flakes at the site. The striking
differences between lipped flake percentages in TP 1 versus other
units is almost solely the result of analytical bias. Because of
these problems, interpretation of the figures
given
here
1s
impossible.
Eleven (8.1%) of the secondary flakes show sign of thermal
alteration.
Table V.76 shows the distribution of this material by
unit. Distribution of secondary flake material types by unit is shown
in Table V.77. Quartzite seems to be more common in the upper terrace
area, with 11 of the 16 total quartzite flakes coming from test pits 2
and 3, in this area.
Tertiary Flakes (175 specimens)
The distribution of the 175 tertiary flakes (54.3% of al I flakes)
is shown in Table 33.5. This percentage is among the highest found in
the Aqui I la Lake area, comparable to 54.8% tertiary flakes found at
41HI76 (Chapter 32, this report). This may indicate that the Sul I ivan
Site was more commonly used for the final stages of
lithic
manufacturing
and
for tool maintenance.
As noted above, the
difference between the first and second terrace area flake class
distributions is statistically significant. Making this separation
shows that the upper terrace area yielded 31 tertiary flakes or 39.2%
of the total from that area, a figure comparable to that from sites
near material sources such as 41HI109 (40.6% tertiary flakes) and
41HI110 (39.2%).
Conversely, the lower terrace area yields a figure
of 143 tertiary flakes or 59.3% of the sample.
This percentage is
higher than that recorded for any of the excavated sites in the
Aqui I la Lake area, even for sites not adjacent to a stone material
source as at 41HI105 (McDonald Site) where tertiary flakes comprise
only 43.9% of the total. On the other hand, given the enormous size
of the Sul Ii van Site, the area of TP 1 is probably as far from the BHT
T gravel area as the McDonald Site is from 41HI165 (see Chapter 39).
The distribution of platform types for tertiary flakes is shown
in Table V.78. As this table shows, multiple facet platforms are most
common in TP 1, as are crushed platforms.
Table V.79 shows the
distribution of ventral platform I ips at 41HI117, but as pointed out
above, the differences between TP 1 and the other excavation units 1s
analytical bias and should be ignored.

Fifteen (8.6%) of the 175 tertiary flakes are burned.
Their
distribution is shown in Table V.80. As with the secondary flakes,
the highest percentage of thermally altered tertiary flakes was found
in TP 2. Material type distribution for tertiary flakes is shown in
Table V.81. Only 9 (5.1%) are quartzite.
CHIPS (277 specimens)
The 277 chips collected comprise 45.9% of al I debitage from the
site and 42.9% of al I lithic debris. Al I of the chips are from 1982
excavation units (Table 33.4). Total flake to chip ratio is 1.16:1,
with some individual variation among the units. TP 1 has the highest
flake-chip ratio at 1.30:1, while TP 4, the 50 by 50 centimeter unit
near the upper terrace edge has the lowest, 0.45:1. Both of the upper
terrace units, test pits 2 and 3, cluster around the mean for the site
with 1.09:1 and 1.19:1, respectively.
Table 33.6 shows the distribution of thermally altered chips at
the site.
The high percentage of burned chips in TP 2 matches peaks
among the secondary (Table V.76) and tertiary flakes (Table V.80).
A
total of 21 (31.3%) of the 67 flakes and chips from this unit were
burned.
Also shown in Table 33.6 is the distribution of material types
among chips. TP 1, with the largest debitage total, has the smallest
percentage of non-chert materials. Only 3 chips (1.7%) from this
unit, 2 quartzite and 1 hematite-I imonite, are non-chert. Although
the overall percentage of quartzite and non-chert materials at the
site (5.8% and 6.6% respectively) are relatively smal I, the units
other than TP 1 have relatively high percentages, with 13.7% quartzite
and 12.7% total non-chert.
CORES (4 specimens)
Only four cores (0.7% of the unmodified debitage) were identified
from the Sullivan Site. Two specimens are from TP 1, one from TP 2
and one from the surface in 1980.
These specimens include one
unidirectional, one bifacial and two multidirectional cores. Al I are
of chert with the exception of a quartzite specimen from level 7 of TP
1.

Unidirectional Cores (1 specimen)
This specimen, from the southeastern quadrant of level 7 of TP 1,
is an altered flat cobble of reddish-gray, medium grained quartzite
with several flake scars emanating from cortex platforms along one
face.
This specimen may have been burned. There is a slight amount
of smoothing along the platform edge and it is possible that this

piece was uti I ized similarly to the quartzite choppers recovered from
other sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. If so, however, its use was
minimal compared to the heavily battered edges ordinarily found on
these specimens. The weight of this specimen is 154.3 grams. Maximum
length is 7.3 centimeters, maximum width is 5.6 centimeters and
thickness is 2.7 centimeters.
Bifacial Cores (1 specimen)
This small specimen, found on the surface of the site in 1980, is
of a partially patinated gray chert that is apparently related to
Cretaceous I imestone cherts from west and south of the Brazos River.
It is similar in color and siliceous texture to Georgetown chert but
with a number of tiny fossi I iferous inclusions. It has a chalky tan
I imestone cortex on part of one face. The specimen exhibits heavy
battering and rounding along two edges. This appears to be platform
preparation rather than utilization. Platform types uti Ii zed include
cortex, single facet and multiple facet. Weight of the specimen is
75.5 grams.
Maximum length is 5.9 centimeters, maximum width is 4.9
centimeters and thickness is 2.7 centimeters.
Multidimensional Cores (2 specimens)
The larger of these two specimens is from the southwestern
quadrant of level 7 in TP 1. It is a smal I gray and reddish-brown
banded chert nodule with cortex remaining on both faces. Identifiable
platforms include cortex and single facet types, but primarily the
latter. A hinge fracture on one side suggests that it is a fragment
from a larger core. Weight of the specimen is 75.5 grams. Maximum
length is 5.9 centimeters, maximum width is 4.9 centimeters and
thickness is 2.7 centimeters.
The smaller specimen is a partially patinated apparent fragment
of tabular chert from the northwestern quadrant of level 11 of TP 2.
Al I of the identifiable platforms are single facet.
Weight of the
specimen is 36.0 grams. Maximum length is 6.3 centimeters, maximum
width is 3.6 centimeters and thickness is 1.8 centimeters.

Discussion

The paucity of cores suggests that initial stage I ithic reduction
was not very common at the site. This has already been suggested with
respect to the lower terrace area, where tertiary flakes were found in
relatively higher percentages. Despite corticate debitage percentages
from the upper terrace area that are comparable to known lithic
workshop sites such as 41HI109 and 41HI110, the low percentage of
cores (and bifaces, as wel I) in this area may indicate limited early

stage workshop activities.
On the other hand, the sample size of
cores and bifaces 1n this area is miniscule (one of each) and
percentage comparisons between areas or sites are not valid. More
careful analysis of the cores shows several to be anomalous, however.
The specimen from the surface should probably be excluded from
percentage counts, since it derived from a collection biased toward
the collection of tools and cores. In addition, its heavily battered
edges mark it as an unusual specimen, suggesting that it may have
functioned as some special tool rather than a core (or after its use
as a core). Although the evidence for use of the quartzite specimen
from TP 1 is slim, the near-absence of quartzite cores or tool forms
other than the heavy chopper form suggests that it may have served as
a hastily made and only briefly used tool rather than a source for
flake blanks. This leaves only two good specimens, one each from test
pits 1 and 2, which comprise only 0.3% of al I lithic debris.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
A total of 23 specimens was identified, compr1s1ng 3.6% of the
total lithic artifact sample and 53.5% of al I tools from the site. As
with unmodified debitage, most of these specimens (65.2%) are from TP
1.
The ratio of unmodified to modified debitage at the site is
26.2:1. Stated differently, 3.7% of al I debitage has been identified
as modified, one of the higher figures from the Aquil la Lake area.
Modified debitage includes 11 secondary flakes, 7 tertiary
flakes, 2 chips and 3 indeterminate specimens. Although chips are
often the least numerous category, the ratio of chips to flakes
modified at the Sul I ivan Site is the lowest of any site in the lake
area. Table 33.7 shows the distribution of modified debitage among
the various test units.
One of the indeterminate specimens from TP 1 was lost during
processing and is not included in the categories below. A total of 37
uti Ii zed facets was recorded on the rema1n1ng 22 specimens.
This
yields an average of 1.7 utilized facets per specimen, one of the
highest recorded in the project area. As usual, Type 1 modification
is the most common, with 27 facets occurring on 18 flakes. Type 2
modification is represented by five facets on four flakes and both
types of attrition are combined on five facets of four flakes. Ten
flakes have multiple uti I ized facets.
These include two specimens
with four facets each and eight with double facets. Five of these
multiple facet flakes have only Type 1 attrition, one has only Type 2
and another has combined Type 1 and Type 2 attrition. The remaining
three have various combinations of attrition types. Table 33.8 shows
the distribution of al I attrition facets by type and excavation unit.

between secondary (12 or 46.4% of Type 1 facets) and tertiary flakes
(12 or 42.9%).
One chip and one indeterminate specimen have Type 1
attrition. As at most sites, unifacial modification, indicative of
scraping activities, dominates the Type 1 sample. A total of 22
facets (81.5%) are unifacial, while three (11.1%) are bifacial and
another
two facets (7.4%) exhibit both bifacial and unifacial
attrition. Straight edge outlines are the most important single
category, occurring on nearly half of the Type 1 facets. Table V.82
shows the distribution of the remainder of the edge outline types.
Lateral edges were utilized most frequently, accounting for 16 (59.3%)

of the 27 total facets.
Other than two facets occurring
on
indeterminate edges, the remaining nine facets (33.3%) were found on
distal edges. As has been the rule, dorsal surfaces are most commonly
modified.
A total of 17 facets (60.7%) were dorsal surface only.
Four facets (14.8%) had attrition only on the ventral surface and
another five had attrition on both surfaces. The surface of one facet
could not be determined.

41HI117
Type 2 Attrition (4 flakes, 5 facets)
These four specimens include only double faceted flakes. One of
the other facets occurs on one of the four faceted flakes but none of
its other three facets exhibit only Type 2 attrition. Type 2 facets
occur on three secondary flakes and one specimen of indeterminate
debitage. Al I five of the Type 2 facets are unifacial and occur on
lateral edges. Four of the specimens exhibit attrition on the dorsal
surface while the rema1n1ng specimen is modified on the ventral
surface.
Edge outlines, shown in Table V.82, are varied, with two
straight, one concave and two convex samples.
Types 1 and 2 Attrition (4 specimens, 5 facets)
These four specimens include three secondary flakes and one chip.
The chip has two facets which exhibit types 1 and 2 attrition
together. Two of the secondary flakes have other utilized facets as
wel I.
Four facets are modified unifacial ly and the fifth has both
bifacial and unifacial modification on the same flake.
Two are
modified on the lateral edge and three on the distal edge. Four
exhibit modification of the dorsal surface and the fifth on both
surfaces.
Edge outlines are varied, with two convex facets, two
concave/convex and one notch.
Formal Tools
BIFACES (12 specimens)
Thick Bifaces (4 specimens)
This group includes two thick bifacial tools, one roughout and a
blank.
Two are from TP 1 and the remaining two are from the surface.
Together they comprise 0.6% of al I I ithic debris from the site, 20.0%
of al I formal flaked stone tools and tool blanks (i.e., all bifaces
and projectile points) and 33.3% of al I bifaces.
The most unusual specimen is an ovate, purple quartzite biface
with notches ground or battered into either long end (Fig. 33.6a).
Bifacial edges are slightly ground along the entire length of the
edge.
This specimen was collected from the surface in 1980. It is
apparently a variant form of a Waco Sinker. A similar specimen was
recovered from the surface of 41Hl110. One face is largely covered by
cortex; the specimen may have been manufactured from a large primary
flake.
cross section of the piece is lenticular. Weight of the
specimen is 39.9 grams. Maximum length is 5.6 centimeters, maximum
width is 3.6 centimeters and thickness is 2.0 centimeters. Depth of
the notches is about 3 millimeters at either end.

The second tool from this group is the distal portion of an
irregularly shaped thick biface from the northwestern quadrant of
level 6 in TP 1. This specimen is made from a waxy white chert
similar to some Arkansas novaculites but has not been positively
identified as such. It has a pronounced piano-convex cross section,
with a smal I patch of white cortex on the center of the convex face.
One edge is bifacial and sinuous while the other is straight and
essentially unifacial. The convex face of this latter edge is marked
by a series of unifacial step fracturesJ while the immediate edge is
rounded from heavy use. On closer inspectionJ the other edge, which
does not appear at first glance to be utilized, shows signs of heavy
edge smoothing at points along the sinuous edge. Apparently, this
edge was also heavily uti I ized and subsequently resharpened.
Weight
of this specimen is 14.5 grams.
Maximum rema1n1ng width is 3.2
centimeters and rema1n1ng thickness is 1.4 centimeters.
One of the rema1n1ng two thick bi faces 1s a smal I roughout
(Fig. 33.6b) from the northeastern quadrant of level 7 in TP 1. It is
a grayish-brown mottled chert with cortex rema1n1ng on both faces;
the size of the original pebble was obviously smal I. Flake removals
are large percussion scars and the edges of the biface are slightly
sinuous.
The specimen is ovate and slightly irregular in cross
section, lying somewhere between lenticular and subtriangular.
One
small section of edge has unifacial step fracture scars along itJ but
this appears to be platform preparation rather than utilization;
no
smoothing or polish is evidenced along this edge. Weight of the
specimen is 31.6 grams. Maximum length is 5.3 centimeters, maximum
width is 3.2 centimeters and thickness is 2.0 centimeters.
The final specimen from this group is a smal I subtriangular or
foliate blank (Fig. 33.6c) collected from the backdirt of BHT D, the
trench closest to TP 1. It is a gray chert with cortex rema1n1ng on
much of one face and a large cortex platform remaining at the base.
There is no evidence of use anywhere on the piece, but the reason for
its apparent abandonment is unclear. Weight of the specimen 1s 16.7
grams. Maximum length is 4.7 centimetersJ maximum width 1s 3.2
centimeters and thickness is 1.3 centimeters.
Thin Bifaces (8 specimens)
These eight specimens comprise 1.3% of al I lithic debris from the
site, 21.1% of al I flaked stone tools and blanks and 66.7% of al I
bi faces. Two of the eight specimens were collected from the surface,
five from TP 1 and one from TP 2. One of the surface finds is the
only complete thin biface from the site.

33-37

41HI117
The single complete specimen (Fig. 33.6d) is the only biface from
the site which can be clearly assigned to one of the formal bifacial
categories established for the 1980 analysis. This is a smal I FORM 1
gouge collected from the disturbed surface of the central area of the
site in 1982. It exhibits tiny hinge fractures on the front of the
bit with some smoothing visible along the immediate edge. This wear
cannot be characterized as particularly intense.
Weight of the
specimen is 15.3 grams. Maximum length is 4.4 centimeters, maximum
width is 2.9 centimeters and thickness is 1.1 centimeters.
The
rema1n1ng
seven
specimens
are
al I
miscellaneous
unidentifiable fragments of thin bifaces. The four larger specimens
al I show signs of use, while the other three are extremely small.
Three of these fragments are distal, one is apparently a base and
another may be a fragment from a corner of a base and lateral edge.
One of the smaller specimens may be from the unfinished barb of a dart
point or from the unfinished stem of an arrow point preform. The last
of these 1s an indeterminate medial fragment.
One of the tips, found in the northeastern quadrant of level 11
in TP 2, is a white grainy chert. This specimen shows evidence of
polish along both lateral edges.
Another tip fragment, from the
southeastern quadrant of level 7 of TP 1, is a tan, fine grained
quartzite similar in some respects to the Ogal I ala material but more
workable than any of the fine grained quartzite observed in the
Aqui I la Lake area. Both of these material types are probably exotic.
The latter distal fragment also evidences polish along both lateral
edges, though slightly less intense than on the chert specimen,
perhaps a function of the strength of the material. In both cases,
the use wear appears much heavier on one lateral edge than the other.
The more complete thin bifacial base fragment contracts slightly
toward the base which is subrounded. This specimen, collected from
the surface of the site in 1980, exhibits smoothing and unifacial
hinge fracturing along the base and both lateral edges. The steep
angle of the base suggests a gouge-like form, but this is not
particularly consistent with the overal I morphology of the piece or
the observable use-wear. An apparent basal corner fragment, from the
southwestern quadrant of level 7 of TP 1, is heavily uti I ized, showing
unifacial step fractures and extensive polish along the rema1n1ng
portions of base and lateral edge. The use-wear on the lateral edge
over I ies a series of apparent resharpening flakes.
Projectile Points (3 specimens)
Three projectile points were collected from the surface of the
site, two in 1982 and one in 1980. Al I of these are dart points
although several arrow points, reportedly collected from the site,
33-38

41HI117
were observed in the landowner>s collection.
DART POINTS (3 specimens)
Unidentified Dart Points
None of the three dart points can be assigned to an established
type. Although al I three are stemmed, none is particularly similar to
any of the others, not surprising given the identification of dozens
of different types from among the landowner's collection.
One of the specimens (Fig. 33.6e), a greenish-brown banded chert
(or possibly petrified wood) that may not be from a local source,
bears some resemblance to both Palmi I las and Godley types but does not
fit comfortably in either one. It has a moderately expanding stem
with a slightly concave base. One of the stem edges is slightly
ground while the other does not appear to be.
Shoulders are
moderately prominent but not really barbed. The blade is of medium
size, with slightly convex blade edges. Cross section is lenticular.
Weight of the specimen is 7.3 grams. Length is 5.0 centimeters, width
is 2.3 centimeters and thickness is 0.8 centimeters. Stem length is
1.4 centimeters, neck width is 1.3 centimeters and basal width is 1.5
centimeters.
The other specimen from the 1982 surface collection is a long,
narrow bladed, slightly expanding stemmed point (Fig. 33.6f) that also
bears some resemblance to the Godley type, in its stem form, but also
to the Dari as wel I, in its long slender form and serrated edges. It
is longer and narrower, with weaker shoulders, than most of the Godley
points identified in the Aqui Ila Lake collection and does not have the
characteristic beveled edges of most Dari specimens. It is made of a
grey chert which resembles Georgetown material, but is somewhat
coarser grained. The base expands slightly and both stem edges are
wel I ground. An obtuse angled cortex platform surface remains at the
base, and some cortex, or perhaps a similar inclusion, remains along

unfinished, or perhaps resharpened, but the ground stem edges probably
indicate that it was used. Weight of the specimen is 7.3 grams.
Length is 5.6 centimeters, width is 2.0 centimeters and thickness is
0.8 centimeters. Stem length is 1.1 centimeters, neck width 1s 1.2

The final dart point, collected from the surface in 1980, is a
smal I para I lel stemmed point made from a whitish-gray river cobble
chert (Fig. 33.6g). The stem is relatively long and narrow, and the
base is unfinished, retaining a cortex platform surface. The blade is
short with slightly convex edges.
The shoulders are slightly

almost barbed. The very tip has been removed by an apparent impact

of these specimens are from TP 1; two from the northeastern quadrant
of level 6 and the third from the southwestern quadrant of level 7.
The fourth specimen is from the northeastern quadrant of level 7 of TP
3. The two largest, both from level 6 of TP 1, also show the most
extensive battering.
The specimen from just below this level, the
smallest of the four, is broken on the battered edge.
This fracture
appears to be the result of a misplaced blow rather than from thermal
alteration. The hammerstone from TP 3 exhibits the least wear of any
specimen. Wear on al I specimens is variable and discontinuous.
Grinding Stones (1 specimen)
This rectangular specimen (Fig. 33.6h) was collected from the
surface of the site in 1980. One face is rounded from use. Smoothed
corners suggest that the opposite face may also have been utilized as
a mano at one time but most of the surface on this side has been
battered and scarred (plow damage?) beyond positive identification.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In many respects, the Sul I ivan Site 1s one of the most
interesting and potentially significant sites in the Aqui I la Lake
area. The large number of projectile points noted in the landowner's
collection are evidence of the long history of aboriginal occupation.
The number of Paleoindian dart points observed on the surface or in
the private collection, equals more than the total number of these
specimens collected from al I the other Aqui I la sites during more than
ten years of archeological projects in the area. In addition, several
33-40

41HI117
Archaic projectile point styles not represented in the collections
from elsewhere in the lake area were observed.
Some of these
differences can be attributed to sampling error.
There are more
projectile points in the Sullivan collection than were recovered
during al I of the archeological projects. The size of the collection,
however, is in itself considered significant. Few sites in the lake
area, with the possible exception of the Brazi I Site (41HI75), from
which a large number of projectile points have reportedly been
gathered, have yielded or have the potential to yield such an enormous
collection.
A few of the specimens from the H.D. Sul Ii van collection
are i I lustrated in figures 33.7 and 33.8.
An interesting subjective comment on the large projectile point
collection is the seemingly high ratio of finished dart points to
debitage on the surface of the site. Although a quantity of debitage
was collected from TP 1, it was not extremely common on the surface.
Projectile points, on the other hand, were much more common than the
numbers collected would indicate since some specimens, perhaps as many
as half a dozen, were observed on the surface but could not be
relocated after heavy flooding inundated the area.
While the huge number of projectile points suggests frequent
reoccupations over a long span of time, the apparent high frequency of
points relative to debitage may indicate special activities at the
site. As noted above, the site has a very high percentage of tertiary
flake debitage and few good specimens of cores. Thick bifaces are not
particularly common and many of the thin bifaces found may be
fragments of projectile points. This suggests that primary reduction
was not an important activity at the site, and what little there may
have been may have occurred on the upper terrace near test pits 2 and
3.
On the other hand, the final stage manufacture of projectile
points, indicated by the preponderance of tertiary flakes and the
generally smal I size of much of the debitage, may have been of
considerable importance.
Cultural materials were collected from an area of nearly 100,000
square meters, making the Sullivan Site one of the largest in the
Aqui I la area. This figure is comparable only to the Brazil Site
(41HI75), which, as noted above, may approach or even surpass the
Sullivan Site in number of projectile points collected over the years.
The Brazi I Site, however, is in a different environmental setting,
located on the top and downstream side of an upland finger ridge and
extending down to the modern floodplain. The greatest density of
material at the Brazi I Site seems to have come from the old alluvial
terrace at the foot of the finger ridge. Some of this material,
including in situ Early Archaic materials, comes from a very low
terrace adjacent to the modern floodplain, a situation very similar to
that of the lowest terrace component at Sul I ivan.

may be present at a slightly higher elevation near the foot of the
finger ridge. Unlike the Sul Ii van Site upper terrace, this area
contains a relatively high density of cultural materials on and just
below the surface, and has been the scene of some very intense looting
since the property was acquired by the Corps of Engineers. Although
the data are not clear, it seems likely that this upper terrace area
at the Brazi I Site may have been uti Ii zed for primary reduction more
so than the lower area, since it is essentially adjacent to a source
of raw materials in the Uvalde gravels that I ine the finger ridge

easily explicable rn terms of the
environmental setting. The ridge provides not only a good source of
I ithic raw materials (both chert and sandstone for hearths, grinding
slabs, etc.) but an excel lent lookout from which one can see up and
down the creek for long distances. The low terraces provide broad
flat areas for camping near water. This latter setting is present at
the Sullivan Site, but 41HI117 has no ridge, and it is unclear whether
the gravels buried in the terrace remnant north of the site were
exposed during the aboriginal occupations.
The low frequency of
primary reduction suggests that they were not.
The similarity between these two sites may I ie more rn the
geomorphic development of the creek basin. These two areas are among
the very few segments of lower terrace remaining along either
Hackberry or Aqui I la creeks. Other possible remnants of this terrace
may exist at 41HI74/114 and 41HI106.
These occurrences, al I on
archeological sites, are the only ones known from the lake area. It
is suggested here that this terrace, more extensive when it was the
floodplain of the creek, contained numerous archeological sites,
probably dating from the Paleoindian Period through the Early or
perhaps even Middle Archaic.
During a period of downcutting and
valley erosion that may have occurred in the Altithermal, these buried
sites were destroyed. Although later occupations at these sites added
new, and generally surficial, cultural materials, it 1s interesting
that the Sul Ii van Site seems to contain a high percentage of
Paleoindian as wel I as Early and Middle Archaic diagnostics and almost
no Late Prehistoric component.
Despite the great potential importance of the Sullivan Site, TAS
excavations were unable to locate any sign of in situ buried
archeological materials and did ascertain that subsurface disturbances
have been enormous. Although the large size of the site precludes any
blanket statements, the evidence to date suggests that the chances of
finding a wel I preserved buried component at the Sullivan Site are

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI125, in the upland slope microenvironment of the Aqui I la
Creek drainage, is situated on a ridge adjacent to the east bank of
Aqui I la Creek (Fig. 34.1). The ridge slopes southwesterly from the
upland edge to the creek bank and rises to a maximum height of
approximately 5.5 meters above the surrounding floodplain (Fig. 34.2).
Although the area was once I ikely covered by post oaks, the area has
been cleared of overstory vegetation and is currently pastureland.
A
stand of post oaks remains along Aqui I la Creek and the lower
southwestern portion of the ridge.
The location, adjacent to the
drainage and above the floodplain, may have made it an attractive
campsite for prehistoric inhabitants of the area. Surface inspection
in 1972 (Skinner and Henderson 1972) and in 1978 revealed only a
sparse scatter of I ithic materials on the top and slopes of the ridge
in an area measuring approximately 50 by 100 meters.
DATA COLLECTION
The 1978 investigations of 41HI125 (originally recorded as
x41HI168) were designed to determine the extent, nature and contextual
integrity of the subsurface deposits.
Both shovel test holes and
control led excavation units were used to accomplish this goal.
Initially, a series of 107 shovel tests were systematically excavated
throughout the site area. Upon completion of the shovel testing, ten
1 by 1 meter square units were excavated to collect a larger sample of
artifacts and to test the relative efficiency of the two testing
methodologies.
The shovel test holes were approximately 30 centimeters 1n
diameter and 40 centimeters in depth. The matrix from each hole was
screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth.
Shovel tests were first

placed at five meter intervals along a base line approximating the
central axis of the ridge. Six transects, consisting of shovel test
holes at five meter intervals, were then systematically placed across
the ridge perpendicular to the base I ine.
These transects were
extended outward from the base I ine unti I cultural materials became
nonexistent.
In this manner the perimeter of
the
site
was
established.
The 1 by 1 meter square test units
were
systematically
superimposed on every tenth shovel test hole. The original shovel
test hole was located in the southwest corner of each designated
excavation unit (Fig. 34.3). The test excavation units were excavated
in arbitrary 10 centimeter levels and al I matrix was screened through
1/4 inch hardware cloth. It was thought that the larger size of these
units would provide a more adequate sample of artifacts and increase
the probabi I ity of locating J..!!. situ features.

41HI125
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Agricultural practices and the resulting soi I erosion have
destroyed the original stratigraphic context of 41HI125. A sandy clay
deposit, varying in depth from 10 to 30 centimeters, overlies a basal
unit of orange-brown clayey sand and fine gravels. The gravels were
also present in the sandy loam deposits near the center of the ridge
(excavation units 50, 60 and 70).
The mixture of historic and
prehistoric artifacts throughout the sandy loam reveals that the
primary context of the artifacts has been destroyed by plowing and
extensive rodent burrowing. Excavation of the test units revealed no
in situ features.
The few temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered indicate that
the site was intermittently occupied from at least the Middle Archaic
through the Historic Period. A Pedernales stem fragment, other dart
point fragments and an arrow point fragment denote occupations during
both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The historic artifacts
appear to date to the latter half of the nineteenth and possibly the
early twentieth century. The lack of segregation of these period
markers precludes the recognition of period specific assemblages other
than that of the Historic Period at this site.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
The lithic debris from 41HI125 included both flaked and battered
stone.
Of the total 953 lithic artifacts, al I but one (99.9%) are
flaked. No ground stone was recovered from the site.
Since neither
the stratigraphic evidence nor the vertical distribution of the
artifacts suggested that discrete occupational periods could be
defined, the entire I ithic assemblage wi I I be treated as a single
unit. Within this single unit, however, two distinctive samples of
artifacts exist. A site wide sample was recovered from the 107 shovel
tests, while 10 excavation units were used to recover a larger, and
hopefully more representative, sample of artifacts from randomly
selected areas of the site. This larger sample of artifacts from the
control led excavation units wil I provide the primary data base for
interpretive conclusions regarding the prehistoric utilization of
41HI125.
The smaller sample from the shovel tests wi I I be used in a
comparative manner to assess variability across the site.

FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage constitutes 96.ll of the entire I ithic
assemblage.
Flakes (51.11) are the most common artifacts of this
class. The remaining materials of this class consist of chips (48.2%)
and cores (0.7%).
FLAKES (468 specimens)
As noted above, the primary discussion of the morphological flake
categories
wi I I focus upon the assemblage recovered from the
controlled excavation units. The smaller sample from the shovel tests
wi I I be used as a comparative sample for judging the site-wide
variabi I ity of the debitage assemblage.
Primary Flakes (12 specimens)
Five primary flakes comprise 1.6% of the flake collection from
the excavation units (Table 34.1). Al I five were recovered from units
40, 60 and 100. Al I are of chert and exhibit single facet platforms.
The attributes of I ipping and burning appear on only one specimen.
Seven primary flakes from the shovel test holes exhibit a greater
amount of variabi I ity (Table 34.2). Although single facet platforms
are stil I dominant, cortex (n=2) and crushed platform (n=l) are also
represented.
Chert remains the dominant raw material, with only one
specimen of quartzite present.

dominant raw material within this flake category. Three specimens of
quartzite and one of hematite were recovered from the excavation
units, while only four secondary flakes from the shovel tests were
made of quartzite.
Only four of the defined platform types occur within the two
samples of secondary flakes. Cortex and single facet are clearly the
dominant modes of platform preparation. The dominance of either of
these modes varies from unit to unit. However, within the total
assemblage, single facet platforms are clearly more common (Table
34.3).
Within the excavation units, multiple facet platforms occur
very infrequently (0.9%) while crushed platforms comprise only 7.2% of
the assemblage. This same pattern is exhibited by the flakes from the
shovel tests (Table 34.2).

As with the primary flakes, the attributes of I ipping and burning
occur infrequently within the assemblage from the test excavation
units. Only one specimen exhibits lipping while six have been burned.
Similar proportions of lipping and burning are represented in the
shovel test assemblage (Table 34.2).
Tertiary Flakes (278 specimens)
Only three platform types were recognized among the two samples
of tertiary flakes. Since tertiary flakes represent a later stage of
reduction, a higher proportion of multiple facet platforms is to be
expected.
Although the proportion of multiple facet platforms (8.4%)
is greater than that of the sample of secondary flakes, such a
proportion is wel I below that of most of the Aqui I la assemblages.
Interestingly, the single facet platform is the dominant platform type
(78.7%) within the tertiary flake sample. Crushed platforms (12.9%)
are the second most common platform type (Table 34.4).
As with the primary and secondary flake samples, the presence of
ventral platform lips (1.5%) and evidence of burning (l.0%) is
infrequent. The raw material type of these flakes is also consistent
with the earlier stages of reduction. Chert comprises 99.5% of the
tertiary flake sample (Table 34.5). As before, similar patterns are
exhibited by the shovel test assemblage (Table 34.2).
Flakes:

Discussion

The patterning of the flake attributes for the three flake
categories from 41HI125 is particularly interesting when compared to
that of other assemblages from the Aqui I la drainage (e.g., the Bailey
Site, 41HI77). The distinctiveness of the assemblage from 41HI125 is
immediately apparent. Irrespective of the flake category, single
facet platforms clearly dominate even though tertiary flakes comprise
the greatest portion of the assemblage (Table 34.1). The percentages
of crushed platforms are also much higher than those exhibited by the
Bailey Site assemblage (tables 26.3, 34.4 and 34.6).
The very low
percentages of multiple facet platforms suggest that the later stages
of bifacial reduction were not conducted at the site.
Final shaping
and
thinning
or tool maintenance apparently were not primary
activities.
The use of a hard hammer for flaking may explain the relatively
high percentages of crushed platforms.
The use of hard hammer
percussion may also be related to the exceedingly low percentages of

flakes exhibiting lipped platforms (1.7% of the total sample) is very
34-8

41HI125
close to the percentage of experimentally produced flakes exhibiting
I ipped platforms when a hard hammer percussor is used (Henry, Haynes
and Bradley 1976).
Although the raw material type of both the core
and the percussor at 41HI125 may have differed from that of the
experimental assemblage, the similar results are highly suggestive of
the use of a hard hammer technology.
CHIPS (442 specimens)
Of the total of 442 chips, 307 (69.5%) were recovered from the
excavation units while 135 (30.5%) were recovered through shovel
testing. The distribution of the chips is very similar to that of the
larger debitage, with units 30, 50, 60, 80, and 90 displaying the
highest frequencies (Table 34.6). The recovery of five and nine chips
from shovel tests 27 and 28, respectively, may indicate a relatively
high density of material in that area of the site, also. However, it
is interesting to note that most of the shovel test holes surrounding
the most productive excavation units produced very few (2 or less)
chips.
Thermal alteration and raw material type were the only attributes
noted for the chips.
The raw material types represented closely
para I lel those of the larger debitage.
Chert comprises the major
portion (97.3%) of the assemblage with quartzite (1.4%), hematite
(0.7%), chalcedony (0.5%) and si licified wood (0.25%) only minimally
represented.
Interestingly, si licified wood and chalcedony are not
represented within the sample of larger debitage. Thermal alteration
was noted on only 6.5% of the chert specimens. This low percentage of
intensity
burned specimens may be related to the overall low
utilization of the site.
CORES (6 specimens)
The smal I number of cores recovered from the excavation units (5)
and the shovel tests (1) is not unexpected given the relatively low
percentages of primary and secondary flakes recovered.
Most of the cores were recovered from areas exhibiting the
highest densities of artifacts. Given the low density of artifacts
throughout the site, the probabi I ity of finding a discarded core would
I ikely be very low. Given the smal I sample size, cores (0.6% of the
lithic assemblage) are more than adequately represented.
All of the cores are of locally available cherts.
Two of the
specimens from EU 50 exhibit unidirectional flaking. Bifacial flake
removal is present on two other specimens. A single specimen exhibits
multidirectional flaking. The remaining specimen is a very smal I core
fragment which was likely too small for the production of a tool

present, it is difficult to understand why the bifacial cores were
discarded. The unidirectional cores, on the other hand, may have
provided the necessary tool blanks and were no longer needed, or were
judged unsuitable for further reduction. The remaining two specimens,
a core fragment and a multidirectional core, were likely no longer of

Although the reason for the discard of these few cores is a
highly speculative matter, it is apparent from the lithic debris that
decortif ication of the cobbles either took place elsewhere on the site
or that the raw material was brought to the site as blanks or
preforms. Unfortunately, sampling bias may be skewing the assessment
of the activities conducted at 41HI125.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
The modified debitage from 41HI125 comprises 2.6% of the entire
lithic assemblage.
The modification occurs on secondary (n=4) and
tertiary flakes (n=ll), chips (n=9) and a pebble (n=l). Both Type 1
and Type 2 attrition facets appear on these specimens. Type 1
attrition is most common, appearing on 60% of the elements (Table
34.8).
The occurrence of both attrition types on a single facet is
also common.
Thirty-six percent of the uti Ii zed
flakes
were
apparently intentionally modified in preparation for such uti I ization.

TYPE 1 ATTRITION (15 specimens, 22 facets)
Only five of the specimens exhibiting Type 1 attrition have more
than a single facet.
Three of these exhibit two facets while the
remaining two exhibit three facets.
Chips served as the primary
blanks for these informal tools (53.3%). Tertiary flakes (40%) were
also commonly chosen for utilization producing Type 1 facets.
Only
6.7% of the Type 1 attrition appears on secondary flakes. Al I of
these blanks are of locally available cherts.

Al I of the Type 1 facets are unifacial, with the dorsal surface
of the blank the preferred position. Only one of the Type 1 facets
appears on the ventral surface of the specimen. The location of the
Type 1 facets is equally divided between distal (n=S) and lateral
(n=S) edges. Two other specimens exhibit facets on both the lateral
and distal edges. The location of the facets on the remaining three
specimens was indeterminable.
The presence of concave (6) and convex {9) facet edge outlines
within this sample indicates that scraping activities were most I ikely
responsible for these Type 1 facets. The straight edge outlines {8
facets), which may have served equally wel I for cutting or scraping
activities, constitute only 36.4% of the total number of facets
exhibiting Type 1 attrition.

41Hl125
TYPE 2 ATTRITION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
A single chert chip exhibited Type 2 attrition only. The convex
shaped retouch is present on the ventral surface of the chip. Whether
this intentional edge modification was to be used for cutting or
scraping activities is unknown.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (9 specimens, 15 facets)
Two-thirds of these specimens exhibit a single facet with types 1
and 2 attrition. The three remaining specimens exhibit two, three and
four facets respectively. Secondary (n=3) and tertiary (n=5) flakes
and a single pebble served as the blanks for these informal tools.
Modification is typically unifacial except for a single case of
bifacial retouch.
As with the Type 1 attrition facets, both the lateral and distal
edges of the blank were equally uti Ii zed. Four specimens exhibit
facets on a lateral edge only, while three exhibit facets on a distal

its lateral and distal edges. The location of the facets on the
remaining specimen 1s indeterminable.
The position of the facets exhibiting both types 1 and 2
attrition is more variable than the other classes of attrition.
Although the dorsal surface of the blank is most common (4 specimens),
the ventral surface (2 specimens) or both surfaces (2 specimens) are
also represented. The facet edge outlines are even more variable, for
six classes of edge outline are represented: concave (1 specimen),
convex (2 specimens), concave-convex (2 specimens), straight (1
specimen), a combination of straight and concave (1 specimen) and
irregular (2 specimens).
Assuming that the concave and convex
outlines are more suitable for scraping activities, the specimens
exhibiting both types 1 and 2 attrition were used more frequently for
scraping than for cutting.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS:

DISCUSSION

Although the frequency of modified debitage is relatively low for
41Hl125, the distribution of informal tools indicates that their use
was an important part of the extraction activities at the site.
Only
12 of the 25 specimens were recovered from the larger excavation
units. The remainder were recovered from widely scattered shovel test
holes (Table 34.5).
Their presence in such I imited test units
indicates that the probability of their representation throughout the
site is very high.

Only 40~ of the informal tools were intentionally modified prior
to their uti I ization.
The majority of the informal tools are flake
blanks which have been altered through use only. Concave and convex
facet edge outlines dominate the sample. Assuming that such edge
outlines would have been more conducive to scraping activities, this
I imited sample of modified debitage suggests that extraction processes

Given the overal I low densities of I ithic artifacts, the products
and by-products of bifacial tool production are relatively wel I
represented (0.6~) even though the actual raw frequencies are low.
Although the intermittent occupations of the site were apparently very

of the base indicate that the point may have been broken in the
process of reworking.
The rema1n1ng fragments are unidentifiable as to type.
A
rectangular stem (11 by 10 mm) with an irregular straight base was
recovered from Shovel Test 12. Distal dart point fragments were also
recovered from level 1 of units 30 and 90. A distal fragment of an
arrow point was recovered from level 1 of Shovel Test 100. Many more
projectile points were likely present on the site surface prior to its
discovery by local collectors.
The present sample is, therefore,

originally discarded here.
GROUND AND BATTERED STONE
Hammerstones (1 specimen)
A single quartzite hammerstone was recovered from Shovel Test 27.
A single battered facet is present on this blocky cobble. Ninety-five
percent of the original cobble is present.
The length, width and
thickness dimensions are 45 centimeters, 39 centimeters, and 30
centimeters, respectively. The weight of the specimen is 78.8 grams.
The poor representation of hammerstones within this assemblage
may reflect sampling problems or the curation of valued tools. Since
the low density of artifacts indicates several ephemeral occupations,
valued hammerstones were I ikely curated for further use.

artifacts.

clear.
There are no records concerning an historic
occupation of the site. The predominance of the historic assemblage
by glass and fine earthenware fragments suggests that domestic or
household activities were primarily responsible for this refuse.
Whether a house structure was once present or the refuse merely
represents a dump area for a more distant structure is unclear. Given

Although the precise period of the use of the site as a dump area
cannot be designated, a variety of datable materials were recovered.
"Purple glass", or amethyst bottle fragments, were recovered from
several units.
This high manganese-content glass was most common
between 1880 and 1914 {Kendrick 1966:57). Several fragments of blue

The blue ground ironstone was produced between 1825 and 1851 (Hughes
and Hughes 1972:85).
A variety of mach~ne cut and wire nai Is were
also recovered.
The cut nai Is, which are most abundant, were
primarily used unti I the 1890s when wire nai Is became the dominant
type (Nelson 1968). Like the glass and the earthenwares, however, cut
nai Is were likely used and discarded long after their primary

DISCUSSION OF TESTING TECHNIQUES
Two testing methodologies were used to retrieve information
concerning the areal extent of 41HI125 and the relative artifact
densities within the site boundaries. The two approaches involved the
use of the traditional 1 by 1 meter excavation units and the more
expedient shovel test technique advocated by archeologists needing to
quickly evaluate sites in contractual situations. One reason for
excavating the 1 by 1 meter units was to test the relative reliability
of the information obtained when using the shovel test technique.
Shovel testing is the more expedient of the two methods, and if it
could be shown to provide information equivalent to that derived from
the 1 by 1 meter excavation units, it would provide a more efficient
approach
to retrieving information concerning areal extent and
artifact densities.
The smal I size of the recovered sample of tools made it
impossible to use these as the exclusive basis for analysis. Instead,
the total number of lith~c artifacts (including flakes, proximal
flakes, chips, non-diagnostic shatter, as wel I as tools) from each 1
by 1 meter unit and its associated shovel test were used as variables
in a simple linear regression analysis (Nie et al. 1975:323; Afifi
and Azen 1972:87-106). In this analysis the count for the 1 by 1
meter units was treated as the dependent variable while the count for
shovel tests represented the independent (or predictor) variable. The
analysis was performed with the use of the SPSS MULTIPLE REGRESSION
program (Nie et al. 1975).
In simple linear regression analysis, values of the dependent
variable are predicted from a linear function of the form, Y' =A+
BX, where Y" is the predicted value of Y (the dependent variable), B
is a constant by which al I values of X (the independent variable), are
multiplied, and A is a constant added to each case.
The difference
between the actual and predicted values of Y for each case is cal led
the residual (or error or prediction). In regression analysis, the
values for A and 8 are computed by the least-squares method. That is,
their values are selected such that the sum of squared residuals is
minimized.
The resulting linear equation is cal led the least-squares
line or the line of best fit (Nie et al. 1975:323).
The linear
equation resulting-frOiil'Sample data used in this analysis (Table 34.8)
is Y' = 18.21486 + 16.428571X.

Inferential statistics may be applied to test the statistical
significance of the observed I inear association. This is accomplished
by computing an F-ratio of the mean square about regression over the
mean square within groups (Afifi and Azen 1972:99), in this case, F =
39.4494 with 1 and 8 degrees of freedom. The p-value (or level of
significance) for this F is less than 0.001.
More important to our purposes is the R2 value.
R2
1s
interpreted as "the proportion of the variance of Y due to or
1
explained 1 by knowledge of
X"
(Afifi
and
Azen
1972:101).
Essentially, the R2 indicates with what degree of accuracy the value
of Y can be predicted, if the value of X is known. Possible values of
R2 range from 0 to 1. The R2 value computed for this data set was
0.8314.
The high correlation between artifact counts from shovel tests
and 1 by 1 meter pits suggests that, in sites of this nature, the
shovel test technique may be as reliable as the use of 1 by 1 meter
units for determining site I imits and establishing relative densities
of cultural material. As a cautionary note, it must be realized that
the preceding analysis was based on only ten cases. Although this in
no way invalidates the analysis or its results, a larger sample size
would be more convincing.
Despite the high statistical correlation, the data also suggest
possible problems with the use of shovel tests. The definition of
site I imits is one of the problem areas. In two cases where shovel
34-21

41HI125
tests produced no cultural material (28 and 49), the subsequent 1 by 1
meter units were not sterile, although the counts were relatively low.
In addition, while shovel testing was sufficient for observing the
general stratigraphy in a shallow site such as 41HI125, its utility is
questionable with respect to deeper deposits.
In such cases,
excavation units of larger areal extent would probably be more
efficient. Finally, the shovel test technique is probably inefficient
as a methodology for discovering in situ features.
Obviously, the
size of test units employed ShouTdl>e relative to the size of the
expected features (i.e., the target population).
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Although the context of 41HI125 is highly disturbed due to
agricultural activities, several observations concerning the nature of
the prehistoric occupations and the value of the testing methodology
may be made. The low density of artifacts, together with the lack of
any features, suggest that the prehistoric use of the site was
infrequent and short in duration. The presence of fragmentary dart
points indicates that the Archaic Period was the primary period of
occupation. A Pedernales point, characteristic of the Middle Archaic,
was the only diagnostic specimen. A fragmentary arrow point of the
later Late Prehistoric Period was also recovered.
The density of artifacts 1s very low;
nevertheless,
the
composition of the tool assemblage is similar to that of other
assemblages within the Aqui I la drainage. Modified debitage comprises
the major portion (67.6~) of the tool assemblage. Bifacial forms
(16.2%), projectile points (13.5%) and hammerstones (2.7%) constitute
the remainder of the tool inventory. Finished bifaces are infrequent
and ground stone tools are not represented.
The modified debitage
also exhibits little variability. These informal tools indicate the
predominance of a single activity, possibly that of scraping.
The
I imited range of the tool assemblage and the lack of specialized tool
forms suggests that 41HI125 functioned as a short term hunting or
extraction camp.
The site was also utilized as a dump area for refuse from a much
later historic occupation. The predominance of glass and earthenware
fragments indicates that household activities were responsible for
most of the refuse. Where this structure was located in relation to
the site is unknown. The presence of amethyst glass, blue ground
Mason's Ironstone and cut nai Is suggests that historic use dates to
the latter portion of the nineteenth century.

34-22

41HI125
The use of two methods of test excavation provided an excel lent
opportunity for methodological comparison. The shovel test method was
certainly more expedient;
nevertheless, certain limitations are
inherent in the methodology.
Shovel tests are only viable for
delimiting archeological deposits to a depth of approximately 50
centimeters below the surface. Horizontal delimitation of the site
area is also very difficult for sites, such as 41HI125, where artifact
densities are very low.
A shovel test hole may yield no artifacts
while the excavation unit next to it yields a reasonable sample.
The
possibility of locating features through shovel test holes is also
extremely low.
Admittedly, the shovel test holes at 41HI125 predicted the
relative distribution of total artifact densities with some accuracy.
Nevertheless, this accuracy reflects the character of the ubiquitous
debitage elements, both unmodified and modified, rather than that of
the formal tool assemblage. The inadequacy of the shovel test method
to recover a representative tool assemblage in conjunction with the
relative inability to locate features renders the methodology somewhat
unreliable as the basis for evaluating the archeological significance
of a site.

CHAPTER 35
TERRACE SITES - SUMMARY

David 0. Brown

Although the age of formation of the landforms upon which the
previously discussed sites are located is probably within a limited
time range, i.e., Late Pleistocene through Early to Middle Holocene,
the individual landforms themselves are quite varied. Perhaps partly
due to this, these sites exhibit diverse characteristics and, like the
upland sites, appear at first to have very I ittle in common.
Of the three sites located on the higher terrace, two are near
the end of projecting ridges. The smaller of these, 41HI125, lies
near the end of a terrace ridge on the east bank of Aqui I la Creek. It
is bounded on three sides by modern floodplain sediments, although on
the westernmost end only a few meters of floodplain level sediments
separate the terrace end from the modern creek channel. At its
eastern end, the projection joins a larger segment of T2 terrace which
lies between the two creeks.
Cultural material extends downward
somewhat onto the slopes, reaching the base in places, but it is
unclear if this is due to post terrace formation cultural activities
or more recent erosion or plowing.
Also located along a projecting terrace ridge, 41HI74/114 is
different in many respects from 41HI125. The ridge projection, lying
at nearly the same elevation about 2 kilometers upstream and across
the creek to the west, is three to four times longer and farther from
the modern creek channel than the terrace remnant at 41HI125.
At
41HI74/114, the terrace remnant forms a narrow ridge across one side
of a large meander of Aqui I la Creek.
Cultural material is also
scattered down along the terrace slopes onto the floodplain, but, as
at 41HI125, it is unclear if this represents l!! situ cultural debris.
Examination of 41HI76 after it was disturbed by dam construction
has shown it to be much larger than originally estimated. The site
I ies on and around an isolated terrace remnant in a broad expanse of
floodplain on the west bank of Aqui I la Creek, about a kilometer

TERRACE SITE SUMMARY
downstream from 41HI125. The northernmost portion is apparently a
smal I remnant of T2 terrace, similar in composition to that found at
the Pi Igrim Site across the creek to the east.
South of this, the
elevation drops slightly and a large area of sandy fi I I, somewhat
similar to the upper fi I I at 41HI74/114 and 41HI125, occurs.
Sti II
farther south, this apparent middle terrace merges with the modern
floodplain, where cultural material has been observed eroding from the
wal Is of a construction borrow pit.
Two sites, the Sul Ii van Site (41HI17) and the Brazil Site
(41HI75), are located primarily on the lower terraces of Aquil la
Creek. The Brazi I Site is a large, multicomponent site that extends
from the crest of an upland projection with slopes partially covered
by def lated T2 terrace gravels, down onto an intermediate terrace
remnant that flanks the hi I I. This remnant appears to be partially
covered by col luvium from the hi I Iside. The site extends onto the
floodplain
where some cultural material is buried.
Formation
processes at this site are complex and its history is obscured by
col luvial and alluvial deposition as well as natural and accelerated
erosion.
The Sul Ii van Site is akin to the Brazil Site not only in the
large and unique private collection removed from it, but also in its
enormous size. It is also I ike the Brazi I Site 1n that it has an
extremely
complex geomorphic
history,
one that the present
investigations only partly succeeded in revealing. Unlike the Brazil
Site, it is not adjacent to an upland finger ridge or an expanse of
floodplain. Instead, it abuts a large area of higher terrace or
eroded upland that I ies between Aqui I la and Little Aqui I la creeks, and
is bounded by a relatively narrow strip of floodplain.
Previous
investigations (Lynott and Peter 1975) have shown it unlikely that
artifactual materials extend onto the modern floodplain.
Al I five of these sites are similar in that they have artifacts
exposed on the surface over some portion of their area. All also
contain relatively large areas where little or no artifactual material
is visible yet where a substantial amount lies buried. Two of the
sites, 41HI74/114 and 41HI76, have yielded features. This combination
of buried cultural material and features on relict landforms is
potentially significant, but excavations at these two sites failed to
reveal any other indication of undisturbed cultural stratigraphy.
Watson (this report), with almost no diagnostics from either site, was
forced to assume that the buried material represented Archaic deposits
(on the basis of what few diagnostics were recovered) and that the
surf icial materials represented Late Prehistori~ occupations at the
site (on the basis of reported Late Prehistoric diagnostics 1n
collections).
This is no more than an assumption, however, and the
general similarities in lithic characteristics, with the exception of

TERRACE SITE SUMMARY
significantly different between surface and
I ipping which
IS
subsurface at both sites, do
not strongly
support temporal
differences.
Unless the sites are heavily disturbed and completely mixed, a
condition not supported by the presence of the features, some general
stratigraphic separation of components is probably present.
Without
diagnostics,
however,
it
is very difficult to ascertain the
approximate limits of such stratigraphy.
It may be that temporal
components at both sites are separated horizontally rather than
vertically. In the case of 41HI74/114, where the channel of the creek
has apparently been migrating eastward and southward in the large
meander loop, it is possible that the focus of occupations has changed
relative to the location of the creek. Note that at 41HI74/114 the
purportedly later surface materials are mostly collected from the
northern end of the site, away from the test units.
In the case of all three of the higher terrace sites (41HI74/114,
41HI76 and 41HI125), the evidence is unclear as to whether they were
occupied during or after the formation of the terrace.
The presence
of buried features at 41HI74/114 and 41HI76 provides the only good
support for occupation during, but in both cases the features are
located where slopewash sediments could have covered them. Buried
artifacts at both sites could have been transported downward through
bioturbation.
At the Sullivan Site buried artifacts were recovered
from below a meter in depth on a higher terrace remnant 1n the
northeastern portion of the site (test pits 2 and 3). Evidence for
extreme bioturbation was observed in these two units, however, and the
overal I density of material was low. On the whole, it seems more
I ikely that the occupation of these higher terraces occurred while the
lowermost terrace and floodplain were forming and the higher terraces
themselves were being eroded away by f luvial action.
Burial of
materials at these sites represents eolian and col luvial deposition
and possibly bioturbation. Al I three processes may have combined to
form the site in many cases. Although some general stratigraphy may
be preserved in some areas of some of these sites, the loose sandy
nature of the soi Is suggests that it wi I I be I imited.
Despite the similarities, these sites are perhaps more notable
for
their
differences.
Each
occupies
a
relatively unique
physiographic position in the drainage basin. Located on landforms of
differing configurations and along portions of the creeks with
variable hydrologic properties, protection from spring flooding is the
only apparent topographic advantage offered in common by all sites.
Each of these sites does, however, provide a smal I island of
biotic diversity in or adjacent to areas probably dominated by
floodplain vegetation assemblages.
The sandy soi Is of al I these
35-3

TERRACE SITE SUMMARY
terrace sites may wel I have supported smal I isolated stands of oak
woodland in the midst of the grassland, cedar/elm woodland and
riparian woodland of the floodplain areas. Al I of the sites reported
in this section were located at some distance - perhaps 200 meters or
more
from upland and high terrace areas where oak forests may have
predominated.
An analysis of site size and density based on the original survey
data might suggest the importance of site location on topographic
highs near permanent water sources. While the preferred utilization
of such areas 1s relatively clear, the recent discovery of large
buried sites in the floodplain complicates this picture somewhat,
underscoring the use of the floodplain as wel I. An analysis of
potential functional differences between these sites is necessary. It
is suggested here that a comparison of the floodplain and pure upland
sites, both groups having some geomorphic homogeneity, would yield
some clear differences, while examination of the terrace sites would
not show them falling in a clear intermediate category, but a more
complex grouping as befits their variable geomorphic settings. This
suggestion wi I I be explored in more detail in the concluding chapters.
The diversity of terrace sites is reflected by their diversity of
recorded lithic technological attributes. Percentage of debitage, for
example, ranges from second highest among the excavated sites at
41HI76 to second lowest at 41HI117.
The ratio of bifaces to
projectile points ranges from the lowest at 41HI74 to the highest of
al I excavated sites at 41HI117. To some degree, these factors may be
The
influenced by sampling error or post-depositional disturbances.
Brazi I Site (41HI75) and the Sullivan Site (4HI117), for instance,
have among the lowest percentages of projectile points recovered from
excavation, yet in both cases, large private collections of projectile
points have previously been extracted from the site.
If the terrace sites do not clearly stand out as a group, there
are some intragroup associations that reoccur. The most noticeable of
these is the similarity in artifact category percentages between the
Brazi I and Sul Ii van
sites.
These sites, which are similar
geomorphical ly in their location on the lower of the two intermediate
terraces and similar culturally in the relative abundance of Early and
Middle Archaic indicators (as noted in private collections as wel I as
the excavated materials), have lithic technological indices which fal I
together more often than not. Of al I the terrace sites, these two
have the lowest percentages of total debitage. Both also have the
highest bi face to projectile point ratio.
The major difference
between the two sites is in the percentage of bifaces recovered.
Bifaces comprise 1.9% of al I lithics recovered from the Sul Ii van site,
highest among the terrace sites and third highest among al I the lake
area sites. At the Brazi I Site, the recorded 0.7% bifaces is only a
35-4

TERRACE SITE Sl.MMARY
few tenths of a percent more than the lowest among al I excavated
Aqui I la Lake sites. The other maJor difference between these two
sites is in the percentages of ground stone present. At 0.81, the
Sul Ii van Site is among the highest in the lake area, while the Brazil
Site at 0.11 is among the lowest. With respect to the latter figure,
it should be remembered that a large number of Waco Sinkers have been
removed in the past by collectors.
The higher intermediate terrace sites do not hang together so
wel I.
41HI76 and 41HI125 are generally similar in many respects, but
41HI74 is somewhat more variable.
The former two sites
have
respectively the highest and second highest percentage of debitage and
the highest and second highest ratio of debitage to cores of any
excavated terrace site. The major difference between these two sites
appears to be the percentage of flakes versus chips. 41HI76 has one
of the lowest flake to chip ratios of excavated Aquil la Lake sites at
0.7:1, while this ratio is 1.2:1 at 41HI124. Although 41HI74 is more
like these two sites than the two lower terrace sites for most
artifact categories, it is sti I I quite different.
While the differences between these two groups are generally
apparent, it is difficult to determine whether such differences should
be attributed to functional variation
between
the sites or
culture-chronological variability.
There is I ittle question that
either could be responsible for differences in lithic technology. But
most, if not al I, of these sites are large complex sites with apparent
long occupation histories and, perhaps, multifunctional utilization.
The two lower terrace representatives, the Brazi I and Sullivan
sites, show the clearest evidence of multicomponent occupations. The
projectile point assemblage from both sites indicates long occupation
spans during the Archaic, but surprisingly little evidence of Late
Prehistoric occupations. None of the other three sites has a large
complement of projectile points, and it would probably be hasty to
assign them to a particular period. At 41HI74/114, where the largest
collection is found, there seems to be a dominance of stemmed Late
Archaic types. At none of these higher terrace sites, however, 1s
there incontrovertible evidence for multicomponent occupations. Only
the size and depth of archeological deposits at these sites 1s any
indicator of long term use.
Certainly
Evidence for multifunctional use 1s much less clear.
each of the sites was an extensive lithic workshop area, as wel I as
being used for a variety of simple campsite work activities, as shown
by the uses inferred from the modified debitage. What cannot be
ascertained from the data at hand is whether any of these varied
activities were performed simultaneously within the same camp or
whether they relate to different occupations.
35-5

TERRACE SITE SUMMARY
With the possible exception of the Sullivan Site, al I of these
sites, and a few other terrace remnants in the lake area, share one
important characteristic, related to the earlier discussion of them as
islands of biotic diversity within the floodplain. In addition to
their resource potential, they are each unique and prominent landforms
that are in some way isolated from the larger mass of uplands or
higher terraces and sti II high above the floodplain.
In times of
flooding, they would provide excel lent protection from rising waters,
and at al I times would provide defensible campsites.
Perhaps even
more important, they are easily recognizable features, possibly even
used as landmarks for relocating favorite hunting or camping spots.
And finally, in most cases, the I imitations of the landform itself may
have constrained campsite location in such a way as to agglomerate the
remains from many smal I campsites into a single, large mixed site.
These latter two factors complicate settlement pattern research.
In the first case, the physical uniqueness of a particular location
and its associated recognizability may have been more important than
the actual biotic or geomorphic environment. Such an explanation is
difficult to approach through current archeological methodology.
In
the latter case, physical constraints on site location, rather than
the presence of some desirable resource, may have lead to intensive
use with a resulting archeological site that resembles a single large
base camp or the site of a number of more intense occupations.
While
the explanation of reutilization of sites such as the McDonald Site,
located in an almost featureless floodplain area, may hinge on
resource exploitation
areas
and campsite reuse by subsequent
generations of related groups, the distinctiveness of many terrace
sites, isolated as finger ridges or remnant islands, may have
artificially inflated their particular attributes for optimum campsite
location.

CHAPTER 36
FLOODPLAIN SITES - INTRODUCTION

David 0. Brown

The fol lowing section detai Is excavations at three sites buried
within the modern floodplains of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks.
Generally, a floodplain is taken to mean the frequently flooded (that
is, annually or several times annually) bottom land which is actively
or has just recently been actively aggrading.
More specifically,
Bates and Jackson (1980:235) define a floodplain as:
The surface or strip of relatively smooth land adjacent to a
river channel, constructed by the present river in its
existing regimen and covered with water when the river
overflows its banks. It is bui It of alluvium carried by the
river during floods and deposited in the sluggish water
beyond the influence of the swiftest current.
This definition is generally fol lowed in the classification of sites
for the Aqui I la Lake Archeological Project.
However, as Patton
(Chapter 3, this report) notes, the Tl terrace merges into the
floodplain in places and may be difficult to distinguish. Despite
this, al I of the sites discussed in this section are relatively
securely assigned to the actual floodplain.
Because the rapid accretion of alluvial sediments on floodplains
fosters the preservation and stratigraphic separation of archeological
sites, floodplains are of considerable importance 1n archeological
research.
Sites located on or within floodplains, though often
difficult to dig and occasionally subject to disturbance by flood
waters, are an important resource since rapid burial often al lows the
chronological separation of occupations at a site. Some of the unique
difficulties presented by floodplain sites include the enormous amount
of matrix which must be removed and, occasionally, the compaction of
the fine grained backwater deposits which hinder excavation. And

FLOODPLAIN SITES
since many floodplains grow both laterally and vertically at the
time, stratigraphic ordering of buried materials may be complex.

same

Active floodplain comprises a significant proportion of the
Aqui Ila Lake project area.
Although relatively narrow in a few
places, segments of floodplain are continuous along both creeks from
the dam area to the upper end of the Corps of Engineers property line.
In some places, the active floodplain is several hundred meters wide.
Throughout the lake area, the creeks have generally meandered to one
side or the other of their floodplain. Only in a very few places can
floodplain be traced along opposite banks of the creek.
The three archeological sites in this setting, which include the
Reps Davis Site (41HI58), the McDonald Site (41HI105) and the McKenzie
Site (41HI115), are among the most important sites excavated at
Aqui I la Lake. Al I three exhibit minimal evidence of disturbance from
flowing water and al I were buried deeply enough to have avoided
disturbance from historic agricultural activities. These three sites
have yielded most of the fauna I remains and al I of the radiocarbon
dates
recovered
in
the project area.
Al I three sites, but
particularly the McDonald Site, were a central focus of the Aqui I la
Lake mitigation plan.
The Reps Davis Site 1s on the floodplain adjacent to the modern
creek approximately a half kilometer south of the dam. Artifactual
materials are buried at a depth of 30 to 40 centimeters beneath the
surface, extending downward to about 65 centimeters. This site,
initially tested by SMU in 1977 and later excavated in 1978, may have
been the smallest of the three floodplain sites and has probably been
the most thoroughly excavated. Excavations here uncovered a midden
feature
of
charcoal and burned earth that has yielded three
radiocarbon dates. Although it is not clear how much, if any, of this
site remains, it was at one time a very important cultural resource.
The McDonald Site (41HI105), excavated in al I three seasons of
work described ·in this report, may be the most important site
investigated during the Aqui I la Lake Archeological Project.
Located
on the east bank of Hackberry Creek some two kilometers above the dam,
the site was bisected by a sma 11 Iatera I drainage that may have been
an old channel of the creek. The two segments of the site on either
side of the drainage were investigated separately and may wel I
represent completely separate occupations, both dating to the Late
Prehistoric.
In addition to Late Prehsitoric
components,
the
westernmost area (Area 8) contained a buried Archaic component
reaching a depth of nearly four meters beneath the surface of the
floodplain.

36-2

FLOODPLAIN SITES
The McKenzie Site (41HI115), is unique in many
respects.
Discovered 1n 1975 by SMU, it was tested at that time and found to
contain a discrete and perhaps very little disturbed
cultural
occupation layer buried nearly three meters under the surface of the
floodplain. The key feature of this site is a series of overlapping
mussel she I I lenses. The site is regarded as an excel lent example of
a pure single activity site since I ittle artifactual evidence exists
for occurrence of other activities. The site contains no diagnostic
stone artifacts or ceramics, no charcoal, no more than a handful of
flakes and only a few tiny bone fragments. Uni ike most of the other
project sites, a very large portion of this smal I site was excavated
during the 1982 season.
As of this writing, only the McKenzie Site is actually listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, but al I three of these
floodplain sites are certainly individually eligible.
Substantial
portions of both the Reps Davis and McKenzie sites have been removed,
however, and portions of the former have been damaged by construction
of the outlet channel for the Aqui I la Lake dam. Only the McDonald
Site,
now
inundated,
remains
substantially
undisturbed.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the impact that inundation
wi I I have on what is probably that site's most valuable asset, its
well preserved faunal materials.

CHAPTER 37
THE REPS DAVIS SITE - 41Hl58

Duane E. Peter and David 0. Brown
SITE DESCRIPTION
The Reps Davis Site, 41HI58, is in the Eastern Cross Timbers
biotic zone below the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks. The
site is situated in the floodplain at the confluence
of
an
intermittent tributary stream and Aqui I la Creek at an elevation of 152
meters MSL. The eastern boundary is a meander scar that dissects the
floodplain and has exposed and scattered artifacts along the slough to
the southeast of the site (Fig. 37.1).
The original
vegetation
probably
consisted
of
elements
characteristic of a red ash/cedar elm/hackberry community. This
vegetation has been cleared from the floodplain with
remnants
remaining along the drainages bordering the site. The site itself has
been cultivated for several years.
The site area of approximately 150 square meters occurs 1n a
level portion of the floodplain.
No artifacts are present on the
surface, for the cultural horizon is buried within the alluvial
sediments.
The surface scatter of artifacts collected over the years
southeast of this site is a secondary deposit derived from the buried
cultural deposits.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
The Reps Davis Site was first recorded by C.K. Chandler in 1969.
It was initially described as a larger site, one area of which was a
smal I trash midden containing mussel shel Is. The 1972 investigations
at the site (recorded by SMU as x41HI40) reported an undisturbed camp
midden containing burned sandstone, mussel shel I, stone tools and
I ithic debris (Skinner and Henderson 1972:18). Due to its location

within a proposed borrow pit for the Aqui I la Lake dam, the site was
recommended for further testing in 1975 (Lynott and Peter 1977:139).
The rema1n1ng portions of the original site were recorded as x41HI41
and x41HI42. These sites were not considered in the testing program.
of
The 1977 testing revealed intact deposits 1n an area
approximately 200 square meters.
Although the majority of the
artifacts were recovered from the interface of two pedogenic strata
approximately 40 centimeters below the surface, some were found as
deep as 65 centimeters below the surface.
The I imited number of
actual artifacts from this deeper zone, however, suggested that
extensive bioturbative agencies had moved them to a secondary context.
During the 1977 season of investigations, a number of shovel
tests and several 1 by 1 meter test pits were uti I ized to delineate
the boundaries of the site. These units, unfortunately not numbered,
are shown on the site map included in Skinner et al. (1978:85). The
1977 excavation notes have been lost and I ittle is known about these
units.
It is thought, however, that with the exception of units 9A
through 9E, they yielded little, if any, cultural material. Units 9A
through 9E are included with the 1978 cultural material reported here.
DATA COLLECTION
Since the Reps Davis Site was
imminently
threatened
by
construction of the dam and outlet channel, further excavation was
conducted in 1978 to recover a representative sample of the buried
I iving surface. To expedite the removal of the sterile overburden, a
crawler tractor with a dozer blade was used to expose the top of the
cultural
horizon.
Once the sterile overburden was removed, a
north-south base I ine was established along the eastern edge of Unit
9E.
Initially,
single 1 by 1 meter square test units were
systematically placed at five meter intervals to delineate the site
area.
Additional excavation was concentrated in areas of high
artifact density. Units were excavated in arbitrary 5 centimeter
levels to sterile strata.
Al I f i I I was screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth. Because of the undulating stratigraphy, the depth of
the several units varied from 20 to 65 centimeters. Two views of the
excavation are shown in Figure 37.2.

SITE STRATIGRAPHY
The soi I profile of the Reps Davis Site has been described in
some

REPS DAVIS SITE
Several additional comments by Pheasant are instructive.
He
notes that the soi I profile reflects primarily the sedimentary
processes forming it, noting that "variations in soi I texture are not
the result of pedogenic processes" (Pheasant 1978:234). He further
suggests that the soi I profile is young, perhaps less than 1,000 years
old, on the basis of the preservation of depositional structures. In
addition, he notes that the texture and composition of the parent
material changes abruptly at 60 centimeters (above the !!Cl horizon).
A last comment concerns the presence of calcareous nodules which he
interprets as the result of groundwater fluctuation at the site rather
than intensive leaching.
Cultural material was recovered from the Cl, C2 and IICl
horizons, although the majority of the materials were from the C2.
The bul I dozer stripping during the 1978 season removed the Al, Al2 and
upper portion of the Cl horizons. Some of the cultural materials in
this upper zone may have been disturbed or damaged by this operation.
Radiocarbon samples collected in 1977 from scattered charcoal in the
matrix of Unit 9E yielded uncorrected dates ranging between AD 1100
and 1350.
These dates, shown 1n Table 37.1, suggest a slowly
aggrading alluvial surface.

Various interpretations of the stratigraphy have been formulated
through the years, leading to diverse interpretations of the integrity
of the cultural deposits, ranging from wholly
undisturbed
to
completely destroyed. An important aspect of these interpretations is
the undulating nature of the stratigraphy.
During
the
1977
excavations, the majority of the materials were recovered from the
interface of the Cl and C2 horizons. A single flake core recovered
from the upper portion of the IICl horizon was considered to represent
either minimal uti I ization of the site at the time of formation of
that stratum or a derived context.
The latter explanation was
considered the most plausible at that time, given "· . . the extensive
bioturbative agencies to which deposits of this nature are constantly
being subjected" (Skinner et al. 1978:89).
37-6

REPS DAVIS SITE
Their interpretation of the remainder of the site as being
essentially undisturbed was dramatically altered after the 1978
excavations. The fol lowing description of the major stratigraphic
alterations
at the site reveals the possible extent of these
disturbances.
An evaluation of the site as a whole reveals that the
cultural deposit deepens substantially to the south while it
pinches out and slopes down the old creek bank to the west
and virtually disappears toward the slough on the east.
Apparently, a major f luvial disturbance truncated the site,
removing portions of the cultural deposit, and scattering
artifacts along the slough.
Subsequent overbank flooding
left a layer of si It over the habitation area and reinforced
the banks of Aquil la Creek, somewhat altering the original
boundaries of the drainage area. A major portion of the
original site deposit has been washed down the slough and an
old meander channel to the southeast of the excavation area;
thus the prehistoric occupation of the site has been
virtually destroyed (Skinner et al. 1978:35).
Later in that same report, the destruction of the integrity of
the cultural materials at the site is emphasized. They state that:
" . . . the site
was
discovered
to
have
been
significantly
disturbed
by

and
an
undulating stratigraphy made it impossible to establish
vertical integrity and significantly altered previously held
concepts of the site's occupational integrity. (Skinner et
al. 1978:35).
The overal I stratigraphy at the Reps Davis Site 1s complex
(Fig. 37.3).
Clearly, sharply dipping strata represent channel
alterations. In fact, the site is surrounded on al I four sides by
abandoned channels of Aqui I la Creek. What is not clear from measured
profiles is the sequence of abandonment and f i I I of these channels and
how they relate to the occupation of the site. It seems an uni ikely
possibi I ity that al I four channels postdate the occupation of the
site, and the actual stratigraphic evidence for truncation by a recent
channel is not clearly documented in the notes. In fact, the sloping
strata could as easily be an indication of point bar development prior
to or during the prehistoric occupation.
Given the
difficult
stratigraphy, it is unfortunate that some deep backhoe trenches were
not uti I ized to assess the development of the landform.

37-7

REPS DAVIS SITE
One interesting point to be made concerning the stratigraphy 1s
the general similarity of the soi I profile described above (and in
Pheasant 1978) to the profile recorded at the McDonald Site, a few
kilometers
upstream
(see Chapter 38).
At the McDonald Site,
alternating layers of brown and yellowish-brown sand, loamy fine sand
and fine sandy loam overlie a dark gray clay with medium subangular
blocky structure found at a depth of about 60 centimeters. Underlying
this stratum, the uppermost stratum to contain prehistoric cultural
material, are a series of alternating dark brown and dark grayish
brown clays. Note that the break between the upper zones and the dark
gray clay is very clearly a depositional one rather than pedogenic.
At the Reps Davis Site, alternating brown and pale brown loamy
sand and sandy loam horizons over I ie a dark gray clay with a medium
angular blocky structure at a depth of 60 centimeters.
Beneath this
are alternating layers of gray and dark gray clay. Again, the
boundary above the upper dark gray
clay
is
interpreted
as
depositional. The most important difference is in the location of the
cultural materials with relation to this depositional boundary.
At
the McDonald Site, the highest in situ prehistoric cultural materials
were found lying on the surface of the very dark gray clay horizon
(Zone 4a) immediately underlying the uppermost dark gray clay (Zone
3), with the upper portions of these materials buried in the upper
dark gray clay matrix (from Zone 3). Prehistoric cultural materials
continued downward for almost three meters below this point.
At the
Reps Davis Site, the majority of the cultural materials were recovered
above or in the very topmost portion of the dark gray clay stratum,
with those few specimens found lower interpreted as in a disturbed
context.
Although it is often problematical to attempt correlations
between floodplain profiles in proximity, the sedimentary similarities
are as striking as are the differences in cultural stratigraphy.
If
the upper sandy and loamy lenses are indeed historic as Watson (1982)
has suggested, this would clearly support disturbance and subsequent
redeposition of the artifactual materials at the Reps Davis Site.
Unfortunately, the evidence for the age of the overlying materials at
the McDonald Site 1s I ittle more than circumstantial. Historic
cultural material was recovered from only the top 20 centimeters.
At

MATERIAL CULTURE
Features
A single feature was described from the two
seasons
of
excavations at the Reps Davis Site. This feature, encountered in Unit
9 during the 1977 investigations, is described
as
"· . . . an
accumulation of firecracked rock, burned bone, and charred mussel
shel Is distributed within a matrix of oxidized soi I. . .
" (Skinner
et al. 1978:86). It was reportedly first encountered at the interface
of the C2 and IICl horizons in Unit A.
This unit was subsequently
expanded to the north and east, adding four more 1 by 1 meter units
(B-E). Additional firecracked rock, burned bone, mussel and snai I
shel Is, chipping debris and charcoal was scattered throughout these
units, ranging from the Cl down to the top of the IICl horizons.
According to notes on file at the SMU radiocarbon laboratory, the
charcoal samples presented above were taken from scattered charcoal 1n
the f i I I of Unit 9E, rather than specifically from a feature.
It is unclear whether the whole agglomeration of materials was
meant to be taken as a single hearth, or if specific areas were
designated separately. No drawings or photographs of this feature

A Gary projectile point was recovered from level 5 of Unit 9A,
associated with the complex feature found in that unit. A second
projectile point, a long stemmed specimen that bears some resemblance
to the Dawson type, was recovered from level 6 of the nearby Unit 19
(see Fig. 37.1). An apparent oxidized clay area, not designated as a
feature, was found adjacent to this projectile point. In addition, a
smal I cluster of rocks was described in the excavation notes as
appearing in the bottom of Unit 36, but this unit was closed out and
no further mention is made of this cluster.
Lithic Artifacts
The total I ithic assemblage recovered from the 1977 and 1978
investigations consists of 388 specimens.
Flaked stone debitage
comprises 90.5% (n=351), and modified debitage (n=24) is 6.2% of the
entire I ithic assemblage. The remaining 3.3% consists of bifaces (7),
projectile points (3), hammerstones (2) and a grinding slab.
Since artifactual material was concentrated in the first 25
centimeters of the culture-bearing horizon (C2), and appeared only
infrequently (one specimen per level) below this, the assemblage wi I I
be discussed as a single unit. Although a fine radiocarbon sequence
exists for the I imited sample of artifacts from Unit 9, the levels of
the rema1n1ng units cannot be directly correlated with the levels of
Unit 9. Only a general correlation based on the presence of the
levels within the C2 soi I horizon can be demonstrated.
To facilitate the presentation and discussion of the flaked stone
assemblage, the three blocks of contiguous excavation units wi I I each
be referred to as a single unit. The central block (units 9A, 9B, 9C,
9D, 9E, 19, and 24) wi I I be referred to as Block A. To the south,
units 14, 18, 22 and 23 wi I I constitute Block B. Block C wi I I be the
northernmost (units 11, 21, and 25). The remaining units wi I I be
referred
to
by
their
original
designations
(Fig. 37.1).
Unfortunately, 26 specimens from Unit 28 were not available for
reanalysis with the remainder of Block B.
The units that are not
discussed (12, 13 1 and 17) were devoid of artifactual material.

constitute this class of artifacts.
FLAKES (221 specimens)
Primary Flakes (16 specimens)
Of the smal I sample of 221 f lakes 1 a surprisingly
large
proportion (7.2%) are primary flakes. Almost half of these specimens
(7) were recovered from the center of the site in Unit 1.
The
remainder came from either the surface of the cultural horizon or
units 2 and 16 (Table 37.2). Al I of these flakes are of chert except
for one specimen of chalcedony from Unit 16 (Table V.87).
Platform preparation (Table V.88) of these flakes is either none
(37.5%) or single faceting (62.5%).
Only one specimen exhibits a
ventral platform I ip. Although many of these flakes were recovered
from the hearth area in Block A, none exhibit any evidence of having
been burned.
Secondary Flakes (130 specimens)
Secondary flakes comprise 58.8% of the flake assemblage from the
Reps Davis Site.
Three raw material types are represented (Table
V.89). Chert (98.5%) is characteristically the dominant source of
material with chalcedony and quartzite represented by single specimens
only. The largest portion of these flakes were recovered from the
surface of the cultural horizon (Table V.89). Of the excavation
blocks, the southern (Block B) contains the most secondary flakes.
The remainder of this sample was found primarily in Block A.
Platform preparation of the secondary flakes involved four
platform types (Table V.90). Single facet (50%) and cortex platforms
(37.7%) are most common. Multiple facet (6.9%) and crushed platforms
(5.4%) are only minimally represented. Ten percent of the secondary
flakes also exhibit a ventral platform I ip.
Evidence of thermal
alteration is present on only four specimens.

37-11

REPS DAVIS SITE
Tertiary Flakes (75 specimens)
Only 33.9% of the flakes are tertiary flakes. Block B (41.3%),
the surface of the cultural horizon (22.7%), and Block A (20%) account
for the majority of these specimens (Table 37.2). The remainder (16~)
are evenly distributed throughout the site. Uni ike the secondary and
primary flakes, the tertiary flakes are al I of chert.
Although single facet platforms (57.3%) are characteristically
most
common,
multiple
facet
platforms are particularly wel I
represented (26.7%). Crushed platforms (14.7%) and ground platforms
(1.3%) appear on the remainder of the sample (Table V.91). As
expected, ventral platform I ipping (18.7%) 1s more common on the
tertiary flakes. More of these flakes also exhibit evidence of having
been burned.
Flakes:

Discussion

The flake assemblage is unevenly distributed within the site area
(Table 37.2).
The production and/or discard of flake debitage was
most common within the southern portion (Block B).
The area around
the feature in Unit 9E also yielded a considerable portion (19.5%) of
the flake assemblage. Other than the exposed surface of the cultural
horizon, no other unit yielded more than seven flakes. Lithic
reduction activities were apparently conducted in relatively I imited
areas.
The extremely large proportion of primary and secondary flakes
(66%) suggests that initial cobble reduction was a primary activity at
the Reps Davis Site.
The large number of cores recovered also
reflects such activities.
Although the later stages of bifacial
reduction are represented by tertiary flakes with multiple facet
platforms, most of the reduced cobbles were most likely discarded or
carried off the site as blanks or preforms.
CHIPS (115 specimens)
Chips comprise a surprisingly low proportion (29.6%) of the
entire I ithic assemblage recovered from this site. Like the flake
assemblage, chips are primarily chert (94.8%).
Four specimens of
quartzite and two of chalcedony were also recovered (Table 37.3). The
distribution of the chips para I lels that of the larger
flake
assemblage (Table 37.2). Blocks A and 8 account for over 65% of the
chip assemblage.

Core fragments (26.6%),

As expected in the Aqui I la drainage, chert (73.3%) is the
primary raw material.
Two specimens of quartzite and one
of
si I icif ied wood are also present. Al I but one was recovered from the
surface of the buried cultural horizon. The unidirectional specimen
was recovered from level 6 of Unit 22.
Multidirectional Cores (9 specimens)
Platform
These cores are of chert (77.8%) or quartzite (22.2%).
preparation consists of none (67%) or single facets (33%). Battering
is present on only one specimen. Except for one particularly smal I
specimen, the size is consistently large (Table V.92). These cores
were apparently not exhausted.

REPS DAVIS SITE
Unidirectional Cores (1 specimen)
This single core of si I icif ied wood exhibits neither battering
nor an observable platform type.
The core is of average size,
measuring 42 mi I I imeters in length, 47 mil I imeters 1n width, and 31
mi I I imeters in thickness. It weighs 106.3 grams.
Bifacial Cores (1 specimen)
This single quartzite core does not exhibit an observable
platform type, but battering is present. The core measures 66 by 66

Core Fragments (4 specimens)
These chert core fragments do not exhibit identifiable modes of
platform preparation, nor evidence of battering. They are expectedly
small (Table V.93), and are likely exhausted cores that
were
discarded.
Cores:

Discussion

As with the other Aqui I la assemblages 1 multidirectional cores are
the predominant core type.
Platform preparation, when observable,
consists of none (67%) or single facets (33%). The large amount of
cortex rema1n1ng on several specimens, together with their large size
suggest that some cores were discarded prior to being exhausted.
The
avai labi I ity
of
additional
cobbles
apparently made the ful I
uti I ization of raw materials unnecessary.
The number of discarded cores at this site 1s very high 1n
relation to the total amount of flake and chip debitage. The ratio of
flake and chip debitage to cores is only 22.4. Apparently, the lithic
reduction activities were very limited and several cobbles were
rejected as unsuitable for the f I int knapper's purposes.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
Twenty-four pieces of debitage from the Reps Davis Site exhibit
retouch or use-wear. This modif ication 1 consisting of both Type 1 and
Type 2 attrition, is equally common on secondary flakes (41.7%) and
chips (41.7%). Tertiary flakes served as the blanks for the remaining
four specimens (Table 37.4).
The occurrence of both types of
attrition on a single blank is more common (58.3%) within this sample
of modified tools. One-third exhibit only Type 1 attrition.
Type 2
attrition alone appears on only two specimens. Unfortunately, most of
these modified pieces (50%) were recovered from the disturbed surface
of the buried cultural horizon. Four modified tools were recovered

TYPE 1 ATTRITION (8 specimens, 11 facets)
Only three of these specimens exhibit more than a single facet.
Secondary flakes (62.5%) were the principal source of blanks for these
informal tools (Table 37.4). A single tertiary flake and two chips
served as blanks for the remainder of this sample. Al I are of chert.
The modification of these specimens is unifacial except for one
that also exhibits a bi facially worked facet. The position of this
modification is characteristically on the dorsal surface (50%) of the
blank.
The ventral surface (37.5%) is also commonly modified. The
bifacial ly modified piece obviously exhibits attrition on
both
surfaces.
The location of this use-wear is most commonly that of the
lateral edge of the blank (40%).
The distal edge {12.5%) or a
combination of the lateral and distal edges {12.5%) accounts for the
remainder of the recognizable locations.
Four edge outlines are represented within this sample of informal
tools.
Straight (37.%) and irregular outlines {25%), which I ikely
served a variety of cutting and scraping purposes, dominate the Type 1
specimens.
Concave (25%) and convex (12.5%) edge out I ines appear on
the remaining three specimens.
These facet edge outlines I ikely
served as scraping tools.
TYPE 2 ATTRITION (2 specimens, 3 facets)
A tertiary flake and a chip served as the blanks for these tools.
Both are of chert.
The modification of one specimen is unifacial,
while the other is bifacial. The unifacial modification appears on
the distal edge of the specimen. A straight facet edge outline is
present on the dorsal surface. The bifacial specimen also exhibits a
straight edge outline. Separate facets, however, are present on both
the lateral and distal edges of the blank.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (14 specimens, 21 facets)
Seven of the specimens exhibiting both types 1 and 2 attrition
exhibit multiple facets. Al I of these have two facets. Chips {50%)
were the primary source of blanks for these tools.
Secondary flakes
(37.7%) and tertiary flakes (14.3%) constitute the remainder of the
sample. Al I are of chert.

specimen. The position of this modification is divided almost equally

on the dorsal surfaces of four blanks, the ventral surfaces of three
specimens and on both surfaces of one blank. Since so many of the
blanks are chips, the location of the modification is indeterminate
(42.9%) for most specimens. Where the location is recognizable, a
combination of the lateral and distal edges (28.6%) or the lateral
edge alone (21.4%) are the preferred positions. Only one specimen is
modified along its distal edge only.
A great deal of variabi I ity is exhibited by the edge outlines of
the types 1 and 2 facets. Straight, irregular, concave and notch
out I ines are equally represented on three blanks, respectively.
Single specimens exhibit a convex facet and a combination of straight
edge out I ine and a notch. The predominance of notches and concave and
convex edge outlines suggests that scraping activities were common at
the Reps Davis Site.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS:

DISCUSSION

The modified debitage comprises 6.2% of the entire I ithic
assemblage from the Reps Davis Site. Little can be interpreted from
the distribution of these informal tools, for most were recovered from
the disturbed surface of the buried cultural horizon (Table 37.5).
Since this surface was disturbed by large mechanical equipment, some
of this modification could have been produced recently. Nevertheless,
fresh scar patterns should have been evident, if this had been the
case. No such evidence was noted within this sample.
Secondary flakes and chips were the primary sources of blanks for
these informal tools.
The majority of these tools (66.6%) were
intentionally modified prior to their
utilization.
The
size
variabi I ity of the informal tool blanks according to attrition type is
very smal I.
The modification of the informal tools
is
overwhelmingly
unifacial in nature (Table V.94). The dorsal surface of the lateral
edge of the blank is the preferred position of this modification;
however, some variabi I ity of the position and location of the
modification is exhibited (Tables V.95 and V.96). Straight, irregular
and concave edge outlines are the predominant forms. Notches are also
present on an additional four specimens (Table V.97).
A variety of
cutting and scraping activities are represented by these facet edge
out Ii nes.

37-18

REPS DAVIS SITE
Formal Tools
The formal tool assemblage recovered from the Reps Davis Site
consists of three projectile points and seven bi face fragments.
Although the raw frequencies of these artifacts are low, they comprise
a relatively large proportion (2.6~) of the total lithic assemblage
when compared to other sites in the Aqui I la Lake area.
BIFACES (7 specimens)
Bi faces, other than projectile points, are not wel I represented
at the site. Seven biface fragments were recovered from the surface
and the test pits (Table 37.6). Of these seven specimens, six are
unclassified fragments.
Half of these represent discarded elements
from an early stage of bifacial reduction. The rema1n1ng three are
fragments of preforms or finished bi faces. Al I of these unclasif ied
fragments were recovered from either the surface or level 1 of units
20 and 22.

PROJECTILE POINTS (3 specimens)
The three projectile points from the SMU investigations were al I
recovered from the central portion of the site. Two dart points and
an arrow point are represented (Fig. 37.4).
Arrow Points (1 specimen)
Seal lorn (1 specimen)
The single arrow point is from the first level of Unit 27.
This
finely chipped Seal lorn point measures 3.3 centimeters in length and
1.4 centimeters in width, weighing 1.2 grams.
Although this Late
Prehistoric projectile point type fits wel I enough with the earliest
radiocarbon dates from the site, it is not possible to establish a
clear stratigraphic association between this specimen and the dated
material because of the undulating stratigraphy and difficulties in
interpreting the SMU excavation notes. It is probably associated with
the uppermost level of the dated zone, however.
Dart Points (2 specimens)
Two dart points were recovered from deeper levels within the
central excavation block. Both were recovered from near the interface
between the C2 and IICl horizons. Only one of these specimens can be
classified.
Gary (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 37.4b), missing its distal portion, was
recovered from level 5 of Unit 9A, in apparent association with the
firecracked rock feature recorded in that unit. It has a long narrow
blade, with moderate asymmetrical shoulders. The long stem contracts
to what was apparently a narrow rounded base; a smal I section of the
edge of that base has been broken. Although the contracting stem and
the average workmanship indentify this specimen as a Gary point, the
long narrow blade, the less than prominent shoulders and the long stem
are not typical Gary-I ike traits. There is a possibi I ity that the
specimen may have been a Wei Is point broken during manufacture and
never finely finished.

Miscellaneous Stemmed (1 specimen)
The remaining specimen (Fig. 37.4a) was recovered from level 6 of
Unit 19, adjacent to a smal I are of oxidized clay matrix. It has a
narrow blade with straight edges and unevenly spaced, moderate
asymmetrical shoulders.
The stem is long, narrow and squarish.
Workmanship is average. The stem edges are lightly ground. This dart
point measures 5.7 centimeters in length, 2.4 centimeters in width,
0.8 centimeters in thickness and weighs 7.7 grams.
It cannot be
confidently typed, but does bear some resemblance to Dawson specimens
from east of the project area.
Projectile Points:

Discussion

Of the three points recovered from the site, only the Seal lorn
arrow point fits wel I with the recorded radiocarbon dates. The Austin
phase Seal lorn recovered from the uppermost levels of the scraped Unit
27, might date between AD 1180 and 1420. These dates fall near the
end of the Austin phase (Prewitt 1981), but are not unacceptable.
Both of the dart points, on the other hand, seem out of place in the
Late Prehistoric context of the dates.

sediments lying below the depositional break at the C2/IIC1 interface
are much older alluvial f i I I. Either or both of the dart points may
have been recovered from this zone, but the field notes are not clear
on this. In any case, the presence of two dart points underlying a
single arrow point hints at the possibi I ity that the site may have
been reoccupied several times over a long span of time.

The larger and nearly whole specimen
possesses two battered facets. Its dimensions are 98 mi I limeters in

The
weights
of
these two hammerstones are 34.3 and 390.5 grams,
respectively.
Faunal Remains
Molluscan and vertebrate fauna I remains were collected from both
seasons of excavations.
A I isting of the molluscan fauna from the
1978 excavations is found in Ful I ington (1978). No analysis of either
the 1978 mol lusca or the vertebrate fauna was conducted. Ful I ington
I ists 426 individual valves of Unionid clams, as wel I as 31 f ingernai I
clams (Sphaerium transversum).
The Unionidae species identified at
the site include Amblema pl icata, Quadrula quadrula,
Uniomerus
tetralasmus, Lampsi I is teres and Potami lus purpurata. ~ pl icata is
the most common pelecypod represented, while U.
tetralasmus and P.
purpurata are represented only by a few recen-:r-individuals. Gastropod
species recovered include Rabdotus dealbatus dealbatus, Helicina
orbiculata tropica, Mesodon roemeri, Mesodon thyroides, Polygyra
texasiana texasiana, Polygyra mooreana, Physa virgata, Practicalel la
berlanderiana, Hel isama anceps and Zonitaides arboreus.
Ful I ington notes that a number of the mussel valves have been
fire
blackened, and that other valves show evidence of human
consumption or usage. Some of the bone has been burned, including
specimens from the feature in Unit 9 (Skinner et al. 1978:86).
Although no formal species identification was conducted, a quick scan
of the material indicates that it is primarily deer and large mammal
bone.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Excavations at the Reps Davis Site have provided some interesting
data on the prehistoric occupations at Aqui I la Lake. Many questions
regarding the site remain unanswered, however. Some of these wi I I be
addressed below, while others wi I I be held unti I further sections of
this report. Some of the questions wi I I never be answered because of
deficiencies in the excavation notes. And despite the fact that most,
if not al 1, of the site has been destroyed by excavation and
subsequent Corps of Engineers activities, some parts of the landform
remain intact and some of the stratigraphic problems might be resolved
by a series of deep backhoe trenches.

37-23

REPS DAVIS SITE
Primary occupation of the site occurred during
the
Late
Prehistoric Period, as evidenced by the recovery of a Seal lorn
projectile point and three radiocarbon dates that span the Late
Prehistoric.
It is not clear how many occupations are represented by
the materials, but the limited sample recovered (388 lithic artifacts)
suggests a relatively smal I number. The thickness of the deposit, on
the other hand, supports more than a single occupation of the site.
The presence of two dart points underlying or lying at the lowest
level of the radiocarbon dated Late Prehistoric "feature" in Unit 9
presents the possibi I ity that the site was occupied during the Archaic
as we 11 . Skinner et a I . (ms. : 31) report that numerous dart points
have been recovered from the slough southeast of the site.
The geomorphic history
of
the
site
is
not
resolved.
Stratigraphic similarities to the McDonald Site suggest corresondences
which are not borne out by the radiocarbon dates from the upper
portions of the profile.
The restricted area of occupation has
suggested both massive disturbances (Skinner et al. ms.) and I imited
activity loci (Peter 1982) to various investigators. Examination of
the avai I able profile data do not clearly support truncation of the
site, although this cannot be ruled out. A limited area of occupation
corresponding to a limited surface area, constricted in al I directions
by old channels of the creek, seems most plausible.
A further point regarding the area of the site is essential. The
excavations detailed in this chapter encompass relatively exhaustive
coverage of the site described by SMU as x41HI40. This site and two
other SMU sites, x41HI41 and x41HI42, are al I included in the site
originally reported by C.K. Chandler to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin and recorded
as 41HI58. The remainder of the site is comprised of a surficial
scatter of I ithic materials along the edge of an intermediate terrace
east and north of x41HI40. It is no longer clear, after Corps of
Engineers outlet channel construction, if surficial cultural materials
ever connected the two site areas (x41HI40 with the terrace ridge),
but the distance between them is not great.
Recording the terrace portions of 41HI58 as separate sites from
the floodplain midden is not an oversight, but rather a question of
managerial choice. Some archeologists would view them as a single
site while others would not. Interpretation of the midden area at
41HI58 out of the context of the terrace sites is problematical,
however.
The midden area excavations describe a I imited area
f I oodp I a in site in a seeming I y i so I ated context.
In rea I i ty, I ess
than 50 meters away, the terrace edge slopes are covered with I ithic
debitage. This intermediate terrace debitage spans the entire range
of the I ithic reduction process, but cores and primary reduction
debris were prominent. Unmodified I ithic raw material was present as
wel I.
37-24

-

REPS DAVIS SITE
Two comments from the 1982 Management Data Survey notes are
interesting.
The first notes the extremely high density of lithic
debris present in a non-upland area close to the creek, adding that no
other Aqui I la Creek terraces at this elevation have extensive gravel
deposits. The second comments on the great variety of chert types
present in the lithic debris, apparently greater than at any other
Aqui I la Lake Project site.
Several characteristics of the I ithic debris from the midden area
may relate to the terrace edge debris. Despite the relatively low
total of I ithic debitage, a total which seems to reflect a large
percentage of the entire site, primary reduction activities are
seemingly emphasized. The 15 cores recovered (3.9% of the total
debris) represent more than three times the percentage from any other
Aquil la Lake site (1.2% at 41HI110) and more than six times the
average of 0.6%. Corticate debitage is also more common. The ratio
of corticate to decorticate flakes is 1.95:1, more than any other
Aqui I la Lake I ithic site (excluding 41HI111 and 41HI115 whose combined
total of flakes was only 29 specimens). Of sites with adequate sample
sizes for analysis, only 41HI1 (1.44:1) and 41HI110 (1.56:1), both
known lithic reduction areas, approach this ratio.
Although the preliminary stages of I ithic
reduction
were
emphasized at the Reps Davis Site, the end product is not altogether
clear. Bifaces, which are dominated by production errors and failures
rather than finished pieces, account for 1.8% of the total debris,
fourth in the Aqui I la Lake sample, bettered only by the I ithic
production centers at 41HI109 (3.3% bifaces) and 41HI110 (2.5%) and
the suspected I ithic center at 41HI117 (1.9%).
Although the total
sample of projectile points is quite smal I for speculation, the three
specimens from the site comprise 0.8% percent of the total debris,
equal to that at the McDonald Site and second only to 41HI109 (1.2%).
Informal tools were also important as is indicated by the
use-wear recorded on bifaces thought to have been broken by production
errors. Modified debitage was also important, comprising 6.2% of the
to ta I , the highest tota I in the Aqu i I I a Lake project area. In
addition, the overal I presence of such tools is important.
Despite
the frequency of cores, the total percentage of debitage is smaller
than at any other site.
Total debitage at the Reps Davis Site
accounts for only 90.5% of the total debris.

THE MCDONALD SITE - 41Hl105

D. Brown, R. Watson, D. Peter and V. Rawn-Schatzinger

SITE DESCRIPTION
The McDonald site I ies on the modern floodplain on the left bank
of Hackberry Creek 2.6 kilometers northeast of the confluence of
Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks. The elevation of the floodplain surface
at the site is just below 520 ft (154 m) AMSL A smal I intermittent
tributary of Hackberry Creek bisects the site.
Gui ly erosion just
above
the
mouth
of
this
tributary has exposed the upper,
artifact-bearing strata at the site, the only visible evidence of
prehistoric occupation on the surface.
The site consists of two
distinct areas separated by the tributary:
Area A I ies on the
downstream or eastern side of the gully and Area B lies upstream to
the west, between the tributary and the modern channel of the creek
(Fig. 38 .1) .
The site lies in a broad expanse of alluvial sediments above the
confluence of the two major creeks which wi I I feed Aqui I la Lake. Much
of this area consists of modern floodplain or low recent creek
terraces mapped by the Soi I Conservation Service as Tinn Clay, a fine,
montmori I lonitic, thermic Vertie Haplaquol I.
A typical profile is
described as consisting of up to 60 inches (150 centimeters) of very
dark gray clay A horizon over mottled olive gray and yellow clay C
horizon (Brooks 1978:70). Unlike other Mol Ii sols, Haplaquol Is do not
have an argi I I ic or natric B horizon and the Vertie subgroup is
clayie~ and dry during at least several weeks of the year (Soi I Survey
Staff 1975:281-2). For a more detailed description of soi Is at the
site, see the section on site stratigraphy.
The site is located near the western margin of the Blackland
Prairie biotic zone, although the vegetation at the site is primarily
riparian lowland forest composed of oak, ash, hackberry and pecan with
an understory of smaller trees such as hawthorne, honey locust and

wi Id plum. In addition to the various tree species, the site was
covered by various short stem grasses, vines, such as greenbriar and
grapevine, and smal I herbaceous plants such as American Beauty Berry.
In the spring, various smal I wi Id flowers were common. As with any
riparian site, wildlife was abundant. A large number of smal I mammals
and bird species were observed at the site during the excavations.
Prior to _inundation, al I of the trees were cleared from the floodplain
in the downstream portion of the lake area. In the immediate area of
the McDonald site, al I trees were hand cleared to m1n1m1ze the
potential destruction of remaining archeological materials.
Unlike many other archeological sites in the Aqui I la Lake area
(and anywhere, for that matter), the McDonald site has been relatively
undamaged by recent historic activities. Capped by nearly a meter of
historic alluvium, the prehistoric cultural materials at the site are
wel I below the reach of most agricultural-related disturbances.
When
first discovered, the site lay in a riverine forest of moderate to
large hackberry, oak and pecan trees which had certainly not been
cleared for much of this century; it is possible that the site area
has never been cleared or cultivated. In addition, the heavy clay
sediments of the site greatly reduced potentially disturbing rodent
activities. One large recent burrow in the upper 50 centimeters of
the historic fi I I (inhabited by a large wood rat, Neotoma sp. during
the 1982 excavations) and surface nests by various smal I rodents
(Sigmodon?
sp.) were the only clear evidence of rodent activity at
the site, and both of these instances were quite recent.
The major destructive influences at the site were the vertic
clays, with high shrink and swel I and potential for the vertical
displacement of artifacts, and gully erosion. While vertic clays may
have contributed substantially to disturbances near the surface in
some areas of the site, there was I ittle evidence encountered during
the 1982 investigations that this was a major source of disturbance.
Gui ly erosion in the arroyo separating the two areas of the site,
however,
has
been
responsible
for a considerable amount of
destruction, at least in Area A. The unstable and col lapsing wal Is of
this gully may continue to slump once the site is underwater in the
lake, accelerating its current rapid rate of destructi_on.
DATA COLLECTION
1978 Investigations

The McDonald site was first recorded by Alan S. Skinner in the
summer of 1978 after the discovery of a buried, dark, humus-rich
stratum which had been exposed by the gully which bisects the site.
38-3

MCDONALD SITE
Eroding from the dark stratum were mussel shel I, large mammal bones,
I ithic debris and an incised and punctated Caddoan sherd, identified
as Maydel le Incised.
Because the site was obviously a unique and
valuable cultural resource located on the edge of an area slated to be
used as a borrow pit for dam construction, test excavations were
initiated immediately in 1978 by the SMU Archaeological Research
Program under the direction of S. Alan Skinner. Due to the lack of
surface visibility, the determination of the horizontal and vertical
extent
of
the
cultural deposits at the site necessitated a
multidimensional excavation strategy, including the use of vertical
profiles of the cut banks, exploratory backhoe trenches and 27
control led excavation units.
Three vertical profiles were initially cut in the channel banks
adjacent to the original exposure of the site (Fig. 38.1). The
largest profile (7 min length), Vertical Face 1, was cut at the
original exposure in the gully.
Vertical Face 2 was cut directly
across the channel to determine if the channel had cut through the
cultural deposits.
Vertical Face 3 was uti I ized to determine the
northern extent of the original exposure.
While Vertical Face 1
revealed the presence of a buried cultural horizon approximately 45
centimeters below the surface of the east bank of the tributary
channel, no cultural deposits were observed in Vertical Faces 2 and 3.
They did, however, reveal a sandy matrix which was totally different
from the clayey matrix observed in Vertical Face 1. This change in
sediments suggested the possibi I ity that the peninsular area northwest
of the original site exposure might be a fi I led meander scar.
A fourth vertical profile was subsequently cut along the east
bank of Hackberry Creek. It was anticipated that sandy f i I I would be
encountered and the presence of a filled meander scar would be

buried approximately 60 centimeters deep in clayey deposits similar to
those of the original site exposure.
A f i I led meander scar was
discovered, but its position was between two separate occupation
areas.
The area to the east of the tributary channel was designated
as Area A.
Area B encompasses the peninsular area adjacent to
Hackberry Creek.
The backhoe trenches were uti Ii zed to determine the horizontal
extent of the cultural horizon and delineate the stratigraphic
relationships of the different portions of the site.
Trench A
revealed that the cultural deposit lay on a surface sloping from east
to west down toward the creek. Trenches C and D were placed across
the tributary channel to establish the relationship of the two
occupation areas and to define the northern I imits of Area A. A more
detailed discussion of site stratigraphy is contained in the fol lowing
section of this chapter.
38-4

MCDONALD SITE
A grid, oriented 21 degrees east of magnetic north,
was
established at the site and 27 one meter square excavation units were
uti I ized to sample the intrasite variabi I ity and to determine the
I imits of the artifact concentrations.
A 1 by 5 meter trench was
first dug from Vertical Face 1 to determine the extent of the exposed
cultural horizon.
The sterile overburden of these units was removed
with picks and shovels. Only when the culture-bearing horizon was
encountered was the matrix removed in 5 centimeter levels and screened
through one-quarter inch hardware cloth. Since the cultural horizon
was present throughout the trench, an additional excavation unit was
placed 6 meters to the east.
An additional 15 excavation units were then placed at 10 meter
intervals from this unit (Fig. 38.1). After the sterile overburden
was removed, al I matrix was removed in either 5 or 10 centimeter
intervals (Table 38.1) and screened through one-quarter inch hardware
screen. Additionally, a No. 10 bucket of dirt was collected from
each level for water screening through 1 mi I I imeter hardware screen.
Soi I samples were also collected from each level.
Testing of Area B was initiated with a 1 by 2 meter unit directly
east of Vertical Face 4.
Since this unit exposed a portion of a
hearth, the unit was expanded into a 2 by 3 meter unit.
Additional
test excavation units were placed to the north and south of this unit
to delimit the boundaries of the cultural deposit.
The sterile
overburden was quickly removed and the culture-bearing deposits were
removed 1n the same manner as those in Area A of the site {Table
38.1).
1980 Investigations
The 1980 investigations conducted by TAS at the McDonald Site
were originally intended to expose large areas in search of structural
remains and specialized use areas. Unfortunately, even with the use
to
remove
the sterile overburden, difficulties
of
machinery
encountered in the excavation and screening of the heavy alluvial
clays significantly slowed the investigations, precluding the opening
of the large areas envisioned.
Excavations were limited to that part of Area A shown by previous
testing to contain the highest density of materials (Fig. 38.2a).
Five 2 by 2 meter excavation units were placed in this area (Fig.
38.1).
Backhoe Trench D, previously excavated by SMU, was cleaned
out, deepened, lengthened and profiled, as were the southern 8 meters
of SMU trench C. In Area B, two new trenches, E and F, were excavated
with a backhoe and profiled.

MCDONALD SITE

The excavation units in Area A were placed with reference to the
grid established by SMU during the original testing. Two by two meter
excavation units were designated by the grid coordinate of the
northwest corner.
The principal reference datum was set at the
southeast corner of SMU Unit 15 and was designated N500/W500.
Al I
horizontal provenience information was recorded in 1 by 1 meter quads
(1/4 s~uares) within the 2 b~ 2 meter excavation units.
Vertical
provenience was recorded 1n terms of arbitrary 5 centimeter units.
During their investigations SMU established a vertical reference point
arbitrarily defined as 100 meters above datum. This point was located
by the TAS party and al I elevations were measured relative to the SMU
datum. A secondary vertical reference point was established by a nai I
set in a tree approximately 6.5 meters south of N500/W500. This point
provided a more reliable and permanent reference than did the surface
point used by SMU.
Ten to 50 centimeters of sterile overburden were removed from a
sizable part of Area A (Fig. 38.1). In the excavated units, it was
also necessary to remove an additional 8 to 47 centimeters of
overburden to expose the top of the stratum containing archeological
materials. Once this level was encountered in an excavation, the
entire 2 by 2 meter unit was leveled, and control led excavations were
made in 5 centimeter horizontal levels, beginning with level 1. There
were no visible natural stratigraphic divisions within the 40 to 50
centimeter thick upper cultural stratum (1980 Stratum 3).
Al I fi I I
removed from the excavation units in Area A was screened through
one-quarter inch hardware cloth, and matrix samples for phytol ith and
pollen analysis were collected from each 5 centimeter level. Figure
38.3 i I lustrates the relationships of levels in the various units.
UNIT N500/W506
This unit was the deepest control led excavation conducted during
the 1980 season. The northeast, southeast and southwest quads of this
unit were excavated to approximately 45 centimeters below the surface
of the upper cultural stratum at the site, designated as Stratum 3 1n
1980 (Fig. 38.3). The northwest quad was excavated an additional 12
centimeters
below the base of level 8 in order to expose a
concentration of sandstone designated as Feature 2.
Table 38.2
i I lustrates the significant decrease in the artifact frequency in the
lowest two levels (8 and 9) of this unit.
A total of 1.617 cubic
meters were removed from 1980 Stratum 3 in this excavation unit.
Features 2 and 3 were recorded in this unit.
(See discussion of
features below for description).

MCDONALD SITE

UNIT N502/W508
The southeastern quad of this unit corresponds to SMU test pit
16.
Backf i I I
from this quad was removed and discarded.
An
examination of the resulting profiles indicated that no natural
substrata could be defined in Stratum 3 during the 1980 investigations
(reexamination of the profiles in 1982 showed that it was indeed
impossible to subdivide this stratum in Area A, but, renumbered
Stratum 4 in 1982, it was successfully subdivided in the deep
excavation unit in Area 8). The remaining three quads were excavated
in 5 centimeter levels below the surface of the main upper cultural
stratum to the base of level 8. A total of 1.21 cubic meters were
excavated from the upper cultural stratum in this unit.
UNIT N504/W510
Three levels were removed from this unit before it was abandoned
to concentrate on excavation units.
Abundant faunal remains were
recovered from levels 2 and 3 in the south half, but I ithic debris was
very rare, only five items being recovered. A I ittle more than 0.5
cubic meter of fi I I was removed from the unit.
UNIT N506/W512
Six levels were excavated from the south half and the southern
two-thirds of the northwest quad of this unit. Problems of vertical
control resulting from an inaccurate I ine level resulted in the
excavation of level 6 from 2 to 4 centimeters too deep. A total of
1.18 cubic meters of fi I I were removed from the upper cultural stratum
in this unit. Feature 1 was recorded in this unit.
UNIT N512/W502
The southeast quad of this unit corresponds to SMU unit 18.
The
f i I I from this previously excavated quad was removed prior to the
excavation of the rema1n1ng three quads.
The sterile overburden
strata 1 and 2, visible in the exposed profiles, was removed to the
top of the cultural stratum in the northwest, southwest and northeast
quads.
Level 1 was then removed from each of these quads and level 2
was removed from the southwest quad.
Inclement weather forced the
abandonment of this unit after 0.2 cubic meters had been excavated.

38-12

MCDONALD SITE
UNIT N495/W510
A smal I section of the gully wal I of the tributary stream was
cleared on the west side of Area A in order to trace the main upper
cultural stratum as it was exposed by stream erosion.
Al I materials
recovered from this section were from a disturbed context. This
section was designated as N495/W510.
1982 Investigations
During the 1979-80 investigations at the site, it was determined
that Area B, while not extensive, was much deeper than had originally
been thought. The main focus of the 1982 investigations was extending
the sample of cultural materials from Area B. Excavations were
undertaken in this area to determine the depth of the cultural
deposits here and to test the suggestion, originally made in 1978,
that there might be differences between the
Late
Prehistoric
occupations in the two areas (Skinner et al. ms.).
At the beginning of the 1982 season, brush was cleared from the
projected excavation areas and the site grid was re-established and
extended into Area B, using stakes left in place from the 1980 season.
The 1980 vertical datum nai I was relocated and a new datum set in Area
B. Before leaving the site, two permanent grid markers, rebar set in
concrete, were placed on the W520 grid I ine in Area B. When the
vegetation was cleared from the site, the height of the Area A datum
forced its removal, but the Area B datum was maintained on a stump
southeast of the excavation area.
The initial 1982 excavation at the site consisted of a 2 by 2
meter test unit (N521/W544) located in Area B between the west end of
Backhoe Trench E and SMU Unit 23. This unit, described in more detai I
below, was excavated to a depth of nearly 4 meters. A second 2 by 2
meter unit (N504/W506) was begun in Area A but this was abandoned
after it became obvious that the excavations in Area B would demand
most of the time budgeted for work at the site. While the excavation
of these units was in progress, the profiles of those old backhoe
trenches remaining open (E, F and G) were cleaned and the strata
reexamined.
Portions of the three backfi I led trenches (A, Band C)
were reopened and examined as wel I.
Trench C was extended and
deepened to the north and a new trench, G, was dug north of the
excavations in Area B, just north of SMU Unit 20.
The primary SMU
excavation unit 1n Area B, Unit 23, was also cleaned out and the
profile examined.

38-13

MCDONALD SITE
After careful examination of al I the excavation unit and trench
profiles in Area B, it was decided to attempt the exposure of a large
portion of the uppermost cultural stratum in this component.
As in
the 1979-80 excavations in Area A, the upper culturally sterile strata
were machine-stripped and hand excavations begun just above the level
of the cultural material.
Initially, a 2 by 3.5 meter rectangle
between the west end of SMU Unit 23 and the 1982 2 by 2 meter
excavation unit, N521 W544, was opened. Later, this excavation was
carried further to the east. Twenty square meters were excavated in
this manner.
This cultural stratum, thought to be an aboriginal
occupation surface, was designated Surface II. One of these one meter
units was carried down below the uppermost surface and is designated
Surface II. These units are discussed in greater detai I below.
UNIT N521/W544
This was the main vertical sampling unit excavated during the
1982 season.
Thirty-five 10 centimeter levels were excavated below
the ground surface from this 2 by 2 meter unit.
Three more 10
centimeter levels were excavated below this 1n the southwestern
quadrant only (levels 36 through 38).
With the exception of four
quadrants from two levels (levels 16 and 17), al I of the matrix from
this unit was water screened through one-quarter inch mesh.
The
quadrants from levels 16 and 17, a zone where cultural materials
appeared to be thinning, were dry screened as an experiment.
Despite
the slightly less clayey soi I, dry screening alone was much slower and
was quickly abandoned. While dry screening did seem to result in a
greater volume of she I I fragments relative to whole umbos, the overal I
recovery of material did not appear seriously affected and the
recorded differences in level totals are thought to be cultural.
Below Level 17, several levels were first dry screened to remove loose
matrix with the remaining clay lumps water screened. The pre I iminary
dry screening technique appeared to have no effect on material
recovery. For more detai I on the excavation and screening techniques,
see the chapter on Data Collection methods in this report.
For a
detailed description and discussion of the sedimentary stratigraphy of
this unit, see the next section of this chapter.
Cultural materials from this unit showed clear stratification as
is indicated by Figure 38.4a and Table 38.3, with several peaks of
cultural material below the main Late Prehistoric occupation of the
site in levels 7 through 12.
A lens of coarse gravel across the
entire unit in level 35 apparently marks the lower I imit
of
occupations at the site. Twenty centimeters of matrix were excavated
below level 38 in the southwest quadrant (this material was scanned
for potential cultural material but not screened), but no indication
of deeper aboriginal occupations was detected.
It 1s possible,
38-14

MCDONALD SITE
however, that layered occupations at the site extend much deeper than
4 meters. A total of 14.3 cubic meters of f i I I (excluding the
unscreened lower 20 centimeters) were removed from this unit. Two
features, Features 5 and 6, were designated in this unit, but several
possible I iving surfaces were noted and are described elsewhere in
this chapter.
UPPER OCCUPATION SURFACE EXCAVATION UNITS
Because of the ultimate shape of these units, it is impossible to
designate them by a unique unit number. As noted above, the sterile
matrix above these units was removed by backhoe, using the freshly
cleaned profiles from N521/W544, SMU Unit 23 and Backhoe Trenches E
These units
and F as a guide to the depth of the uppermost stratum.
were
opened in two phases.
The first phase consisted of an
approximately two meter wide strip opened between the north end of
N521/W544 and the south end of SMU Unit 23. Twenty whole and four
partial 50x50 centimeter units were located in this area.
A second
area was opened to the east of the original phase, running from the
south end of N521/W544 to the middle of SMU Unit 23 and extending 1/2
to 2 meters east of the first phase area. Altogether, 15 50x50
centimeter units were excavated in this area. Figure 38.4b shows the
stripped area around N521/W544 looking west toward the creek. The
first phase area is covered with plastic. The second phase area is in
the foreground.
Actually three potentially distinct
cultural
strata
were
identified from these units. These are designated here as Surfaces I,
II and III. Surface I, originally thought to I ie in the uppermost
portion of soi I stratum 4a, was finally defined as a probable
ephemeral prehistoric occupation lying on the surface of Stratum 4a,
with the upper portions of al I larger bones contained mostly within
the bottom of Stratum 3. A number of bison bones observed in the
1979-80 backhoe trenches were determined to be associated with this
surface, as wel I as bones from several other animal species. The only
material other than bones encountered on this surface was a smal I
number of very tiny flakes and chips scattered across the entire
excavation area.
Surface II was the primary target of the last few weeks of
excavation.
This surface is the uppermost clearly recognizable
aboriginal living surface at the site (Surface I was not so much
recognized
for any cultural patterning but for its consistent
association with the boundary between soi I strata 3 and 4a).
The
surface was recognized in al I but two of the 50 centimeter quadrant
provenience units by the highly visible occurrence of smal I bits of
charcoal, specks of burned soi I, tiny burned rock fragments, hackberry
seeds and the relatively high density of artifactual material (Figs.

38.Sa, 38.Sb, 38.6a).
Throughout most of the unit area, excavation
was down to and including the immediate surface where al I cultural
material was mapped in place and subsequently collected. Because of
the slope of Surface II and the overlying stripped matrix, it is
difficult to exactly calculate the amount of f i I I excavated but a
figure of 2.0 cubic meters is estimated for the entire area.
Surface III (Fig. 38.6b) was only exposed in four 50 centimeter
quadrants which were taken below the level of Surface II. Less than
0.1 meters of f i I I were excavated from these units.
In these four
quadrants, excavators reported an apparent stratigraphic break of two
to four centimeters between artifacts lying on Surface II and those
lying on Surface III. Because of the proximity of these two surfaces,
some mixing might be expected and is apparently indicated by the
presence of a sherd from a partial Surface III ceramic vessel
excavated with the Surface II materials. Nonetheless, the distinction
between the two surfaces is thought to be val id.
Horizontal provenience within these occupation surface units was
maintained in 50 centimeter square units (cal led quadlettes to
distinguish them from quadrants which in most chapters of this report
refer to one meter excavation units), with the exception of two
peripheral units (N524/W539 and N524/W540) dug in one meter square
quadrants.
Al I of the matrix from these units was dry screened
through one-quarter inch mesh and the screened material bagged
separately from the rest of the cultural material which was mapped in
place. Dry screening was used here rather than water screening
primarily because it was thought important to have immediate feedback
on the type and density of material not being found in situ by the
excavators. In addition, the smal I volume of the matrix and its prior
disaggregation by trowel I ing made it quite easy to dry screen rapidly.
Al I material was mapped in place on surfaces II and III and
debris (as wel I as bone tools and pottery) were given
individual numbers keyed to their location on the map.
Other
materials were drawn on the map but not identified individually.
Transit elevations relative to the arbitrary datum point were taken
for most specimens of debitage and pottery on the various surfaces
with additional sample elevations as needed to define the slope of the
layer.
The analysis of the material from this floor is treated in a
separate section near the end of this chapter.

Summary of Investigations
In three years of investigation at the McDonald Site, 33
control led excavation units covering 70.5 square meters and 7 backhoe
trenches were dug. A I ittle over 32 cubic meters of matrix were hand
excavated, while 700 cubic meters of sterile f i I I were removed by
machine. SI ightly over 13 cubic meters were excavated from Area A
while excavations in Area B totaled just under 19 cubic meters. With
few exceptions, al I matrix was sieved through 1/4 inch screen. During
the 1978 investigations, samples from each level were water screened
through fine mesh, and during excavation of the upper occupation
surface floors in 1982, careful troweling recovered a variety of
materials that would have passed through 1/4 inch screen.
Excavation levels at the site present a complex picture.
During
1978, the sterile overburden was removed by hand with pick and shovel,
and subsequent levels were dug in 5 and 10 centimeter increments.
With the exception of the three 1 by 2 meter units which comprise Unit
23 in Area B, al I of the 1978 units were 1 by 1 meter.
Table 38.1
summarizes these variable increments.
Note that in units which
yielded artifactual material, the upper I imit of cultural materials
ranges from 35 to 75 centimeters.
Prior to the 1980 excavations, 10 to 50 centimeters of sterile
overburden were machine stripped from Area A; In contrast to the
widely spread 1978 units, the 1980 units were concentrated in Area A.
Figure 38.3 shows a comparison of the total depths and level sizes of
the 1980 units with some of the main 1978 units 1n that same area.
Al I of the 1980 units were 2 by 2 meters.
The main 1982 unit, N521/W544, was dug from the surface 1n
consistent 10 centimeter levels. This was the only excavation unit,
other than soi I units 1 and 4, which did not yield cultural materials,
that was dug from the surface. In al I other cases, Unit 1 refers to
the first cultural level. In addition to the 2 by 2 meter unit, a
wide but shallow excavation area was opened north and east of
N521/W544 after machine stripping in that area.
Backhoe trenches in both areas showed that at least some of the
excavation units generally sampled the major cultural strata present.
Al I of the units did not reach the lowermost of the main cultural
zones, however, and the evidence is not clear on whether the the lower
I imits of cultural material were reached in either area.
The deep
Area B 2 by 2 meter unit presents the best evidence, having reached a
gravel lens and a half-meter segment with only five specimens of
cultural debris recovered;
but as the backhoe could not penetrate
38-21

beneath this depth, this is only speculative. In Area A, examination
of the backhoe trench profiles showed no evidence of major zones
beneath the deepest excavation units, but a 1982 re-eexamination of
Trench C showed some burned rock and mussel she I I wel I below the level
reached by any of the excavation units.
After the final season of excavations, vegetation was hand
cleared from the site so that the use of heavy equipment would not
damage any remaining intact sediments. The main excavation units were
backf i I led with the remaining original sediments. Several loads of
sand were brought in to effect the final backfi I I ing, replacing soi I
that had been eroded away or transported to water screens, and placing
a final protective cap on the site. The site is now inundated by
Aqui I la Lake.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
After three seasons of excavation, the complex stratigraphic
history
of
the
McDonald site 1s beginning to unfold.
This
understanding has been aided by 7 backhoe trenches, 33 hand control led
excavation units and 7 gully or creek bank profiles. Underlying the
generally flat and featureless surface of the Hackberry
Creek
floodplain, stratigraphic units of varying thickness and texture offer
some clues to the alluvial history of the site.
Overview of Site Stratigraphy
The stratigraphic summary presented 1n the unpublished draft
report of the 1978 SMU excavations at the site (Skinner et al.
ms.:74-79) provides an excel lent general overal I view of
the
depositional
stratigraphy
at the
site.
Unfortunately, their
diagrammatic profiles are not quite consistent with the verbal
descriptions (the latter being the more accurate). SMU recognized
five discontinuous general stratigraphic layers, numbered upward from
the
lowest stratum reached during the excavations.
The brief
descriptions of these general strata included below are taken from
their unpublished report. Particular note should be taken of the soi I
textural studies. Revised stratigraphic zones for each area are shown
below.
SMU SOIL STRATIGRAPHIC UNITS
Layer 5: A silty stratum found only in Backhoe Trench B,
increasing in thickness from west to east in that
trench and thought to indicate the edge of a fi I led
channel east of the main site area. Although none of
the backhoe trenches was carried further east into the
38-22

--------------------------------··-·--~·

MCDONALD SITE
center of this proposed channel area, a very slight
I inear depression can be observed running north-south
in this area. During a 1982 summer flood at the site,
this area fi I led with water making an island of the
site area. This surficial strata is not interpreted as
direct channel fi I I but rather
as
more
recent
floodplain fi I I ing of the low-lying depression scar of
a much earlier channel. The concentration of cultural
remains west of the area of this old channel and its
relative indistinctness suggest that it was excavated
and f i I led prior to the Late Prehistoric occupations at
the site, although how much before cannot be said.
Layer 4: This is the primary surficial depositional unit
across most of the site area (incorrectly labeled as
Layer 5 in the SMU draft report profiles).
As the
surface unit, it is the most recently deposited unit
and most clearly linked to the modern depositional
regime. SMU identifies it as the Tinn Clay series soi I
mapped at the site by the Soi I Conservation Service
(Brooks 1978), suggesting that it ranges in depth from
13 to 25 centimeters in various parts of the site.
As
described by the SCS, however, the Tinn Clay soi I is a
relatively deep clay and silty clay soi I, ranging up to
80 or more inches in depth (Brooks 1978:70). This zone
is probably best regarded as only the A horizon of the
Tinn Clay series soi I which actual ry includes the
prehistoric culture-bearing layers described below.
Grain-size analysis data provided by the Corps of
Engineers indicates that this stratum is sandier in
Area B than in Area A. In Area A, the sand fraction
ranges from 15 to 21 percent while in Area B, the sand
fraction forms 39 percent of the total (U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers 1978: Table I). Theoretical models
of alluvial deposition suggest that coarser sediments
either never leave the channel proper or are deposited
along stream banks (Ritter 1978:262). This suggests
that Area B, with its greater sand content, was closer
to the creek channel than was Area A when this level
was deposited and that perhaps the creek channel
occupied its current location adjacent to Area B at the
time of deposition.
Layer 3: SMU notes that this sandy layer is only present in
the Area B component of the site. They record it as
being 25 centimeters thick and composed of 66 percent
sand fraction. No cultural material was recovered from
this stratum or the overlying Layer 4.
This stratum,

Layer 2: This dark brown to gray silty clay stratum 1s
present across most of the site, underlying Layer 3 1n
Area Band Layer 4 in Area A.
Its thickness ranges
from 25 centimeters in Area A to 35 centimeters in Area
B. In Area A, it is primarily clay, consisting of only
7 percent sand. In Area B, the sand fraction increases
to 27 percent and gravel comprises 5 percent.
Again,
the higher percentage of sand west of the tributary
gully suggest that this stratum was deposited after
Hackberry
Creek had moved to its modern channel
location.
Layer 1: This 1s the lowest stratum recorded by SMU and
contained most of the prehistoric cultural material
recovered from the site in 1978. It is described as
underlying most of the site, apparently pinching out
toward old channels north and east of the site, and
dipping down below the tributary that divides the site
areas.
AREA A STRATIGRAPHY
The 1980 TAS investigations at the site recognized four primary
strata that do not exactly correspond with those described above. SMU
Layer 5 was not included in the 1980 strata and SMU Layer 1 was
divided into two separate strata, 3 and 4. In addition, SMU Layers 2
and 3 are apparently combined in TAS 1980 Stratum 2.
Figure 38.7
shows the south wal I profile of the 1980 excavation unit N500/W506 and
the fol lowing description of soi I zones from that unit generally
correspond to the upper three strata recognized during that season.

AREA B STRATIGRAPHY
A third major redefinition of the soi I stratigraphy was attempted
during the 1982 excavation season, based on the 4 meter deep unit
excavated in Area B at that time.
Figure 38.8a i I lustrates the
stratigraphic profile of this unit, N521/W544.
While the strata
defined in this unit generally agree with the upper units defined by
both SMU and the 1980 TAS investigations, they add a number of finer
subdivisions to the lower strata at the site.
These are described
below.

stratum apparently corresponds to SMU Layer 2, but it
is unclear whether it was included with Stratum 2 or 3
during the 1980 TAS excavations.

happens to this zone in other areas of the pit. Rather
than including a cultural zone it appears to be bounded
on top and bottom by cultural zones, but it does
contain some charcoal and shel I.
Zone 6. Dark brown (10YR3/3) clay or clay loam;
strong,
medium to coarse subangular blocky structure; lower
boundary clear to gradual, smooth to slightly wavy.
This zone is one of the more prominent dark strata,
possibly a second buried "A" horizon but this is
unclear.
This is apparently the uppermost section of
what the 1980 TAS crew described as their lowest zone,
Stratum 4. Beginning with this zone is a series of ten
very similar strata distinguished primarily on slight
differences in texture and color.
The boundaries
between each of the zones below are gradual and
generally smooth but with occasional wavy patches. In
general, the strata are visible but indistinct and
difficult to describe.
In poor lighting, they are
invisible, but can be detected by trowel ling due to
slight textural differences. It is not clear whether
these zones represent individual
flood
episodes,
periods of stabilization and slight horizon formation
or perhaps climatic cycles during which there are
sedimentary changes in materials eroded and deposited.
Starting with this zone, there are pronounced carbonate
threads throughout.

Site Stratigraphy:

Discussion

The soi Is on the floodplain of the site have been classified by
the Soi I Conservation Service (Brooks 1978) as belonging to the Tinn
Clay series, a fine, montmori I lonitic (calcareous) thermic Vertie
Haplaquol I soi I 1n the revised terminology of the SCS.
This
classification seems accurate enough;
the
soi I
is
certainly
fine-grained, calcareous, wet during parts of the year (from the aquic
moisture regime reflected in the aquol I descriptor) and with a
relatively wel I-developed mol I ic epipedon at the surface (Soi I Survey
Staff 1975).
Several potential discrepancies have been
noted,
however.
While the clay fraction of the soi I may be partly or even
wholly montmori I lonite, there is little evidence of significant
shrink-swel I disturbance at the site, particularly within the Area B
portion. Not only was no evidence of fresh or old drying cracks
uncovered, but the distinct soi I horizons and the clear zonation of
the cultural material argue for a relatively undisturbed soi I matrix.
During the careful excavation of the upper occupation surface floors,
nearly every single artifact (with the exception of smaller mussel
shel I fragments) was found to be flat-lying or nearly so, a
potentially good indicator of lack of disturbance.
Another deviation from the typical Tinn Clay series profile is
found in the presence of the somewhat coarse sandy strata described
above as subdivisions of the 1982 Zone 2. The presence of a stratum
containing such a high concentration of sand in deposits derived from
Black land Prairie soi Is is somewhat anomalous. The General Soi I Map
Hi I I County (Brooks 1978), however, indicates that a single lobe of
deep sandy and loamy savannah soi Is extends into the Hackberry Creek
drainage between Jacks Branch and the Aqui I la Creek divide south of
Peoria.
Allen Newman, Assistant State Soi I Scientist
(oral
communication) noted that the early Anglo settlers in the Blackland
Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers area invariably settled
and
cultivated the sandier soi Is first because they were fami I iar with
these generally poorer, but more easily worked soi Is. It is probably
no coincidence then that the earliest town to be established in Hi I I
County, Lexington (see Jackson in this report), was located on the
eastern edge of the lobe of sandy soi Is described above, nor that the
earliest patented tracts around Lexington all extend to the west of
Jacks Branch.
Presumably it is these tracts which contributed the
sandy sediments which compose Stratum 2.

38-31

MCDONALD SITE
Wherever this material might have originated, the alternating
microstrata and lenses of clay and sand suggest several episodes of
deposition. If each separate stratum were regarded as a single flood
event, then as many as six or seven floods might be represented
{including the microstratum 2CC and Zone 3 which may represent a
separate clay stratum). Higher energy floods would have left coarser
textured deposits and lower energy stream flows would have deposited
the clay strata. It is also possible that a sequence of clay and sand
may together represent a single flood episode, with initial high
energy flow sand deposition and subsequent deposition of smaller
particle sized material after the flood crest had passed.
In any case, the historic cultural material found 1n the
uppermost of these strata definitely indicates a historic date for
their deposition. Zone 1 and some or al I of the five microstrata (A
through E) of Zone 2 may date to the historic period. Short lengths
of barbed wire (including two varieties, both sti I I in common use 1n
the area) were found in levels 1 and 2 and a .22 caliber rimfire
cartridge marked "H" in level 1. Level 3 yielded a metal fencing
staple and a two piece molded bottle with an applied I ip. This
bottle, marked "Ful I Measure", predates the 1920,s introduction of the
Owens bottle machine but cannot be securely dated earlier than this.
Note that the only aboriginal cultural material from the upper
three levels of N521/W544 is seven chips and flakes from the surface
level, material probably left behind as a result
of
surface
disturbances by previous excavations (recal I that this unit was
located between and quite close to both SMU Unit 23 and 1980 TAS
Backhoe Trench E). Levels 1 through 3 in N521/W544 roughly correspond
to Zones 1 and 2A. The dating of the levels below this is less
secure.
One smal I chert chip (from level 4 - approximately within
Zone 28) is the only artifact (excluding bone
al I of which is
thought to represent natural death assemblages) from Zones 28 through
2E. If these do represent the deposition of eroded sandy sediments
from the early farming activities at Lexington, then it would not be
surprising to find no artifacts mixed in these lower strata at a time
when population was relatively smal I and located several miles
upstream of the site area.
The interpretation and dating of Zone 3 1s one of ·the more
perplexing stratigraphic problems at the site. This dense gray clay
stratum bears some resemblance to the clay strata of Zone 2, but with
no hint of sand or she I I fragments. It is also thicker and more
nearly level across the unit than the strata above. For this reason
it was numbered separately.
There is also a relatively clear
stratigraphic break between Zones 3 and 4 (apparently a depositional
one since Zone 4 is a buried A horizon). This zone does contain
infrequent faunal remains representing diverse species, including deer
38-32

MCDONALD SITE
and bison. The juvenile bison remains recovered from the profile wal I
of 1980 Backhoe Trench E were apparently from this stratum and a large
mammal scapula fragment (probably a bison) was found associated with
this stratum in the wal I of Trench F when the profile was cleaned
during the 1982 season. In addition to these fauna! remains, a few
very tiny flakes and chips were found near the
interface between
Strata 3 and 4.
Although not all of the bones could be definitely
associated with the interface, one large bone (the axis vertebra of a
whitetai I deer) was found to be lying on the top of the upper surface
of Stratum 4 and otherwise completely encased 1n the gray clay
sediment of Stratum 3.
Below this stratum, the three subdivisions of Zone 4, which form
al I or part of the sol um of a buried soi I, contain the densest
cultural material recovered from the site. Late Prehistoric cultural
materials continue down into (and perhaps al I the way through) Stratum
5. A smal I fragment a a dart point shoulder recovered from near the
bottom of this stratum (level 13) may mark the upper boundary of the
Transitional Archaic, while a complete specimen (a Dari point from
level 17) from Zone 8 is probably a more secure indicator.
Twelve radiocarbon dates were obtained from the McDonald Site
during the the three seasons of excavations. These dates, shown in
Table 38.4, include six charcoal dates, five dates on mussel shel I
(Amblema plicata), and one date on soi I organics. Al I of the dates
were run by the Radiocarbon Laboratory of The University of Texas at
Austin.
Only a single sample was recovered from the Late Prehistoric
cultural zone in Area A. The two standard deviation range of this
charcoal date, gathered during the 1978 season, is so wide as to
completely eliminate its usefulness. The Area B dates include six
from the Late Prehistoric strata, two collected by SMU (TX-3168 and
The
TX-3169) and the rema1n1ng four from the 1982 excavations.
overal I range of these dates, from A.O. 85 to A.O. 1315, is also
wide with I ittle overlap. The two SMU date ranges approach overlap
between A.O.
1185 and A.O. 1190. The two 1982 dates from the same
general stratigraphic level as these SMU levels (TX-4815 and TX-4905)
overlap between A.O.
460 and A.O. 560. If the general pattern of
mussel shel I yielding dates too old held true here, the A.O. 460 date
might be somewhat later, but should in no way approach the much more
recent SMU dates. The remaining two dates from the Late Prehistoric
cultural zone (TX-4815 and TX-4964) are apparently much too early for
the Late Prehistoric as defined by Prewitt (1981). In any case, the
Late Prehistoric dates obtained from shel I, soi I and scattered
charcoal should be considered less reliable than the larger charcoal
samples submitted by SMU (TX-3169 and TX-3168).

The series of five dates from Archaic deposits in Area B are more
consistent, although imperfect.
The earliest two dates, one from
mussel shel I and one from charcoal, yield almost identical ranges and
are in good agreement with the Pedernales projectile point recovered
from that zone. The next higher series of dates, TX-4813 and TX-4907,
are in substantial agreement, with the mussel shel I date ranging
somewhat earlier, as might be expected.
In cultural terms, these
dates are somewhat early for the tentatively identified Castrovi I le
point from this zone. The last Archaic date, at the same level as a
Dari specimen, apparently fal Is much too early to agree with dates for
the Mahomet type and the Driftwood Phase as defined by Prewitt (1981).

Correction from Klein et al. 1982
** Area A
+ Feature chacoal

Although alluvial deposition should probably never be regarded as
constant, the bulk of the terrace sediments below the Late Prehistoric
strata suggest a somewhat rapidly aggrading valley f i I I sequence, with
cyclic or episodic events of similar magnitude occurring throughout
the profile (represented by the alternating light and dark strata and
the
more
or less evenly distributed cultural material).
The
compression of cultural material during the Late Prehistoric period
(if we accept the suggestion [Skinner et al.
1978] that the
aboriginal population was at its peak during the Late Archaic rather
than during the Late Prehistoric) may be a function of one (or both)
of two phenomena. Either the spot suddenly became attractive to the
Late Prehistoric population (either because of a change in the
38-34

-------

MCDONALD SITE
location of the creek or perhaps some change in resource procurement
strategies) or the deposition of materials from the creek was slowed
due to some environmental change.
While there is some evidence that the spot was utilized more
frequently by Late Prehistoric peoples (more lithic debitage and more
projectile points were deposited during a one thousand year period
than during two thousand years of Archaic occupation at the site), the
formation of an A horizon in Zone 4 suggests that aggradation had
essentially ceased after the heaviest Late Prehistoric uti I ization of
the Area B portion of the site. Given this, it is quite likely that
Hackberry Creek had begun to entrench and slow the process of
aggradation at some point during or slightly prior to the early
portion of the Late Prehistoric. Near the end of the Late Prehistoric
period, aggradation had al I but ceased and a stable surface formed
(subsequent to al I but the last aboriginal utilization of the site).
On this stabi I ized surface, the remains of one or more short term (and
perhaps dispersed) very late aboriginal campsites are found (i.e., the
cultural materials from Stratum 3).
Subsequent to the deposition of Stratum 3, one or more flood
events deposited the various lenses and microstrata of Stratum 2.
Part or al I of this may date to the historic period.
Despite the
probable link of this coarse sandy material with the early settlement
in the Lexington area, several other factors should be pointed out.
One, it is clear from the buried A horizon that stream deposition had
slowed to an apparent halt during the Late Prehistoric.
And yet,
suddenly, a stream which was not capable of lifting suspended clay
sediments to deposit them on the stream bank is leaving coarse sand
and she I I on its bank. A change in stream flow regime, either from a
climatic shift or an actual channel movement, is indicated.
It 1s
suggested
here that a combination of the two factors may be
responsible for the change.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Cultural Features
The features described below include only those recorded during
the 1980 and 1982 seasons. The 1978 SMU excavations revealed several
possible hearths (Skinner et al.
ms. :80,83) but the number and
location of these is somewhat unclear from the notes. One of these
1978 hearths is reported as a charcoal concentration from what was
then thought to be the earliest occupation zone in Area B (actually
the lower portion of the Late Prehistoric occupation levels).
This
concentration yielded two radiocarbon dates: 1010+70 (TX-3169) and
780 +70 (TX-3168). A third radiocarbon date of 1280+540 (TX-3578) was

FEATURE 1
Feature 1 was a roughly semicircular concentration of charcoal
fragments and irregular lumps of bright orange burned clay in level 1
of the northwest quadrant of N506/W512. No artifacts, lithic debitage
or faunal remains were recovered in direct association with this
feature. Level 1 produced only five indeterminate large mammal bone
fragments. Feature 1 consisted of a mixed fi II of charcoal and burned
earth in a dark soil matrix and covered an area about 65 by 50
centimeters.
It did not appear to represent a primary deposit
resulting from in situ burning. The mixing of the matrix and the lack
of burned material outside of the arcuate concentration which composed
the bulk of the feature argue for a secondary deposit of hearth
materials.

sandstone pieces, covering almost the entire 1 by 1 meter quadrant
(Fig.
38.9).
The feature and surrounding fi II had few cultural
associations: 1 secondary chert flake, 2 tertiary chert flakes, 1
chert chip, 7 unidentified large mammal bone fragments, 4 gastropod
shel Is and 1 pelecypod valve.
Charcoal occurred in fit I of the
feature only in very low quantities as a diffuse scatter of flecks.
There was no burned earth or other evidence of in situ burning.
The
feature was about 12 centimeters thick from~he top of the highest
rock to the base of the lowest rock visible in this unit.
The rocks
composing the feature were resting on a flat surface at an elevation
of about 99.02 meters, approximately 95 centimeters below the modern
ground surf ace.
The function of this feature could not be determined.
The lack
of
any indication of in situ burning seems to eliminate the
possibility that it was a "Fieartti:'""" The oxidized sandstone composing
the feature and the presence of scattered charcoal flecks in the
surrounding matrix suggest that the stones were heated elsewhere and
redeposited in their present configuration. As in the case of the
large sandstone feature (1 and 2) at the Bailey Site discussed
earlier, the stones may have been heated and used as warming hearths
or boiling stones.

FEATURE 3
This feature consisted solely of two tabular sandstone slabs
located along and extending into the east wal I of the southeast quad
of N500/W506. The slabs are of oxidized sandstone and were lying at
an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizontal surface. The feature
was first encountered near the base of level 3 and extended almost to
the bottom of level 6 (elevation 99.35 to 99.23). The fi I I included
burned ~arth, burned bone and smal I pieces of charcoal. Their angular
position and the presence of burned materials beneath the stones
suggests that they were placed as f i I I into a hole or pit, perhaps to
support a post.
No artifactual remains were directly associated with
this
feature, and no pit outline could be defined. The feature measured
approximately 32 centimeters north-south by 22 centimeters east-west
as it was exposed in N500/W506.
FEATURE 4

A concentration of semi-articulated bison bones located in trench
E of Area B was designated as Feature 4. The feature covered an area
about 1 meter east-west by 0.6 meter north-south at a depth of about
60 centimeters below the modern ground surface. The bones included
the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae and several ribs and rib
fragments from a large adult bison.
This configuration of bones
corresponds to the hump, a portion preferred by many Plains Indians.
Butchering marks indicate that this feature was the result of human
activities and represented a discrete episode of bison butchering.
Feature 4 was at the base of a yellow-tan sandy clay horizon
which may be the result of an increase in the rate of deposition
subsequent to the clearing and cultivation of lands in the Hackberry
drainage after 1850. It is not altogether clear if this feature was
contained within 1982 Stratum 2E (see section on Site Stratigraphy
above), where no other prehistoric cultural material were found, or
within Stratum 3, where a number of bones (including some bison) and a
few smal I flakes and chips were recovered. In either case, this
feature is stratigraphical ly the youngest of al I those identified at
the site. Dating of this feature is thought to be relatively late in
the Late Prehistoric period. It may even date to the proto-Historic
period, but there is no evidence of this.

38-38

MCDONALD SITE
FEATURE 5
This feature, found in the northeastern quadrant of level 28 of
N522/W544 in Area B during the 1982 excavation season, was a smal I
tightly clustered concentration of lithic debris, snai Is, charcoal
flecks and burned soi I. The most notable aspect of this small feature
was a smal I pi le of I ithic debitage among which was found two smal I
crude bi faces and a bifacial core. Al I together, 29 flakes and chips
were recovered from this cluster.
Although this total 1s smal I
compared to many level and quadrant totals from this unit, it
comprises more than a third of al I the flakes and chips found in level
28.
In fact, most of the lithic debitage found in this level (63 of
81 specimens - 77.8%) was recovered from the northeastern quadrant.
A careful examination of the materials both from the feature and
the surrounding level collections showed that many of the flakes and
chips were of the same material as the two bi faces and core collected
from the feature (al I three of which are manufactured from different
but somewhat distinctive local chert types and therefore easily
separable).
While none of the debitage from the feature itself could
be refitted, several flakes from level 27 were refitted to the cruder
of the bifaces. A radiocarbon sample of charcoal from the feature has
yielded a date of 2610+40 B.P. (TX-4813). A mussel shel I sample from
the same level as the feature (Level 33) has been dated to 2760+60
years B. P. (TX-4907) .
FEATURE 6
The only other feature noted during the 1982 season was an
approximately circular lens of charcoal in the southwest corner of the
base of level 33 and extending downward into the top of level 34 of
N521/W544 in Area B.
This feature, interpreted as an aboriginal
hearth, was more clearly visible in the corner wal I of the unit after
excavation.
No lithic debris at al I was recovered from level 34
(though a few fragments of bone and mollusc shel Is were), while 18 of
the 19 flakes and chips recovered from level 33 were from the
southwestern quadrant.
A para I lel-sided, concave-based projectile
point, described later as Pedernales-1 ike was recovered from the floor
of level 32 in the northwestern quadrant of N521/W544 and is
tentatively associated with this feature. Charcoal from this feature
yielded a radiocarbon date of 2850+40 B.P. (TX-4814).
Mussel shel I
from the same level in the excavation unit has been dated to 2880+60
years B.P. (TX-4906).

FEATURES:

DISCUSSION

The features discovered at the McDonald Site appear to be the
result of different and probably unrelated subsistence activities
which were widely separated in time. The stratigraphic positions of
Features 1, 2 and 3, based on recognition and base level elevations,
indicate that they were stratigraphical ly separated by from 4 to 24
centimeters.
Feature 3, which is interpreted as a smal I pit or post
hole, probably originated from a surface above the elevation at which
it was recognized. If this is the case, it may have originated from
the same surface as Feature 1, 10.25 meters to the north.
Al I of the 1980 Area A features (1-3) occur in or immediately
above the main upper cultural stratum (1982 zone 4) and are thought to
date to the Late Prehistoric Period. Feature 4 (from the 1980 backhoe
trenches in Area B) appears to over I ie the main Late Prehistoric
occupation layers at the site and may date to the latter portion of
the Late Prehistoric or even possibly the early Historic Period. Both
of the 1982 Area B features (5 and 6) date to the Archaic period, as
discussed above.

Lithic Material
The greater part of the I ithic material recovered from the
McDonald site is flaked stone; only 21 specimens (0.2% of al I I ithic
debris from the site) of grooved, scratched and battered stone were
recovered from the excavations. Despite the relatively low percentage
of non-flaked stone, there is perhaps a greater variety of non-flaked
stone types present at the McDonald site than at any other site in the
Aqui I la Lake area. Non-flaked stone artifacts from the site include
not only the usual hammerstones, manos and grinding slabs, but a
combination mano-hammerstone, two abraders and various pigments.
FLAKED STONE
Flaked stone recovered in the three seasons of excavation at the
McDonald site total led 11,876 specimens. This includes 5590 specimens
from 1978 (47.1% of the total flaked stone sample), 3829 from 1980
(32.3%) and 2457 from 1982 (20.7%).
As at al I of the excavated
Aqui I la sites, debitage comprises most of the flaked stone assemblage,
total I ing 11,427 specimens, or 96.2 percent of the flaked stone
sample. Total modified debitage from the three seasons of excavation
includes only 200 specimens (1.7% of the flaked stone total), while
formal tools (uni faces, bi faces and projectile points) include another
249 specimens (2.1%).

MCDONALD SITE
Unmodified Debitage
As noted above, 11,427 specimens of unmodified debitage were
collected from the McDonald site. This total includes 5355 specimens
from 1978 (47.2% of the total debitage), 3703 specimens from 1980
(32.4%) and 2329 specimens from 1982 (20.4%). The 11,427 specimens
comprise 96.2 percent of all flaked stone. The individual 1978 and
1980 debitage percentages (96.5 and 96.9% respectively) are quite
close to this average, while the 1982 percentage (94.8%) is somewhat
smal le~.
This slightly higher percentage of tools from Area B (focus
of the 1982 excavation) agrees wel I with Skinner>s et al.
(ms.)
observation that tool percentages were higher in Area 8.
Unmodified debitage from the three seasons of excavation includes
5509 flakes ·(48.2% of the total debitage) 5890 chips (51.5%) and 28
cores (0.2%). The 1978 SMU excavations yielded 2457 flakes (45.5% of
the 1978 debitage), 2,919 chips (54.0%) and 19 cores (0.5%). The 1980
collection included 1,773 flakes (47.8% of the 1980 debitage), 1927
chips (52.0%) and 3 cores (0.2%). In 1982, 1279 flakes (54.9%), 1044
chips (44.8%) and 6 cores (0.2%) were collected.
FLAKES (5509 SPECIMENS)
As noted in the chapter on laboratory analysis, there were some
difficulties in assuring the compatibility of the flake analyses from
the three different seasons of excavation. Despite al I attempts to
maintain a perfectly uniform analysis, certain indicators suggest that
analyst bias is invariably a factor. Even uti I izing the same analyst
over a period of several years can introduce an indeterminate amount
of bias. The sources and intensity of such bias, and some possible
controls, are discussed in more detai I in the data analysis chapter of
the concluding section. It is possible, indeed, almost probable, that
the biased analyses inhibit the accurate interpretation of the
combined totals. Interpretation of the unintegrated data from the
separate seasons is equally as difficult, however, and, at the request
of the Corps of Engineers and the Texas Historic Commission, the data
from the separate seasons have been combined. Where such figures
might be useful, data tables separated by season of excavation are
included in Appendix V.
Three seasons of excavation at the McDonald site yielded a total
of 5509 flakes. Broken down by season, these include 2457 specimens
(44.6%) from 1978, 1773 (32.3%) from 1980 and 1279 (23.2%) from 1982.
The total flake collection includes 123 primary flakes (2.2%), 2660
The 1980
secondary flakes (48.3%) and 2726 tertiary flakes (49.5%).
and 1982 collections are relatively similar (with the exception of the
percentage of primary flakes), the 1978 collection has significantly
different percentages of secondary and tertiary flakes. Part of this
38-41

MCDONALD SITE
difference is due to SMU>s use of fine screening for a portion of
their excavation (thus inflating the ordinarily smaller tertiary
flakes). Excluding these fine-screened flakes leaves 1,078 tertiary
flakes (51.9% of the 1978 flakes), stil I a significantly larger
percentage of the collection.
The distribution of flake types by excavation unit is shown in
Tables 38.5 and 38.6, i I lustrating each of the excavation areas
separately. These tables represent gross horizontal distribution of
flake .types, lumping the various vertical levels in each excavation
unit. Note that where possible the 2 by 2 meter units have been
separated into their component 1 by 1 meter units and al I units have
been assigned grid numbers. Separation of the three 1978 SMU 1 by 2
units in Area 8 was not possible. For the Area A materials, vertical
lumping may be the best solution for a complex and tightly packed
cultural stratigraphy.
The greater part of the Area A materials is
thought to be Late Prehistoric.
Such lumping is certainly not
justified in the deep excavation unit from the 1982 investigations in
Area 8. The distribution of flake types for this unit and the
adjacent occupation floor is shown broken down by cultural level in
Table 38.7. Period designations for this table are only approximate,
based on both radiocarbon dates and diagnostic artifacts. Each of
these gross stratigraphic units is thought to contain a number of
discrete occupation strata.
The highest corticate/decorticate ratio at the site (from any
unit with a sample size greater than fifty specimens) is SMU Unit 5
(483/493) in Area A, with a ratio of 2.1:1. Two Area A units, SMU
Unit 13 (491/504) and the southeast quad of 502/508 (501/508), are
tied for the lowest corticate/decorticate ratio of any of the units
with a larger sample size at the site with 0.5:1. Of the units in
Area 8 with an adequate sample size for analysis, the highest ratio is
found in the western 1 by 2 segment of SMU Unit 23 (N525/W545) with
1.9:1 and the lowest in the northeastern 1 by 2 segment of the same
SMU unit (N526/W544) with 0.6:1. Average corticate/decorticate ratios
between the areas are quite close. Area A has an overal I average
ratio of 1:1, while Area B has an overal I ratio of 1.1:1. Overall
site ratio is 1:1.
The 1978 SMU excavation areas show the greatest variation among
units in corticate/decorticate flake ratios, with an average overal I
ratio of 0.8:1. The differences between Area A and Area 8 in this
respect (for the 1978 excavations only) are neg I igible. The overal I
ratio of corticate to decorticate flakes for the 1980 TAS excavation
units is 1.3:1, with less unit by unit variation than among the 1978
materials. This figure is almost identical to the 1982 overal I
excavation unit corticate/decorticate flake ratio of 1.2:1. There is
slightly greater variation among the units in 1982, however. The 2 by

2 meter excavation unit in Area B (which contained 86.7% of al I 1982
flakes) yielded a ratio of 1.3:1, while the upper occupation floor
units yielded a ratio of only 0.9:1. This latter figure is partially
due to a methodological bias: careful trowel I ing on the occupation
surfaces recovered a number of smaller tertiary flakes which would
have gone through a quarter-inch screen. In fact, level 8 in the 2 by
2 meter excavation unit, which most closely corresponds to these
occupation surfaces, yields one of the highest corticate/decorticate
flake ratios found at the site - 1.8:1.
The distribution of platform types by flake class 1s shown in
Table 38.8, which i I lustrates each major site area separately. As
noted in the chapters on laboratory analysis and data analysis, there
are some potentially significant differences in the data from the
different seasons of analysis which are apparently attributable to
analytical bias. These differences are ii lustrated in separate tables
by year of analysis which are included in Appendix VI.
The
distribution of ventral platform lips by flake class for each of the
site areas is shown in Table 38.9. Again, some possible analytical
differences may exist here. Although analytical differences are less
pronounced in the identification of thermal alteration and material
types, there is some variation between the various seasons of
excavation. Distributions of thermal alteration and material types by
flake classes for each of the excavation areas are shown in Tables
38.10 and 38.11 respectively.
Primary Flakes (123 Specimens)
Of the 123 total primary flakes recovered from three seasons of
excavation at the McDonald site, 45 (36%) are from the 1978 SMU
excavations, 34 (27.6%) are from 1980 and 44 (35.8%) from 1982.
Overal I, primary flakes from the three excavation seasons comprise 2.2
percent of flakes recovered. Primary flake percentages from the first
two seasons of excavation, 1978 and 1980, are quite close (1.8% and
1.9% respectively), while the percentage of primary flakes identified
in 1982 is significantly higher at 3.4 percent. Whether this is due
to analytical bias or a real difference in the assemblages is not
known.
Comparison of the 1982 Area B 2 by 2 meter test unit with the
1982 occupation surface excavation units yields similar primary flake
percentages (3.4% and 3.6% respectively). On the other hand, broken
down by vertical provenience units, some primary flake percentage
differences can be seen in the 1982 2 by 2 meter test unit. For
example, contrasting the three main Late Prehistoric occupation levels
(8, 9 and 10) against the remainder of the pit yields figures of 3.9
percent (only slightly higher than that recorded from the occupation
surface
units)
and 2.8 percent respectively.

interpretation of this difference 1s related to the length of
occupation. This is only one of several possible explanations the
greater density of cu Itura I mater i a I in these Ieve Is; mater i a I
density may be just as much a function of distance from the center of
a particular campsite (see discussion below on thermally altered
primary flakes). As Yellen (1977) and Schiffer (1978) have pointed
out, the longer the stay at any given campsite, the greater the number
of activities conducted. Longer stays represented by these levels are
probably more I ikely to have included primary reduction activities
than the more ephemeral occupations represented by the levels with
sparser cultural materials.
By definition, al I primary flakes in this study have cortex
platforms and the SMU data has been converted for this site to make
comparable analysis possible. Only 9 (7.3%) of the 123 primary flakes
from the three seasons have ventral platform lips. This includes 2
from 1978 (4.4% of the 45 1978 primary flakes), 3 from 1980 (8.8%) and
4 from 1982 (9.1%).
Given the relatively smal I sample size, the
identification of trends in the data can be deceptive. In the latter
two seasons, however, I ipping is much less common on primary flakes
than on either secondary or tertiary flakes. The 1978 data set shows
a smaller percentage of I ipped secondary flakes (1.9%) and a not much
larger percentage of ventral platform lips on tertiary flakes (6.3%).
Six (4.9%) of the primary flakes show evidence of thermal
alteration, whether intentional or not. These include 2 (4.4%) from
1978, 3 (8.8%) from 1980 and 1 (2.3%) from 1982.
Again, given the
smal I sample size, the identification of trends is tenuous at best.
Overal I, however, primary flakes appear to be less commonly thermally
altered than secondary and tertiary flakes, a trend noted at other
sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. Two interpretive possibi I ities are
suggested:
if the thermal alteration is intentional, it may be that
cobbles are tested or even partially reduced before thermal alteration
(a practice for which there is no real ethnohistoric evidence, but
which may make good sense technologically). Secondly, if the thermal
alteration is the result of accidental burning in hearths, it may be
that primary reduction activities were confined to areas away from
hearths, perhaps on the margins of the camp. This latter possibi I ity
is suggested by Peter (1982) in his draft of the I ithic analysis of
the 1978 McDonald site materials. Using the SMU definition of primary
flakes (100% cortex dorsal surface but not necessarily a cortex
platform), he found that primary flakes tended to be discarded near
38-51

MCDONALD SITE
the periphery of the major occupation areas. The peripheral discard
model would only hold true if these >peripheries> were actually the
margins of larger camps rather than smal I, discrete, ephemeral
occupations and if, at the same time, the less dense occupational
strata in the 1982 2 by 2 meter test unit (where, as noted above,
lower percentages of primary flakes were encountered) were actually
the centers of ephemeral campsites rather than the margins of larger
ones.
If the position of the creek, along with the position of the
abandoned channels, can be assumed to be a relatively constant
distance from the center of the site, then al I of the cultural strata
within the 1982 2 by 2 meter unit and the units along the northeast
bank of the modern arroyo (an abandoned channel) would have been camp
centers, while the remainder of the SMU units would have sampled camp
margins.
Only two material types, chert and quartzite, were identified
among the 123 primary flakes from the three seasons of excavation.

collection (2.2% of the 1978 primary flakes compared to 2.°" quartzite
in the total 1978 collection), three quartzite flakes from 1980 (8.8%
compared to 1.6% total 1980 quartzite) and six from 1982 (13.6%
compared to 3.5% total 1982). While the 1978 sample size is smal 1,
both the 1980 and 1982 figures suggest that quartzite primary flakes
are
more
common than would be expected in a totally random
distribution, an observation noted at several other Aquil la Lake sites
(such as 41HI109, 41HI110).
As noted in those chapters, it may be
that quartzite, much less easily worked than the local chert, is
abandoned more often, with fewer tertiary flakes detached, or that
quartzite is primarily used in the manufacture of crude, heavy
chopper-like tools which are made by the simple removal of a few
primary and a few secondary flakes. Since al I but one of the five
Ogallala -chert (actually a quartzite) "cores" from the site are
heavily battered, it is suggested that these functioned primarily as
chopper tools rather than as raw material sources.
Secondary Flakes (2660 Specimens)
Secondary flakes from the three seasons of excavation comprise
48.3 percent of al I flakes from the site. Broken down by season,
these include 1,026 specimens from 1978 (41.8~ of the 1978 flakes),
978 specimens from 1980 (55.2%) and 656 specimens from 1982 (51.3%).
As noted previously, the discrepancy in secondary flakes between the
SMU collection and the two TAS collections is partially due to the use
of fine screening by SMU. Excluding the fine-screened flakes, the
1978 collection includes only 954 specimens (46.0% of the total 1978
non fine-screened flakes). This is sti II the lowest secondary flake
figure, but the 5.3 percent difference between 1978 and 1982 is not
38-52

MCDONALD SITE
much different than the 3.9 percent difference between 1980 and 1982.
Some support for the cause of the differences being in the screening
technique is found in the 1982 excavation results.
From
the
quarter-inch screened 1982 2 by 2 meter unit, secondary flakes
comprised 52.3 percent of al I flakes, while from the carefully
trowel led occupation surface units secondary flakes comprised only
45.0 percent of the flakes, a figure nearly identical to that recorded
by SMU with fine-screened flakes excluded.
Contrasted to these figures, the secondary flake percentage from
the 1982 2 by 2 meter test unit (52.3%) is comparable to the same
percentage from the 1980 excavations in Area A.
In fact, excluding
al I but levels 8, 9 and 10 from the 1982 2 by 2 unit (since these
dense levels may most closely correspond to the Late Prehistoric
levels most heavily sampled by the 1980 Area A excavations) yields a
secondary flake figure of 54.6 percent, nearly identical to the figure
of 55.2 percent from 1980. The 1978 SMU excavations at the site found
relatively similar percentages of secondary flakes in Areas A and B.
As noted in the chapters on laboratory analysis and data
verification, there are marked discrepancies between seasons in the
identification of various platform types. When comparing intra-areal
differences
at the McDonald site, these comp I ications seem to
multiply. The 1978 excavations found greater percentages of cortex
platform secondary flakes in Area A and greater percentages of
multiple facet and crushed platforms 1n Area B with comparable
percentages of single facet platforms in both areas. Comparing the
1980 and 1982 excavations, however, these relationships are reversed.
Area A (represented by the 1980 excavations) has fewer cortex platform
flakes, while Area B (1982) has fewer multiple facet platforms (the
crushed platform relationship appears to hold, but a comparison of the
total figures - 0.8 percent crushed platforms in 1980 with 13.8
percent in 1982 - suggests analytical differences rather than cultural
ones.
Overal I, 366 secondary flakes (13.8%) are recorded as being

sites.

MCDONALD SITE
A total of 208 (7.8%) of al I secondary flakes are thermally
altered. This includes 34 (3.3%) from 1978, 123 (12.6%) from 1980 and
51 (7.8%) from 1980. Both the 1980 and 1982 percentages are quite
close to the tertiary flake figures for thermal alteration and suggest
no essential difference between the two (but see the discussion above
on differences in the primary flake assemblage). No explanation is
offered for the SMU differences.
One comparison does seem to be
consistent.
Peter (1982) notes that thermally altered secondary
flakes (excluding the mislabeled primary/secondary
flakes)
are
slightly more common in Area A (3.8%) than in Area B (2.7%).
Consistent with this is the fact that the 1980 (Area A) percentage of
thermally altered secondary flakes (12.6%) is greater than that for
1982 (Area B - 7.8%).
As at al I Aqui I la Lake sites, chert is by far the most common
secondary flake material type, with 2571 (96.7%) specimens overal I.
Other material types identified include 68 quartzite specimens (2.6%),
4 si I icified wood specimens (0.2%), 7 'chalcedony' specimens (0.3%), 3
hematite-I imonite specimens (0.1%) and 7 specimens of quartz (0.3%).
Chert percentages between the excavation seasons are relatively
consistent, with 97.2 percent chert in 1978, 97.1 percent in 1980 and
95.1 percent in 1980. The slight difference in the latter figure may
be due to a somewhat greater interest in fine-grained quartzites such
as Ogallala chert during the 1982 season, but is probably not a
significant difference in any case.
This latter suggestion is
generally borne out by quartzite percentages from the three seasons.
In 1978, 2.2 percent of the secondary flakes were identified as
quartzite while 1.9 percent quartzite secondary flakes were recognized
1n 1980. In contrast, 4.0 percent of the 1982 flakes were quartzite.
Other material types identified in 1978 include 4 'chalcedony'
specimens
(0.4%) and 2 hematite-I imonite specimens (0.2%).
In
addition to chert and quartzite, the 1980 collection of secondary
flakes includes 4 si licified wood specimens (0.4%), 3 'chalcedony'
specimens (0.3%), 1 hematite-I imonite specimen (0.1%) and 1 specimen
of quartz (0.1%).
Quartz was the only other material type recorded
for debitage in 1982 - 6 (0.9%) quartz specimens were recorded.
No
significant differences have been noted in the areal distribution of
these material types.
Tertiary Flakes (2726 Specimens)
Tertiary flakes comprise 49.5 percent of al I flakes from the
McDonald site. These 2,726 specimens include 1,386 from 1978 (56.4%),
76l from 1980 (42.9%) and 579 from 1982 (45.3%). Possible biases in
the analysis of these types (the inclusion of a fine screen sample in
the SMU collection) have been discussed above and in the section on
data verification. As noted above, the exclusion of the fine-screened

Intrasite variabi I ity in tertiary flake percentages is greatest
in the collection from the 1978 season of excavations. Tertiary flake
percentages from 1978 (for units with sample sizes greater than 75
flakes total) varied between 32.6 percent (in Unit 5) and 67.2 percent
(in Unit 16). On the other hand, no variation in percentage was noted
between the two major excavation areas. Area A yielded 1133 tertiary
flakes in 1978 (56.7%) and Area B 254 flakes (55.8%).
During 1980,
intra-unit variabi I ity was much smaller than in 1978. Tertiary flake
percentages in 1980 (from the three major excavation units) only
ranged from 41.1 percent up to 45.4 percent.
Variation in the 1982 sample is not much different than 1980 when
only the two major units are compared: the 2 by 2 meter test unit
contained 492 tertiary flakes (44.3%) and the occupation surface
excavations contained 87 tertiary flakes (51.5%). When the larger
levels in the test pit are broken down, variabi I ity increases. In the
test unit, tertiary flake percentages range from 35.3 percent (in
level 8) to 57.4 percent (in level 27).
This expanded variability,
however,
1s sti I I less than that encountered during the 1978
excavation season.
As noted previously, there are numerous problems
in
the
comparison of platform types between the three seasons of excavation.
Comparisons between the tertiary flake platform types reveal many of
the same difficulties as found in the secondary flake sample. One
apparent fact emerges: multiple facet platforms are more common on
tertiary flakes, even when cortex platforms are excluded from the
secondary flake group. Single facet platforms are more common on
secondary flakes when cortex platforms are excluded. When they are
not excluded, however, single facet platforms are more common on
tertiary flakes from the 1978 collection.
Variabi I ity between units in the frequency of occurrence of
tertiary flake platform types is greatest in the collection from the
1978 SMU investigations.
Among the larger units, single facet
platform percentages range from 65.9 percent (in Unit 23, Area 8) to
85.2 percent (in Unit 9, Area A). Single facet platforms range from
9.5 percent (in Unit 9) up to 19.4 percent (in Unit 23). Crushed
platforms range from a low of 3.5 percent (in Unit 16) to a maximum of
17.1 percent (in Unit 19).
In general, it appears that there are
significant differences in platform types among tertiary flakes
between the two major excavation areas at the site (at least in the
1978 collection). The higher percentage of multiple facet platforms
in Area B suggests more final stage bifacial reduction and tool
maintenance here than in Area A. Additionally, the higher percentage
38-55

--------------- ----

MCDONALD SITE
of crushed platforms may be an indication of increased use of pressure
flaking in Area B.
Variabi I ity among the three 1980 units with the largest sample
size (N500/W506, N502/W508 and N506/W512} is almost nonexistent,
ranging from 77.4 percent multiple faceted platforms in N506/W512 to
80.6 percent 1n N502/W508.
Single facet platforms show even less
variation, from 19.0 percent in N502/W508 to 20.6 percent
in
N506/W512. Variabi I ity among the two major 1982 excavation units, the
2 by 2 meter test pit and the occupation surface units, is much
greater than in 1980. In the test pit, 37.8 percent of the tertiary
flakes had multiple facet platforms as opposed to only 25.3 percent in
the occupation surface units. Single facet platform percentages, on
the other hand, were comparable, with 40.7 percent in the test pit and
42.5 percent in the occupation surface excavation units. Crushed
platform percentages are also quite similar with 19.7 percent in the
test pit and 17.2 percent from the surface units. Unfortunately, it
appears that the differences between the 1980 and 1982 collections are
due to analytical biases and not strictly comparable.
Ventral platform lips are also highly biased, preventing accurate
comparison between seasons.
Overal I, the data show that I ipping is
more common on tertiary flakes than on either primary or secondary
specimens (Table 38.9}. The 1978 SMU data indicate a slightly higher
percentage of lipped flakes in Area B (8.3%) than in Area A (5.9%).
This is in accord with the suggestion made above that final stage
I ithic reduction and tool maintenance were more common in Area B, if
I ipping is taken as an indicator of soft-hammer percussion. The
percentage of lipped flakes from the 1980 investigations does not
exhibit a great deal of variabi I ity, ranging in the units with larger
sample sizes from 27.8 percent in N502/W508 to 32.8 percent in
N500/W506. Variability in 1982 is somewhat greater, with 30.5 percent
I ipped tertiary flakes from the test pit and 40.2 percent from the
occupation surface excavation units. If the 1980 and 1982 analytical
biases in I ip identification could be taken to be minimal, then the
higher percentage of I ipped flakes from 1982 (and thus Area B) could
On
be taken as support for the same findings from the 1978 SMU data.
the other hand, the overall percentage of lipped flakes identified is
also greater in 1982.
The 1978 data show a greater percentage of thermally altered
tertiary flakes 1n Area A (8.1%) than in Area B (4.7%). If the
comparative data can be regarded as unbiased, then the higher
percentage of thermally altered tertiary flakes from 1980 (12.9%} than
from 1982 (6.9%) tend to support this conclusion.
In terms of the
overal I data on thermal alteration, it should be noted that the 1980
figure for 41Hl105 is higher than the overal I 1980 average while the
1982 41Hl105 figure is lower than the overal I 1982 average.

Tertiary flake material types are predominantly chert, a fact
agreed upon during al I three seasons. In fact, tertiary flake chert
percentages only vary between 97.4 (1982) and 97.7 percent (1978), a
rather remarkable correspondence (Table 38.11). SMU data indicate a
slightly higher percentage of quartzite in Area A (2.0% compared to
0.8% in Area B).
This fact is not confirmed by the 1980 and 1982
figures, although the 1982 McDonald Site tertiary flake quartzite
percentages are wel I below average for the general 1982 identification
of quartzite.

Discussion

Because of the problems with analytical bias in examination of
the materials from this site, it is somewhat difficult to make
cohesive statements about the flake assemblage. Comparisons to other
Aqui I la sites may be useful, however. On the whole, the division into
flake types at 41HI105 (Tables 38.5 and 38.6) para I lels that for the
whole study.
Broken down by seasons, the similarities are not as
obvious. The data from the 1982 season of excavations at the McDonald
site most closely para I lel the overal I 1982 figures, with a slight

Comparison of the 1982 McDonald site data to the material recovered
from the 1982 investigation at 41HI110 shows support for a simple
model that relates flake typology to I ithic technology, i.e., sites
nearer to I ithic resources (such as 41HI110) wi I I have greater
percentages of corticate flakes than sites at some distance from a raw
material source.

McDonald site data to the only other large 1980 data set, the Bailey
site (41HI77), shows I ittle correspondence, and, even more important,
no support for the simple typology/technology model proposed above.
The Bailey site, located on a raw material source, has greater
percentages of tertiary flakes and fewer secondaries than the McDonald

MCDONALD SITE
CHIPS (5890 SPECIMENS)
Chips constitute the most numerous category of debris recovered
from the three seasons of excavation at the McDonald Site. Overal I,
they account for 49.5 percent of al I lithic debris.
The 5890
specimens include 2919 from 1978, 1927 from 1980 and 1044 from 1982.
In Area A, chips are the most numerous type of I ithic debitage, with
4346 specimens accounting for 51.6 percent of al I lithic debris from
that area. Chips are outnumbered by flakes in Area B, where 1,544
specimens only comprise 44.5 percent of the total lithic debitage.
Tables 38.12 and 38.13 i I lustrate the distribution of thermal
alteration and material type by excavation unit. Chert is by far the
most commonly uti Ii zed material for both chips and flakes.
In fact,
overal I there is I ittle difference between chips and flakes in this
respect, with chert accounting for 97 percent of the total flakes and
chert accounting for 97.2 percent of al I chips. The few differences
between the areas of the site are slight.
Chert is slightly less
common and quartzite a little more frequent in Area B. Al I the
rema1n1ng material types account for only about a quarter of the
quartzite tota I .
Thermally altered chips are considerably more common than burned
flakes. Burned flakes account for only 8.3 percent of the total flake
count, while burned chips comprise 15 percent of the chip total.
A
chi-square comparison of this difference yields a test statistic value
of 125.5, significant at the .001 level with one degree of freedom
The significance of this difference is probably
(Blalock 1972:613).
attributable to the fracture off lakes or larger chips in fires rather
than any culturally selective parameter. Thermal alteration is more
common in Area A than in Area B, with 16.6 percent burned in Area A
and only 10.6 percent burned in Area B. It is not clear if this
difference is culturally significant or related to analysis bias,
since the greatest percentages of burned chips are all from the 1980
excavation units located in Area A.
CORES (28 SPECIMENS)
Twenty-eight specimens of debitage were identified as cores from
the three seasons of excavation at the site.
These include 19
specimens from 1978, 3 specimens from 1980 and 6 from 1982. The 1980
and 1982 specimens are from Area A and Area B respectively, while all
but four of the 1978 specimens are from Area A. Table 38.14 shows the
provenience of al I specimens by core type. As is obvious from this
table, multidirectional cores are the most common type (39.3%), as
they are at most sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. Second to this are
the
bifacial
cores
(28.6%),
while
unidirectional
(14.3%),
bidirectional (10.7%) and ninety degree cores (7.1%) together form

less than a third of al I cores from the site.
Al I of the cores
described here are chert (note that several Ogal I ala quartzite
specimens which may have also served as cores are treated as bifacial
tools because of their heavily battered edges). Only one of the
specimens is considered thermally altered under the criteria uti I ized
here (see chapter on laboratory analysis), but a few reddened
specimens with a waxy sheen may have been heated (one each from SMU
Units 3, 16 and 23).
Multidirectional Cores (11 Specimens)
As Table 38.14 shows, these specimens include 3 each from 1980
and 1982, and 5 from 1978 (none of which are from Area 8). These
cores range from very carefully prepared single facet cores with
serviceable material rema1n1ng to heavily uti I ized specimens with
seemingly random flake removals and few, if any, serviceable platforms
rema1n1ng.
These specimens range in size from among the largest to
the smallest at the site, but most are moderate to very smal I in size.
Some of the smaller specimens are certainly exhausted, exhibiting
flake scars so smal I as to be unserviceable for use as blanks.
Several of the specimens, as wel I as various specimens from the other
groups, may indeed be unrecognized abandoned biface roughouts.
Five of these eleven specimens have single facet removals only.
Al I of the remaining cores have both cortex and single facet removals,
and two of these six also have multiple facet removals as well.
Two
specimens
have
unused
platforms
prepared by apparent dorsal
microf lakes isolating a promontory platform. One of these specimens
also show grinding as a platform preparation technique. Al I of the
specimens are chert and none are thermally altered.
Dimensions of
these cores are shown in Table 38.14 and a statistical summary of the
multidirectional cores is shown in Table 38.15.
Unidirectional Cores (4 Specimens)
Two of the four unidirectional cores are from the 1978 collection
(Area A) and two are from 1982 (Area 8). These specimens range from a
tested pebble, with only two cortex facet platform removals from one
side of one end, through a split pebble with platform shaping and a
removal scar along the interior face of the pebble. The other two are
apparently abandoned unidirectional cores with more complex histories.
One flat pebble has two flake scars along its end, with multiple facet
platform
preparation,
thus
making
this
specimen
I iteral ly
bidirectional, although these faceting scars are hardly more than
microf lakes.
This is the only unidirectional specimen which has
another platform type in addition to the cortex platforms which al I
share. Another specimen has several scars running down along the flat

face of a smal I pebble, the last few of which have truncated abruptly
at a fracture plane running perpendicular to the long axis of the
pebble. Al I specimens are chert (the split pebble is a banded yellow
and brown stream pebble gravel).
Dimensions and proveniences are
shown in Table 38.14 and a statistical summary in Table 38.15.
Bifacial Cores (8 Specimens)
Bifacial cores are the second most common core type found at the
site, comprising 28.5 percent of al I cores. Seven of these specimens
are from the 1978 SMU excavations and one from 1982.
The 1978
specimens include four from Area A (one from the profile and the
remaining three from Units 13, 16 and 18) and three from Area B (Unit
23).
The 1982 specimen was part of the smal I concentration of
chipping debris (labeled Feature 5) found in level 28 of N521/W544.
Several of these specimens, including the one from 1982 and the
surface specimen from 1978, are very close to being biface roughouts
rather than cores.
Al I of these specimens have single facet platforms, five have
cortex platforms and three specimens have multiple facet platforms.
One specimen,the only one of the three multiple-facet platform
specimens which does not also have a cortex platform, has a ground
platform surface. Six of these specimens have platform preparation
evidenced by microf lake scars. These cores are shown in Table 38.14
and a statistical summary of their various dimensions is shown in
Table 38.15.
Bidirectional Cores (3 Specimens)
Al I of these specimens are from the 1978 SMU excavations at the
site.
Al I are from·SMU Unit 10 in Area A. As with most of the cores
from the site, al I three of these are manufactured from smal I stream
pebbles.
One or more may actually be very preliminary attempts at
bifacing, abandoned during the early stages. One does have several
flakes large enough to have served as arrow point preforms driven off
from one end. This specimen is the only one which shows any form of
platform preparation, having nibbling on one end. Al I three have both
cortex and single facet platforms and none has a multiple facet
platform.
Tables 38.14 and 38.15 show individual and summary
statistics on these specimens.
Ninety Degree Cores (2 Specimens)
Two ninety degree cores were identified from the 1978 SMU sample.
One of these is from Area A and the other from Area B. The specimen
from Area B is smal I and somewhat questionable as a core, while the

Cores:

Discussion

The 28 cores from the site include a very diverse lot of types
and sizes.
Some of these specimens, perhaps as many as eight, are
somewhat questionable as cores. Three or four of these questionable
specimens are possibly biface roughouts rather than cores (this does
not negate the possibi I ity that several more specimens may also have
been intended as bifaces but abandoned before they had taken any
recognizable shape), and four or five are so smal I as to make their
utility questionable.
Even with the inclusion of these specimens,
however, it is obvious that the McDonald Site has a relatively small
percentage of cores when compared to many other sites in the Aqui I la
Lake area. Flake to core ratios for the major 1978-1982 Aqui I la Lake
sites range from 46:1 at 41HI110 (a figure of 15:1 at the Reps Davis
Site is regarded as potentially anomalous since 14 of the 15 cores at
the sites were collected from the surface - a much greater percentage
than for any other artifact class) to 197:1 at the McDonald Site.
With the exception of the Bailey Site (with a ratio of 138:1), none of
the other sites has a greater flake to core ratio than the 85:1 found
at 41HI109. If the eight questionable specimens were to be excluded,
the McDonald site ratio would be 275:1, wel I above any of the other
sites. Primary I ithic reduction was clearly a less important activity
at the McDonald Site than at many other sites in the lake area. While
the differences are undoubtedly related to site function and the
nature of tool use at the site, it is interesting to note that the
McDonald Site is farther from a lithic source than any other excavated
site in the area. While distances to lithic source areas are usually
measured in much larger increments, it is argued here that the half a
kilometer from the McDonald Site to the nearest source at 41HI119 was
indeed significant in comparison to those sites with I ithic raw
mateials either present on site or within 100 meters.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
A total of 200 specimens of modified debitage was recovered from
the site during three seasons of excavation.
This includes 108

found at al I excavated sites in the project area. Tables 38.16 and

Modified debitage is slightly more common in Area A than might be
expected in comparison to the total amount of debris from each of the
areas. Area A contributes 60 percent of the modified debitage and
70.8 percent of the total lithic debris. When compared to only the
chipped stone tools (unifaces, bifaces, projectile points), the areal
percentages differences vanish.
Area A chipped stone tools make up
60.6 percent of the site total. Similarly, chipped stone tools from
Area B comprise 39.4 percent, almost equivalent to the 40 percent of
modified debitage.

While this
correspondence
suggests
regularities
in
the
uti I ization of expedient tools, the explanation for such regularity is
unclear. The ratio of formal tools to informal tools at the McDonald
Site is 1.2:1. Of the ten other excavated sites in the Aqui I la Lake
area with a sizeable I ithic sample, none are close to this ratio.
With the exception of the lithic workshop sites, 41HI109 and 41Hl110,
with respective ratios of 5.1:1 and 5.8:1, al I of the sites range
between 0.3:1 and 0.8:1. The two higher of the latter group, 41Hl117
with 0.7:1 and 41Hl76 with 0.8:1, are both terrace sites with evidence
of only slight Late Prehistoric occupations and seemingly have I ittle

1n common with the McDonald Site. Nonetheless, the correspondence at
the McDonald Site is remarkable and may indicate that functional
similarities through time brought about regular patterns of formal and
informal tool usage.
On the whole, flakes were preferred to chips for use as informal
tools, probably because chips, defined as broken flakes, are smaller
and less serviceable as tools than the generally larger flakes.
Flakes comprise 61.5 percent of the 200 specimens of modified debitage
and chips 38.5 percent. In contrast, overal I site totals indicate
that flakes only comprise 48.3 percent of the flake/chip debitage
(cores excluded) while chips account for 51.7 percent.
A chi-square
test of the significance of this difference yields a value of 13.66
which is significant at the .001 level with one degree of freedom
This clearly indicates that such preference 1s

not a simple matter of sampling bias.
The actual strength of
preference in choice of flakes over chips for informal tools 1s
potentially even greater when one considers that some of the specimens
recorded as chips in the sample of modified debitage may have been
flakes broken through modification or use.
Among the flakes, secondary flakes were greatly preferred for
informal tool use. with 86 specimens comprising 69.9 percent of the
total modified flake sample of 123 specimens.
The 33 modified
tertiary flakes are only 26.8 percent of the total while four primary
flakes account for a mere 3.3 percent.
A chi-square comparison of
combined corticate (primary, secondary) versus decorticate flakes in
the modified and unmodified sample yields a statistical value of
24.79, significant at the .001 level with one degree of freedom
(Blalock 1972:613). Again, the reason for this preference may be the
generally larger size of secondary flakes. Although there are few
instances of the use of corticate edges, the choice of corticate
flakes for backed edges away from the uti Ii zed edge or for some
unknown hand I ing characteristic cannot be ruled out.
Along with flake type, another important characteristic of
modified debitage is attrition type, which is divided into Type 1 and

Type 2 as wel I as facets that exhibit both (see Chapter 9).
analysis of this characteristic is primarily centered upon the actual
attrition facet rather than the uti Ii zed specimen.
In most cases,
this yields a different analytical total than the 200 actual uti I ized
specimens. Table 38.18 shows the distribution of attrition types by
flake class.
As at most of the Aqui I la Lake sites, Type 1 is the most common
modification, accounting for 59.9 percent of al I specimens. Type 2
attrition accounts for only about a third as many specimens as Type 1,
with 19.3 percent of the total and the combined types account for

about the same amount at 20.8 percent. Of the 215 attrition facets
for which data are avai Iable, 91 (42.3%) are from Area B and 124
(57.7%) from Area A. The facets from Area B include 43 examples of
Type 1 (47.3%), 22 Type 2 (24.2~) and 26 combined types. A total of
86 specimens of Type 1 facets (69.4%) was recovered from Area A, while
19 facets (15.3%) of each Type 2 and combined Types 1 and 2 facets
were recorded. The differences in percentages of attrition types
between the areas are thought to reflect analytical bias rather than
prehistoric preferences.
TYPE 1 ATTRITION
Over the three seasons of excavation, 124 specimens with Type 1
attrition were recovered.
This includes 73 specimens from 1978, 31
from 1980 and 20 from 1982. Overal I, these 124 specimens exhibit 134
separate facets. As is the case with al I specimens, secondary flakes
were the most commonly uti Ii zed blank, and flakes in general were much
more common than one might expect given their distribution at the
site. Ten of these specimens have double facets.
Flakes with Type 1 attrition are predominantly unifacial, with
125 of 129 facets (data from five of the SMU 1978 facets are missing),
or 96.9 percent of the total exhibiting unifacial modification.
A
single facet exhibits bifacial and three facets exhibit combined
bifacial and unifacial wear patterns.

platform (7 - 5.4%) and combined lateral distal (3 - 2.3%) were less
common.
Dorsal surface modification was the most common, with 79
(61.2%) of the total 129 facets represented.
Ventral surfaces were
uti I ized on 36 facets (27.9%) while only 5 facets (3.9%) had a
combination of both. Eight facets (6.2%) were indeterminate.
TYPE 2 ATTRITION
Forty specimens with Type 2 attrition were recovered, exhibiting
42 facets.
These specimens include 17 from the 1978 season, 4 from
the 1980 season and 19 from the 1982 season. Again, secondary flakes
were the preferred blank, but tertiary flakes were much less common
and chips more common than in any other attrition category.
As is the case with Type 1 attrition, unifacial modification is
most common in the sample, present in 32 (78%) of the 41 facets (data
for one of the SMU facets are missing). Although only a single Type 2
attrition facet has combined bifacial and unifacial wear, eight facets
(19.5%) have bifacial, suggesting that Type 2 attrition is more often
representative of cutting activities than Type 1 alone. Although
straight edged facets also predominate in the Type 2 specimens, they
are slightly less common than in Type 1 facets, with only 14 (34.1%)
of the 41 total facets exhibiting straight edges. Convex edges run a
close second with eleven facets (26.8%), while concave edges are
present on only eight
facets
(19.5%).
Both
irregular
and
concave-convex edges are represented by three facets (7.3%) each,
while only two specimens (4.9%) are notched.
Lateral edges are even more common among Type 2 specimens, with
27
(65.9%)
facets.
The
rema1n1ng facets are divided among
indeterminate (7 - 17.1%), distal (4 - 9.8%), and lateral distal (1
2.4%) edges, with edges obi ique to the platform accounting for only
two facets (4.9%). Type 2 attrition is most common on the dorsal
surface, with 22 facets represented (53.7%). As might be expected
with the higher percentages of bifacial wear, more Type 2 than Type 1
specimens
exhibit a combination of ventral and dorsal surface
uti I ization, accounting for 11 (26.8%) of the facets.
Only five
facets (12.2%) were uti I ized on the ventral surface, while three
facets (7.3%) were modified on the indeterminate surface.

38-70

MCDONALD SITE
TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 ATTRITION
The 43 specimens in this category exhibit 57 separate facets.
These include 18 examples from the 1978 season, 5 from the 1980 season
and 20 from the 1982 season. While sti I I the most common flake class,
secondary flakes drop to their lowest percentage in this group, while
tertiary flakes are about twice as common as in any other group.
Chips are less frequent also, totaling only slightly more than the
tertiary flakes.
A total of 45 facets exhibiting combined Types 1 and 2 attrition
comprise the data base (date for 12 facets from the SMU 1978 season
are missing). Facets are primarily unifacial, with 17 unifacial
(75.6%), 2 bifacial facets (4.4%) and 8 combined bifacial and
unifacial facets (20%). Straight edges are the most common, with 20
(44.4%).
Six edges (13.3%) are concave, eight are convex (17.8%),
five are concave-convex (11.1%), three are irregular and three are
notched.
Lateral edges are the most commonly uti Ii zed, with 24
lateral edges (53.3%), 6 distal, 6 lateral distal and 6 platform
(6.7%).
Dorsal utilization is most common in the sample, with 23
dorsal facets (51.1%), 10 ventral facets (22.2%) and 12 combined
dorsal and ventral facets (26.7%).
MODIFIED DEBITAGE:

DISCUSSION

On the whole, unifacial, or scraping facets, predominate at the
site, as they do at every Aqui I la Lake site. A total of 191 of 215
facets (88.8%) is unifacial.
Cutting activities, represented by
bifacial and combined bifacial and unifacial wear patterns, appear on
only 24 facets (11.2%). Straight edges predominate among the scraping
facets, with a total of 80 facets (41.9%), while concave, with 33
facets (17.3%), and convex edges (38

importance.
concave-convex edges, with 10 facets (5.7%), and notched with 9 facets
(4.7%), are of lesser importance. As might be expected, among the
cutting facets, concave edges and notches are absent.
Nine facets
(37.5%) have straight edges, seven (29.2%) have convex edges and
another 6 (25%) have irregular edges. Two facets (8.3%) with combined
bifacial and unifacial attrition exhibit concave-convex edges.
Lateral edges are preferred for scraping activities, with 107
facets (56%), while distal edges (33 - 17.3%) account for less than a
third of this figure. The uti I ized edge was indeterminate on 32
(16.8%) facets.
Only a few informal scraping tools occurred on
combined lateral distal edges (9
4.7%) or edge oblique to the
platform (10 - 5.2%).
Lateral edges occur with about the same
frequency among the cutting edges with 13 (54.2%) of 24 facets, while
indeterminate accounts for the only other sizeable group with 7 facets

(29.2%). Two cutting facets (8.3%) were recorded on an edge obi ique
to the platform while one facet each (4.2%) was noted on the distal
and combined lateral distal edges.

for study. A sixth specimen was recovered from the 1982 excavations
tn Area B.
PERFORATORS (4 specimens)
Four chips and one tertiary flake were unifacial ly modified to
produce perforators.
Each of these smal I implements has a smal I
projection which shows evidence of use on soft materials. Edge damage
on the lateral edges near the base of each specimen is probably the
result of prehension. These specimens do not appear to have been
hafted, but were probably hand held and used in an alternating rotary
action. They most I ikely are hide working tools.
Two of the
specimens, both from Area A (SMU Unit 15, Level 29 and Unit 19, Level
3) have serrated lateral edges and are very similar to the serrated
flakes recovered by Jelks (1961:49-50) at the Kyle Site.
SCRAPERS (2 specimens)
A single end scraper was recovered from the McDonald Site.
This
specimen, of a highly lustrous, possibly heat treated, chert was made
on a secondary flake or chip. Retouch and edge rounding near the base
indicate that it was probably hafted, a common practice on the Plains
during the Late Prehistoric. Wear on the bit, in the form of feather
and step terminated Type 1 attrition, and edge abrasion suggest that
this implement was used on soft or soft medium materials (Ode I I 1980).
A concave side scraper (Fig. 38.lOa) was recovered from the
occupation surface II excavation units in Area B during 1982.
Manufactured on a large, heavy, gray chert secondary flake, this
specimen has several large removals from the dorsal surface forming a
concave edge which was then uti I ized heavily. Wear 1s uni facial on
the ventral surface of the flake.

UNIFACES:

DISCUSSION

Five of the six unifacial tools are interpreted as hide working
implements on the basis of their form and wear patterns. The hide
working activities suggested by the analysis of the modified debitage
and bifaces is further supported by this evidence.
These specimens were not directly associated with one another,
although the two perforators from Area B were in adjacent levels and
were no more than three meters apart. The three specimens from Area A
appear to have come from the upper part of Stratum 3.
The sites in the Aquil la Lake area have yielded only small
percentages of formal unifacial tools; the aboriginal inhabitants of
the area apparently preferring to use unmodified flakes for cutting
and scraping activities. This smal I percentage becomes miniscule at
the McDonald Site, where after three years of investigation and the
recovery of more than 10,000 specimens of I ithic debris, only 6
unifaces were recovered. Even more emphatic is the fact that only two
of these six are scrapers, ordinarily a common type.
To some degree, this paucity of scrapers may reflect the limited
scope of activities at the McDonald Site. On the other hand, a number
of modified flakes from the site represent scraping activities. Since
the vast majority of McDonald Site lithic debris is from the Late
Prehistoric occupations, the lack of formal unifaces may wel I indicate
a decline in the usage of formal, curated tools in preference to
expedient alternatives. An emphasis on expedient technologies has
been suggested for the latter portion (Toyah phase) of the Late
Prehistoric in South Central Texas (Brown 1983:74-78).
Bifaces (148 specimens)
A total of 148 bifaces were collected during the three seasons at
the site. This includes 50 specimens from 1978, 38 of which are from
Area A and 12 from Area B, 53 specimens from the 1980 excavations 1n
Area A and 45 specimens from 1982, al I but one from Area B. The
bifaces were analyzed as a group during 1982 and are presented here
separated into 26 thick and 122 thin specimens. Where possible,
classifications into the 1980 tool forms have been included.
The
latter category undoubtedly includes some medial and distal projectile
point fragments which could not be included with that group.

THICK BIFACES (26 specimens)
Twenty six thick bi faces were collected from the McDonald Site
during the three seasons of excavation. These include 11 from 1978
(al I but one from Area A), eight from 1980 (all from Area A - one was
collected during a return visit to the site in 1981) and seven from
1982 (al I Area B). Fifteen of the twenty six are thought to have been
uti I ized, including eight of the so cal led quartzite chopper tools.
The remaining specimens show no clear evidence of use and are thought
to be pieces abandoned during the lithic manufacture process. Al I but

Thick Bifacial Tools (15 specimens)
Fifteen thick bifacial tools were collected from the site.
This
includes eight specimens from 1978, six from 1980 and one possible
specimen from 1982.
The variation in artifacts included
here
i I lustrates the potential sampling biases inherent in rarer artifact
types even from relatively large overal I samples. Al I of the thick
bifacial tools from the 1980 sample are large quartzite chopper tools.
Only two other possible chopper tools, extremely large specimens from
the 1978 excavations, were recovered from the site.
With the
exception of these two pieces, the 1978 and 1982 specimens are
relatively smal I, bifacial ly reduced chert pebbles, while al I six
specimens from 1980 are large quartzite chopper tools or fragments
thereof. Even the single 1982 specimen, larger, fully decorticate and
with a continuous bifacial edge, is anomalous when compared to the
1978 specimens.
None of the samples by itself, or even two of the
three, would fully characterize the sample of thick bifacial tools
from the site. One wonders what sort of thick bifacial tools would be
recovered from yet another season, or how many seasons would be
necessary to adequately sample the variety present.
As noted above, al I six of the 1980 thick bifacial tools and two
of the 1978 specimens are quartzite chopper tools or fragments. Five
(including both from 1978) are relatively complete specimens, three
specimens with one and two with two battered edges. Al I three
fragments have portions of one battered edge remaining. Al I but one
specimen are of fine grained (Ogallala?) quartzite, while the eighth
is a coarser grained, purplish red quartzite relatively common in the
local Uvalde gravels. Al I of these are thought to be examples of the
quartzite chopper tools that have been found in a number of Aqui I la
Lake sites (41HI109, 41HI110). The function of these tools, some of
which show extensive wear, remains unknown. Informal experimentation
by the senior author with this fine grained quartzite has shown it to
be almost indestructible (and extremely difficult to knap), leaving

only slight wear on a fresh edge after several minutes of battering on
other quartzite and on rolled steel. The number of blows necessary to
generate the extent of wear present on some of the specimens, using
any material softer than rock, is almost inconceivable.
Experimental
battering of bovid long bones showed no visible trace of wear on the
quartzite even after several minutes.
Although the data are not conclusive, it is not I ikely that the
observed wear on these choppers could have been generated in any other
manner than use as some sort of hammerstone against other rock.
Although pecked stone is present in the area (as in the shaped mano
described in the ground stone section below), it is uncommon and this
pecking action does not necessarily require the sharpened edges found
on these chopper tools. One potential function explanation is their
use
as
modified hammerstones, after the fashion described by
Sol I berger (1968:99) for use in more carefully control led percussion
flaking.
Another
possibi I ity
is that they were uti Ii zed in
conjunction with stone anvi Is (unmodified cobbles or even another
quartzite chopper) to sever heavier animal tendons (as wel I as break
bones if necessary). This use combines a need for a sharp edge (but
not necessarily razor sharp) with the wear generated by stone on
stone. In fact, they may wel I have been used for both (as wel I as any
number of other tasks which generated no wear at all). Multiple
functions are supported by the great variation in size and shape.
With respect to their shape, al I but two are easily uti I ized from
either a finger grip which would be more appropriate for use as a
hammerstone or a palm grip probably more useful with a chopper tool.
These two exhibit edge configurations which would make their use
awkward with one of the two grips, each specimen being more suited to
a different form of prehension.
The complete specimens of these chopper tools range in size from
199.2 to 738.2 grams, with the two 1978 specimens being considerably
larger than any of the 1980 specimens (see Table 38.19). The largest
specimen of al I is minimally modified, with one short bifacial edge,
one unifacial edge and pecking along one unmodified natural edge. One
of the 1980 specimens is also minimally modified with intense
utilization along two short bifacial edges. In this latter case, the
edges are so heavily smoothed that it is hard to imagine any use less
than as a hammerstone which could have generated the wear. Two of the
remaining complete specimens have more carefully prepared, longer

rema1n1ng complete specimen, the smallest from 1980, is manufactured
from a cobble fragment and has primarily unifacial battering wear
along one edge.

38-77

MCDONALD SITE
Seven other thick bifaces from the site are thought to be tools,
though
none
fal I into established bifacial categories.
These
specimens include six from the 1978 excavations (al I but one of these
from Area A) and one from 1982 (from the upper occupation surface
excavations in Area B). At least one of the 1978 specimens, with a
pointed ovate form, a medial lump and minimal unifacial use wear, is
probably a rejected bi face blank put to other uses (Fig. 38.lOb).
Many of the others may have been purposefully chipped for the task at
hand, including one specimen with a segment of wel I made bifacial edge
protruding from an otherwise unmodified pebble (Fig. 38.lOc), and two
tiny specimens so thick as to be nearly round and past any hope of
further reduction.
The tool from 1982 (Fig. 38.lOd) is the only fully decorticate
specimen among the thick bi facial tools (or among al I the chert thick
bi faces for that matter). It has slight indentations at either side
of one end that are reminiscent of side notches, but the specimen is
too thick and too poorly formed to imagine it ready for notching. Nor
does it seem to be haftable as is. Wear on this specimen is extremely
heavy in a few spots, tending to rounding of the edge, while absent in
other places. Originally this was thought to be platform preparation,
but careful examination suggests that the existing platforms were
destroyed rather than strengthened or isolated.
Roughout (1 specimen)
This single incomplete specimen from the 1978 excavations 1s
included as a roughout because of its crudely finished edges. Despite
this, it is smaller and thinner than most of the bifacial blanks from
the site.
Although this specimen is the only roughout from the site
(and a somewhat marginal one at that), it is interesting to note that
almost al I of the 1978 specimens would qua I ify as roughouts were they
not tools. It is not clear, however, whether these tools were crudely
chipped expedient items or rejected biface roughout/blanks which were
subsequently uti I ized.
Blanks (10 specimens)
Al I but one of the non tool thick bifacial specimens from the
McDonald Site are classed as biface blanks rather than roughouts,
primarily because of their carefully finished edges.
In fact, many
are as wel I made as the thin bifacial rejects from the site. This
category includes two specimens from 1978, two from 1980 and six from
1982. Both of the 1978 and one of the 1980 specimens are fragments of
larger specimens, about which I ittle more can be said.
One of the
1982 specimens is missing an end but is more than half complete. Two
other of the 1982 specimens were apparently broken during the
excavation, but the fragments form a complete specimen. Forms of
38-78

MCDONALD SITE
these specimens included two circular types (Fig. 38.lOe), two ovate
or sub-elliptical types (Fig. 38.lOf,g), one foliate type (with a
pointed distal end - Fig. 38.lOh), one sub rectangular (the specimen
missing one end) and a strangely shaped half circular form which may
have split in half along a weathered fracture plane, but appears more
likely to have been manufactured as is (Fig. 38.lOi).
Two of the specimens are from the smal I concentration of lithic
debris labeled Feature 5 (Fig. 38.lOg,h). This concentration, also
included a bifacial core whose shape and dimensions are generally
similar to these two specimens.
Flakes and chips of identical
material types to these three specimens (each of which is made of a
different and, fortunately, less common chert type) were found among
the debitage collected from Feature 5 and from the general level
collection from both Level 28 and Level 27 (but none, interestingly
enough, from Level 29 despite the fact that Feature 5 was located only
about three centimeters above the top of Level 29). Four flakes were
refitted onto one of these bifaces, shown in Figure 38.lOh;
none,
however, were from the feature collection. The two largest were from
the same quad and level as the main concentration of the feature,
while one smal I specimen was from the adjacent quad to the south and
another smal I specimen was from the quad and level immediately
overlying the feature.
These specimens show no traces of use wear and are thought to be
rejected attempts to manufacture thin bifacial tools or projectile
points. Al I but one coarse grained quartzite specimen are relatively
crude grainy chert with numerous inclusions and many or al I of these
chert specimens may have been rejected for material flaws.
A couple
of specimens, including the nearly complete fragmentary specimen and
one of the bifaces from the feature, were probably rejected for
technological errors in addition to poor material qua I ity. Rationale
for abandonment of the quartzite specimen is unclear and it may wel I
be an unrecognized thick bifacial tool.
Thick Bifaces:

Discussion

Although biface thickness was not a criterion for separating
specimens at most of the Aqui I la sites, the avai table evidence
suggests that the thick bifaces from the McDonald Site are thinner,
better made and generally less common overal I than at sites adjacent
to I ithic raw material sources. At sites 41HI109 and 41HI110, both
with apparent strong lithic workshop components and both essentially
adjacent to the procurement site, 41HI165, thick
bifaces
are
approximately equal to or outnumber thin bifaces. By the same token,
roughouts outnumber blanks on both of these sites. This suggests that
either initial reduction was carried out at the procurement area or at
some intermediate workshop, or that rejection was a less uti I ized
38-79

option as distance from source material increased.
probably functioned concurrently.

Both strategies

In addition, there are fewer fragmentary thick bifaces at the
McDonald Site than at sites such as 41HI109 and 41HI110. Only one of
nine blanks from these two sites is complete, while ten of eighteen
roughouts are considered complete;
compared to the six out of ten
complete blanks and one fragmentary roughout from the McDonald Site.
Given the much higher ratio of breakage among blank specimens from the
hi I lside workshop sites, it argues for greater care in reduction at
the McDonald Site (and, perhaps, greater care 1n selection of
specimens that would not break).
Another apparent difference between these three sites is the
greater percentage of thick bifacial tools at the McDonald Site.
Thick bifacial tools comprise 57.7 percent of the total thick bifaces
from the McDonald Site, whereas at 41HI109 and 41HI110 they only make
up 11.1 and 26.9 percent respectively. Tool form does not appear to
matter here, as at both the McDonald Site and at 41HI110, quartzite
chopper tools comprise a little more than half of the thick bifacial
tools.
It seems probable that the explanation may I ie again in the
distance from raw material sources. At the McDonald Site, farther
from raw materials, rejected biface blanks were put to use rather than
walk back up the hi I I for a perfect natural blank for some special
tool.
Of special note here are the chopper tools, found at most of the
sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. Whatever their function, they occur
throughout the Late Prehistoric levels in Area A, but not in either
the Late Prehsitoric or Archaic strata of Area B. This may wel I be a
function of sampling error, but is worth noting for future research
with this artifact type.
THIN BIFACES
A total of 122 thin bifaces was collected from the site during
the three seasons of excavation. These include 39 from 1978; 28 of
which are from Area A and 11 from Area B, 45 from the 1980 excavations
in Area A and 38 from 1982, al I but one of which are from Area B. The
thin bifaces have been broken down into three categories:
thin
bifacial tools, Preform I and Preform II categories. Seventeen
specimens are classed as tools, 21 as Preform I and the remaining 84
specimens as Preform II.

38-80

MCDONALD SITE
Thin Bifacial Tools (17 specimens)
This group of thin bifaces includes those whole and fragmentary
specimens which have convincing evidence of utilization; or which,
because of their form, are thought to be completely finished forms
rather than preforms or other unfinished specimens. Where bifacial
forms defined in the chapter on laboratory analysis can be clearly
identified among this group, they are included.
Form 3. Cleburne knife.
One biface fragment (Fig. 38.lla),
missing only its distal portion (snapped off during excavation, but
left in the unit wal I), is considered to be a Cleburne knife, as
defined by Jelks (1962) at the Kyle Site. This specimen was recovered
from near the top of Level 8 in the north wal I of the 1982 2 by 2
meter excavation unit in Area 8. This elevation is approximately
equivalent to that of materials mapped as part of the adjacent
occupation Surface II. This specimen exhibits evidence of utilization
along part of one lateral edge. Use wear is primarily in the form of
edge dul I ing, probably indicative of use with softer materials.
Several other thin biface
basal
fragments
are
possibly
representative of this type, but their incompleteness precludes their
inclusion here. None of these fragmentary specimens shows signs of
ut i I i zat ion .
Form 6.
This group includes one rounded base thin biface
(Fig. 38.llb) which is classified as a Covington knife as defined by
Jelks (1962) at the Kyle Site.
This specimen, from Level 6 of
N506/W512 in Area A (collected during 1980), is 7.0 centimeters 1n
length, 3.3 centimeters in width and 5 mi I limeters thick.
It 1s
extremely wel I crafted, with fine pressure retouch scars and tiny
serrations along the convex blade
edges.
This
specimen
1s
manufactured from a fine grained, very light brown chert mottled with
tiny white spots and larger pinkish discolorations.
There is no
evidence of utilization.
Four other fragmentary specimens, included with the preform I
category below, appear to have similar rounded bases, and may be
examples of the same form. These specimens are not only fragmentary,
but are generally less wel I made than the complete specimen described
above and may be unfinished examples of this type, broken during
manufacture.
None of these fragments shows clear evidence of
uti I ization.
Form 7.
This form group includes one complete
specimen
(Fig. 38.llc) and is possibly represented by fragments of another
similar specimen. The whole specimen is, in many ways, the finest
biface recovered from the site. Long, lanceolate and with a concave

base, it is very carefully made with a near perfect edge.
With the
exception of only a very few specimens, workmanship on this piece is
among the best in the lake area. Low power microscopic examination of
the edges shows slight dul I ing which may be from relatively infrequent
use on soft materials or intentional smoothing.
This specimen is
similar to the Friday knife type as defined at the Kyle Site (Jelks
1962), but is somewhat narrower and longer than his type specimens.
Width of this specimen, at 2.5 centimeters, is equal to the width of
the narrowest Friday knives from the Kyle Site and the length, at 9.9
centimeters, is more than a centimeter longer than the Kyle Site
maximum, 8.8 centimeters. Thickness, at 6 mi I I imeters, is within the
range of the Friday type. This specimen, recovered from between 55
and 60 centimeters below the ground surface in the SMU excavation Unit
15,
has no closely associated temporally diagnostic artifacts,
however. An undecorated body sherd was found in the level below, and
a miscellaneous square stemmed arrow point two levels below. At
approximately the same elevation in the closest 1980 excavation unit
N500/W506, Perdiz, Cliffton and miscellaneous square and round stemmed
arrow point specimens were recovered.
The other specimen possibly associated with this form 1s a
fragmentary medial section which exhibits approximately similar form,
dimensions and qua I ity of workmanship. This specimen was collected by
SMU in 1978.
Unfortunately, the provenience of this specimen is
somewhat questionable, since fragments which are obviously freshly
broken (as by a shovel while digging) and can be fitted back together
are labeled from different levels of different units.
This specimen
is from either SMU Unit 6 or Unit 16. It is not the case that a 1 was
left off of the lot numbers in two fragments, since the original field
and lot numbers of these two units are 20 and 25.
Form 8. One specimen recovered by SMU in 1978 from Level 7 1n
Unit 13 is included in this form category (Fig. 38.lld). Although at
the upper I imit of thickness for thin bifaces (12 mi I I imeters), it is
included here because the lateral edges are wel I formed and the
triangular shape is fairly distinct.
Use wear includes bifacial
microflakes (Attrition Type 1) and rather heavy edge polish or
dul I ing, suggesting utilization with some moderately hard material
such as soft wood.
Form 12. Bi facial Dri I Is.
Eight dri I Is (Fig. 38.lle-k) were
recovered from the McDonald Site. This includes seven manufactured on
otherwise unmodified flakes, and one specimen manufactured on a
Miscellaneous round-stemmed arrow point. One of these specimens was
recovered in 1978, four (including the modified arrow point) were
recovered 1n 1980 and three specimens came from the 1982 excavations
in Area B.
38-83

MCDONALD SITE
Unclassified. Five other thin bifaces show fairly clear evidence
of uti I ization, though none of these can be associated with any
defined bifacial forms. One specimen is from the 1978 SMU excavations
in Area A (actually from the arroyo bank profile), two others from the
1980 excavations and the remaining three from the 1982 excavations in
Area B.
Only one, from 1978, is complete (Fig. 38.111). This ovate
specimen is made from a gray fine grained chert not common at the
site.
One face is almost completely covered by the smooth, flat,
grayish white (calcium carbonate?) cortex; only the lateral edges are
chipped.
Uti I ization is marked by unifacial microf lake scars along
almost half of the lateral edge, with slight edge polish visible in
places. The utilization is on alternate faces, with either end of the
uti I ized edge located on the dorsal surface of the original flake and
the middle section located on the ventral surface.
The four remaining specimens are al I too fragmentary to identify
the exact location of the uti I ization, but one end fragment has
lateral edge wear a centimeter below the rounded distal or contracting
proximal end. One specimen, composed of two fragments, is the medial
section of a well made biface from Level 9 of the main 2 by 2
excavation unit in Area B. This specimen is slightly thicker than
expected (9 mi I limeters), given its narrow width (2.9 centimeters).
Another specimen, from Level 8 of the same unit, is a wel I made
lateral fragment (which includes three fragments) of a relatively
uncommon fine grained black chert. Al I of these specimens show I ight
edge polish with some bifacial microf lake scars. With the exception
of the specimen from Level 9 described above, which has slightly
heavier polish and may have been used on a medium hard material, al I
were probably used on relatively soft materials.
Preform I (21 specimens)
These 21 specimens are defined on the basis of their degree of
reduction.
They are, generally, thinner than 12 mi I I imeters and are
better worked than many of the thick bifaces.
Unlike the more
advanced stage Preform II category, they have edges which are often
slightly sinuous and occasionally irregular. Cross section is also
occasionally irregular. In most cases, the form is not identifiable.
Most of these specimens are thought to represent pieces abandoned
during manufacture because of fracture or some inherent technical
difficulty. In support of this, only three of the 21 are complete and
two of these three are essentially irreducible because of large knots
on one face. No clear reason for abandonment of the final piece can
be given, but it does have a slightly twisted shape which would leave
either a twisted final product or a much smaller one than the
available material might suggest. These 21 specimens include seven

MCDONALD SITE
1982 excavations, four from Area B and one from the aborted unit 1n
Area A.
Only two specimens are identified as belonging to a
previously defined form.
Form 9. These two somewhat thick ovate bifaces, identified as
Form 9 specimens by Watson (1982), have I ittle in common but their
shape. One is complete (Fig. 38.llm); described above as having a
questionable reason for abandonment. The other is fragmentary. Both
are from 1980 excavations in Area A. Neither shows any indication of
ut i I i zat ion.
Unclassified Preform I.
Two smal I complete specimens, both
possibly arrow point preforms, are not classified here. As noted
above, both would be difficult to reduce further. One 1s from 1978
excavations
in Area A (Fig. 38.lln), the other from the 1982
excavations in Area B (Fig. 38.llo). Seventeen fragmentary specimens
are included in this group. One specimen, from the 1978 SMU Unit 8,
is a rounded basal fragment. Another, from one of the 1978 vertical
profiles, is a distal fragment. One other 1978 specimen, from Unit
13, is a medial fragment of what may be a crudely made Cleburne knife
or a preform for one. The remaining specimens are nondescript medial
and lateral fragments.
Preform II (84 specimens)
This group of thin
bifaces
includes
the
remainder
of
non-projectile point bifaces which are not included in Preform I or
described as thin bifacial tools. In general, they are better made,
with less sinuous edges and more regular outlines than the specimens

represent specimens broken during manufacture or discarded because of
other technical flaws. Twenty eight of these specimens were collected
in 1978, 19 from Area A and nine from Area 8 1 33 were collected from
Area A in 1980 and 23 were collected from Area B in 1982.
Only four specimens are complete (Fig. 38.12a-d) 1 although the
reason for abandonment is not clear in any of these cases. The first
two specimens (Fig. 38.12a 1 b), apparently unuti I ized, may be abandoned

preforms, while the latter two complete specimens
(Fig. 38.12c 1 d) are arrow point preforms.
None are identified as

In addition to the four complete fragments, this group contains
at least ten basal fragments, al I but three of which are round to
subrounded. Two of these (Fig. 38.12e,f), and one lateral fragment
(Fig. 38.12g), are perhaps from preforms for, or crudely chipped
examples of 1 Covington knives. Two other bases may be preforms for
either Cleburne or Friday knives (Fig. 38.12h, i).

MCDONALD SITE

Four basal (one actually a basal medial) fragments are relatively
smal I and may be arrow point preforms. Two of these are squarish
(Fig. 38.12j,k), one rounded (Fig. 38.121), and the fourth exhibits
the beginnings of a stem forming notch (Fig. 38.12m). The smaller of
the two square bases (Fig. 38.12k) has what may be the beginning of a
side notch below a lateral snap.
In al 1, unti I the complete
specimens, there are seven probable arrow point preforms, five from
Area Band two from Area A. In addition to these, there are 34 smal I
distal and five smal I medial sections which may be from either
finished arrow points or arrow point preforms. A few of these may be
from smaller bifaces. Besides these there is one smal I fragment which
may be the stem of a smal I round stemmed arrow point.
Nine end fragments and one complete specimen have platforms
remaining.
On the complete specimen, the platform is at the distal
end of the piece while on the apparent stemmed preform fragment
described above, the platform 1s at the base. On the remaining
specimens, the biface end cannot be ascertained with certainty but
five are pointed enough to suggest the distal end and two rounded
enough to suggest a base. Al I of the platforms are cortex.
Thin Bifaces:

Discussion

It is a measure of the emphasis on excavations 1n the upper
component at the McDonald Site that so many of the thin bifaces
recovered appear related to arrow points or their manufacture.
More
than thirty distal bi face fragments are too smal I and too thin to have
been fragments of anything but arrow points, although it cannot be
determined from workmanship alone which, if any, are from completed
specimens. Looking at these 31 specimens, there is a considerable
range of variation in quality of manufacture, spanning the gap from
very crude to very finely made. Eighteen are piano convex in cross
section and most of these are primarily unifacial ly chipped, while the
remaining 13 are lenticular and fully finished bifacial ly.
Most
appear to have lateral snap fractures, suggesting that they were
broken during manufacture.
A number of the remaining thin bifaces are almost certainly arrow
point preforms rejected during manufacture. At least ten fragmentary
specimens definitely belong in this group, having been broken during
manufacture.
One smal I complete specimen is probably too smal I and
too crude to have been worked further.
Another whole specimen is
crudely chipped and too thick and too narrow to finish.
Although only a few of the identified forms present (Friday and
Covington
knives) are recognized as potential Late Prehistoric
diagnostic artifacts, most of the larger thin bifaces are nonetheless

clearly linked to the Late Prehistoric occupation levels at the site.
Only three thin bifacial specimens can be convincingly associated with
the Archaic occupations. Al I three of these are too fragmentary to be
of any diagnostic value.
The paucity of these
specimens
1s
interesting, but they do approximately equal both the number of thick
bi faces (4) and complete projectile points (4) found in definite
Archaic contexts at the site. By contrast, thin bifaces from the Late
Prehistoric levels (80) are approximately equal to the projectile
points (88) but considerably outnumber thick bifaces (22) from that
context.
Projectile Points
A total of 95 projectile points and projectile point fragments
were collected during the three seasons of excavation at the McDonald
Site. This includes al I stemmed bi faces from the site as wel I as
three smal I triangular or foliate bifaces considered to be finished,
unstemmed arrow points.
Al I other unstemmed bi faces and bi face
fragments, including some specimens which may have functioned as
projectile points, have been included 1n the more general bi face
category.
The 95 specimens collected include 12 dart points and dart point
fragments and 83 arrow points and fragments. Ten of the dart points
are relatively complete, while one large specimen is missing its stem
and another is only a smal I fragment of shoulder and stem edge.
Fourteen projectile points are complete and another 14 are nearly so.
In al I, 59 specimens have an intact stem.
ARROW POINTS
Sixty one stemmed arrow points or fragments have complete stems
three triangular points or fragments have complete bases.
and
Nineteen specimens are obviously arrow points (because of the presence
of barbs or partial stems) but are too fragmentary to attempt
identification. Another 43 specimens, included above in the biface
category, are probably the distal ends of arrow points. In addition,
three smal 1, crude, thin bifaces, also discussed above, are probably
arrow point preforms. Thirty specimens were recovered from the 1978
SMU investigations; 19 from Area A and 11 from Area B.
Twenty nine
specimens were recovered from the 1980 TAS excavations, al I from Area
A. The 1982 TAS excavations yielded 24 specimens, al I but one from
Area B. Arrow points from Area A are i I lustrated in Figure 38.13 and
those from Area B in Figure 38.14.

MCDONALD SITE

(Skinner et al. ms.; Watson 1982). As is usual for Texas arrow point
types, stem morphology is a critical variable, but blade morphology
and technological characteristics have also been taken into account.
Type names are from the Handbook of Texas Archeology (Suhm and Jelks
1962).
Alba-I ike Variant I.

(11 specimens)

These smal I specimens are uni ike typical East Texas Alba points
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:263) 1n several ways, but show enough
similarities to justify the type name use.
Basically, they have
triangular blades, wide, outf laring shoulders and squarish stems with
generally para I lel stem edges (Figs. 38.13a-c and 38.14a-h).
Unlike
typical Alba specimens, however, blade edges tend to be straight.
Only one of the specimens in this group has a recurved blade shape.
Stem bases also tend to be much more rounded than typical Alba
specimens from elsewhere, grading into a Perdiz-1 ike contracting stem.
In fact, several specimens from the site fel I into the fuzzy area
between the sharply contracting Perdiz type and the rounded Alba-I ike
type and could not be definitely classified (see Miscellaneous Round
Stemmed below). Al I of the specimens in this group are chert.
Two
specimens, one from each area (and both from 1978), are thermally
altered.
Despite the gray area between Perdiz and Alba-like specimens from
the McDonald Site, the typical Alba-I ike specimens are distinct and
easily separated out. The critica"!Cflagnostic characteristics of this
variant are the broad blade width relative to blade length, short,
squarish base and wide, straight shoulders.
Another distinguishing
characteristic in this particular sample is the high incidence of
primarily unifacial specimens among the Alba-like variants (7 of 11)
and the relative absence of this characteristic among definitely
identified Perdiz points (1 of 13).
This latter is probably an
accident of sampling error since Perdiz points from many sites in
Texas are commonly unifacial or nearly so (Suhm and Jelks 1962:283).
Eight of these specimens are from excavations in Area B, three
from the 1978 season and the remaining five from 1982. The other
three are from Area A, two from 1978 and one from 1980.
In Area A,
there 1s no clear stratigraphic relationship associated with this
type. The two 1978 specimens were found between 50 and 60 centimeters
below the surface, one the only a~row point from SMU Unit 14 and the
other, from SMU Unit 9, overlying one of the untyped square stemmed
points described below. The 1980 specimen from Area A was found at 80
centimeters below the surface in N506/W512 with two other square
stemmed, untyped arrow points, overlain by a Seal lorn point at 75
centimeters and a Cliffton point at 70 centimeters.
38-91

MCDONALD SITE
In Area B, the stratigraphic picture is somewhat clearer, but not
who I ly so.
On this side, these Alba variants generally appear to
underlie Perdiz. Two possible Perdiz--5°pecimens, included here as
miscellaneous rounded stem, are mixed in the Alba-like levels and
another specimen, found at an elevation comparable~ the Alba-I ike
levels, 1s the only diagnostic from SMU Unit 22 at the northern edge
of Area B. They appear to over I ie the three unstemmed arrow points
found in the 1982 excavations and are also apparently mixed with the
Seal lorn and other Alba variants.
Four specimens were recovered
between 70 and 80 centimeters below the surface, two from between 80
and 90 and two more from between 90 and 100 centimeters.
Alba-like Variant II.

(4 specimens)

These four smal I specimens are al I fragmentary. They differ from
the above Alba-like variants in being slightly smaller, with slightly
narrower blades and a smaller blade
width
to
length
ratio
(Figs. 38.13d and 38.14i-k). Al I have concave or recurved blade edges
and slightly rounded, somewhat bulbous stems. Inclusion of these four
specimens as a distinct variant is based on the few morphological
features noted above.
Otherwise they are similar to Variant I
specimens and are apparently stratigraphical ly equivalent. Al I of the
specimens are chert. One, from the 1982 sample, is burned.
Three specimens are from Area B, one from 1978 and two from 1982.
The rema1n1ng specimen is from the 1978 excavations in Area A. In
Area B, they are evenly distributed throughout the Alba-like levels,
while the specimen from Area A, from SMU Unit~ is one of the
deepest arrow points recovered in that area (from 75 to 80 centimeters
below the surface - the same elevation as a Perdiz and Cliffton from
SMU Unit 19, 10 meters northwest).
Cliffton (8 specimens)
Al I of these specimens are flakes whose proximal end has been
bifacial ly worked to various degrees and with minimal, primarily
unifacial modification elsewhere (Fig. 38.13e-I). Al I are apparently
made from loca1 cherts and al I are fragmentary. None are thermally
altered. Al I are from Area A, two from 1978, five from 1980 and one
from 1982.
They range from among the highest to the lowest Late
Prehistoric diagnostics in that area and, where associated with other
point
types
in
the same arbitrary level, it is usually an
unquestionable Perdiz type. One specimen, however, from TAS 1980 Unit
N512/W502 (adjacent to SMU Unit 19 which contained the deepest Perdiz
specimens), was recovered from the same level as a Seal lorn point.
Otherwise, they seem to overlie both Seal lorn and Alba-I ike specimens.

38-92

MCDONALD SITE
Perdiz (13 specimens)
These thirteen specimens demonstrate an extreme degree
of
internal morphological and technological variabi I ity, but on the basis
of one or another characteristic can be relatively securely assigned
to this type (Figs. 38.13m-u and 38.141-o).
The most clear cut
diagnostic feature, of course, is the strongly contracting stem,
present to some degree 1n almost every case. Second to this in
diagnostic value is the presence of wel I defined barbs on most
specimens.
Another defining characteristic in this sample appears to
be the long, narrow blade found on many of the specimens.
Nine specimens are from Area A, five from 1978 and four from
1980. The other four are all from the 1978 SMU excavations in Area B.
They are widely distributed vertically in Area A, but are generally
overlain only by Cliffton and other Perdiz. In only one case, in the
1980 TAS Unit N500/W506, are they overlain by other types, i.e.,
Miscellaneous round and square stemmed specimens. In Area B, they
either overlie or are widely separated horizontally from other arrow
point types.
Perdiz-like (2 specimens)
These two specimens, both from Area A, are a cross between the
Cliffton and Perdiz styles (Fig. 38.13v,w). Like Perdiz points, they
are fully bifacial ly modified with long narrow blades. Uni ike Perdiz
points, however, they have tiny projecting nubs instead of wel I
defined, contracting stems. In one case, a specimen found eroding
from the Area A side of the arroyo in 1982, has one pronounced barb
(the other is broken off) and a rounded base apparently reworked after
the original base snapped off. The other specimen, from the 1978 SMU
excavations, has a calcareous inclusion (cortex?) across the entire
basal portion of the point. Whether the attempt to form a stem was
abandoned because of the non-isotropic properties of the inclusion, or
whether the attempt was made and snapped off is not known. Both are
apparently unfinished or reworked
Perdiz
specimens.
Vertical
provenience is unknown in both cases.
Seal lorn (5 specimens)
These five specimens are relatively divergent in both size and
morphology, the single diagnostic feature being the moderate to
strongly expanding stem (Figs. 38.13x,y and 38.14p-r). In size, these
specimens vary from the shortest projectile point found at the site to
one of the longest. Blade edges are straight to concave. Stem bases
are convex to concave. Blade width/stem width ratio varies from near
3:1 down to just over 1:1.
There are some similarities in stem
morphology, however, among the Area B specimens. In addition, stem

length is greater, both 1n absolute terms and relative to blade
length, than in the Area A specimens. Al I specimens are of chert.
None are obviously thermally altered.
Two of these specimens are from the 1980 excavations in Area A,
while the remaining three are al I from the 1982 excavations in Area B.
These points, which occur between 65 and 75 centimeters below the
surface in Area A and between 70 and 90 centimeters below the surface
in Area B, are not clearly separated stratigraphical ly from other
arrow point styles at the site.
The few specimens recorded here
appear to lie in the middle of the arrow point occupation sequence,
mixed with and overlying the Alba-like styles and possibly mixed with,
and certainly overlain by, Pei=dl'Z types.
Miscellaneous Round Stemmed (10 specimens)
These ten arrow points are a diverse lot, having in common only
their para I lel sided, round based tem (Figs. 38.13z-ee and 38.14s-v).
This stem form is intermediate between the contracting stem Perdiz
style and the squarish stemmed Alba-I ike form. They do not actually
form a type or variant as such, but rather cannot be convincingly
typed in one of the other categories. Most of them are probably
examples of the Perdiz or Alba type, or unfinished versions of these
two types.
One specimen:--included here, has a narrow dri I I I ike
blade. Another specimen, with a slightly bulbous stem and straight
shoulders, is probably an Alba preform, while two other somewhat
crudely chipped specimens ma;--i;e unfinished Perdiz points.
Al I
specimens are chert. None are thermally altered.
Six of these specimens are from Area A, only one from 1978 and
the rema1n1ng five from 1980. The other four are from Area B, one

specimens (probably not I ikely, however), the separation between Alba

identified as Perdiz (equally uni ikely), the separation might be
blurred somewhat.
Miscellaneous Square Stemmed (8 specimens)
Although there is considerable diversity among these specimens,
this category is less of a catch al I than the one above. Although
some of these specimens might be class~f ied as variants of Alba or
Perdiz, they are not truly transitional but generally unique lntheir
long, para I lel sided, square stem (Figs. 38.13ff-i i and 38.14w-z).
The four nearly complete specimens have relatively long, slender
blades with moderately prominent barbs. Craftsmanship is quite good
on most of these specimens.
Stem length and width is somewhat

variable, with the specimens from Area B tending toward a slightly
wider stem.
A couple of these specimens could probably be classed
with the Bonham type, though not al I of them.
Al I specimens are
chert. Two specimens from Area Bare thermally altered.
Four of these specimens are from Area A, two from 1978 and two
from 1980.
The other four are from the 1982 excavations in Area 8.
Their stratigraphic relationship to other types in Area A is unclear,
but in Area B they lie in the intermediate zone, between 70 and 80
centimeters below the surface, near what appears to be the interface
between Perdiz and Alba types.
Miscellaneous Triangular (3 specimens)
Although these three specimens could al I conceivably be preforms
for stemmed arrow points, they are relatively wel I made and appear
finished (Figs. 38.14aa-cc).
In
addition,
their
stratigraphic
position below al I of the stemmed specimens makes them unique. Two of
the specimens are subtriangular while the third, short but unusually
narrow, has a rounded base.
All are chert and none are thermally
altered. Al I three are from Area 8, from between 100 and 110
centimeters below the surface.
Unidentifiable Fragments (19 specimens)
In addition to the above identifiable and/or relatively complete
specimens, 19 specimens are fragmentary and unidentifiable. These
include seven from the 1978 investigations (five from Area A, two from
Area 8), nine from 1980 (al I from Area A) and three from 1982 (al I
from Area B). Almost al I are relatively complete or medial blade
fragments which are missing only the critical diagnostic feature, the
stem. Several of these specimens show some affinities to the Perdiz
type (as defined at this site) because of their distinct barbs, but
nevertheless cannot be unquestionably identified.
One of the most
likely is from the 1978 profile face in Area A. Two others are from
the upper levels of the 1978 2 by 3 Area B excavation unit (above the
highest Alba level).
In addition to these specimens, there are, as
noted abov;:-an additional 20 thin biface fragments, not included
here, which may wel I be the tips, barbs or stems of arrow points.
Because these cannot be definitely identified as projectile points,
they are included in the general category of bifaces.
DART POINTS
Twelve dart points and dart point fragments were collected from
the McDonald Site during the three seasons of excavation. These
include two from the 1978 SMU excavations, four from the 1980 TAS
38-95

MCDONALD SITE
excavations and six from 1982. One of the 1982 specimens is no more
than a fragment of shoulder and stem edge and not identifiable, while
another
specimen,
from
1980,
1s missing its stem and also
unidentifiable. Al I remaining specimens, although they cannot be
unquestionably
associated with a defined type, are potentially
identifiable and described in more detai I below. With the exception
of Godley type points, al I of the identifiable types are represented
by a single specimen.
Bulverde-I ike (1 specimen)
This resharpened specimen (Fig. 38.15a) has a long, wel I made
para I I el-sided stem similar to that of Bulverde and other such
para I lel stemmed types. The basal thinning (almost fluting) of the
stem and the qua I ity of workmanship suggest either Bel I or And ice
types but, lacking the barbs, it 1s difficult to~~make
this
identification.
This specimen is made from a high qua I ity, fine
grained chert and is patinated on both faces. Grinding is present on
both stem sides and base.
This projectile point was recovered from Level 9 of the 1982 2 by
Area B excavation unit, in the middle of the Late Prehistoric
occupation levels. Whether this point 1s identified as a Middle
Archaic Bulverde type (Prewitt 1981) or an Early Archaic Andice
(Prewitt 1981), it is obviously out of place 1n a Late Prehistoric
campsite.
Although some localized m1x1ng of materials could be
expected at most sites, the possibi I ity of
post depositional
introduction of this projectile point into this unit can be ruled out.
Given the current interpretation of the stratigraphy of the unit, a
Bulverde point might be expected at the very bottom of the excavation
unit, 2.5 to 3 meters below its actual location, if not deeper.
An
upward movement of that distance in the dense clays found at the site
would be impossible. Geomorphic and cultural evidence at the site
suggests that the stream energy at this period was insufficient to
have introduced this specimen by flooding. Therefore, this point 1s
interpreted as having been picked up and introduced into the site by
the Late Prehistoric occupants. As wel I as can be determined, this
specimen was resharpened shortly after manufacture rather than several
thousand years later during the Late Prehistoric (judging from the
patination). Curiously, it does not show any sign of reutilization.

Castroville-I ike (1 specimen)
This single specimen, from Level 27 of the 1982 Area B 2 by 2
excavation, has a broad, expanding stem with one broad, deeply notched
barb (Fig. 38.15b). Maximum stem width, at 2.4 centimeters, is at the
lower end of the range I isted by Suhm and Jelks (1952:173). Maximum

blade width is 3.8 centimeters and stem length 1s 1.0 centimeters.
Since the distal end is missing, total length is indeterminate.
Maximum thickness is 0.7 centimeters.
Although one face is relatively wel I made, the opposite face
retains a large patch of cortex which comes right up to one edge.
Given this fact and the snap fracture at its distal end, the specimen
may have been abandoned during manufacture. The Castrovi I le type is
generally assigned to the late Middle or early Late Archaic (Weir
1976).
Prewitt (1981) lists this type as a key index marker of the
Uvalde phase of the Late Archaic. On the other hand, two radiocarbon
dates from charcoal and mussel shel I in this occupation stratum place
this specimen slightly before the advent of the Uvalde phase (2250
B.P.) as dated by Prewitt (1981). The charcoal date from this level
is 2610+40 years B.P. (TX-4813), corrected to between 610 and 865
B.C. (from
Klein et al. 1982), and the shel I date is 2760+60
(TX-4907), corrected to between 795 and 1105 B.C. (Klein et al. 1982).
Dari (1 specimen)
One specimen from Level 17 of the 1982 Area B 2 by 2 meter
excavation unit is assigned to the Dari type (Fig. 38.15c). This
short, wel I made point has a narrow triangular serrated blade beveled
on the right side. Shoulders are moderately prominent and the stem
expands slightly with a slightly convex base. Base and sides of the
stem are ground. It is manufactured from a gray brown chert common at
the site. Total length is 4.1 centimeters, maximum width is 1.8
centimeters and thickness is 0.6 centimeters. Stem length is 1.1
centimeters and maximum stem width is 1.3 centimeters.
Dari points are commonly assigned to the Late or Transitional
1976).
Prewitt (1974) has divided the Dari type into
the early Hoxie type and the much later Mahomet type-.--Given the
stratigraphic placement of this specimen below Late Prehistoric
materials and above the Late Archaic Castrovi lie type, this specimen
is probably best regarded as a Mahomet type, assigned by Prewitt
(1981) to his Driftwood phase of the Late Archaic.
Archa~(Weir

Elam (1 specimen)
This smal I specimen is best identified as representative of the
Elam type (Fig. 38.151d). It was recovered from Level 7 of N502/W508,
just below a specimen of the Miscellaneous round stemmed arrow point
type described above (from Level 6 of the same unit). Two undecorated
body sherds were recovered from the level above and one more from the
level
below this point.
This specimen has a smal I, slightly
asymmetrical, broad triangular blade with moderate outflaring

38-98

MCDONALD SITE
shoulders and a para I lel sided, convex based stem. The stem is not
ground. Length 1s 3.4 centimeters, maximum width is 2.3 centimeters
and thickness is 0.6 centimeters. Stem length is 1.0 centimeter and
width 1.5 centimeters.
Although this type 1s regarded as characteristic of the Elam
Focus of North Central Texas, it cannot necessarily be taken as an in
situ indicator of an Elam Focus campsite underlying the
Late
Prehistoric campsites in Area A. Its singular occurrence close to and
seemingly mixed with Late Prehistoric diagnostic indicators leaves
some room for suspicion.
On the other hand, the Elam Focus is
regarded as a Late Archaic manifestation and Crook and Harris
{1952:30) suggest that the terminal Elam focus is mixed with arriving
pottery elements.
El I is (1 specimen)
This single specimen is the lowest projectile point recovered
from the McDonald Site, found in Level 35 of the main Area B 2 by 2
unit Fig. 38.15e). Found in the screened matrix from this level, it
1s closely associated with the channel gravels thought to mark the
base of the occupation layers. It may also be associated with the
charcoal feature recorded in the level above.
This point has a short triangular blade with short barbs formed
by corners notched from the base. The distal end has been removed,
possibly by an impact fracture. Maximum width is 2.6 centimeters and
thickness is 6 mi I I imeters.
Stem length is 0.8 centimeters and
expands from 1.3 centimeters at the neck to 1.8 at the base. The base
may be lightly ground. Material is a gray brown mottled chert.
Godley {2 specimens)
Two dart points from Area A (one from the 1978 SMU Unit 19 and
the other from the backdirt of 1980 Backhoe Trench C) are classed as
Godley points, as defined by Jelks {1962) at the Kyle Site.
The
specimen from Unit 19 was found at a depth of 85 to 90 centimeters
beneath the surface, the deepest temporal diagnostic artifact from the
SMU excavations, directly underlying a Perdiz and a Cliffton specimen
found at 70 to 75 centimeters below the surface in the same unit. The
elevation of this Godley specimen is approximately equivalent to or
perhaps even slightly lower than that of the Elam point discussed
above.
The smaller of these two specimens, from 1978, has a short,
narrow triangular blade with moderate, upward shoulders (Fig. 38.15f).
The stem expands slightly and the base is convex. It is manufactured
from a light tan fine grained chert and has a portion of cortex
38-99

MCDONALD SITE
remaining on the shoulder and stem neck. The extreme distal portion
is missing, possibly from an impact fracture and a large flake scar
emanating from this snapped end has removed most of one lateral edge
on the ventral face of the point. Maximum width is 2.1 centimeters
and maximum remaining thickness (the impact scar may have removed the
thickest point) is 0.6 centimeters. Stem length is approximately 1.0
centimeter and the stem expands from 1.1 centimeters at the neck to a
maximum of 1.3 centimeters at the base.
The 1980 specimen is larger and heavier, with a short, broad,
triangular blade (Fig. 38.15g).
Blade edges are notably convex.
Shoulders flare outward and down at the ends, forming a sweeping curve
around the stem onto the shoulder, a shape relatively common in
narrow, expanding stem points from the Aqui I la Lake area. The stem is
slightly asymmetrical, with a slightly more pronounced expansion than
the specimen above and a concave base.
It is manufactured from a
speckled, off white grainy chert or fine grained quartzite not noted
elsewhere in the Aqui I la Lake sites. Length of this specimen is 4.7
centimeters, maximum width is 2.7 centimeters and thickness is 0.7
centimeters. Stem length is about 1.3 centimeters and the stem
expands from 1.1 centimeters at the neck to 1.6 centimeters at the
base.
Godley points are common throughout portions of the Central
Brazos region. Jelks (1962) suggested that they were associated with
the Austin focus at the Kyle Site but evidence from the Ham Creek Site
(Forrester 1964) and the Baylor and Britten sites (Story and Shafer
1965) suggest that they may date to the Transitional and perhaps Late
Archaic. A Transitional Archaic date fits very well with the location
of the single in situ specimen underlying Late Prehistoric diagnostic
materials in Area A.
Pedernales-1 ike (1 specimen)
This specimen is from the northwestern quadrant of Level 32 in
the main 2 by 2 excavation unit in Area B. This point (Fig. 38.15h),
somewhat crudely made, has a short, narrow blade with asymmetrical
shoulders (one straight and one rounded upward) and a slightly
expanding, concave based stem. It is manufactured from a speckled
black chert found as a rare raw material type in the Uvalde gravels
observed at the nearby procurement site, 41HI165.
Debitage of this
material was uncommon in some of the surface collection areas at the
nearby 41HI110 but is almost absent from the McDonald Site collection.
Length is 4.1 centimeters, maximum width is 2.1 centimeters and
thickness is 0.6 centimeters. Stem length 1s 1.2 centimeters and
maximum stem width is 1.3 centimeters.

MCDONALD SITE
Although the Pedernales type does occur infrequently in the area
(Jelks
1962:38-40;
Forrester
1964:10,pl.7;
Lynott and Peter
1977:89), this specimen is at the lower end of the size range for
unresharpened pieces and has a basal concavity that is less wel I
defined than is usual in the type (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:235-238).
Although this specimen is really beyond the range of what could
comfortably be included in the Pedernales type (it is closer to the
definition of that type than to any other), it is located one level
above, and very probably associated with, a hearth (Feature 6) dated
to 2850+40 B.P. (TX-4814);
a date which conveniently fal Is within
Prewitt's (1981) hypothesized Round Rock phase (2,600 to 3,400 B.P.),
whose primary key index marker is the Pedernales style projectile
point. Whether this is a crude, local imitation of a Central Texas
style or an attempt to manufacture that style out of low quality local
chert gravels cannot be definitely ascertained, but some suggestions
are made in the concluding chapters of this report.
Untyped Dart Points (2 specimens)
Two dart points from the site cannot be confidently grouped with
wel I known point type.
These include one from the 1978
any
excavations in Area A and one from the 1980 trenching of Area B.
The
1980 specimen was found in the bottom of Trench E in Area B. It has a
broad, triangular blade with beveled and serrated lateral edges
(Fig. 38.15i).
The shoulders flare out in a sweeping curve from the
stem ending in a slight downward curve, much as in the second Godley
specimen described above. The stem expands very slightly and the stem
base is slightly convex. The point is made from a I ight grayish brown
chert relatively common in the lake area. Length of the specimen is
4.7 centimeters, maximum width is 2.8 centimeters and the thickness is
0.6 centimeters. Stem length is 1.2 centimeters and the stem expands
from 1.4 to nearly 1.6 centimeters.
The dimensions of this point and its curved outf laring shoulders
are somewhat reminiscent of the second and larger Godley specimen
described
above,

The previously described specimen has a much better
made blade and more strongly expanding stem. Taking into account its
beveled and serrated blade, this undefined specimen also shows some
affinities to the Dari point identified from Level 17 in the 1982 deep
excavation unit (located adjacent to Trench E). The untyped specimen,
however, cannot be forced into either of these types.
One other nearly complete specimen, m1ss1ng only its distal
portion, was recovered from one of the profiles cut by SMU in 1978.
This specimen has a short, slightly asymmetrical blade with slightly
convex edges, slight barbs and a very slightly expanding stem with a
cortex platform rema1n1ng at its base
(Fig. 38.15j).

manufactured from a relatively common light gray chert. Maximum width
is 2.4 centimeters and thickness is 0.5 centimeters. Stem length 1s
1.1 centimeters and the stem expands from just less than 1.1
centimeters at the neck to more than 1.2 centimeters at the base.
Watson (1982) has noted the similarities of the stem to the
Dawson type (Duffield 1963; Prewitt 1974), but unmodified stem bases
are frequently found throughout the southeastern United States and the
other characteristics of this specimen (i.e., expanding stem, barbs)
do not fit wel I within the Dawson type.
Fragmentary Dart Points (2 specimens)
Two fragmentary dart points were recovered from the McDonald
Site, one 1n 1980 (from 64 centimeters beneath the surface in
N504/W510) and the other in 1982 (from Level 13 in the deep Area B
excavation unit). The former is a large triangular point missing its
stem and extreme distal end; the latter removed by an apparent impact
fracture (Fig. 38.15k).
The point has slight barbs marked by a
reddish discoloration. It is manufactured from an unusual brown
speckled light tan chert not observed anywhere else in the Aquil la
Lake area. It was found near the top of the Late Prehistoric
occupation in Area A and is interpreted as having been picked up and
brought into the site by the Late Prehistoric occupants. Both lateral
edges
show
smoothing, while one edge has infrequent bifacial
microf lake scars and the other relatively intense unifacial attrition.
It is impossible to say, however, if the uti I ization occurred at the
time of its manufacture or at some later period.
The other is no more than a fragment of the lateral edge and
shoulder
of a dart point, hardly enough to classify.
It 1s
manufactured from a reddish brown speckled chert. This specimen may
mark the transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric at the
site, or at least the introduction of the bow and arrow. Although it
could be introduced, as is probable for the Bulverde-I ike specimen in
Level 11, no definite arrow points occur in this or any of the levels
beneath it.
GROUND, BATTERED, SCRATCHED, AND GROOVED STONE
Grinding Stones (6 specimens)
Four artifacts exhibiting ground facets were recovered from the
1978 investigations of the McDonald Site. One specimen from Unit 24
Level 8, a mano, exhibits two flat, polished surfaces. This sandstone
specimen measures 70 mi I limeters in length, 92 mi I I imeters in width,
and is 28 mi I I imeters thick, although approximately 50 percent is
missing.

quartzite. The battered facets indicate that this mano was also
uti I ized as a hammerstone. This specimen measures 76 mi I limeters 1n
length, 60 mi I I imeters in width, and is 44 mi I limeters thick.
The remaining two specimens are portions of grinding slabs
recovered from Unit 6 and an unidentified vertical profile. The
smaller fragment, measuring 180 mi I I imeters in length, 135 mi I I imeters
wide and 45 mi I limeters thick; is made of sandstone. Ground surfaces
appear on both sides of this specimen. The larger slab fragment is of
quartzite ad exhibits only one ground surface. The use of this slab
has produced a concave depression.
This specimen measures 347
mi I I imeters in length, 224 mi I limeters in width, and 35 mi I limeters in
thickness.
One grinding slab fragment of Woodbine sandstone and one complete
mano of granite, a non-local material, were recovered from the 1980
TAS excavations. The grinding slab fragment is too smal I to permit
reconstruction of the original form, but it probably had a basin
shaped grinding surface.
The mano is wel I shaped and sti I I shows evidence of pecking on
its upper surface and edges.
It was recovered from an area of
slumping in the gully which bisects the site, and cannot be directly
associated with the materials from the excavation units.
Hammerstones (6 specimens)
Only two hammerstones, one from Unit 16 (Level 5) and another
from Unit 19 (Level 5) were recovered from the 1978 excavations. The
specimen from Unit 16 exhibits four battered facets whle the other
exhibits only one.
Both specimens are of quartzite. The larger
specimen, from Unit 19 measures 73 mi I I imeters in length,
69
mi I limeters in width, and 41 mi I I imeters in thickness. Its weight 1s
362.6 grams. The other specimen weighs 239.7 grams and measures 61
mi I limeters 1n length, 55 mi I limeters in width and 41 millimeters 1n
thickness.
Three quartzite hammerstones were recovered from the 1980 TAS
excavations.
Two of the specimens are complete and one is a fragment
of a larger implement. The two complete specimens are wel I rounded
quartzite cobbles.
The battering on these implements is confined,
with one exception, to the ends and occurs as localized facets.
The
exception is a somewhat flattened cobble which has an additional area
of bruising on an upper surface, suggesting its use as an anvi I stone.
These specimens are al I of locally available materials and were
probably used for knapping.

MCDONALD SITE
Only one hammerstone was recovered from the 1982 excavations at
the site. This specimen, recovered from Level 8 of N521/W544, is hemi
discoidal in shape with battering wear at either long end.
Five other specimens with battered facets from
the
1980
excavations and two from 1978 have been included with thick bifacial
tools because they had a prepared bifacial edge. The battering wear
on these specimens may wel I have resulted from use as hammerstones.

specimen probably was an abrader for use in dul I ing the edges of thin
bifaces to facilitate pressure flaking. The presence of what appear
to be pigments on this implement suggests that it was also used in
grinding pigments. A second ground stone artifact was recovered from
the 1982 Surface II excavations. This Woodbine sandstone specimen has
at least five deeply incised cross cutting grooves on a single face.
Pigments (7 specimens)
Six pieces of red ocher (hematite) and one piece of yellow ocher
(limonite) were recovered, al I from the 1980 TAS excavations. These
specimens ranged in size from 3.7 by 2.4 by 0.7 centimeters to 1.0 by
0.7 by 0.4 centimeters. The two largest specimens show evidence of
use in the form of flattened and striated facets. The uti I ized pieces
came from Units N500/W506, Level 5, and N506/W512, Level 5. Unworked
specimens were recovered from N500/W506, Level 5, and N502/W508,
levels 5, 8 and 9.

collected in 1982. Al I 127 sherds are included here. The majority of
these came from a single vessel found in Area B, while many of the
rest are from only two or three additional vessels. Because of the
smal I sample size of vessels represented in this collection, the
analysis wi I I be largely descriptive.
Al I but a couple of the 1982 specimens are part of two vessels
from Area B. The analysis of the paste, temper, and surface treatment
of the remainder indicates that between 6 and 15 vessels are
represented by this collection. Given the extreme variation existing
in the known vessels from the site, the lower of these two figures is
probably more accurate.
Despite minor differences 1n paste and
temper, the overal I manufacturing technology uti Ii zed is generally
similar; perhaps al I of the vessels may be contemporaneous.
The most complete vessel, represented by 59 sherds forming a
complete section from base to rim, has cross hatched diagonal lines
extending a short distance down the rim (ca. 8 cm) with a plain body
beneath (Fig. 38.16, Cover).
This vessel, whose flattened, conical
base shape closely resembles specimens i I lustrated in Suhm and Jelks
(1962:23,24), is tentatively identified as Canton Incised.
This vessel was recovered from the Surface II excavation just
east of the main 2 by 2 meter excavation unit 1n Area B. Although
less than half of the vessel 1s represented by the collection of
sherds, the position of the sherds suggests that it may have broken in
place in a midden area on this surface. The circular base was found
lying bottom downwards with the lower body sherds arranged 1n a
slightly disturbed outward flaring pattern around it.
Most of the
lower body sherds were found interior up as if they had not been
disturbed after fal I ing outward from the vessel wal I.
Furthest from
the base were the few decorated upper body and rim specimens from the
vesse I .
Among the sherds from the one vessel (but at the outermost
eastern edge of the scatter) was a single punctated body sherd. This
specimen matched a broken sherd from Level 7 of the N521/W544
excavation unit. During the Surface III excavations (directly beneath
the Surface II vessel scatter), a number of punctated body sherds were
discovered in addition to a fragment of a horizontally incised neck.
Al I of these sherds, in addition to one from the 1980 excavation of
Backhoe Trench E and three from the 1978 SMU Unit 23, are apparently
part of the same Ki am Incised vessel (Fig. 38.17a,b). The only other
sherd recovered from Area B is a very smal I brushed sherd also from
Level 7 of N521/W544.

Other than the sherds from the above two vessels found in Area B,
five decorated sherds were collected from Area A. This includes one
rim (from the 1978 SMU collection) and four body sherds (2 from 1978,
1 from 1980 and 1 collected from the gully wal I in 1982). The rim

(Fig. 38.17c). It is typed as Maydel le Incised (Suhm and Jelks

This specimen is bone tempered. Two other decorated
sherds have diagonal incised I ines (without punctations) and may be
the same vessel (Fig. 38.17d,e).
The inc1s1ons on these

specimens are somewhat cruder than on the sherd described above, but
may also come from a Maydel le Incised vessel. Both are grog tempered.
The final two decorated sherds from Area A are two curvilinear
engraved specimens which do not at first glance appear to come from
the same vessel. One is nearly flat with two para I lel curvilinear

Neither of these can be identified as an established type.
The remaining 29 sherds, from Area A, are all undecorated but,
from an analysis of their paste, temper, thickness, color and surface
treatments, they are grouped into 4 to 12 groups which presumably
represent different vessels. At least some of these specimens may be
the undecorated body portions of decorated vessels, but one plain rim
is included in the collection. The technological analysis consisted
of the characterization of the paste, temper, and surface treatments.

occurring in more than half of the vessel groups. Interestingly, an
analysis of the sherds from the Canton Incised vessel in Area B shows
that the temper is quite variable across the entire surface of the
vessel, ranging from abundant bone in some sherds to none in others.
Sand is the only other apparent tempering material, present in less
than a fourth of the vessel groups.
Whether or not it was an
intentional inclusion is not known.
Interior and exterior colors
range from tan to gray to black.
Again, the variation in both
interior and exterior color on the single partially complete vessel 1s
almost as great as among al I the rest of the sherds from the site. If
the sherds from this vessel did not fit together, it might wel I be
identified as several separate vessels.
Several sherds show evidence of self-slipped or floated surfaces.
In each case, the sherds have dark cores which extend almost to the

layer. This layer is distinct in color and texture from the clay body
and is easily removed to reveal the surface of the darker clay core.
This layer does not, however, cover the larger particles of the clay
body which remain visible on the surface. A microscopic examination
of the contact between the lighter colored surface layer and the
darker core does not reveal a prepared surface such as would be
expected for a true slip. These sherds are therefore interpreted as
having a floated surface which, in conjunction with low firing
temperatures as indicated by the thick unoxidized cores and the soft
clay bodies, produced a thin oxidized surface layer of fine clays
which might easily be mistaken for a slip.
Ceramics:

Discussion

The distribution of ceramics in the McDonald Site suggests that
areas A and B may be discrete occupational units. With only a single
exception, the sherds recovered from Area Bare from a single vessel,
probably Kiam Incised, while those from Area A include sty I istical ly
later MaydeTTe Incised sherds and a large variety of undecorated body
sherds.
The Kiam Incised type is dated to the later part of the span
(A.O. 800-1000), but may be somewhat later, possibly as late as
A.O. 1300 (Story and Valastro 1977). Maydel le Incised is a later type
estimated to have been made between A.O. 1200 and A.O. 1500. The
possibi I ity that the recovery of these two types from different parts
of the site is entirely fortuitous, cannot be ignored. Given the
difficulties of precise temporal placement of types, particularly in
peripheral areas, we cannot preclude the possibility that both types
were deposited simultaneously.
The analysis of this collection leaves the distinct impression
that these ceramics were not produced in the Caddoan area, but
represent a manifestation of the Caddoan ceramic tradition, possibly
using local clays, or else traded from outside the Caddoan area. The
range of clay body colors (dark browns and blacks) and textures is not
typical of those from the central Caddoan region, which tend more
toward the reds and browns.
The implications of East Texas ceramic styles produced from what
may wel I be local Central Brazos clays are most interesting. Do these
vessels represent copies of East Texas trade pieces by an indigenous
population or do they merely represent trade pieces from East Texas
which, for a variety of possible reasons, do not conform to the
typical paste characteristics? The first alternative seems unlikely
because local copies of trade pieces, where they have been documented
archeological ly, generally are only morphologically similar, having
been produced fol lowing the local ceramic technological tradition.

collection merely represents an analogous group of East Texas trade
pieces cannot be evaluated at this time as it would require massive
comparisons of materials which is beyond the scope of this report.
A third alternative is that this collection of materials was
produced by a resident or transient population which shared in the
Caddoan ceramic tradition. These sherds might then be interpreted as
the work of a ful I time resident Caddoan population or a more
transient group from East Texas on a hunting, trading, or resource
procurement expedition. The critical evaluation of these alternatives
is, of course, not possible in the analysis of a smal I collection from
a single site.
IMPRESSED BURNED CLAY
A large quantity of burned clay was recovered from some of the
Late
Prehistoric
occupation
levels
in N521/W544 1n Area B,
particularly Level 12. This material was most common in the southern
half of the unit, adjacent to the apparently burned portion of the
soi I stratum labeled Zone 5. Although this stratum did not show up
during excavation as anything more than a harder and dryer soi I zone,
particularly noticeable in the southern half of the unit, examination
of the wal I subsequently suggested that it may have been some sort of
large burned area, perhaps an aboriginal occupational feature
a
large hearth or burned structure. Size estimates from the portion
excavated in the test unit and its invisibi I ity in the adjacent
backhoe trench indicate a probable size of just less than 2 meters in
diameter.
Because this area was recognized subsequent to
the
excavation, it did not receive a feature number.
Careful examination of the burned clay from this area showed that
a number of the specimens had smoothed, molded surfaces. The variable
thicknesses of these specimens and the fact that they are al I
unifacial suggested that they were impressed daub.
Impressions
observed include primarily concave surfaces, with occasional ridges
separating para I lel concavities. What these are impressions of cannot
be conclusively determined, but the ridged, double concavity specimens
suggest smoothed wooden poles set next to each other in the ground.
Poles (with the bark removed) twisted into the ground would probably
leave such impressions if the ground around them had burned.
The most obvious feature I inked to these fired clay objects is a
structure lined with vertical poles, possibly a habitation. Other
possibi I ities exist, however, including smaller structures intended
for cooking or processing food. Although the estimated dimensions of
38-110

MCDONALD SITE
the burned clay would imply a relatively smal I dwelling, it 1s not
clear if the distribution of the impressed clay para I lels this
exactly. Other types of activities, such as a clay-I ined cooking pit
with impressions of animal meat and bones, might also be reponsible
for the impressions (D.A. Story, personal communication).
In any
case, most of these alternatives suggest the extensive preparation of
an area for cooking and/or habitation, probably indicating
an
occupation period longer than an overnight hunting trip.
Faunal Remains
INTRODUCTION
One of the most valuable aspects of the cultural remains at the
McDonald Site was the preservation of faunal material from the
aboriginal occupation levels. Concentration of the excavations in the
Late Prehistoric occupation areas has yielded a moderately large
sample from that period, but a smal I sample of Archaic fauna I material
was recovered from the 1982 excavations in Area B. Identification of
the faunal material was conducted by Viola Rawn-Schatzinger and this
section is co-authored by her and the senior author of this chapter.
Additional help with the section on cultural modifications was
furnished by Lynn Harrel I. Information on the fauna I remains from the
1978 excavations was furnished by Bonnie Yates of North Texas State
University.
Invertebrate remains from the 1980 TAS excavations were
identified by Rawn-Schatzinger and are reported briefly

remains collected in 1982 1 conducted by Raymond Neck, is reported in
Appendix I and briefly summarized in a subsequent section of this
chapter. Molluscan remains from the 1978 season, previously reported
by Ful I ington (1979), are also summarized here.
The analysis of fauna I materials reported here 1s primarily
concerned with materials recovered from the two seasons of work
performed by the Texas Archeological Survey, in 1980 and 1982.
Where
possible, the 1978 fauna I material, reported in an unpublished study
by Yates (1979), is included. The faunal analyses from these two last
seasons of work, originally performed and written as two separate
tasks, have been integrated here into a single section.
There are,
however, some differences in excavation methodology and analyst
experience between the two seasons of work which may have slightly
biased identifications, but these differences are thought to be minor.
METHODS
The faunal material was identified to species, and m1n1mum
numbers of individuals for each species were calculated. Degree of
burning, butcher marks and other cultural modifications, animal
gnawing, and patterns of breakage were calculated for the total

assemblage. Bone from different horizons was counted to assess
changes in usage of the site through time. Climate and microhabitat
at the site during its period of occupation and deposition were
determined by analysis of the ecological requirements of the species
found.
The vertebrate faunal material was identified with the aid of the
comparative osteological collection of the Vertebrate Paleontology
Laboratory, Texas Memorial Museum, The University of Texas at Austin.
Each bone or fragment was identified and coded to be processed by
computer retrieval.
Computer analysis enabled speedy counts of
numbers of elements, species and minimum numbers of individuals.
Initial collection techniques have biased the sample in favor of
large animals.
The soi I was screened through 1/4 inch mesh which is
insufficient to collect smal I rodent teeth and bones or smal I aquatic
gastropods.
In addition, differences between the dry screening
techniques utilized in 1980 and water screening in 1982 may have
contributed some differential bias to the collection.
ANALYSIS OF SPECIES
Mammals
ARTIODACTYLS
Whitetai I deer (Odocoi leus virginianus) 1s the most common
mammalian species identified during al I three seasons of excavations
at the McDonald Site. A total of 1,268 elements were attributable to
whitetai I deer from the excavations in Area A.
The TAS Area B
excavations yielded an additional 347 identifiable elements. The 1978
SMU excavations recovered a total of 511 elements from both areas.
Indeterminate large mammal bone, which comprises a large percentage of
the collected fauna I material from al I three seasons, is also, in most
cases attributable to Q. virginianus, based on the thickness of the
bone fragments and the number of identified species in that class
found at the site.
Of the vertebrate faunal material from Area A, 11.0 percent was
identifiable deer bones. An additonal 81.9 percent was indeterminate
large mammal. Several means were used to estimate the minimum numbers
of individuals (MNI) of this species in Area A. The most common
identifiable element was the astragalus. A total of 24 complete or
nearly complete astragal i were collected. The astragalus fuses early
in development and is not so useful in indicating age as are teeth or
other bones with slower fusion rates. Of the 24 astragali, only two
were clearly from juveniles. Astragali counts give a minimum number
of 13 adults and one juvenile.

38-112

MCDONALD SITE
Teeth give a better indication of age 1n the Area A deer
population.
The majority of the. teeth recorded as juvenile were
permanent teeth in the process of eruption, very few were deciduous
teeth.
One specimen, a deciduous cheek tooth, indicated a newborn or
fetal deer. The age suggested for the erupting teeth is in the
yearling class, probably between eight and twelve months old. The

classification.
As
previously mentioned, the majority of the
astragal i were completely fused. The distal and proximal ends of the
long bones were wel I developed and nearly ful I sized, but the
epiphyses were sti I I detachable or detached in most specimens.
Vertebrae were also near ful I size and only the lack of fusion of the
vertebral discs suggested immaturity.
Minimum counts of the juvenile teeth indicate a minimum of two
yearlings and one fetal individual. The much larger number of unfused
epiphyses of I imb bones and vertebrae suggest that this is indeed a
minumum.
The teeth were highly fragmented however, and only 37.5
percent of the Area A deer teeth could be identified to age and
symmetry on which to base precise minumum numbers. Nearly al I bones

The mastoids were not easily

a minimum of 15 adult individuals were required to supply the 29 fused

A summary of al I methods of obtaining m1n1mum numbers and age
classification for the Area A deer population (dental and post
cranial) gives 15 adults, two year I ings and one fetal or newborn, for
a total of 18 individuals. The yearling age group suggests a seasonal
use of the site from perhaps late fal I to winter.
Additionally, 13 antler fragments were collected from the TAS
investigations in Area A. These cannot be used to determine numbers
or age of male deer because of their fragmentary nature. They do give
some indication of seasonal use of the site. All the antler fragments
were porous and sti I I in the stage of growth cal led "velvet". As the
velvet or skin membrane of blood vessels becomes dry and shed in the
late fal I and winter, this indicates that the deer were ki I led between
spring and early fal I.
Smith (1975:38) suggests that velvet stage
antlers occur in Missouri deer between May and September.
Although not so common as 1n Area A, whitetail deer also
represent the most frequent mammalian species exploited in Area B.
Identifiable deer bone accounts for only 4.2 percent of al I vertebrate

23.
No deer bones were found in levels 24, 26, 28, 36 and 38. Fifty seven
identifiable deer fragments were scattered on Surface II.
Establishing the minimum number of individuals present in the TAS
excavations 1n Area B is a somewhat simpler matter because of the
smaller sample size. Of the eight calcaneum collected from Area B,
four are right, suggesting an MNI of four individuals. None of the
other collected materials from Area B can be uti I ized to expand this
number.
The deer in the prehistoric occupation levels at Aquil la lake are
much larger than the modern deer found in East Texas and the Edwards
Plateau. This size difference was evident in the width of distal and
proximal I imb bones and the greater size of foot elements.
A single tooth, from Area A, is tentatively assigned to the
pronghorn (Anti locapra americana). The specimen, an upper P4, has a
broken crown, but its length and lateral styles preclude it from a
Odocoi leus. Two other antelope teeth were recovered from the 1978 SMU
excavations in Area A (Yates 1979). This species is not found in the
area today, but historically was occasionally reported.
A total of 146 elements from the 1980 and 1982 excavations were
identified as bovidae (Bos sp.
or Bison bison).
None of the
recovered materials could be unquestionably attributed to bison rather
than cow, but the contexts of al I bovid elements, capped by 50 to 70
centimeters of historic f i I I and associated with Late Prehistoric
materials, strongly suggests Bison bison. The immature individual
found in the uppermost cultural strata in Area B, lying immediately on
top of the upper surface of stratum 4a, (see the section above on site
stratigraphy), is suggested by Watson (1982) as a possible historic
Indian ki I I, includes some of the most convincing bison elements.
Twenty elements were tentatively attributed to bison from the 1978 SMU
excavations (Yates 1979).
Only five elements from the TAS excavations in Area A were
identified as bison (Bison bison). Al I of the 20 bovidae elements
from the 1978 SMU excavations were recovered from Area A, however.
The rema1n1ng 141 bovid elements from the TAS excavations are from

addition to the material identifiable to the species level, the 1980
excavations recovered five extra large mammal bone fragments, three
from Area A and two from Area B, which are probably attributable to
bison because of their size. An additional two such fragments were
recovered from Area A by SMU. Two individuals are identified as Bison

LAGOMORPHS
Leporid fauna from the site comprises the second most numerous
mammalian category. Fifty six elements, equally divided between areas
A and B, were recovered from the 1980 and 1982 TAS excavations. Eight
elements were recovered from the 1978 SMU excavations, five from Area
A and three from Area B. In addition, some part of the fragmentary
bone identified only as smal I mammal may wel I represent lagomorphs.
Three species of lagomorphs have been tentatively identified at
the site, the eastern cottontai I (Sylvi lagus floridanus), the swamp
rabbit S lvi la us aquaticus) and the blacktai led jackrabbit (Lepus
cal ifornicus
Of these three species, the eastern cottontai I, with
38 elements from the TAS excavations and eight from the
SMU
excavations, is the most commonly identified species, fol lowed by the
jackrabbit with 16 elements from the TAS excavations.
Two elements
from Area A are tentatively identified as swamp rabbit, but as Hulbert
(1979) has pointed out, distinguishing between swamp rabbit and
jackrabbit is not always an easy task.
In Area A, the cottontai I, which is represented by a m1n1mum of
three individuals, two adult and one juvenile, is the only vertebrate
species other than the whitetai I deer with more than two individuals.
At least three cottontai Is are suggested for the Area B material.
Although the elements do not support any more than a single jackrabbit
in Area B, an analysis of the provenience of the materials suggests
three groupings which are widely separated stratigraphical ly and which
probably represent at least three separate individuals. Additionally,
one swamp rabbit is suggested in Area A.
Despite the fact that rabbits represent one of the more common
smal I mammals,
and often represent a major food resource 1n
archeological sites, they are somewhat scarce at the McDonald Site.
In continuous or long term habitation sites, rabbit bones may number
in the thousands. However, here the few cottontai I individuals are
widely scattered throughout the site and are not an important
component.
CARNIVORES
A single adult wolf, Canis lupus, 1s represented by a nearly
complete skeleton from the upper levels of Area A. The mandibles and
many of the foot and I imb bones are complete. There is no evidence of
disarticulaton,
butchering or breakage patterns attributable to
dismemberment of a fleshy specimen, and the bones do not show the same
degree of weathering as the other bones from the site. These features
38-115

MCDONALD SITE
indicate that this specimen may post date the cultural accumulation at
the site.
Carnivores are usually rare in archeological sites except 1n
areas where extensive trapping was done. The raccoon, Procyon lotor,
was represented by three bones from Area B. Twenty three bones of a
coyote or dog, Canis sp., were also found in this area. Most of these
represent two individuals found in levels 10 and 12 and in Level 31.
Because of the fragmentary condition of these bones, it is not
possible to determine if the bones are coyote, C.
latrans, or
domestic dog, C. domesticus.
RODENTS
Rodents are sparsely represented at the site. Single individuals
of five species were identified from Area A; the ground squirrel
(Spermophi lus sp.), the plains pocket gopher Geom s bursarias), the
beaver (Castor canadensis , the hispid cotton rat Si madon hispidus)
and the squirrel Sciurus sp.). Spermophi lus and Geomys are burrowing
forms. Sciurus, the gray or fox squirrel, is arboreal. The beaver is
represented by an upper incisor.
Although it might be argued that the low frequency of rodents 1n
Area A is a function of the collection bias, dry screening through 1/4
inch screen, this is contraindicated by both the SMU excavations,
which
included some fine screen samples, and the TAS Area B
excavations, which included water screening and very careful troweling
on the occupation surfaces (where many flakes smaller than the 1/4
inch mesh were recovered). The relatively smal I numbers of rodents
recovered appear to be an environmental or cultural phenomenon rather
than a sampling error.
Single specimens of the common deer mouse, Peromyscus sp., and
the
pocket mouse, Perognathus sp., were found in the Area B
excavations as were three bones of the woodrat, Neotoma sp.
The
usually very common cotton rat, Sigmadon hispidus, was identified by
16 bones.
Four bones were attributed to the
beaver,
Castor
canadensis.
The fox squirrel, Sciurus niger was represented by nine
bones of which six belonged to a single individual in Level 9.
This
very smal I showing of rodents would not be expected at a site which
sustained long term habitation and developed large middens.
Smal I
rodents frequent these areas and become incorporated into the deposit
through natural attrition. While the relative paucity of rodents,
particularly burrowing species, may be indicative of the length of
stay of the McDonald Site occupants, possibly it reflects the
difficulty of burrowing in the compact clayey soi Is at the site.
The 1978 SMU excavations, which utilized some fine screening,
recovered several species of rodents not recognized in the TAS
excavations, but the total number of elements and individuals is sti I I
38-116

MCDONALD SITE
low.
Species recovered from Area A include the fox squirrel (Sciurus
cf. niger), the plains pocket gopher (Geomys cf.
bursarius), the
beaver (Castor canadensis), the white footed or deer mouse (Peromyscus
sp.), the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and the woodrat
(Neotoma sp.). The beaver, the pocket gopher and the cotton rat were
also recovered from Area B, as were specimens of the harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys sp.) and the vole (Microtus sp.). A total of 18
elements were recovered, 10 from the fine screen sample. Elements of
the harvest mouse, the deer mouse and the pocket gopher were only
recovered from the fine screen. Al I specimens have an MNI of one with
the exception of the cotton rat, with three individuals recognized
from left mandibles.
MARSUPIALS
The only other species of mammal recovered from the site 1s the
opossum (Didelphis virginianus), reported by Yates (1979) from the
1978 SMU excavations. Five elements, four from Area A and one from
Area B, were identified. Some of the fragmentary material identified
as indeterminate medium mammal may be opossum. Yates suggests an MNI
of two based on two left ulnas, one immature, from Area A.
Aves
Bird remains are not common in the McDonald Site fauna. Many of
the bird bones recovered may represent incidental inclusions. In
addition to the 20 indeterminate elements recognized from the 1980 TAS
excavations in Area A, three elements were attributed to the wi Id
turkey (Meleagris gal lopavo). Three species were recognized from the
Area B sample.
Two of these species, Anas sp., a duck, and Colinus
virginianus, the bobwhite quai 1, are generaTTy considered edible.
A
single bone of a medium hawk, Buteo sp., was also discovered. Six
other bird bone elements are listed as indeterminate.
Three species
were recognized in the 1978 SMU excavations. One species identified
is the wi Id turkey, represented by two elements from Area A and one
from Area B. Three elements from Area A are tentatively identified as
a crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and one specimen was thought to belong
to the Fringi I I idae family which includes grosbeaks, finches, sparrows
and buntings.
Osteicthyes
The location of nearby streams and their importance as a source
of food is reflected in the high numbers of fresh water mussels and
the aquatic turtles, Chrysemys and Chelydra. Fish remains, however,
are rare.
Scattered gar scales, Lepisosteus sp., and occasional
vertebrae belonging to the catfish and bass families are the only fish
elements present at the site.

38-117

MCDONALD SITE
Fish remains were not extremely common from either of the areas
and are among the least accessible to precise counts of minimum
numbers of individuals. The most common single fish species was the
gar, Lepisosteus sp., represented primarily by scales. The greater
part of the fish bones, mostly vertebra, could not be identified to
species.
In addition to gar, Yates (1979) identified single elements
of the catfish (Ictalurus sp.) and bass fami I ies (Centrarchidae).
No
MNI estimates are made for any of these specimens.
Reptiles
.TURTLES
Aside from the fish, the animals least accessible to precise
counts of minimum numbers of individuals are the turtles. Fragments
of turtle carapace and plastron were scattered throughout the site at
al I
levels.
Many more individuals are clearly suggested than
indicated by precise means of counting symmetrical elements.
The
number of fragments suggests that turtles were uti I ized as a food
resource frequently. The pond slider or river cooter species of
Chrysemys are large turtles which would provide up to several pounds
of meat per individual.
The soft she I I turtle, Tri onyx sp., 1s
somewhat smaller but is considered a delicacy.
Turtles are the second most valuable group of species uti I ized at
the site.
A total of 2799 specimens, mostly carapace fragments, was
recovered from the three seasons of excavation.
This accounts for
13.7 percent of al I fauna I materials, second only to indeterminate
large mammal fragments. This includes 16 identified specimens from
the TAS excavations in Area A and 1092 identified specimens from Area
B. The greater number of identified specimens from Area B is partly a
function of increased analyst familiarity with turtle species between
the 1980 and 1982 seasons, but turtle remains also comprise a greater
portion of the Area B material. Only 326 unidentified specimens were
recovered from the 1980 Area A excavations, while 1257 unidentified
specimens were recovered from Area B. Smal I fragments of carapace and
plastron are often difficult to identify to genus, however.
Of the
turtle fragments, 53.8 percent could not be identified to species.
The genus Chrysemys was easily identifiable by the pattern on the
shel I.
This genus has two common species, .f.:. scripta, the pond
slider, and C. concinna, the cooter. Both species may be represented
in the 897"""turtle fragments found in Area B excavation units. Other
less readily identifiable species were the box turtle, Terrapene
ornata, and the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina.
The soft
shelled turtle, Tri onyx spiniferus, is easily identifiable
but
uncommon.
Both the snapping turtle and soft shelled turtle are less
common than either Chrysemys or Terrapene, and their numbers probably
reflect a normal ecological balance. Terrapene numbers are probably
underrepresented because they are not as identifiable as Chrysemys. A
number of the turtle fragments were found grouped together and several
38-118

MCDONALD SITE
were partially articulated. They may be incidental individuals which
burrowed into the soi I and died of natural causes. The large number
of burned turtle fragments, including some
of
the
partially
articulated specimens, is indicative of their use, however. The
turtles taken together represent an easily obtained and nutritious
food source.
SNAKES AND LIZARDS
Snake vertebrae were not common at the site. Vertebrae of smal I
snakes would not have been picked up by 1/4 inch screen. The material
indicates the presence of at least one species of crotal id (venomous)
snake, and at least one species of non poisonous snake.
In addition to the numerous turtle remains, a few other reptile
remains were found.
Vertebrae and ribs of snakes are not normally
idenftifiable to species;
however, rattlesnake vertebrae may be
identified.
Among the scarce snakes, at least one rattlesnake was
found The distinct skul I bones and dermal horns of one Texas horned
toad, a lizard, Phrynosoma cornutum were discovered in Level 8 of
N521/W544.
Amphibians
Only two amphibian bones were identified. These represent either
a frog or a toad and are probably incidental to the site.
Invertebrate Fauna
Invertebrate fauna I remains were recovered from al I three seasons
at
the McDonald Site.
Differences 1n collection methods make
comparisons of the counts difficult. During the 1980 excavations 1n
Area A, only whole molluscan specimens were saved; whereas in 1982,
al I pelecypod remains and only whole or identifiable gastropod remains
Because of the large number of specimens collected in
were saved.
1982, only a sample of the molluscan fauna was analyzed. This sample,
analyzed by Raymond Neck, is reported in Appendix III. Analysis of
the 1980 molluscan materials was conducted by Viola Rawn-Schatzinger
and is detailed in this section with a summary of Neck's findings.
The 1978 SMU molluscan fauna were analyzed and reported in Fullington
(1979) in the unpublished draft report of the 1978 SMU excavations.
His totals are reported briefly 1n this section.
A total of 6670 specimens of molluscan fauna was identified.
These include 1240 pelecypod and 5430 gastropod specimens. Despite
the differences in sampling and recovery in each of the three seasons
(which
render meaningless any inter-seasonal comparison between
invertebrate fauna! remains and other material from the site), the
relative abundance of gastropods versus pelecypods remains remarkably
constant, suggesting the internal consistency of the samples and the
38-119

MCDONALD SITE
inter-areal consistency of these percentages. Identified mussels and
f i ngerna i I clams range from 17.8 percent of the total sample In 1982
to 19.9 percent In 1978.

during different seasons of analysis.

Percentages are columnar.

The most numerous species collected during all three seasons 1s
the large and relatively easily identified~ pl icata. This species
has more than three times the number of valves as any other species in
the 1978 and 1982 samples, and approximately twice as many as any
other species in the 1980 sample. The dominance of this species was
also noted at the McKenzie Site (41HI115), where it accounts for
nearly 80 percent of al I valves.
Ful I ington (1978) notes that A.
pl icata is the most prevalent species now occurring in Hackberry
Creek. In general, the~ plicata specimens have the largest shel I
size of any of the species represented at any of the Aqui I la Lake
project sites. In contrast to this are estimated live weights (from
38-120

MCDONALD SITE
Parmalee and Klippel 1974 - see Chapter 39 on the McKenzie Site for a
more detailed discussion), which place ~
pl icata wel I
below
estimates for either of the Lampsi I is species or some of the other
large species. Although the estimates may not be completely reliable,
the very thick and low domed~ plicata shel I is not likely to hold
as large an animal as the thinner shelled Lampsi I is species.
In any
case, it is probably safest to assume that~ pl icata was not singled
out for I ive meat size, but was simply the most common species 1n the
creeks.
The second most pro I if ic mussel at the site are the various
members of the genus Lampsi I is, including b,;,_ hydiana and b,;,_ teres.
Altogether these species account for about half of the ~pl icata
total. After these specimens, species belonging to the genus Quadrula
are most numerous.
Most of the other species at the site are
represented by only a few individuals.
Table 38.21 shows the percentages of various terrestrial and
aquatic snai Is recovered.
As at many Texas archeological sites,
Rabdotus sp. are the most common gastropod species, totaling more
than al I other species combined. R. mooreanus specimens recovered
include individuals and clustered groups or pockets of snai Is.
Their
spotty distribution is indicated by the chart of gastropod recovery
from the upper occupation surface excavation units in Appendix III
(III.2).
In addition, the presence of this species appears to be
closely correlated with the prehistoric occupation, at least in Area
B.
A comparison of the total amount of debitage from the deep 1982 2
by 2 meter excavation unit (Table 38.3) with the R. mooreanus totals
from
the
molluscan
appendix
(Table
III.l~ i I lustrates this
correspondence. In addition to the correlation between peaks in
levels 8 through 12, note the corresponding lows in levels 14 and 17
and peaks in levels 20, 27 and 30.
The increasing abundance of M. roemeri, which prefers a woodland
habitat, in the Late Prehistoric levels suggests a developing or
perhaps wel I developed woodland on or adjacent to the site during the
late occupations.
The near absence of this species in the levels
immediately below the Late Prehistoric may indicate a more pra1r1e
environment during the Late Archaic occupations (Neck, Appendix III,
this report). The few specimens of M. roemeri which occur in the
Middle Archaic levels might indicate slightly more mesic conditions
and forested areas near the site. Although the sample of snails is
smal I for any major environmental reconstruction, it is interesting
that this lower portion of the site seems to correspond wel I, at least
in terms of diagnostic indicators, with the mesic period noted along
the Colorado River by Baker and Penteado-Orel lana (1977 - see Chapter
2, this report).

Clam species present at the site do not indicate any major
changes rn the flow regime of Hackberry Creek, but at times in the
past, it may have had a more permanent and perhaps slightly greater
flow. As Neck (Appendix III) points out, the species present indicate
a moderate size stream with flow velocities sufficient to maintain
clear water. The presence of~ gigantea, which Fullington (1978:216;
1979:172) has characterized as a deep water species, at the McDonald
Site as wel I as the McKenzie Site farther upstream on Hackberry Creek,
may indicate the presence of some deep pools along the creek.

38-122

MCDONALD SITE
STRATIGRAPHY
Area A
The internal stratigraphy of the sediments and bones was not
sufficient to divide the 1980 units on the basis of natural events.
Arbitrary units of 10 centimeters per level were excavated. Dating of
levels and length of time of deposition was not determinable. Because
of this, the seasonal use of the site can only be inferred from the
faunal remains.
Tables V.113 and V.114 summarize the total counts of bone and
shel I collected from each level of the 1980 excavation units. They
reveal spatial (horizontal) as wel I as temporal (vertical) changes in
the faunal component of the site. Faunal material is concentrated in
excavation units N503/W506, N502/W508 and N506/W512. The most distant
square, N573/W512, contained only invertebrate remains. The lowest
levels at the site, levels 12-14, contain a smal I amount of fauna I
material, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Fol lowing this I imited
cultural accumulation, a hiatus occurs in which two levels of sediment
yielded no fauna I material. In a normal period of abandonment of a
site, soi I accumulation would be slow and migration of terrestrial
snai Is would occur. The lack of snai Is in levels 10 and 11 throughout
the site suggests rapid sedimentation, perhaps a single period of
flooding.
The amount of faunal material begins to increase in levels 8 and
9 with the greatest concentrations of both vertebrate and invertebrate
specimens collected in levels 4 through 6. The fact that the highest
numbers of invertebrates, particularly the terrestrial snai Is, are
concentrated in the same levels as the vertebrate faunal remains,
further substantiates the belief that the snai Is were scavenging the
organic debris left by cultural occupation. Each level may represent
a long period of deposition, during which cultural use and abandonment
alternated with periods of natural attrition of snai Is and the smaller
vertebrate species.
Collections from backhoe trenches C through F indicate higher
than average concentrations of bivalve she I Is. They may represent
middens where shell was accumulated during short seasonal collecting
periods.
The two partial skeletons for which bone associations can be
made, one deer and one wolf, are both from the uppermost levels at the
site. As indicated previously, the general appearance of the bones
differs from that in the main levels of cultural concentration and
they may post date the cultural association of the other skeletal
material.
The upper levels of sediment and fauna I material may be
much more recent than the main concentrations in levels 4 through 6.

38-123

MCDONALD SITE
Area B
Some bone was found in al I levels from 1 to 38, but numbers
indicate several peaks suggestive of habitation periods. Bone in the
upper levels 1 to 6 was very sparse. This suggests some incidental
material caused by natural animal deaths and some mixing from other
levels.
Excavations on occupation Surface II showed a high concentration
of fauna I material.
A large number of bone fragments were found in
these units. Most of these are related to the 57 identifiable deer
bones. Two adults and one juvenile deer can be accounted for based on
teeth and foot elements. The deciduous deer teeth represent a deer
from approximately 6 months to 10 months in age. No evidence of
antler material was found in the occupation surface units.
A few
antler fragments were found in other levels. The age of the juvenile
deer and the lack of antler material suggest late fal I or early winter
ki I I.
However, the sample is too smal I to rule out the possibi I ity
that al I three individuals are females and the ki I I period could be
late summer or early fal I.
Turtles are heavily represented on Surface II.
Four nearly
complete carapace and plastron of Chrysemys were found in association
in this level. Fragments of snapping turtle were aso identified.
These are both primarily aquatic species and suggest uti I izaton of the
nearby stream.
Rabbit bones were rare throughout the site.
Two theories may
account for this.
The occupation may have occurred at a phase when
the rabbit population was low as, due to disease and predation, rabbit
populations are highly cyclic. Or occupation may have been very short
term for the purpose of butchering and eating the deer and a few handy
turtles, and other hunting for smal I game was not necessary.
Smal I game species of birds, squirrels or carnivores are rare or
lacking on Surface II. The only rodent represented by more than one
bone was the cotton rat, Sigmadon. Sigmadon is a common incidental
species and 1s often found scavenging 1n close association with
humans.
In the adjacent deep excavation unit, N521/W544, a peak of faunal
concentration comes in levels 8 through 12. The faunal material in
these levels can be clearly seen in profile to represent a number of
short term, discontinuous time periods. The bone, shel I and lithic
debris occurs in layers and lenses reflecting the surface topography
at the time of occupation. The sharp decrease in numbers above and
below the levels of occupation suggests a discrete period separated
from
other periods of occupation by deposition of soi I.
The
concentration of bones in these layers and the amount of bone 1n the
deposit suggests repeated short occupations of the site.
38-124

MCDONALD SITE
Of al I the deer bones from the site, 43 percent were found 1n
levels 8 to 12, most .in levels 8 and 9. Antler material was found in
these levels, so some of the deer were males. The antler material was
not in velvet.
The hard, firm antlers are found in fal I when deer
shed their velvet preparatory to the mating season.
Turtles were very common 1n levels 8 through 12, including
Terrapene, Chrysemys and a few Trionyx.
Forty percent of the
unidentified turtle fragments were found in these levels, and these
figures suggest high uti I ization of turtles.
Six bones from an individiual squirrel, Sciurus were found 1n
Level 9. Four bones of rabbit were found in Level 12. These are the
only suggestion of uti I ization of smal I game 1n this extensive
occupation period.
SI ight peaks in fauna numbers can be seen 1n levels 14, 17
through 18 and 30 through 32. These lenses of bone material can be
correlated with peaks in lithic material (see Table 38.3) and are
datable by both interpretation of point types and radiometric dates.
Levels 30 through 32 show an increase in both unidentified bone and 1n
deer. This may represent a early phase of occupation at the site.
Bone is distributed over the site horizontally and vertically,
but 1s concentrated in discrete layers and units as seen in wal I
profiles. Isopacs of the amount of bone, both burned and unburned, by
weight on Surface II (Figs. 38.18 and 38.19), reveal areas of highest
concentration. Note that there are several distinct areas of high
density bone discard, thought to be either processing (primary
deposition) or discard (secondary
deposition)
areas.
It
1s
interesting to note that the distribution of burned bone does not
para I lel that of the total bone weights. Relatively high densities of
burned soi I in the area between the two largest bone concentrations
(i.e., the main concentration of burned bone) may be indicative of a
processing or cooking area, while the bone concentrations themselves
represent discard piles to either side of this area.
ANALYSIS OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL MODIFICATIONS
Area A
Table V.115 lists the numbers of burned bones from the 1980 TAS
excavation units in Area A. Burning was assessed in three degrees,
slightly charred, burned black or charcoaled, and white or calcined.
Most of
the
burned material is represented by fragments of
indeterminate large mammal bone. A total of 3124 bones were burned
(26.3% of the total). Of these, 83.9 percent were slightly charred,
usually I ightly brown on one side or at one end of a fragment.
Only
3.2 percent were burned to a blackened charcoal consistency. White or
calcined bones accounted for 12.7 percent of the burned specimens. As

whitetai I deer was the most common species at the site, it is not
surprising that 47 percent of the identifiable burned bone is of that
species.
An additional 44 percent of the identifiable burned bones
are fragments of turtle carapace and plastron.
Almost none of the
invertebrates were burned (< 1%).
Tables V.116 and V.117 I ist the fracture patterns of the
vertebrate bones collected from the Area A excavation units. In most
cases, the age of the fracture could not be determined. In 755 cases
the bones appear to have been broken while dry. This could have
occurred during occupation of the site after the flesh and grease were
removed from the bone, during the interim since deposition, or during
collection. Green bone or spiral breaks were seen on 331 bones. This
is indicative of breakage of fresh bone caused by striking it with a
heavy instrument. Among the green bone fractures, 97.9 percent occur
in the I imb bones of the vertebrates. This suggests a butchering
technique in which the I imb bones were hacked from the body and broken

proximal and distal ends remaining whole. The distal foot bones were
normally whole or nearly complete. This suggests that the feet were
cut off just above the articulations of the distal tibia and ulna
radius with the metatarsals and metacarpals.
The high degree of
fragmentation and the fact that most burned bone is fragmented beyond
recognition, suggests the bones were broken up for cooking, or shortly
thereafter, for removal of the marrow.
Modifications other than burning and fracture patterns included
whittled and polished bone, usually found together, butcher marks or
cuts left by a sharp instrument, chop and percussion marks left by
blunt instruments, and grooved marks. Chop marks were defined as V
shaped wedges from which the bone was absent.
Percussion marks are
curcular depressions in which the bone is crushed and compressed.
al I metatarsals 1n
Five deer bones are whittled and polished;
varying stages of manufacture to form awls. The metatarsal was first
split lengthwise and the distal portion was whittled and polished off
to a sharp point.
The shallow depression on the inside of the
metatarsal is sti I I visible in al I five specimens and enabled
identification. These are discussed further in the fol lowing section.
Knife cut butcher marks on the bone were the most common cultural
modification found. These probably were formed when the animals were
being disarticulated for easier handling and cooking. The high number
of butcher marks on astragali seen by Yates (1979) in her analysis of
a previous sample from Aqui I la Lake was not observed in this sample.
One astragalus had a deep chop mark. The bones were weathered to some
extent and this may have obscured the tine cuts or butcher marks. One
section of Bison metatarsal had been rounded and was covered with

purposeful modification and not the random cuts left by butchering.
One piece of deer bone was distinctly grooved or notched at one end.
Gnawing marks were uncommon. Gnawing by rodents was identified
on only five bones. Two of these, both heavily gnawed, a phalange and
part of a pelvis, were from a partial deer skeleton found in the upper
levels of the site.
Lack of weathering, as indicated for the wolf
skeleton, was also noted. This deer may have died at the site after
cultural deposition and been exposed to rodent gnawing to a greater
extent than bones deposited during the occupational stages.
Canid
gnawing consisted of circular tooth marks found on two unassociated
bones. The low frequency of gnawing corresponds to the low number of
rodents. Particularly absent from Area A are such conspicuous gnawing
rodents as wood rats (Neotoma) and deer mice (Perymycsus).
However,
their absence in the collection may be a bias of the collection
accounted for by the possibility that burned bone and bone which has
been thoroughly cooked lose much of their flavor and food value.
Area B
Burned bone is an indication of uti I ization of animals by
prehistoric Indians.
Of the bone recovered from the 1982 TAS
excavations in Area B, 20.5 percent showed some sign of having been in

calcined. A smaller amount showed evidence of scorching. Nearly al I
of the bone which showed evidence of burning was fragmented and
unidentifiable. Distribution of the burned bone by weight for Surface
II is given in Figure 38.19 to demonstrate the change in proportions
across the floor.
Over 65 percent of the bones found were fragments unidentifiable
to species.
The identifiable elements were primarily teeth, foot
elements and terminal fragments suggestive of having been broken in
the preparation of food. The burned fragments were particularly smal I
and irregular and much breakage may have occurred during or after they
were burned.
Only two percent of the Area B bone showed definite signs of
spiral or green fracture. Spiral fracture occurs when a fresh bone is
struck with a heavy object. The bone is splintered in such a way that
the marrow can be removed. Al I skul I material was highly fragmented,
suggesting breakage to remove the brains.
Further evidence of uti I ization 1s represented by butchering
marks caused when fleshing out an animal. These appear as thin,
straight cut marks incised into the bone. Much evidence of butchering
is lost is subsequent breakage of the bone and burning. Twelve bones
exhibited butcher marks. Four of these were deer bones and one was a
rabbit.
Others were smal I fragments of large mammal bone, probably
deer. Modified bone from the Area B excavations is listed below.

that the gnawing was done by dogs. This appears to be the case at
least for the majority of gnawed boned found n levels 7 through 12.

evidence of their work. As previously noted, rodents were found in
very smal I numbers at the site.
BONE TOOLS
Seventeen bone tools were collected from the three seasons of
excavation at the McDonald Site. Two of these were recovered from the
1978 SMU excavations, nine from the 1980 excavations and six from
Al I of these specimens are manufactured from deer (or perhaps
1982.
antelope) bone. None are made from bison bone, perhaps not surprising
given the relative infrequency of bison bone at the site. At least
nine different tool forms are represented by this sample.
Tables
38.22 and 38.23 show the breakdown of these specimens by bone element
and tool form.
One of the bone tool specimens from the 1978 SMU excavations is a
smal I, burned and polished fragment of what may be a fish hook
(Fig. 38.20a). It appears to be a portion of the distal corner.
It
is heavily modified from the original bone, rounded and shaped with
striations over most of its rema1n1ng surface.
The bone element
u~i I ized
in its manufacture cannot be identified, but examination of
possible fish hook debitage from the McDonald Site suggests that it
may be from a deer mandible or ulna.
The other 1978 bone tool is a long, rectangular, flattened
section of bone with rounded, spatulate ends (Fig. 38.20b). It is
extremely thin. The original bone element is unidentifiable but it
may be from either the rib or ulna of a deer. Its function is also
unknown (no use wear has been observed), but it is similar in width
and thickness to several fragmentary specimens from the Kyle Site,
some of which have been described as needle fragments (Jelks 1962).
One of the 1980 specimens is a tool shaft fragment (Fig. 38.20c)
made from the anterior middle diaphysis of a deer metatarsal (large
size may indicate mule deer rather than whitetai I, but not bison).
The only modification to the bone is present on the rounded, raised
surface on the medial side of the vascular groove. Modification is in
the form of para I lel striations or shallow cuts oriented perpendicular
to the long axis of bone, roughly grouped into about 10 sets
approximately 0.5 centimeters apart, each set containing at least
three shallow cuts. The cuts are deepest on the higher, raised bone
surface.
Although this tool has been cal led a "rasp" (Watson 1982),
traces of wear do not appear to support this functional label, but the
cause of this modification is sti I I unknown. The wear seems to have
been caused by something pliable being pulled over the bone (as in
"thong stretching").

Another specimen 1s the base and shaft of a used tool made from
the posteromedial quarter of a left deer metatarsal; the proximal
articular surface serves as the tool base (Fig. 38.20d).
The shaft
has been shaped to a tapered form with a round distal cross section,
probably having a pointed tip. The distal portion of the shaft has
some polish and striations from tool manufacture have been smoothed
over on this end, whereas the proximal shaft has less polish and
deeper, rougher striations.
A third bone tool from the 1980 excavations 1s a burned shaft
fragment of used tool, probably made from a quartered metapodial,
judging from the traces on the flattened side and its rounded cross
section (Fig. 38.20e).
Except for the flattened surface, al I other
surfaces are highly polished and any traces of manufacture are
obi iterated.
One specimen from 1980 1s a burned tool tip with tapered outline
made from the diaphysis of a deer ulna (Fig. 38.20f). Traces of
manufacture are present in the form of deep, para I lel striations
oriented longitudinally to the long axis of the bone. Traces of wear
are in the form of abundant, shallow scratches or striations oriented
perpendicular to the bone's long axis and located on the tip's distal
extremity, 0.3 centimeters down the sides of the tip and about 1
centimeter down the edges of the tip.
The character of these
striations may indicate use in a circular, dri I ling type motion.
Also from 1980 are three fragments of a tool shaft with a flat
cross-section, probably made from the lateral wal I of a left deer
metatarsal near the proximal end (Fig. 38.20i). Traces of manufacture
are present in the form of deep, roughly para I lei, longitudinal
striations which have been smoothed over and polished on the higher,
protruding surfaces.
One 1980 fragment is made from a burned antler tine tip
(Fig. 38.20g).
The natural shape of the tine tip has been flattened
slightly (probably from use) and has shallow striations encircling the
tip.
Also, one side of the antler shaft has deep, rough, para I lel,
longitudinal striations which extend from the tip to the broken basal
surface.
One specimen is probably a fragment of the lateral wal I of a left
deer mandible from below the premolars (Fig. 38.20h).
Only one
surface is modified (proximally oriented on mandible, below premolar
1) and the notched, bipointed form suggests that this may be debitage
from fish hook manufacture. However, the surface of the bone is so
deteriorated that traces of manufacture and/or wear blurred.

38-135

MCDONALD SITE
An eighth fragment from 1980 is the base and shaft of a used tool
made from the posterolateral quarter of a left deer metatarsal; the
proximal articular surface is the tool base.
The shaft has been
shaped to a tapered form with a round distal cross section, probably
having a pointed tip (Fig. 38.20j). The tool was burned and has a
high gloss or polish on al I surfaces of the shaft and smoothed bone
wal I edges at the base.
Rough, para I lel, longitudinal striations,
resulting from abrasion in tool manufacture, are present on the part
of the shaft near the base, but these have been smoothed over and
polished on the distal part of the shaft.
The last 1980 bone tool specimen is part of a tool shaft fragment
having only one modified surface, bordered by fractures, probably made
from some deer bone, perhaps a rib. Longitudinal, para I lel striations
are present on the modified surface (Fig. 38.20k).
One of the 1982 bone tool specimens is a complete, used tool made
from
the
distal half of a right tibia of an immature deer
(Fig. 38.20n). The anterior portion of the diaphysis is. absent and
the roughly broken bone wal I edges are smoothed somewhat and polished;
no striations are present, indicating that the bone was not cut or
abraded.
Although the surface of the immature bone is deteriorating
(possibly hiding some wear), the traces of wear that are present
indicate that the bone was probably not modified before use and that
it was not used extensively. This may be an example of Johnson's
(1976) "bone expediency tools".
Another specimen from 1982 is a left deer ulna with tapered tip
outline, shaped at the beginning of interosseous crest (Fig. 38.200).
Wear on the tip is identical to that on the fourth specimen from 1980
discussed above.
One specimen is the tip and shaft fragment from a left deer ulna
which has a spatulate tip outline (Fig. 38.201). Some longitudinal
striations remain from abrasion to shape. Traces of use wear are 1n
the form of shallow, irregular scratches oriented in al I directions,
located on the tip's distal extremity. Harrel I (1983:131-155) found
that this same type of use wear was experimentally produced when
spatulate-tipped deer ulnas were used to presssure flake chert and
obsidian.
A left deer ulna has been modified on the proximal part of the
shaft (Fig. 38.20p).
It has one half of a central oval hole and the
anterior edge has been modified I ike an "awl" but the tip 1s broken
off and there are no traces of use wear. The posterior edge is
similarly modified but with an annular groove cut across its midpoint.
Because of the form of these modifications and the lack of any use
wear, this piece is considered to be debitage from fish hook
manufacture.
An excel lent sequence of photos, i I lustrating fish hook
manufacture, 1s included 1n Webb's (1946:287-290) report on the

excavations at Indian Knol I in Kentucky. Butcher marks (several cut
marks) are present on the posterior surface of the coronoid process.
These, no doubt, were made when ligaments were removed from the ulna
(these are also present in the same place on the specimen described
two paragraphs above).
Yet another specimen is a burned shaft fragment from a deer ulna
tool (Fig. 38.20m).
The large end has been cut (ancill iary cuts
border a clean break), indicating that this piece was intentionally
removed from a tool.
The last 1982 specimen is probably an "expediency tool" (Johnson
1976) made from a posterior diaphysial wal I fragment of a right deer
humerus from near the distal end (Fig. 38.20q). The bone was probably
fractured for marrow and one lateral edge of this piece contained a
fortuitous spiral fracture that was uti Ii zed. Wear is in the form of
bone flake removal from the exterior surface in an area approximately
two centimeters long at one end of the edge and polish occurs down the
adjoining edge of the fracture.
CONCLUSIONS
Area A
The faunal material sampled from the McDonald Site reveals
seasonal use as a hunting and mussel gathering camp. A total of 17
vertebrate and 12 invertebrate species were identified. Three faunal
groups (whitetail deer, turtles and mussels) constituted the primarily
uti Ii zed food resources. By number, fresh water mussels were the most
abundant food source uti I ized, but by weight, deer supplied the
majority of the animal food collected. Burned bone, fracture patterns
and butchering marks reveal that the vertebrates were dismembered by
severing the feet and crushing the major I imb bones during the cooking
and eating processes.
Smal I and medium size mammals and snakes are uncommon at the
site.
The absence of mice and smal I snakes may be attributed to the
size of screen used. The paucity of rabbits and other medium size
game animals may be attributable to hunting efficiency where labor was
more profitably invested in acquiring large game and bivalves than 1n
snaring, netting or hunting lesser fauna.
The fauna as a whole indicates vegetative and edaphic conditions
1n the area very similar to the present day climate: heavily
forrested river terraces with brushy savanna-I ike clearings merging
with grassland at a distance from the creeks. No species identified
are outside of their historic or modern day ranges.

38-137

MCDONALD SITE
The vertical distribution of faunal material at the site suggests
more I imited cultural use at the lowest Ieve Ls than during the
occupations represented by the upper levels. Between lower and upper
levels a hiatus occurs in which sedimentation continued, but neither
natural nor culturally derived fauna I material accumulated, suggesting
abandonment of the site and possible flooding. Accumulation of fauna!
material increases from Level 9 to Level 6 and decreases upward,
thereafter.
The uppermost levels suggest reduced use of the site.
Concentrations of culturally deposited bivalve shel Is in the trenches
suggest specific collecting activities in those areas differing
somewhat from the general hunting camp aspect of the site as a whole.
The limitations of the stratigraphy prevent the precise dating of
each level or recognition of specific cultural horizons. Seasonal use
of the site is suggested by the age populaton structures of the deer
and bivalves.
The most probable periods of use, based on the deer
population, are late summer to late fal I or early winter. Hunting and
mussel gathering activities need not have occurred during synchronous
periods of occupation and the concentrations of bivalves 1n the
trenches tend to substantiate this.
Area B
The faunal material from the second excavation at the MacDonald
Site gives an insight into the stratigraphic nature of the deposit.
The stratigraphic profile correlated' with the relative numbers and
weights of the bone indicate repeated short term occupations. The few
species present in the fauna suggest that deer were brought to the
site to be butchered and eaten. During the time required for this,
turtles and fresh water mussels were brought from the nearby stream.
No extensive hunting for additional smal I game appears to have
occurred during the short occupation periods. The bones of smal I game
such as rabbit, squirrel and raccon tend to appear in higher numbers
at sites which sustained long term occupations. Many of the scattered
bones of reptiles, bird and smal I mammals may be incidental or
represent species which scavenged the site.
Correlations of the layers of faunal materials, the depth of the
deposit of sediments and the I ithic materials indicate that the
McDonald Site was uti I ized over many centuries as an occasional
habitation.
The fauna! material was deposited relatively evenly over
the existing topography and the large middens associated
with
permanent vi I Iages never developed.
The animals found at the site are al I modern species found in the
area historically.
The Texas horned toad and Bison are the only
representatives of the fauna not found there today.
Historically,
Bison were not common in this region of Texas and have been extirpated
in the last 200 years. The range of the Texas horned toad has been

steadily shrinking in the past 25 to 50 years due to destruction of
habitat and disruption of its specific food supply.
During the Prehistoric Period, the deer herds in Texas were kept
1n check by natural predation and primitive hunting. The deer were
larger than their modern descendants which have suffered

Area A/Area B Faunal Materials Comparison
One obvious difference between the fauna from the 1980 Area A and
1982 Area B excavations was in the number of specimens. The Area A
excavation collected 11,852 specimens; the Area B excavation yielded
8442 specimens.
Sixteen percent of the bones were identified to
species from the collections of the first excavation and 18.7 percent
were identified from the second. The slightly higher percentage of
identifications from the 1982 collections was due to bias in the
investigator, who became more proficient in dstinguishing the species
of turtles present. Seventeen vertebrate species were identified from
the 1980 excavation, nineteen from 1982. The number of species from
both excavations is representative of the selectivity of the Indians
who brought most of them to the site. A far larger number of species
inhabits the area:
more smal I rodents and carnivores,
birds,
amphibians, reptiles and fish.
The most important differences 1n the fauna are the specific
identificatons of a single wolf, Canis lupus, and Bison from the 1980
investigation. The partial wolf skeleton was an isolated find. Canid
material from the 1982 excavation was scattered and not identifiable
to species. A few bones are attributed to Bison from the 1982
excavation, but more complete Bison material from the 1980 excavation
was actually taken from Area B, the locus of the 1982 investigations.
The number of deer represented in the first excavation was
significantly higher in both number of specimens and minimum number of
individuals. This difference may reflect merely the greater number of
bones collected or may indicate some differences in concentration in
specific proveniences. In both samples, deer and turtle are the most
abundant species. Smal I game and incidental rodents and species other
than mammals are at a minimum throughout the site.

38-139

MCDONALD SITE
The proportions of burned and culturally modified bone from the
two excavations were fairly consistent. Twenty six percent of the
bone collected in the first sample was burned, compared to 21 percent
from the second. The bone from both samples was highly fragmented and
evidence of purposeful breakage was abundant. Butcher marks, spiral
or green fractures, destruction of skul I material and absence of whole
I imb bones were the rule in both collections.
More specific comparison of the faunas from both excavations can
be made by analyzing the species tables and level information. The
fauna as a whole is homogeneous and shows stable composition and
climatic relationship over a period of hundreds of years. Species not
found in the area today are absent due to modern intervention and not
climatic changes.
The decreased size of the modern deer compared to
the samples taken from prehistoric levels is because of reduced
predation and increased interspecies competition. A more detailed
discussion of the faunal resources and their potential cultural
significance is contained in the concluding chapters of this report.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The McDonald Site, perhaps the most important site investigated
during the Aqui I la Lake project, has provided some interesting
insights into the prehistory of the area. Excavations have shown that
it was occupied as early as about 2850 B.P. (perhaps even slightly
earlier) and intermittently through to the latter part of the Late
Prehistoric Period.
The earliest occupation of the site (at 2850+40
B.P. - TX-4814) is associated with a smal I, crudely made, concave
based projectile point described here as Pedernales-like. Stream
gravels not far beneath this occupation zone indicate that it was
probably on a low bank above the channel of Hackberry Creek. Evidence
from the gastropods suggests that the area was not heavily wooded at
this time, being more akin to a prairie environment. The presence of
a few specimens of the woodland loving snai I, Mesoclan rocmer1, may
indicate adjacent woodlands or sparse trees at the site, however.
Like many of the aboriginal occupation layers at the McDonald
Site, this earliest campsite seems to be a riverine hunting camp,
occupied temporarily for the exploitation of mussels and large
mammals, particularly deer. The near-absence of tools and the smal I
sample of debitage from this level preclude a much more detailed
discussion of the activities conducted at this camp. Discovery of
this occupation stratum does have several important imp I ications for
settlement patterns in the Aqui Ila Lake area. The most important of
these relates to the fact that sites dating to the Middle Archaic
Period seem rare in the Aqui I la Lake area (see concluding chapters).
This discovery suggests a partial explanation for this phenomenon,
i.e., that many of the sites are buried deeply in the floodplain,
beyond the reach of ordinary archeological survey techniques.
38-140

MCDONALD SITE
The recovery of several Pedernales projectile points from the
lake area and the radiocarbon contemporaneous dating of the concave
based specimen from the McDonald Site with Prewitt's (1981) Round Rock
phase suggests some sty I istic affinities with Central Texas at this
time. Nevertheless, even if one could argue on the basis of sty I istic
similarities that there are strong cultural connections between the
two regions (and such an argument would hardly be clear cut given the
morphological distinctiveness of the Central Texas-I ike Middle Archaic
projectile points from the Aqui I la Lake specimens), the absence of
burned rock middens remains problematical. A large enough sample of
sites with Middle Archaic diagnostics has been recorded at Aqui I la
Lake to suggest that it is more than sampling error or simply burial
in the floodplain
that
is
responsible
for
their
absence.
Additionally, one of the key resources, I imestone, is actually present
in smal I strata (ca. 5 to 10 feet thick) which outcrop along the
hi I I sides east of Hackberry Creek. A potentially adequate substitute
(assuming that the use of I imestone does not depend on some special
chemical or physical property of the I imestone itself - see Witkind
1977) in the form of slabs of Woodbine sandstone exists in great
quantity throughout most of the lake area. This may be an indication
that the resource linked to the burned rock middens of Central Texas
1s rare or absent in the Aqui I la Lake area.
An increase in I ithic debitage in Level 30 of N521/W544 indicates
an occupation level but no charcoal or diagnostic artifacts are
available for dating of this layer. Overlying this, in levels 27 and
28 (primarily the former) is another apparent occupation layer, marked
by an increase in debitage and the presence of charcoal and several
formal tools.
These include a projectile point which is tentatively
identified as a Castrovi I le type. Charcoal collected in this level
has yielded a radiocarbon date of 2610+40 B.P. (TX-4813), somewhat
earlier than might be expected for a Castrovi I le point.
Prewitt
(1981) has suggested that the Castrovi I le type is a key index marker
for the Uvalde phase, dated between 1750 and 2250 years B.P.
Morphological variation between this specimen and the classic Central
Texas Castroville type precludes any attempt to suggest that the phase
may have begun earlier in this area or that the basic type was
diffused southward from somewhere to the north.
Above this in N521/W544, occupation zones are suggested by
increases in debitage in levels 19, 20 and 21 and in levels 15 and 16.
A projectile point, identified here as a Dari type, was recovered from
Level 17 of this unit and is proba~ related to this latter
occupation zone. As with the minutely sampled occupations below this
level, little can be said of the activities that occurred at campsites
during these periods. In al I cases, fauna I remains are dominated by
large mammal bones, primarily deer where identifiable.

38-141

MCDONALD SITE
The last and best known occupations of the site occurred during
the Late Prehistoric Period, with extensive areas and deep midden
deposits indicating frequent reoccupations.
Radiocarbon dates from
the Late Prehistoric strata include four from Area B (A.O. 940+70 TX-3168;
A.O. 220+120
TX-4815; - and
TX-3169; A.O. 1170 +70
A.O. 520+70
TX-4905) and one from Area A (A-:-o. 670+540 - TX-3578).
The extreme sigma of the latter date makes it almost useless for
chronological placement of the Area A portion, while the earliest date
from Area B is felt to be an error. This date was run from a large
number of flecks of charcoal gathered over an area of several meters,
a collecting technique obviously subject to a number of potential
disturbing factors.
Association of this date with the uppermost of
the Late Prehistoric deposits in Area Band with a Caddo-like vessel
found at the same level offer support for the erroneous nature of this
date. On the other hand, the mussel she I I date from this same area
(TX-4905) is also somewhat earlier than expected.
Diagnostic projectile points from the Late Prehistoric occupation
zone include Seal lorn, Perdiz and Alba. In Area A there is I ittle
indication of any stratigraphic separation of arrow point styles,
while Area B shows some internal stratigraphic division as wel I as
some clear differences from Area A. The sample of arrow points from
Area B suggests that the Alba type at the site is somewhat earlier
that the Perdiz, and that activities associated with the Perdiz type
were
largely confined to Area A.
This latter observation 1s
particularly true of the manufacture of Perdiz points if one assumes
that the Cliffton type is a preform for the former, since Cliffton
points are absent from Area B.
Differences between the two areas were initially proposed by
Skinner et al. (ms.). In addition to the absence of the Clifton type
from Area B, other subtler differences can be noted in the composition
of the arrow point sample (Figs. 38.14 and 38.15). Area A has a
greater number of Perdiz and Perdiz-like variants, while Area B is
dominated by squarer stemmed specimens, including Alba and many of the
miscellaneous types.
~~
Although the sample of projectile points 1s smal I, the three
triangular specimens from Area B may be indicative of another
difference between the areas.
While these could be preforms for
stemmed arrow points, they occur in the lowest arrow point level (with
the exception of a few tips from Level 11), below al I of the stemmed
points from the site. No triangular forms I ike these were recovered
from the other Late Prehistoric occupation layers in either Area A or
Area B.
The other significant Late Prehistoric diagnostic at the site is
the ceramic artifact assemblage. Most of the sherds recovered from
the site have come from Area B. With the exception of one miniscule
brushed sherd, however, these sherds are al I from two vessels, one of
38-142

MCDONALD SITE
which has been partially reconstructed. The more complete vessel is
typed as Canton Incised~
the other is identified as Kiam Incised.
Both of these types are generally dated in the Mid- to Early Caddo
period, perhaps sometime after A.O. 500 and before A.D. 1200 (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:89-90). Bruseth and Perttula (1981:87) indicate that
Canton Incised occurs in their Early Ceramic period which they suggest
ends around 800 or 900 A.O.
They also note that this type is
associated with Sanders focus sites which are contemporaneous with
their Early Ceramic period but may cover a longer timespan (Bruseth
Story (1981) has included Davis Incised,
and Perttula 1981:89-90).
which she has combined with Kiam Incised, in the Early Caddoan period
at the Davis Site. A radiocarbon date on a trash fi I led pit (F196-11)
containing sherds of Davis Incised and other early ceramics 1s
corrected to A.D. 940 +110.
Although there is a wide range of radiocarbon dates from Area B,
they generally support the suggestion that this portion of the site
was occupied primarily during the Early Caddoan period. The earliest
date from Area B, A.D. 220+120 (TX-4815), may wel I be too old;
although its corrected deviation is between A.D. 40 and 560 (Klein et
al.
1982), the latter is probably more reasonable. A mussel shel I
date from the same area is A.D. 520+70 (TX-4905), corrected to between
A.O.
460 and 645.
Although the corrected ranges of these dates
overlap, the uncorrected one sigma deviation does not. The ranges of
neither of these specimens overlap with the 1978 SMU dates on a
charcoal feature less than 4 meters north of the area where these
dates were collected. Nonetheless, both dates, A.O. 940+70 (TX-3169)
and A.O. 1170+70 (TX-3168), fal I near the end of the -Early Caddo
period.
The- second date is later than what Bruseth and Perttula
(1981) include in their Early Ceramic period.
The ceramics from Area A are somewhat less useful as temporal
diagnostics.
The engraved sherds, while possibly representing the
late~ Engraved, could also be an earlier type.
The vessel typed
here (and originally by Watson, 1982) as Maydel le Incised, also a
later type, is similar to one identified by Bruseth and Perttula
(1981) as Canton Incised.
While the arrow point styles in Area A
suggest that occupation continued longer on this side, the ceramics
from Area A cannot be convincingly associated with either the Early or
Late Caddoan phases. The lack of a good radiocabon date and the
apparent lack of stratigraphy complicate interpretation of this area.
Both areas of the site were occupied and reoccupied a number of
times during the Late Prehistoric Period. The duration of any of
these occupations is difficult to assess, but most or al I of them may
have been ephemeral hunting camps. Although the density of cultural
material within the Late Prehistoric strata is high, suggesting
greater frequency of utilization during this period, this inference
may be comp I icated by geomorphic factors.

increasing presence of M. roemeri, a woodland snai I species, suggests
a developing riverine~woodland habitat, perhaps similar to the one
found at the site today.
Faunal remains indicate that hunting was an important activity at
the site, with deer providing most of the animal calories for the
inhabitants. Turtles provided an important secondary food source, as
did fish (particularly gar) and mussels. Bison bones are present at
the site, but only in the uppermost Late Prehistoric deposits.
In
most cases, where bison bones could be stratigraphical ly isolated,
they were above the main Late Prehistoric occupation strata in Area B.
One badly weathered bison element was recovered from Surface II, or
just below it. The single bison near the top of the Late Prehistoric
deposits in Area B may have been butchered on the spot. This
butchering episode probably took place after the main occupation of
Area B, but perhaps contemporaneous with the latest occupations in
Area A. The few bison bones found below this from both areas are
probably elements carried in from animals butchered at other locales.
Although hunting was clearly an important economic activity,
gathering was probably equally important if not more so in providing a
subsistence base, as it is in many ethnographical ly documented hunter
and gatherer groups.
As noted above, the apparent development of a
wooded environment at or immediately adjacent to the site during the
Late Prehistoric probably provided the occupants with more available
species than adjacent grasslands. Nuts, such as acorns and pecans, as
wel I as fruits, such as wi Id plum, may have been abundant in season.
Faunal remains present clear evidence of mussel gathering from the
earliest occupations, but increasing dramatically during the later
occupations. Ful I ington (1978:216) has indicated the I imitations on
mussels, particularly Amblema pl icata, as a permanent, dependable food
source. Neck (Appendix III) has suggested the possibi I ity that the
apparent decreasing size of clam shel Is throughout the profile, with
only very smal I specimens present in the uppermost levels, may be an
indication of predation pressure or resource depletion, supporting
frequent utilization of the site through time.
In addition to hunting and gathering, the Late Prehistoric
occupations were the locus of stone tool manufacturing, although
perhaps not as frequently as at sites nearer to material sources. The
38-144

•

MCDONALD SITE
frequency of both cores and bifaces is somewhat less at the McDonald
Site than at many other sites in the lake area, particulary sites such
as 41HI109 and 41HI110. A greater part of the debris discarded at the
McDonald Site is thought to be after use rather
than
after
manufacturing failures, with the apparent exception of arrow points.
The bi face category, as wel I as the projectile point category, contain
a number of specimens broken during manufacture. Excluding these
specimens, a greater number of bifaces show signs of utilization than
at many other sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. This high percentage of
tools seems to be supported by the relative frequency of modified
debitage present at the site.
Although the presence of decorated ceramics seems somewhat
atypical for a short term hunting camp, the evidence from Area B
suggests that a I imited number of vessels were present.
The Area B
ceramics, however, also offer the best evidence for longer term or, at
least more frequent, occupation of the site. Excavation of the 1982 2
by 2 meter test pit in this area (N521/W544) yielded only a very few
sherds, matching the sparse collection from previous SMU units and TAS
backhoe trenches.
Excavation of more than ten square meters of
Surface II yielded none at al I unti I reaching the square just east of
the northeast corner of N521/W544 where a large portion of a single
vessel was discovered. This vessel, typed as Canton Incised appeared
to have broken in place. Most of the base and a portion of the upper
section were present in the area excavated. Excavation of the Surface
III unit directly beneath this unit yielded a second vessel, typed
here as Kiam Incised, which is less complete. The separation between
these two vessels was emphasized by an apparent smal I stratum (ca. 2
- 3 cm) of sterile fi I I between.
Although a few of the outlying
sherds from both vessels were stratigraphical ly mixed, the evidence
indicates that these two vessels were broken and left in exactly the
same spot with a short period of time separating the two discard
events. Whether this hiatus was simply days or months cannot be
determined.

CHAPTER 39
THE MCKENZIE SITE - 41Hl115

David 0. Brown
SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is on the right (west) bank of Hackberry Creek more
than a kilometer upstream from its confluence with Jack's Branch. The
site is exposed in the bank of a deep gully in the floodplain, twenty
meters north of the confluence of the gully with Hackberry Creek.
Elevation of the floodplain at this point is about 162 meters MSL.
Because it is deeply buried, the site area is difficult to ascertain,
but a minimum area of 20 by 20 meters is suggested.
A map of the
general area of the site is shown in Figure 39.1.
The site is located just upstream from a natural choke where
Hackberry Creek 1s constricted by upland or high terrace remnants.
Upstream from this constriction, the Hackberry Creek floodplain
broadens to its greatest width between Hi I lsboro and the floodplain
segment just north of the confluence of Hackberry and Aquil la creeks.
The underlying sediments for some distance around the site are
alluvial, but uplands to the south are mapped as Lake Waco and South
Bosque formations of the Eagle Ford Group (Barnes 1970). Soi I at the
site is mapped as Tinn Clay series, classified by the SCS as a fine
montmori I lonitic
(calcareous), thermic Vertie Haplaquoll (Brooks
1978).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
There is some confusion concerning the initial recording of this
site and its subsequent history.
A site numbered x41HI141 was
recorded during the 1972 survey (recorded on June 27, 1972 by
W.J. Fawcett
SMU site records), but the description and its mapped
location indicate that it is more than one half kilometer northwest of
the McKenzie Site.
This original x41HI141 was relocated during the
1982-83 Management Data survey and included with x41HI140 as TARL

41HI162.
The first actual record of the McKenzie Site is found on a
site survey form dated July 3, 1975 by Duane Peter, where he indicates
that the landowner, Lloyd McKenzie, pointed out the site (SMU site
records). The site number originally assigned (as recorded on the
site survey form and in the testing notes) was x41HI156, but this was
later changed to x41HI141. Whether this was due to an erroneous
interpretation of the actual location of the original x41HI141, or
some data management decision not recorded in the notes, is not known.
The McKenzie Site, now numbered x41HI141, was tested in 1975 by
Lynott and Peter (1977).
Three backhoe trenches and three 1 by 1
meter test units were excavated at that time. Only one of the backhoe
trenches encountered cultural materials. Al I three of the test units,
excavated into the sloping wal Is of the gully bank, yielded cultural
materials.
However, Unit 1, at the northeastern end of the site,
found only the lowest portion of the cultural stratum, the upper
portion having been eroded away by gully wash. Subsequent to the 1975
test, the site was nominated to, and placed on, the National Register
of Historic Places.
Mussel shel I is the primary cultural refuse found at the site,
although some bone was recovered as wel I. These were found occurring
in two apparent occupational strata near the top of a paleosol buried
at about 275 centimeters depth (Lynott and Peter 1977:52; Pheasant
1978). Species identifications and tabulations are included in Lynott
and Peter (1977). No I ithics are mentioned in the report of testing,
but an examination of the 1975 excavation level records indicates that
single specimens of f I int debris (debitage?) were recovered from Level
3 of Test Pit 1 and Level 2 of Test Pit 3.
A biface fragment is
reported
from
Level
4 of
Test Pit 3 (SMU site records).
Unfortunately, no specimen inventory exists and the artifacts could
not be located in the SMU collection.
In addition to the analyses of molluscan and vertebrate fauna
reported in the 1975 testing report, an analysis of pollen recovered
from the various strata is reported (Lynott and Peter 1977). Although
no excavation was conducted at the site in 1977, Skinner et al.
(1978) report a radiocarbon date on mussel she I I from the occupation
layer (A.D. 529 + 177:SMU - no sample number given - see the summary
and conclusions section of this chapter for a discussion of this date
and others from the site). In addition, a detailed description of the
soi I strata at the site is included in this report (Pheasant 1978).

MCKENZIE SITE
DATA COLLECTION
A primary goal during the 1982 investigations at the McKenzie
Site was the exposure of a large horizontal area in order to isolate
potential patterning in the distribution of molluscan remains. It was
hoped that, if possible, the limits of the midden might be determined
and a sufficiently large sample of mussel she I I be recovered for
analysis not only of the local riverine ecological system, but also of
the particular dietary preferences of the aboriginal inhabitants.
Although the site is an excel lent example of a wel I preserved mussel
shel I midden and may represent only one or two single episodes of food
collecting during a relatively brief period of time, the depth of the
overburden makes wide area excavation somewhat difficult.
For this
reason, it was decided to machine strip the sterile overburden over as
large an area as practical and open a number of shallow excavation
units within that area.
A total of five days of backhoe time and
approximately 80 man days were expended on the excavation of this
site.
After careful examination of the gully wal I profile, the central
area of the buried cultural horizon was isolated and an area
containing what appeared to be the densest concentration of cultural
material delineated.
A backhoe was brought in and a section of the
bank was excavated to just above the level of the cultural horizon.
Figure 39.2a shows the backhoe at work along the west bank of the
gully. Hackberry Creek fol lows the tree line in the center of the
picture.
The 270 centimeter depth of the cultural material proved to
be near the I imit of the backhoe's capability at reaching out over the
bank to excavate but with a crew of observers and shovelers in the
gully, an initial area of 6 by 4 meters was opened rapidly.
A long
sloping ramp was added to the west for easier access and at a later
time both the eastern portion of this ramp and a section of the north
wal I were re-excavated to expand the excavation area west and north,
ending up with the final area shown in Figure 39.1.
A grid was established within the stripped area, oriented just
east of north with the gully, and the area staked off. A vertical
datum, designated as an arbitrary 100.0 meters elevation, was set in a
mesquite tree on the lower portion of the gully bank opposite the
stripped area. Initially, a series of four 1 by 1 meter excavation
units were opened at the eastern edge of the stripped area, near the
gully edge. These units were excavated in arbitrary ten centimeter
levels beginning between five to ten centimeters above and continuing
to just below the dark soi I zone associated with the cultural
material.
These units, labeled as N48/W50, N49/W50, N50/W50 and
N51/W50 (and collectively termed the W50 I ine), were taken down six
levels with the exception of the northernmost (N51/W50) which was
excavated to Level 7. Distribution of mussel shel Is within these

contained what could be described as part of a "midden" area tn Level

West of these initial units, a series of 1 by 1 meter units was
extended across the stripped area. An additional 15 units were opened
in this area, al I of these taken down to the top of the shel I
concentration,
which
was
carefully exposed and mapped.
This
concentration is shown is Figure 39.2b. The concentration, where it
occurred, was found at the bottom of Level 2 and the top of Level 3 as

excavated from the front units, while approximately three cubic meters

SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Cultural materials at the McKenzie Site are buried under more
than 270 centimeters of culturally sterile alluvial fi II. These
materials are found within and apparently overlying the lowest of two
buried A horizons.

MCKENZIE SITE
Careful examination of the fi I I excavated from the strata above
the main lower cultural zone has indicated that they are essentially
devoid of cultural materials.
Only widely scattered mussel shell
fragments as wel I as whole and fragmentary snai I are found in these
upper strata.
Of particular interest are the two buried soi I
horizons, the lowermost of which contains most of the cultural
material. This very dark colored zone stands out clearly from the
rest of the gully wal I, at least in the area of the site. This zone
indicates the presence of a relatively long stabi I ized ground surface
at about the time of the occupations, or perhaps shortly afterwards
(since most of the material is contained within the buried soil).
Observations of material eroding from the bank has shown that the
concentration of mussel she I I seems to be restricted to a twenty meter
long portion of this darker horizon in the gully wal I profile,
suggesting that this horizon is due to an actual stabi I ization of the
ground surface rather than some cultural phenomenon. On the other
hand, attempts to trace this dark stratum farther than twenty meters
or so north of the apparent I imits of cultural materials have failed.
Although the attempt to correlate soi I strata over long distances
1s difficult, it 1s interesting to note that one of the densest
Archaic occupation levels at the McDonald Site occurred in a dark soi I
zone (a buried A horizon?) at about 270 centimeters below the surface.
Equally interesting, but also difficult to prove, is the apparent
correlation between the Late Prehistoric paleosol at the McDonald Site
(1982 Soi I Zone 4) and the upper buried soi I horizon at the McKenzie
Site.
These stabi I ized surfaces may date to the same period.
Additional evidence suggestive of this correlation 1s found 1n the
horizon overlying the upper buried soi I. This zone contains faint
microstrata and thin lenses of crushed shel I, much I ike that which 1s
mixed with the sandy microstrata in the apparent historic soil zone
(1982 Soi I Zone 2) observed in the upper part of the McDonald Site
soi I prof i I e.
Although the upper paleosol at the McKenzie Site does not contain
cultural material, the potential correlation between this buried soi I
and the one at the McDonald Site presents a number of interesting
implications.
First, this suggests that the McKenzie Site occupation
is earlier than (and perhaps much earlier than, judging from the two
meter depth differential) the A.O. 1200 date postulated for the upper
stabi I ized surface in Area B.at the McDonald Site. This older age is
confirmed by SMU radiocarbon dates which range from 1075 to 2305 B.P.
(Table 25.1). These dates are, however, somewhat younger than that
estimated for the prehistoric occupation recorded in Level 27 of the
McDonald Site. Comparison of the valleys of these two site areas
shows that the McDonald Site is located wel I upstream from the
confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks, where backing up of
floodwater flows has caused a broad floodplain, while the McKenzie
39-7

MCKENZIE SITE
Site is just a short distance above a narrow choke formed between two
old alluvial terrace remnants.
The rate of deposition might be
expected to be slightly greater in the latter case.
A question which arose during the excavation of the McKenzie Site
was the possible location of the then extant channel of Hackberry
Creek. The quantities of shel I observed at the site suggest that
these resources were not being carried far from the creek, and that
quite probably the site was located directly on the bank of the creek.
Three possibi I ities were considered: the modern channel, some twenty
meters to the south; a fossi I meander scar, about forty to fifty
meters to the north; and, the gully itself as a re-excavated creek
channel.
The latter possibi I ity was lessened somewhat by
the
observation of the original landowner, Mr. McKenzie, who remembered
seeing mussel shel I eroding from the opposite bank of the gully years
earlier, suggesting that the gully had cut through what was previously
a single site. No trace of mussel shell, or even the buried dark
stratum, was observed 1n the opposite bank during archeological
investigations at the site, however.
Although the modern creek
channel is the closest and seemingly the most plausible location for
the mussel she I I bed, the lowermost buried soi I was observed to slope
upwards very gently to the north suggesting the possibility of an
older levee formation and a corresponding old creek channel north of
the excavated area. The filled channel to the north of the site may
have been an active creek channel at the time of the occupation of the
site.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
Very I ittle I ithic debris was collected from the excavated areas
at the McKenzie Site. No formal tools were collected. A total of 22
specimens off laked stone was collected, including one modified flake
and 21 specimens of debitage. This latter group includes 11 flakes
and 10 chips. The flakes include eight secondary and three interior
specimens.
No primary flakes were collected from the site. In
addition to the flakes and chips collected, three or four more
specimens, pedestaled during the excavations of the main midden floor,
were lost when the site was flooded during a spring thunderstorm.
Only four specimens of lithic debris were recovered from the midden
surface excavations, contrasted to 18 from the arbitrary level units.
These latter specimens consist of one from Level 1, four (including
the modified specimen) from Level 2, five from Level 3, four from
Level 4, one from Level 5 and two from Level 6.

The secondary flakes include three specimens with single facet
platforms, four with cortex platforms and one crushed platform
specimen. No multiple facet platforms are present in the sample. Two
of these flakes have ventral platform I ips. Al I but one are chert,
the exception being a medium grained quartzite.
None are thermally
altered.
The three tertiary flakes from the site include two with single
facet platforms and one with a crushed platform.
As with the
secondary flakes, no multiple facet platforms are present.
One
specimen is I ipped. Al I are of chert and none are thermally altered.
The ten chips are al I of chert and none are thermally altered.
Only one of the chips has cortex on it. The rema1n1ng specimens are
who I ly decorticate. Al I of the chips, as with the flakes, are quite
smal I.
One modified flake was recovered.
This specimen, a smal I
secondary flake, has both Type 1 and Type 2 attrition along one
lateral edge of the dorsal surface. Modification is unifacial and the
microf lake terminations are both stepped and feathered. Some polish
is visible along the uti I ized edge and the ridges of the dorsal
surface.
This specimen was probably uti I ized with a soft medium
material.
Faunal Remains
The vast majority of al I materials collected from the McKenzie
Site were whole and fragmentary valves of fresh water mussels. These
are reported in Appendix III of this report and the discussion here is
based on that section. Three species of terrestrial snai Is and nine
species of fresh water mussels were recovered. No water snai Is were
recovered , perhaps indicating that the site, buried deeply in the
floodplain less than a meter above the modern creek level, may either
have been buried rapidly or been dry at the time of occupation despite
its relative elevation. Land snai Is are infrequent when compared to
their occurrence at other river bottom sites such as McDonald, a
circumstance which Neck (Appendix III) suggests may indicate rapid
accumulation of the clam she I Is (and perhaps rapid burial?). Rabdotus
is the dominant land snai I species, accounting for more than 95
percent of al I specimens. Their distribution appears to be densest
overlying or very near the top of the mussel shel I midden.
A total of 995
different species
were recovered from
along the eastern
N51/W50), while the

mussel valves identified as belonging to nine
were recovered from the site. Of this total, 225
the four 1 meter squares dug in arbitrary levels

MCKENZIE SITE
excavations along the upper midden floor. As at most of the sites in
the Aqui I la drainage where fresh water mussel she I I was preserved,
Amblema pl icata was the dominant species. At the McKenzie Site, this
species accounted for 78.4 percent of al I occurrences. The next most
common species overal I, Lampsi I is hydiana, was also commonly observed
at she I I midden sites. This species accounted for 14.0 percent of al I
specimens from the site. Of the remaining seven species identified
from the site, only three, Potamilus 1urpuratus (2.9%), Quadrula
apiculata (2.4%) and Lampsi I is teresl.4%), had total percentages
greater than one percent.
Examination of the SMU data from the 1975 excavations at the
McKenzie Site (Lynott and Peter 1977:55) shows similar percentages to.
those recorded above.
In 1975, Amblema specimens comprised 80.5
percent of the total mussel fauna. The second ranked clam species,
Lampsi I is radiata si I iquoidea (the equivalent of Lampsi I is hydiana
uti I ized here), accounted for about 10.5 percent of the total. Of the
remaining species identified, guadrula quadrula (forsheyi) was the
only significant component, comprising 8.3 percent of al I mussels from
1978. The other species identified included Tritigonia verrucosa (5
valves) and Lampsi I is anodontoides (1 valve).
Very little information can be gleaned by an examination of the
distribution table shown in Appendix III (III.8). Amblema pl icata is
the dominant species in al I but two of the 36 SO-centimeter quads
collected.
Both of these two had miniscule sample sizes. In the
quads with larger samples, the percentages of Amblema run from 61.2 up
to
90.6
percent.
There is no discernible patterning to the
distribution of any of the minor species, i.e., they do not appear to
cluster according to·species. Raymond Neck (personal communication,
1983) has stated that it would not be unusual to find a distribution
approximating the one found at the McKenzie Site in a single natural
clam bed. The one exception, a surprising one, is the minor presence
of Megalonaias gigantea, a species generally found in 8 to 15 feet of
water. A single specimen of this species was recovered from the 1978
excavations at the McDonald Site (Fullington 1979). The occurrence of
a single specimen at a large multifunctional site such as McDonald
might easily be explained as having been carried some distance for a
special purpose. Its occurrence in a mussel shel I midden at a special
function site I ike the McKenzie Site suggests that it was actually
collected from nearby Hackberry Creek.
Since pools near the site
today probably do not maintain eight feet of water year round, the
presence of these specimens raises some interesting questions. Either
occasional individuals of this species are capable of survival under
less than ideal conditions, or at the time of their collection,
Hackberry Creek was a permanent stream with somewhat more water than
it has today.

39-10

MCKENZIE SITE
A smal I quantity of animal bone was collected during the 1982
excavations.
A total of 73 bone fragments were recovered, only 19 of
which could be identified to the species level. The latter consist of
14 pieces from the she I I of a soft she I led turtle (Tri onyx spiniferus)
from Level 2 of the arbitrary level excavation units and five
whitetai I deer bone fragments. One deer bone is from Level 1 of the
arbitrary level excavations and the remaining four from the horizontal
midden excavations.
With the exception of four indeterminate turtle
she I I fragments from the midden surface excavations and a single
unidentified smal I mammal bone fragment from Level 5 of the arbitrary
leve~ units, al I of the remaining specimens are from
an unspecified
large mammal, possibly also whitetai I deer. The 1975 SMU excavations
recovered 39 bone elements or fragments (Lynott and Peter 1977:55).
The identified species are remarkably similar to those from 1982: 16
fragments of turtle shel I, 8 specimens of possible deer bone and 1
rodent radius. Although no analysis of minimum number of individuals
has been conducted, there is no clear evidence to suggest that more
than one individual of each species was buried with the mussel shell.
Because of the fragmentary and poorly preserved condition of the
bones, it cannot be conclusively stated that they were butchered
and/or consumed by the aboriginal occupants of the site.
SITE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A total of five radiocarbon dates have now been collected and
analyzed from the site. Four dates were collected from the 1975 SMU
excavations (J. Devine, personal communication, 1984) and one date
from the 1982 TAS excavations.
Only one SMU date is reported in
Skinner et al. (1978), but this date, which does not match any of the
SMU lab dates now on record, was apparently a pre I iminary run which
was later corrected. The uncorrected values of these five dates are
shown below in Table 39.1. As is obvious from a quick glance at this
table, there is a wide temporal range given by these dates. Excluding
the uppermost date, which seems somewhat anomalous, the series of
dates does seem to form a stratigraphic sequence ranging from 1075 +61
to 2305 +57 years B.P. The early upper date is inexplicable. The
wide range-of time on the two she I I dates, several standard deviations
apart, may indicate the presence of two distinct occupations at the
site, but the fact that the two samples were collected during
different seasons and run by different labs may account for some of
the variabi I ity. A fractionation correction, run on the SMU shel I
sample only, yielded a corrected date of 1395 +61 years B.P. No
correction has been attempted for the UT shel I dati:"
In any case,
since mussels incorporate inorganic carbon from the environment to
bui Id their shel Is, these dates might be expected to be slightly older
than the actual date of collection of the she I Is. Where para I lel
shel I and charcoal dates were run at the McDonald Site (41HI105), the
39-11

MCKENZIE SITE
she I I dates for two samples were 30 and 150 years older. Another

a

Uni ike shel I, which contains inactive carbon and is often dated
as older than it really is, soi I humates can contain younger organic
materials and thus be dated somewhat younger than the formation of the
soi I.
If this is the case, the paleosol underlying the mussel shel I
lens may wel I correspond to the cultural zone and possible paleosol in
Level 27 of the McDonald Site, dated to 2610 ..:!:,40 years B.P.
Although no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered, the
radiocarbon dates do at least offer an approximate time frame for the
occupation of the site. Despite the problems with dating noted above,
it is suggested here that at least one, but more I ikely several
occupations are represented, dating sometime between Prewitt's (1981)
Twin Sisters phase of the Late Archaic (beginning around 1750 years
B.P.) and the early Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric (dated by
Prewitt between 1250 and 650 years B.P.).
The analysis of collected materials indicates that the site is
primarily attributable to a single activity: shelling mussels. A
large number of the valves from the 1982 excavations are broken at
right angles to the umbo, a characteristic manner of aboriginal shel I
opening. Lynott and Peter (1977:52) also noted this characteristic
pattern in the molluscan remains from the 1975 excavations at the
site.
Although the activity of opening the shel Is is clearly
documented, there is some speculation about the locus of associated
activities. In the first place, it is somewhat difficult to determine
if the collected specimens were actually broken near where they lay or
if they might perhaps represent a secondary depositional event, 1 .e.,
the dumping of foul smelling garbage away from the main campsite area.
Although careful studies matching broken she I Is from different spots
39-12

MCKENZIE SITE
across the site might give a hint at this, there is no clear evidence
present to indicate whether or not the she I Is were either gathered or
eaten at or near the site. Regarding these points, it can be remarked
that it seems only logical to limit the distance which one might carry
the heavy shel Is from their source, whether or not they are consumed
at the site.
Although the vast majority of material remains from the site are
the result of mussel preparation, other activities may be represented
as wel I. Bone collected suggests that animal resources may have been
prepared and consumed at the site. The majority of these bones are
from a whitetai I deer, al I perhaps from the same individual, although
this
has not been ascertained.
Additionally, the presence of
unmodified I ithic chipping debris suggests stone tool manufacture. It
1s difficult to ascertain whether or not the single modified flake
from the site was uti I ized in conjunction with mussel preparation.
Lynott and Peter (1977:52) suggested that the midden was composed
of two distinct strata of shel I. The excavation of the initial set of
arbitrary level units across the eastern edge of the midden al lowed an
excel lent four meter profile of the midden unit which did not support
such a conclusion. The greatest concentration of mussel valves was
spread across a 10 to 15 centimeter wide zone running primarily
through Level 3, thickening slightly and sloping downward to the
south. Table 39.2 shows the vertical distribution of al I mussel shel I
Isolated valves were spread both

upward and downward from this zone with I ittle suggestion of discrete
strata. Examination of this profile and the further horizontal
excavation area strongly suggested lensing rather than distinct
strata.

In addition to the stratigraphic vagueness, the effects of clay
expansion and contraction were clearly visible in both vertical and
horizontal sections of the excavation unit.
These cracks were of
variable width up to about 10 centimeters, with most crossing the ful I
depth of the excavation unit. The results of this clay movement were
apparently reflected in the orientations of the shel Is from the
midden. Even within the thickest part of the midden, valves were
frequently found lying vertically or at a steep angle. The occasional
specimens below the main midden area were not only quite frequently
vertical, but smaller and generally fragmentary, unlike the more
complete valves from the main midden surface. The generally smaller
size of shel Is above and below the main central midden area is shown
is Table 39.3 below. Although it is not suggested here that al I of
the shel Is above and below the main midden were moved there by
pedoturbation, the data do suggest some vertical migration
of
materials.

Ful I ington (1978:217) has suggested that the Hackberry Creek
mussel fauna were probably not sufficient to sustain aboriginal groups
for long without supplementary food sources. This 1s 1n line with the
conclusions of Parmalee and Klippel (1974) who argue that enormous
quantities of mussel would be required to sustain even smal I groups
for any length of time. Although many of the sites along Hackberry
Creek contain substantial numbers of mussel shel I, it is clear from
the numbers suggested by Parmalee and Klippel (1974:433) for mucket
consumption, that is, between 57,000 and 67,000 muckets to feed a band
of 25 individuals for a single month, that the sites recorded to date
would not support a band for many months.

39-14

MCKENZIE SITE
Muckets are not found in the Central Brazos region (R. Neck,
personal communication), but a number of the species for which
Parmalee and Klippel record I ive weights are indigenous to the area.
An extrapolation of the food value of the McKenzie Site mussels from
this data, although it should only be viewed as a bal I park estimate,
might be useful here. The specimens collected appear to comprise a
large proportion of al I the mussels from the site, and the sample 1s
probably
representative

and

characteristics of the largest shell middens along Hackberry Creek.
The vast majority of sites with shel I middens observed in the Aquil la
Lake area during the Management Data survey were much smaller and less
densely populated with shel I than the McKenzie Site.
Ful I ington (1979:216) reports the soft part weights of five
specimens of Amblema pl icata collected from Denton County. The
average soft part weight of these specimens, 39.8 grams, is close to
that recorded by Parmalee and Klippel (1974:424) for the closely
related Amblema costata (R. Neck, personal communication), 36 grams.
This latter figure, based on a larger sample size, is uti I ized in
calculations below.
Parmalee and Klippel list soft part weight
figures for all species identified from the site or their equivalent,
with the exception of two species: the relatively common Potamilus
purpuratus
and the single specimen of Cyrtonaias tampicoensis.
Raymond Neck (personal communication, 1983) pointed out that Potamilus
purpuratus is a new name for Proptera, a somewhat larger relative of
the mucket Proptera alata discussed 1n Parmalee
and
Klippel.
Recognizing the potential for gross error here, the figure for
Proptera alata was nonetheless substituted for Potami lus purpuratus as
a
minimum size estimate.
Neck also suggested that Cyrtonaias
tampicoensis is similar in size to Potami lus purpuratus and the figure
for that species was used in the calculations here.
Table 39.4 shows the total number of mussels collected from the
1975 and 1982 excavations, their estimated soft part weights and
possible ranges in protein and calorie content based
on
the
nutritional data given in Parmalee and Klippel (1974:431). It should
be emphasized that these figures represent several
levels
of
extrapolation and should not be taken as more than very general
estimates. According to the figures in this table, the mussels
excavated from the site represent between 20,661 and 27,429 calories.
Although there is some variation in caloric requirements based on
stature
and energy expenditures, it is probably reasonable to
estimate, as did Parmalee and Klippel (1974:432), a figure of between
10,000 and 12,000 calories per day for a family of two adults and
three children.
Lee's (1979) estimate for the
daily
caloric
requirements of the perhaps somewhat smaller !Kung are only slightly
less, averaging 1975 calories per person overal I. Using 2000 calories
per day per person as a rough estimate, it can be seen that the
39-15

MCKENZIE SITE

mussels excavated from the McKenzie Site would provide enough calories
to keep 10 to 14 people going for a day.

Although there may wel I be more mussel lenses buried at the site,
the 1982 excavations appeared to have reached the limits of the
densest portion of the concentration of the excavated midden surface.
How many other concentrations might be buried further back in the
bank, or even how the SMU specimens relate to the 1982 materials are
difficult questions. As noted above, Lynott and Peter (1977) suggest
that there are two distinct shel I strata which may be discrete,
temporally separate events. Since these strata were not observed in
the series of units along the eastern edge of the excavation area
(Units N48/W50 through N51/W50) which apparently reached the lower
I imit of cultural materials (see Table 39.2), it is possible that a
second midden concentration existed in other portions of the site.
The sample excavated to date suggests that the midden is the
result of more than a one day stay by a single small family. A family
of five could, in fact, survive two to three days on the calories
represented here. If one assumes that the animal bone present at the
39-16

MCKENZIE SITE
site is representative of other food resources being consumed at the
same time, and that mussels only supplied a portion of the caloric
need, then a longer stay or a larger group of people might be
represented.
Assuming that mussels may have supplied only half the
daily caloric requirements of the occupants, then 20 to 28 people
would be represented, a group size one might expect for a smal I band.
None of these population figures can be conclusively proven, but
they do establish some useful working limits. Using the lowest limits
and assuming that very I ittle shel I remains at the site, a smal I
family could have eaten wel I for several days. Extending the limits
upward, adding additional subsistence resources and assuming that the
analyzed sample is only partial, a small band might have uti Ii zed the
site for several days. In other words, there are too many she I Is to
represent an overnight stay by a single smal I family, but too few to
represent a stay of too many days by a band of any size.
Ful I ington (1979:217) suggested that a generous single pool
population figure for mussels in Hackberry Creek might be 600
individuals. While this estimate might be believably stretched to the
916 individuals recovered from the two seasons of excavation, his
point that clam populations by themselves would not support an
extended stay at a given campsite is wel I taken. In fact, the whole
of Hackberry Creek in the Aqui I la Lake area could be stripped of clams
in a very short time by a relatively smal I population. If, as Raymond
Neck (personal communication, 1983) has suggested, a minimum of three
to four years is needed to regenerate a new population once the old
one had been essentially gathered, then a narrow, shallow creek like
Hackberry could not have been a permanent source of mussel as a main
dietary staple.
If this is the case, one might expect mussel to be a relatively
infrequent dietary supplement, uti I ized most frequently at times when
the normally exploited resources are stressed. If, as is argued 1n
the concluding chapters, there is a population increase during the
Late Archaic, then sites such as McKenzie might be common during this
period.
Further study of this possibility could be accomplished by
the attempt to find and describe shel I middens exposed in cutbanks
throughout the region. A great deal of information could be gained by
simply estimating their size and dating soi I and shel I samples from
them.
Such efforts should prove ultimately more rewarding than total
excavation, particularly, when, as at the McKenzie Site, other
cultural remains are infrequent.

FLOODPLAIN SITES SUMMARY

David 0. Brown

The three prehistoric sites discussed in this section are in many
ways among the most unique and important sites included in this
report. These three sites yielded the only collections of wel I
preserved
faunal remains recovered from the project area.
In
addition, the more than 20 assayed radiocarbon samples from these
three sites yielded the only radiocarbon dates from sites in the
project area. Perhaps most important of al I is the fact that al I
three sites were buried in the floodplain and show less evidence for
post-depositional disturbances than at other shallower sites 1n the
project area.
The midden area of the Reps Davis Site (41HI58) 1s shallowly
buried in the modern floodplain about 20 meters west of the present
channel of Aqui I la Creek, a half kilometer downstream from its
confluence with Hackberry Creek. The site, as originally defined by
C.K. Chandler on TARL site forms, included a
large
area
of
intermediate terrace with surficial cultural materials. Probably
because the cultural material on the terrace edge lies at some
distance from the midden area, these areas were recorded as separate
sites by SMU. Only the floodplain portion of the Reps Davis Site
(x41HI40) was selected for further investigation.
Uni ike the Reps Davis Site, both the McDonald and McKenzie sites
are surrounded by relatively large areas of floodplain. At the
McDonald Site (41HI105), an intermediate terrace area is present
across the creek beyond a narrow stretch of floodplain, while on the
same side of the creek, the site is more than 100 meters from the
closest recognizeable terrace or alluvial fan segment (at 41HI109).
The uppermost in situ prehistoric cultural materials at the McDonald
Site, recovered from below 60 centimeters, are buried slightly deeper
than those recovered from the Reps Davis Site and cultural materials

The McKenzie Site (41HI115) lies even farther from any large
segment of terrace or upland landforms.
A smal I, low knol I of a
terrace remnant, located more than a hundred meters to the north (and
recorded as 41HI163), is the closest nearby topographic relief.
Uni ike the McDonald Site, where stratified cultural materials were
found throughout a three meter section of profile, only a single
cultural layer was recorded at the McKenzie Site. And uni ike either
Reps· Davis or McDonald, no cultural material was recovered above the
280 centimeter depth of the top of that cultural zone.
There are some interesting geomorphic correspondences between the
three sites.
Both the Reps Davis and McDonald sites have remarkably
similar upper soi I profiles with about 60 centimeters of stratified
brown sand and sandy loam overlying a dark gray clay. The gray clay
at the McDonald Site overlies a distinct paleosol which contains most
of the Late Prehistoric cultural materials in Area B, while no such
paleosol was reported from Reps Davis. In fact, while most of the
prehistoric cultural material recovered from the McDonald Site was
found below the gray clay, the majority of the cultural material at
the Reps Davis Site extended down only to the gray clay.
At the McKenzie Site, lenses of sand and crushed shel I similar to
those found in the upper profile section of the McDonald Site, only
thicker, more diffuse and less wel I defined, were observable in the
upper meter of the soi I profile. Two paleosols were defined at the
site (Pheasant 1978:250).
The first, at 80
centimeters,
may
correspond to the upper paleosol at the McDonald Site (Zone 4), dating
to the mid to late Late Prehistoric. The second, associated with the
cultural materials at the McKenzie Site, may correspond to one of the
lower occupation zones at the McDonald Site.
The most obvious
possibility, the early Late Archaic or late Middle Archaic occupation
zone recognized from levels 27 and 28 (260 to 280 cm below the
surface), is radiocarbon dated somewhat earlier than the McKenzie Site
materials.
Altogether, 21 radiocarbon dates have been collected from these
three sites, ranging from as late as A.D. 1331 back to 930 B.C. in
uncorrected form. Dates at the Reps Davis Site, taken from charcoal
scattered throughout the f i I I of an apparent midden between 30 and 60
centimeters beneath the surface, are al I essentially Late Prehistoric,
ranging from A.O. 1101 to A.D. 1331 (Table 37.1).
Despite the
apparent stratigraphic agreement of the three dates and an arrow point
found in the upper portion of the deposit, two dart points found in
the lower portion of and near the base of or perhaps underlying the
midden, suggest at least Late Archaic occupation of the site. The
40-2

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
higher of these two dart points, tentatively identified as a Gary
type, is appropriate to this temporal assignment. The other point has
not been formally assigned to a type.
At the McDonald Site, the 12 avai Iable dates present a somewhat
more problematical picture (Table 38.4). Given the presence of both
Perdiz style arrow points and ceramics, two dates from the Late
Prehistoric levels seem reasonably consistent.
These dates have
corrected two-sigma ranges between A.D. 890 and A.D. 1315 which may
effectively span the Late Prehistoric occupations at the site. The
ranges of these dates miss overlapping by only five years between
A.D. 1185 and A.D. 1190 and it is around this time, i.e., the late
twelfth century, when the most intensive occupation may have taken
place, at least in Area B.
However, four other Late Prehistoric
cultural zone samples from the same area yield dates which appear to
be much too early.
The uncorrected versions of these dates range
between A.D. 220 and A.O. 520. Corrected ranges run from A.D. 40 to
A.D. 645, sti I I somewhat early. The single Late Prehistoric cultural
zone sample from Area A has yielded an uncorrected date of A.O. 670
which can be effectively discounted as worthless because of its +540
year one-srgma range.
Archaic dates from the lower strata of Area B at the McDonald
Site
present
less
interpretive difficulties.
Only one date,
associated with a Dari-I ike projectile point from Level 17, is
questionable.
The uncorrected date for this sample is 820 B.C. This
appears to be much too early, both in artifactual and stratigraphic
terms. Below this, dates with corrected range overlaps from 865 B.C.
to 795 B.C. (Level 27) and from 1245 B.C. to 870 B.C. (Level 33)
appear to be consistent for the two lowest major cultural strata,
dating to the middle and late Middle Archaic.
The McKenzie Site dates, which should define only a single
cultural layer, are equally problematical.
Since absolute depths
below the surface were not submitted with the original SMU dates,
there is some question as to the stratigraphic precedence of these
dates. Descriptions such as "5 cm below the top of the cultural zone"
and "5 cm above the bottom of cultural layer" are difficult to
interpret stratigraphically in an undulating cultural lens of variable
thickness.
The most reasonable interpretation of these stratigraphic
descriptions yields an order which is in agreement with a single
exception (Table 39.1). The uncorrected consistent dates range from
355 B.C. to A.D. 875, while the exception, dated at 253 B.C.
supposedly over I ies al I of the other dates. With the exception of
this latter date, al I of the dates should reflect the cultural
materials or the matrix of the actual midden. Thus the radiocarbon
dates yield a 1,230 year range for what has been suggested to be a
single short term campsite.
While part of the problem may lie in
40-3

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
assessing the stratigraphic placement of the samples, it may also be
due to the combined use of both soi I and mussel samples, as well as
the use of two radiocarbon laboratories. Unfortunately, insufficient
charcoal was obtained from the site for a date.
While most of the dates fal I into the Late Prehistoric or Late
Archaic range, the whole set of dates represents a relatively I imited
time span, given that at two sites much of the floodplain is involved.
At the McKenzie Site, where the cultural material is just a I ittle
over a meter above the modern creek level, dates for the cultural zone
indicate an early Late Prehistoric or Late Archaic age. At the
McDonald Site, where a four meter section of profile was sti II a few
meters above the normal creek level, the earliest dates fal I in the
Middle Archaic. Although deposition may have been more rapid in the
upper section of the McKenzie Site, the entire section of floodplain
there is certainly 2,500 years old, if not more.
At the McDonald
Site, the floodplain base is probably over 3,000 years old. The
latter date 1s in line with that suggested by Epps (1973) for the
beginning
of the Tl terrace bui Iding phase.
It also closely
corresponds to the date suggested by Baker and Penteado-Orellana
(1977) for the initiation of their Phase 4 channels. Brakenridge
(1980), in his discussion of the alluvial history of the Pomme de
Terre 1n southern Missouri, has pointed to the possibility of
Gunn and
widespread synchronized alluvial cut and fi I I sequences.
Brown (1982:118) noted the correlation between Brakenridge>s sequence
and the high latitude glacial and tree I ine sequence of Denton and
Karlen (1973), indicating periods of alluvial cutting occurring along
with glacial advance and increased meridional air movements. Although
Brakenridge interpreted several periods of downcutting, the most
important here is dated to the Subboreal, falling between 2,900 and
2,500 years B.P.
These dates are close to what appears to be the
initiation of terrace formation at both the McDonald and McKenzie
sites.
It is not unreasonable to suggest that terrace formation
fol lowed closely upon a brief, but widescale alluvial downcutting in
the Aqui I la Lake area, scouring out many previously buried earlier
sites. Only the excavation of a larger sample of floodplain sites and
a comparative analysis of their dating wi I I clarify the finer points
of depositional history in the Aqui Ila Lake area.
Prior to the subboreal, Brakenridge's (1980) earliest previous
period of downcutting is dated to the Mid-Hypsithermal and is too
early to be of apparent relevance to the sites discussed here.
Two
later periods, however, must be mentioned. There is no evidence in
the Aqui Ila Lake project area for a downcutting episode dated to the
early Little Ice Age, between 1,500 and 1,600 years B.P. This occurs
during the apparent dry period marked by the prairie vegetation in the
middle profile section at the McDonald Site. It is possible that this
interval marks the temporary halt of al luviation 1n the Hackberry
40-4

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
Creek va·I ley and the formation of the archeological remains-bearing
paleosol at the McKenzie Site. A final downcutting episode, fal I ing
in the Little Ice Age proper, is dated to 400 to 500 years B.P. This
episode may correspond to the period fol lowing the cessation of the
main Late Prehistoric occupations and the development of the paleosol
1n soi I zone 4 of Area B.
The most important aspects of the cultural remains found at the
floodplain
sites
include
the
retention
of in situ spatial
relationships and the preservation of cultural materials other than
debris.
The
extent
of
the preservation of spatial
I ithic
relationships is clearly shown in the distribution of sherds from the
Canton Incised vessel recovered from the McDonald Site. Al I of the 59
sherds from this vessel were found in an area I ittle more than a meter
in diameter. Examination of the distribution of these sherds, most of
which were mapped in place, shows the base in the approximate center
of the scatter with many of the larger basal body section sherds lying
interior up just out away from the base. The few rim sherds recovered
were the farthest from the base.
This pattern suggests that the
vessel, perhaps already broken and unusable, was dropped or thrown to
the ground in a trash dump area, breaking upon impact. Difference in
elevation between the sherds was no more than five centimeters, hardly
more than the undulations of the modern surface.
Some soi I compaction 1s indicated, but it may not be a major
factor at the site. A few of the sherds from the above vessel, for
instance, may have been broken in the ground by soil pressures, while
several long bone shafts were broken in place. On the other hand,
many bones, including some
articulated
groups,
were
clearly
undisturbed.
In a refitting of the material from the 1978 2 by 3
excavation units in Area B, SMU found cojoined pieces from different
levels in different units (Peter 1982), and vertic disturbances were
supported. While the possibi I ity of some vertic disturbances cannot
be refuted, a closer examination of this refitting data showed all but
a couple of the cojoined pieces came from adjacent levels.
In other
words, they may have been separated by less than a centimeter near the
boundary of the levels. In the remaining cases, a five centimeter
level separated the pieces. As previously pointed out, this is hardly
more than the undulation present in the modern surface.
The fact that the refittings could be made at al I argues for the
general lack of disturbances at the site. Other I ithic debitage was
refitted to a biface from Level 28 in the 1982 deep 2 by 2 excavation
unit 1n Area B; some of the refitted debitage was from Level 27, but
none was any more widely spread. Fragments of long bone found on
Surface II fit back onto the shaft of a deer metapodial spatulate tool
lying only a meter or so away. Reffiting these bone flakes to the
worn shaft indicated that they were removed in the manufacture of the
40-5

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
implement, which was subsequently used immediately adjacent
it was manufactured.

to

where

In contrast to the known instances of excel lent preservation of
spatial remains, the evidence for disturbances remains unclear. At
the McKenzie Site, a few deep, wide cracks marked by I ighter sediment
from the higher sections of the profile indicate the potential vertic
disturbances which may have affected the integrity of the cultural
materials.
The mussel valves throughout much of the midden area at
this site are twisted and turned from the horizontal, suggesting that
the valves were either deposited in a plastic matrix such as mud or
garbage, or were twisted by subsequent vertic activity. Despite this
twisting, the vertical definition of the midden area remains clear and
the wel I defined cracks show no immediate indication of disturbing
much material downward.
In fact, the relative paucity of valves
broken in place in the soi I seems to support the former hypothesis,
that the she I Is were perhaps discarded in fresh mud adjacent to the
creek.
At the McDonald Site, a wide variety of diagnostic indicators are
present in the Late Prehistoric strata of both areas. In Area A,
which has produced the greatest number and most varied sample of arrow
points, an analysis of the stratigraphic positions of the variety of
arrow points suggests no clear stratigraphic separation of Late
Prehistoric occupations at the site. If it were not for the presence
of wel I defined clusters of shel I and faunal remains, as well as
several burned rock features, mixing might be cited as an explanation
of the diagnostic diversity.
Stratigraphic evidence from Area B,
however, tends to discredit the possibi I ity of m1x1ng, although there
is also some evidence for a general trend 1n projectile point
stratigraphy in this area.
On the whole, the evidence from the McDonald Site seems to
support a wide variety of arrow point styles being utilized and
Several types seem

separable, however.
In Area B, the Perdiz type is less common and
where it does occur, it tends to overlie or to be horizontally
separate from the main occupation area. Cliffton points, which are
generally associated with Perdiz, do not occur in Area B, but are
relatively common in Area A. Across the site as a whole, Perdiz and
Cliffton types are overlain by other types only in one Area A
excavation unit.
In addition to the apparent separation of the
contracting stemmed varieties at the site, unstemmed, triangular
points are found only in Area B. Al I three specimens from this area
were found in the lowest level which contained complete diagnostic
arrow point specimens.

40-6

----

-------

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
Most of the complete arrow points from the McDonald Site are
round or square stemmed, including the Alba-like specimens, rather
than contracting stemmed as in the Perdiz and Cliffton types. Despite
the rather divergent technological aspects of these several round and
square stemmed styles, they are apparently mixed throughout the site.
It 1s again stressed that other evidence seems to suggest that this
m1x1ng is cultural rather than pedologic. It is not clear whether
this indicates alternating occupations by different groups or multiple
types manufactured by different individuals within a single group.
The stratigraphic and stylistic aspects of arrow points recovered
from the McDonald Site suggest several possibilities. The first, and
seemingly most clear, is that the occupation of the two areas occurred
at different times, making them separate archeological components.
The emphasis on contracting stem points in Area A seems to indicate it
was occupied later in time. Although it seems unlikely that the creek
would have shifted its channel at this time, it remains a possibility.
Perhaps more likely is the possibi I ity that woodland growth reached a
peak at this time, making the immediate bank in this area unsuitable
for camping. The woodland snai I, M. roemeri, does peak in the latter
portion of and immediately fol lowing-the Late Prehistoric occupations
1n Area B.
A second stratigraphic possibi I ity is that the main occupations,
and perhaps the earlier occupations in Area B may have occurred
contemporaneous with or even prior to the earliest arrival of Perdiz
points.
Whether this is contemporaneous with the transition between
the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric is not clear, but
lacking other evidence, this date, at around A.D. 1300, seems the best
estimate for the last major occupation in Area B.
Perhaps even more important than the preservation of horizontal
and vertical spatial relationships at the floodplain sites is the
preservation of various faunal remains. Analysis of these materials
from the McDonald and McKenzie sites has given at least a preliminary
view of the subsistence patterns of the project area.
While the
faunal data do not differ in any important respects from that
collected at other Central Texas hunter gatherer sites, the Aquil la
Lake project materials add significantly to the overall sample of
individual site fauna from Central Texas and provide a better
perspective on the range of animal exploitation strategies during
various time periods. The potential for a comprehensive study of
faunal material and artifacts in Central Texas sites, reaching beyond
the summary provided by House (1978), 1s growing rapidly with the
publication of such data.

40-7

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
Fauna! materials recovered from the McKenzie Site were almost
exclusively I imited to molluscan remains.
Only 19 specimens of
identifiable bone, consisting primarily of turtle carapace, were
recovered from the site. Nearly a thousand mussel valves, identified
as belonging to nine different species, were recovered and this data,
in conjunction with the materials from the previous SMU excavations,
was uti I ized to estimate caloric potentials. These data were in turn
used in estimating the subsistence limits of this particular resource.
Assuming mussels as a sole source of food, the recovered mussels would
have been sufficient to provide enough calories for 10 to 14 people
for. a single day. Unfortunately, the archeological evidence from the
site is insufficient to detemine what actual fraction of the diet was
comprised of mussel, although it can probably be assumed from the
presence of turtle and deer remains that other foods were present in
some quantities. Nor is it possible to asses whether the subsistence
remains from the site were actually uti I ized by a smal I group of
people for a long time, or a much larger group for a brief period.
Contrasted to the I imited and highly specialized subsistence
remains at the McKenzie Site are those found at the McDonald Site
which provide a larger and more diverse sample of the fauna! resources
exploited by the Aqui I la Lake area hunters and gatherers. More than
3,000 bones were identified to the generic level, while more than five
times this many could be identified to order or class. In addition,
some 1,200 mussel valves were recovered from various proveniences at
the site, nearly two-thirds of the total from the McKenzie Site.
Fauna I remains from the McDonald Site wi I I be examined in some
detai I in the concluding chapters, but a few summary points are
mentioned here. Whitetai I deer were the most prominent terrestial
species,
in
total number of bones and in m1n1mum number of
individuals. Their apparent contribution to the diet was greater than
any
other animal resource.
Riverine resources were also wel I
represented, with both turtles and she I If ish providing important
dietary supplements.
Perhaps even more interesting than the dominance of whitetai I
deer and riverine species was the relatively minor contribution of
other fauna I resources to the total. At the only other area site with
a relatively large, quantified fauna, Bear Creek Shelter on Lake
Whitney (Lynott 1978), deer and riverine resources predominate, but by
a smaller margin. Not only are many species, such as various rodents,
present in larger percentages at Bear Creek Shelter, but more species,
especially
among the birds, are represented.
This may be an
indication that whitetai I deer were overly abundant in the area around
the McDonald Site, diminishing the necessity of exploiting less
valuable species. On the other hand, it may indicate that the site
was I ittle more than a very short term campsite, where the occupants
40-8

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
did not bother to expend energy 1n the manufacture and placement
snares and traps which might be necessary to capture smaller game.

of

Another interesting faunal resource at the site is bison.
Bison
are al I but absent at Bear Creek Shelter (6 bones out of 1709 - Lynott
1978:50-51). A somewhat larger number of potential specimens are
represented at the McDonald Site, al I from a post-Archaic context.
Unfortunately, not al I of the bovid bones are in a sol id prehistoric
context, with most of the specimens actually overlying the main Late
Prehistoric occupations. Most of the putative bison bones have been
recovered from Area B, rn the uppermost cultural level, apparently
corresponding to what was described as Surface I
during
the
excavations.
In contrast to the McDonald Site, which yielded more I ithic
artifacts than any other site in the project area, both the McKenzie
and Reps Davis sites yielded few lithics. Only 22 specimens of I ithic
debris were recovered from the McKenzie Site, reinforcing the notion
that the primary function of this site was a specialized one:
mussel
shel I consumption and discard.
At the Reps Davis Site, 388 I ithic
artifacts were collected, along with a smal I amount of shell and bone
which remains unanalyzed.
The variety of cultural remains, which
includes a grinding slab, suggest the utilization of the site in
diverse activities.
Nevertheless, the total amount of material
collected is smal I. With the exception of the McKenzie Site, I ithic
debris density at the Reps Davis Site is the lowest of any of the
major sites investigated during the Aqui I la Lake project.
Although the sample size of lithic debris at the Reps Davis Site
1s smal I, there are some intriguing figures found here, setting it
apart from other project area sites in many respects.
In the first
place, it has a greater percentage of flakes and fewer chips than at
any other major site. Flakes at the site comprise 57.0 percent of the
total I ithic debris. Average flake percentage for the eleven Aqui I la
Lake sites with the largest sample is only 48.0 percent.
Only two
other sites have flake percentages above fifty percent. These two,
41HI109 (52.2%) and 41HI110 (56.2%), are both thought to be primarily
I ithic workshops.
Chips comprise only 29.6 percent of the total
I ithic sample at the Reps Davis Site. While 41HI109 and 41HI110 are
again the closest sites in chip percentages, the Reps Davis Site is
sti II wel I below 41HI110 which has the next lowest total with 37.5
percent chips.
Overal I mean for the Aqui I la Lake project is 46.2
percent chips.
In addition to these distinctions, the Reps Davis Site has the
highest percentages of cores and modified debitage of any of the major
sites. Bi face, projectile point and ground stone percentages are also
high. In general, many of these percentages are high because the site
40-9

---------~-~~-----~~-------

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
has the lowest percentage of debitage of any in the lake area.
The
two I ithic workshop sites, 41HI109 and 41HI110, also have relatively
low debitage percentages, being third and fourth lowest respectively.
The comparisons are inescapable. With the high corticate/decorticate
flake ratio present at the Reps Davis Site and the two lithic
workshops as wel I, it seems likely that the I ithic remains from Reps
Davis represent primary reduction.
The high number of cores and
relatively crude, unfinished bifaces also support this conclusion.
The McDonald Site, with 11,987 specimens of lithic debris, is the
largest and most important source of information on lithic patterns in
the lake area.
The total site is intermediate in most of the
percentage categories of I ithic artifacts. Its only distinction is
the lowest percentage of cores of any of the major sites, and
correspondingly, the highest flake-chip debitage/core ratio of any
site. Its intermediate position may simply indicate the combination
of
many
diverse components, but other sites with inseparable
components, such as the Brazil (41HI75) and Bailey (41HI77) sites, do
not
fol low
this intermediate status of the artifact category
percentages.
Separation of the McDonald Site into its major components reveals
few significant changes in this intermediate pattern. Only in the
total percentage of debitage is there any recognizeable separation
among the components.
The combined debitage at the site, totaling
96.0 percent of all lithic debris, ranks sixth among eleven sites
which range from a low of 90.5 percent debitage at the Reps Davis Site
to a maximum of 97.3 percent debitage at the Bailey Site.
Separation
of the I ithic debris into Area A (Late Prehistoric), Area B Late
Prehistoric (1978 SMU materials plus 1982 materials from Level 11 and
higher), Area B Late Archaic (1982 materials from levels 12-24) and
Area B Middle Archaic (1982 materials from Level 25 and below) finds
only the Area B Late Archaic, with 95.7 percent debitage, close to the
combined total. The Area B Late Prehistoric is somehat lower at 94.1
percent, while the Area A Late Prehistoric, at 96.6 percent, ranks
considerably higher. The Middle Archaic materials from Area B yield
the highest debitage percentage of al I, with 98.1 percent. Both the
Late and Middle Archaic samples are somehat small, however.
Other than in debitage percentage, the individual components do
not show as much variation as might be expected if such variation were
tied to technological changes through time. The similarities are much
more easily explained by a hypothesis of similar functions through
time linked to the environmental setting of the site.
Although this
theme wi I I be investigated in further detai I in the concluding
chapters of this report, it is worth noting here that this latter
hypothesis is neither intuitively obvious nor easily confirmed. In
previous section summaries, the simple geomorphic categories of upland
40-10

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
and terrace sites have been shown to include a great diversity of
cultural materials. At this level of generality, it is possible that
these broad categories are of I ittle uti I ity in understanding the
diversity of cultural patterning.
This is again echoed in the
analysis of cultural materials from floodplain sites. The three sites
classed here as floodplain sites, so similar 1n natural setting
(particularly in their depositional histories and in conditions of
preservation), are as different from one another in cultural remains
as any sites in the project area.
The abandonment of simplistic notions of geomorphic categories
for the description of archeological sites does not negate the
possibility of the heuristic use of environmental setting for the
determination of site function.
Such a use must proceed, however,
from an analysis of the functional and technological aspects of a site
assemblage and the examination of correspondences in these aspects
with various individual environmental parameters. In the case of the
floodplain sites, it is clear that the simplest categorization does
not work; the Reps Davis Site is more similar in many respects to the
hi I Iside group sites, 41HI109 and 41HI110. This strongly suggests an
important I ithic workshop component at the Reps Davis Site, despite
its location on the floodplain. An inspection of its environmental
setting shows only one commonality with these two sites: the presence
of terrace gravels less than 100 meters from the main site area. The
question which proceeds from this is whether or not middens similar to
the one at Reps Davis may have ever existed in the low preservation
qua I ity soi Is of the hi I Iside sites.
While the location of the briefly occupied McKenzie Site may have
been control led by mussel bed location, which is in turn control led by
water depth and flow conditions of Hackberry Creek, the locational
factors at the McDonald Site are not so easily determined. The site
was obviously the locus of activity for many years, perhaps even
several centuries, during the Late Prehistoric and at odd times prior
to that. One tentative suggestion offered here is that the site may
have been located adjacent to a cutoff meander of the creek, now
represented by the arroyo which cuts between the areas of the site.
Examination of the profiles of arroyo cutbanks and backhoe trenchs
suggests that the arcuate shaped mouth of the arroyo fol lows an older
and larger channel for some distance. How far upstream this smal I
tributary follows such an old channel, and whether the old channel was
actually the main Hackberry Creek channel or a large tributary, are
not determined.
Evidence favors the old channel fol lowing the
tributary upstream as far as SMU unit 24 (Fig. 38.1), and topographic
evidence additionally suggests a f i I led channel between the arroyo and
the main modern creek channel running just south of that same
excavation unit. Such a physiographic feature may have drawn repeated
visits to the site by the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and
40-11

FLOODPLAIN SITE SUMMARY
conditioned the remains found at the site by providing a plentiful
supply but perhaps a somewhat narrow range of animal resources.
In the conclusion to the terrace sites section, the idea was put
forth that some sites may be continually reuti Ii zed because of their
recognition potential as much as any particular subsistence value.
While a slough might easily be considered a distinctive physiographic
feature, it is not entirely clear what the recognition potential may
have been.
Certainly in dry times, a tree lined slough in the midst
of a grassy pra1r1e along the creek would have
been
highly
recog.nizeable and desireable.
Evidence from the McDonald Site,
however, suggests that the least frequent occupation occurred while

it is difficult to believe that the aboriginal inhabitants of the area
would not have known of the potential diversity of resources avai Iable
in and around abandoned channel ponds, whatever the recognition

Despite their diversity, it was possible to formulate some
potentially useful subgroups among the upland and terrace sites,
suggesting possible new direction for research in sites of these
categories.
The three floodplain sites discussed here are each so
unique that they defy grouping in any useful fashion. What is least
clear from this summary is how many unique variants existed among
floodplain sites or whether each and every floodplain site might have
The latter possibility is, of course, unrealistic,
