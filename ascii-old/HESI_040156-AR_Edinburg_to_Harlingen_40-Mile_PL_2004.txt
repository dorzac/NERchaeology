This document reports the intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 20 miles
(32.18 kilometers [km]) of high-probability areas along the proposed Valero 40-mile (64.36 km)
Edinburg to Harlingen refined products pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in Hidalgo and
Cameron counties, Texas. The proposed undertaking consists of the construction of a 40-mile
(64.36-km) long, 10-inch (25.4-centimeter [cm]) diameter refined products pipeline from an
existing refined products storage facility north of Edinburg, Texas, to a pipeline intersect at the
Arroyo Colorado east of Harlingen, Texas. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted the survey at the request of Valero Logistics, LP (Valero), in accordance with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the
survey was: 1) to identify any cultural resources within the Area of Potential Effect (APE), and, if
any existed, to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP); and 2) to determine the course of action for pipeline construction to proceed while
avoiding impacts to eligible sites.
The survey of the high-probability areas along the proposed ROW was conducted
between late September and early November 2004. An additional survey of rerouted segments
was conducted in early January 2005. A total of 9 sites (7 newly recorded sites and 2 re-visited
sites) were documented during the course of the investigations. Of these 9 sites, 7 are within
the originally proposed ROW, and 1 was documented within rerouted segments. The ninth site
is not located within the proposed ROW.
The 9 documented archeological sites consist of 5 aboriginal open camps
(41HG136, 41HG198, 41HG199, 41CF192, and 41CF197), 1 aboriginal lithic scatter
(41HG196), 2 historic farmsteads (41HG83 and 41CF193), and 1 historic cemetery (41HG197}.
It should be noted that the historic cemetery, while recorded during the investigations, is not
within or even immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW.

Of the 5 aboriginal open camps, 3 (41HG136, 41HG198, and 41HG199) were found
to possess a good mix of artifact types and some potential for stratified deposits. However, the
current survey level data is not sufficient to determine the NRHP eligibility status of these 3
sites. As such, their eligibility status remains undetermined. Horizon recommends that these 3
sites be completely avoided and protected from any impacts. If avoidance and protection is not
possible, Horizon recommends NRHP testing investigations to formally determine their NRHP
eligibility status. Valero has indicated that these 3 sites will be avoided and protected.
The fourth aboriginal open camp (41CF192) was also found to possess several
artifact types, including a marine shell pendant, as well as the potential for buried deposits. The
presence of the shell pendant suggests a Brownsville Complex association for this site.
Because such items of personal adornment are often found with human interments, this artifact
suggests at the least the possibility that human burials may be present at the site. At this time,

site 41CF192 has not been assessed thoroughly enough to determine if human burials or other
cultural features are in fact present at this site. As such, the NRHP eligibility status of site
41CF192 remains undetermined. Horizon recommends that this site be completely avoided and
protected from any impacts. If avoidance and protection are not possible, Horizon recommends
NRHP testing efforts at this site to formally determine its eligibility. Valero has indicated that this
site will be avoided and protected.
The fifth aboriginal open camp (41CF197) possessed a large amount of preserved
bone fragments, as well as lithic debris and daub that covered a rather extensive rise situated
next to a resaca remnant. This site is located only a short distance away from 41CF192, the
site with potential human interments discussed above. Although the bone specimens were
highly fragmented on this site, their presence coupled with the potential for human interments
nearby at 41CF192, suggests that site 41CF197 may possess human remains. Because of this,
as well as the presence of buried deposits, site 41CF197 is also considered eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP. Horizon recommends that this site be completely avoided and protected from any
impacts. If avoidance and protection are not possible, Horizon recommends data recovery
efforts at this site to salvage any pertinent information. Valero has indicated that this site will be
avoided and protected.
The aboriginal lithic scatter (41HG196) consists only of a sparse, poorly defined
scatter of lithic debris. It is not considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon
recommends no further cultural resources investigations at this ineligible site.
The historic farmsteads (41HG83 and 41CF193) consist of historic surface scatters
with no associated structural components. Due to the lack of deposits and existing structures,
these 2 sites are also not considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends
no further cultural resources investigations at these 2 ineligible sites.
Finally, a ninth site (41HG197) located well outside of the APE of the proposed ROW
was also documented during the survey. This site consists of the historic Anahuac Community
Cemetery, located roughly 310 meters (m) north of the northern edge of the proposed ROW.
Because of its distance from the proposed ROW, it is in no danger of disturbance during
Valera's construction efforts. Since it lies outside of the proposed ROW and outside of the
purview of this investigation, Horizon did not document the cemetery beyond delineating its
visible boundaries and acquiring a trinomial identifier. As such, its eligibility status is
undetermined.
The investigations of the originally proposed alignment are presented within the main
body of this document. The investigations of the rerouted alignments, as well as proposed
avoidance and protection measures are presented as an addendum at the back of this
document.

INTRODUCTION

This document reports the intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 20 miles
(32.18 kilometers [km]) of high-probability areas (Project Area) along the proposed Valero 40mile (64.36 km) Edinburg to Harlingen refined products pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in
Hidalgo and Cameron counties, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed undertaking consists of the
construction of a 40-mile (64.36-km) long, 10-inch (25.4-cm) diameter refined products pipeline
from an existing refined products storage facility north of Edinburg, Texas, to a pipeline intersect
at the Arroyo Colorado east of Harlingen, Texas. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted the survey at the request of Valero Logistics, LP (Valero), in accordance with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the
survey was: 1) to identify any cultural resources within the Area of Potential Effect (APE), and, if
any existed, to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP); and 2) to determine the course of action for pipeline construction to proceed while
avoiding impacts to eligible sites.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, a general
reconnaissance of the entire 40-mile (64.36 km) length of the proposed ROW, an intensive
pedestrian survey of approximately 20 miles (32.18 km) of high-probability areas along the
proposed ROW, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission's (THC)
Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Russell
Brownlow (Horizon's Cultural Resources Director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project, and Ron Ralph (archeological sub-consultant) served as the Project Archeologist. The
field crew consisted of Horizon technicians Reign Clark, Jared Wiersema, and Logan Ralph.
Prior to initiating the survey, Horizon consulted with the THC in order to delineate
areas having an increased probability of containing cultural deposits that would require an
intensive pedestrian survey. This consultation resulted in a determination that 5 segments or
"reaches" totaling roughly 20 miles (32.18 km) of the proposed 40-mile (64.36-km} ROW
possessed a high probability for cultural deposits. The survey of high-probability areas along
the proposed ROW was conducted between late September and early November 2004. A total
of 8 sites (6 newly recorded sites and 2 re-visited sites) were documented during the course of
the investigations. Of these 8 sites, 7 are within the APE of the proposed ROW. These consist
of 4 aboriginal open camps (41HG136, 41HG198, 41HG199, and 41HCF192), 1 aboriginal lithic
scatter (41 HG196), and 2 historic farmsteads (41HG83 and 41CF193).
Of the 4 aboriginal open camps, 3 (41HG136, 41HG198, and 41HG199) were found
lo possess a good mix of artifact types and some potential for stratified deposits. However, the
current survey level data is not sufficient lo determine the NRHP eligibility status of these 3
sites. As such, their eligibility status remains undetermined. Horizon recommends that these 3
sites be completely avoided and protected from any impacts. If avoidance and protection is not

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Valero's 40-mile (64.36 km) pipeline ROW begins at its refined products containment
facility located 5.2 miles (8.37 km) north northeast of Edinburg, Texas, and ends at a pipeline
interconnect near the Arroyo Colorado located approximately 4.2 miles (6.76 km) east of
Harlingen, Texas (see Figure 1). The pipeline ROW primarily crosses cultivated fields, while a
small portion of the ROW consists of undeveloped land. The pipeline parallels an existing
electrical transmission line corridor for more than half of its length and crosses a number of
irrigation canals. The ROW measures roughly 40 miles (64.36 km) in length and 80 feet (24.4

m) in width, yielding an overall area of 387.9 acres. Roughly half of the ROW length (20 miles,
or 32.18 km) was determined to have an increased probability for containing cultural deposits
based on topographic settings, distances from water sources, and the locations of previously
identified sites. In all, the high-probability areas totaled approximately 193.95 acres. These
high-probability areas consisted of 5 reaches scattered along the proposed 40-mile (64.36 km)
pipeline length. Reach 1 consisted of a single stretch of ROW measuring roughly 15.4 miles
(24.78 km) in length. Reach 2 measured 0.5 miles (0.8 km) in length, while Reach 3 measured
roughly 0.6 miles (0.97 km). Reach 4 measured approximately 3 miles (4.83 km) in length, and
Reach 5 measured approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) in length. Photographs of the general area
are presented in Appendix A.
The proposed ROW is located within Blair's (1950) Tamaulipan Biotic Province. He
notes that the region's climate is classified as semiarid, with an annual moisture deficiency
index of -20% to -40%. The region's average temperature is 64° Fahrenheit (F) and can range
from an extreme low of 47° F to an extreme high of 96° F. Total average precipitation in the
region is approximately 23 inches (58.4 cm) annually, and the growing season averages 320
days.
In general, the topography of the area is characterized as flat farmland in various
stages of cultivation. The only obvious elevation changes are the numerous irrigation canal
berms located throughout the area. Elevation slopes to the east from 85 feet (25.9 m) above
mean sea level (MSL) at its west end near Edinburg to 30 feet (9.1 m) above MSL at its
terminus east of Harlingen. The majority of soils along the 40-mile (64.36 km) alignment are
identified as sandy clay loams including the Hidalgo, Racombes, and Raymondville series.
These soils formed in alkaline loamy or clayey sediments. The most prolific native vegetation
types in these soils are prairie grasses including bluestem, trichloris, cottontop, bristlegrass,
sideoats grama, buffalograss, guayacan, engelmanndaisy, bundleflower, sensitivebrier, orange
zexmenia, ruellia, and bushsunflower. Once cleared of these plants, mesquite, whitebrush,
spiny hackberry, annual grasses, and weeds take root as the invasive species (USDA 1981).
The soils along the ROW, as indicated in the Hidalgo County (USDA 1981) and Cameron
County (USDA 1977) soil surveys, are listed alphabetically below.
Brennan
Brennan soils are dark brown to pale brown, fine sandy loam and sandy clay loam.
The first 13 inches (33.02 cm) of soil depth are generally dark brown, fine sandy loam. This fine
sandy loam is partly reworked by wind. From 13 to 65 inches (33.02 to 165.1 cm), the soils turn
more clayey and range from brown to pale brown in color. All of these soils appear darker when
moist. Solum thickness ranges from 28 to 52 inches (71.12 to 132.08 cm).

ARCHIVAL REVIEW

To determine the prehistoric and historic context of the Project Area, Horizon
conducted archival research via the Internet at the THC's Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web
site. Additionally, Horizon also reviewed the map files housed at the THC, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas General Land Office (GLO), and the
Perry Castaneda Library Map Collection. All reviewed maps and files were examined to
determine the location of previously recorded archeological sites and historic properties within a
1.2 mile (2 km) perimeter of the proposed pipeline ROW, as well as areas where previous
cultural resources surveys had been undertaken. Additionally, historical plat maps were also
reviewed to determine property plat histories that might suggest the potential for significant
historical sites as well as unrecorded cemeteries. This research indicated that a total of 19
archeological sites are recorded within the 1.2 mile (2 km) review perimeter of the proposed
pipeline ROW. At least 8 small- to large-scale archeological surveys have been conducted
within the 1.2 mile (2 km) perimeter. Six of the archeological surveys resulted in the
documentation of archeological sites, while 2 produced negative findings. The historical plat
review indicated that the proposed ROW traverses 12 blocks, tracts, and/or parcels in Hidalgo

and Cameron counties. The results of the archival review are presented within the appropriate
sections below.

Of the 19 previously recorded archeological sites located within the 1.2 mile (2 km)
review perimeter, a total of 17 were documented during 6 separate archeological surveys
conducted in the area (discussed below). No information other than site location data was
found for the remaining 2 sites, 41 HG8 and 41 HG25.
One of the earliest surveys performed within the vicinity of the proposed ROW was
conducted by the THC in 1978. This survey resulted in the documentation of 2 prehistoric open
campsites, 41 HG57 and 41 HG59. Site 41 HG57 contained lithic debris, burned rocks and snail
shell, while 41 HG59 contained 2 blades and 2 other worked stones. The present condition of
both of these sites is listed as destroyed.
In 1980 during the Lower Rio Grande Basin Project, R. Mallouf recorded site
41 HG42 as a prehistoric open campsite containing a scatter of lithic debris. This site was later
revisited and assessed along with 8 newly recorded sites (41HG81 through 41HG88) during a
cultural resources survey and assessment of Hidalgo and Willacy counties (Day et al. 1981). Of
the 8 newly recorded sites, 6 (41HG81, 41HG84, 41HG85, 41HG86, 41HG87, and 41HG88)
consisted of prehistoric open campsites containing lithic debris, bone fragments, and burned
clay lumps. Of these, only 41 HG85 produced diagnostic materials including an Olmos biface
and a Matamoras-like point. These implements suggest Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations at this site (Turner and Hester 1999). The remaining 2 sites include the historic Las
Burras Cemetery (41HG82), dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and a multiple
component prehistoric open campsite with an associated historic scatter (41HG83). While
almost all of these sites are located a considerable distance from the proposed ROW, site
41 HG83 is located on the proposed centerline of the ROW. Prior to the current investigations,
its NRHP eligibility status was listed as undetermined.
In 1987, 4 additional sites were documented during the survey of a drainage
improvement project for Hidalgo and Willacy counties (Hall et al. 1987). These sites include a
prehistoric open campsite (41HG126), a multiple component site (41HG128) consisting of a
prehistoric open campsite and an associated historic homestead, and 2 undefined prehistoric
sites (41HG132 and 41HG134). None of these 4 sites are located within the vicinity of the
proposed ROW.
In 1989, site 41HG136 was documented during a proposed drainage ditch
realignment in Hidalgo County, Texas (Quigg et al. 1989). This site is documented as a
prehistoric open campsite that is listed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. This site

is localed just outside (north) of the currently proposed ROW. As will be reported later in this
document, its boundaries were found lo actually extend into the proposed ROW.
Finally, site 41HG173 was recorded during a salvage excavation in 1995 by
Southern Archeological Consultants, the University of Texas Pan American. This site was the
location of a single prehistoric female burial. The associated funerary objects with this individual
included cul bird bone beads, cut olivela shell, canid teeth linklers, drilled canid teeth, and a
single human tooth found by the wrist of the individual. This site is associated with the
Brownsville Complex and is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. II is not located within
the immediate vicinity of the proposed ROW.
Previously Surveyed Areas with no Archeological Sites

The current archival review also documented 2 previous cultural resources surveys
that produced negative findings within the 1.2-mile (2-km) review perimeter. In June of 1988, a
cultural resources survey in Hidalgo County north of La Villa was performed in compliance with
a permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District. In July of
1991, another cultural resources survey was conducted in the same vicinity of Hidalgo County in
compliance with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations. As previously indicated,
both surveys produced negative results. Horizon was unable lo find bibliographic references for
reports of these surveys in THC files or on its Atlas web site.
Historic Parcel Landowner Data

Five historic plat maps were reviewed during the archival review for both Hidalgo and
Cameron counties. The oldest map reviewed, dating lo 1836, indicated that the proposed ROW
is located within areas previously designated as the Slate of Tamaulipas (Figure 2). In the mid1700s the Spanish and Mexican governments had 19 grants in what would become Hidalgo and
Cameron counties. Sellling of these grants was left to the grantees who began to establish
ranches throughout the 2 counties. During the Mexican-American War, these lands were
disputed, as Mexico insisted the lands were part of the Stale of Tamaulipas, while Texas
considered them to be its southern border (Handbook of Texas Online 2004a).
Hidalgo County
In addition lo the 1836 plat map, the remaining 4 maps reviewed for Hidalgo County
include the 1880, 1896, and 1911 plat maps, as well as 1936 General Highway Map. According
to these maps, the proposed pipeline ROW crosses 2 blocks and 3 tracts of land in Hidalgo
County. The 2 blocks, which are further subdivided into parcels, include: the "San Salvador del
Tule," Juan Jose Balli, 1_738; and the Texas Mexican Railway Company. The pipeline crosses
4 alpha-numeric or numeric parcels within this block which include: S.3087 joint parceled as
361 and 362; 476; 3.315.L; and 456. The pipeline appears to cross 2 parcels associated with

the Texas Mexican Railway Company. These include 257, S.2612, ptd., and a triangularshaped parcel which contains no designation. The 3 tracts crossed by the proposed ROW
include: the Llano Grande, Juan Jose Ynojosa de Balli, 1_723; Augustus C. Allen, 1_92, ptd.;
and "Las Menstefias Petitas Y la Abra," Vincent de Ynojosa, 1_739. These blocks, tracts, and
parcels of land were maintained through time as they were reviewed on the 1880, 1896, and
1911 Hidalgo County maps. Figures 3 and 4 reflect this continuity between the 1880 and 1896
maps.
In addition to the historical plat maps, the 1936 General Highway Map of Hidalgo
County was also reviewed in order to determine the presence of any historic cemeteries and
structures along the proposed ROW. One cemetery, the Anahuac Community Cemetery, is
located roughly 1020 feet (310 m) north of the proposed pipeline ROW, and can be seen on the
modern US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5' Edcouch, Texas, topographic quadrangle map
(1980). The review of the 1936 General Highway Map of Hidalgo County did not show a
cemetery at its current location. One structure observed on the 1936 General Highway Map is
located in immediate proximity to the proposed ROW. It was suspected to be associated with
the previously recorded multiple component site, 41 HG83. Discussion of this site is presented
in the above Previously Surveyed Areas with Archeo/ogica/ Sites section, and below in the
Section 6.0 site descriptions and the 7.0 Recommendations section.

Juan Jose Ynojosa de Balli, 1 of the first settlers of Hidalgo County, was issued the
"Llano Grande" grant in 1790 (Handbook of Texas Online 2004b). He was the father of Rosa
Maria Ynojosa de Balli, who was better known in the region as "La Patrona." Also known as the
first "cattle queen" of Texas, she initially inherited the property from her father, who had died
before the application of his grant was finalized and had specified in his will that the property be
bequeathed to her (Handbook of Texas Online 2004b). According to the Handbook of Texas
Online (2004c), she skillfully and deliberately built up her landholdings through her siblings and
her children by applying for grants in their names. Ultimately, at the time of her death in 1803,
Rosa Marfa Ynojosa de Balli owned more than a million acres of land in the lower Rio Grande
Valley (Handbook of Texas Online 2004c).
The Ynojosa de Balli land holdings were maintained even during the turbulent times
following the Mexican-American War. As previously mentioned, these lands were believed to
be part of the State of Tamaulipas by Mexico, and Texas' southern border by Texas, during this
time. As such, following the war, Spanish and Mexican land grants became the focus of
competition, controversy, and conflict (Handbook of Texas Online 2004a). Ultimately, claims
regarding the "Llano Grande" and "Las Menstefias Petitas Y la Abra" grants were confirmed by
the Texas Legislature in 1852. It is speculated that the grant confirmations were due, in part, to
the influence of these families and their longevity in the region. This confirmation could also
have served to ease the suspicion on the part of the original settlers and those who wanted to
purchase the lands from them (Handbook of Texas Online 2004a).

The Texas Mexican Railway Company, owner of the other land tracts crossed by the
proposed ROW, began in 1875 as "the Corpus Christi, San Diego, and Rio Grande Narrow
Gauge Railroad Company" (Handbook of Texas 2004b). William J. Palmer and James Sullivan,
the new owners of the company, changed the name to the Texas Mexican Railway Company.
The railway is maintained and operated today by the Texas Mexican and the Missouri Pacific

Cameron County
The 5 maps reviewed for Cameron County included the 1836 map indicating early
land grants; 1880, 1895, and 1913 county maps; and the 1936 General Highway Map. In
Cameron County, the proposed ROW traverses 2 tracts of land and 1 block with 6 smaller
parcels. The 2 main tracts are "La Feria," Rosa Maria Ynojosa de Balli, 1_697; and a section of
"Las Menstefias Petitas Y la Abra," Vincent de Ynojosa, 1_739, that extends into Cameron
County. The block is the "Concepcion de Carricitos" Eugenio and Bartolome Fernandez, 1_737,
ptd. The 6 parcels are located within this block and have numeric designations, 3 of which have
name associations; however, for the most part these names are illegible. These parcels are
274 _.01, Colo__oward; 273 Sa_ir L Sa_r, p357, ptd.; 278, __ , __; 277, Do_le, p369,
ptd.; 8089, 302; and 80817, 6380, 216. These blocks, tracts, and parcels of land were
maintained through time as they were reviewed on the 1880, 1895, and 1913 Cameron County
maps. Figure 5, a historical 1880 Cameron County map, depicts the location of the current
proposed ROW in relation to the historical land tracts. The review of the 1936 General Highway
Map of Cameron County indicated that there were no historic cemeteries or historic structures
within the current proposed ROW.
"La Feria" was the original grant that Rosa Maria Ynojosa de Balli inherited from her
father. Her headquarters/ranch, named "La Florida," was located on this grant (Handbook of
Texas Online 2004d). One of her business ventures included financing the application for "Las
Menstefias Petitas Y la Abra" for her brother Vincente. This grant encompassed 35 leagues of
land. Once this grant was approved, Vincente transferred 12 leagues of "Las Menstefias" to his
sister (Handbook of Texas Online 2004d). As a savvy businesswoman, Rosa Maria furthered
her landholdings and surrounded them by her extended family, providing protection of her ranch
lands and cattle.
She was one of most influential women of her time and, as such, took
advantage of her status and supported and maintained a family chapel and endowed other
churches in the region (Handbook of Texas Online 2004d).
Documentation regarding the "Concepcion de Carricitos" land grant is limited. The
land grant was awarded to Eugenio and Bartolome Fernandez in 1789 (Handbook of Texas
Online 2004e ). The small town of Carricitos in the region was named after this original land
grant. According to the Handbook of Texas Online (2004e), the town got its name from local
ranchers sometime before the Civil War. The portion of this land grant located north of the Rio
Grande was separated into parcels prior to 1880. Due to the deterioration of the maps and
simple numeric designations, little more can be said regarding the parcels.

REGIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm, Kreiger, and
Jelks (1954) and later revisited by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and
Hester (1999). Cultural chronologies for South Texas and the Rio Grande Delta have
continually evolved over the latter half of the 20th century. Early archeological investigations in
these areas have been based on records and artifact collections of A. E. Anderson (Hall et al.
1987). A.E. Anderson, an avocational archeologist in the first half of the 20th century, was the
first to document and define the topographic setting of prehistoric sites and recover comparative
collections of artifact types in South Texas and the Rio Grande Delta. Sites that he first
documented fall within the surrounding vicinity of the pipeline study area.
The temporal framework for the cultural chronology of the region consists of a tripartite system based on technological changes in diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of
indigenous adaptation to changing environments and subsistence strategies.
Previous
investigations in South Texas and the Rio Grande Delta by Mallouf et al. (1977), Hester (1981),
Hall et al. (1987), Bousman et al. (1990), Hester (1995), and Quigg et al. (2000) discuss the
temporal framework as it has developed in the regions. The cultural chronology for the region is
broken down into 4 main periods: the Paleoindian (11,200-8000 BP), the Archaic (8000-1400
BP), the Late Prehistoric (1400-450 BP), and Historic Contact (circa 450 BP).
Paleoindian ( 11,200-8000 BP)
The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. Evidence of the Paleoindian period in the Rio Grande Delta and South Texas
region is most often characterized by a few isolated projectile points (Mallouf et al. 1977).
According to Hester ( 1995: 434 ), no Clovis or Folsom camp or kill sites have been documented
in South Texas. Bousman et al. (1990) note that sites across the region containing isolated
finds of Paleoindian projectile include an A. E. Anderson site at the mouth of the Rio Grande, 11
sites at Falcon Reservoir including La Perdida, and the La Paloma Mammoth Site in Kennedy
County. Other sites with Paleoindian components in the regions include the Berger Bluff site in
Goliad County and the Loma Sandia site in Live Oak County.
An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may suggest
an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation for the
purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland tributary

suggest that Archaic people did not heavily exploit the Rio Grande Delta area until the Middle
Archaic period.
Late Archaic (2400-1400 BP)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence is focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.
Late Prehistoric (1400-450 BP)
The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow,
as well as ceramics in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. However, according to
Bousman et al. (1990:22-23), agriculture and ceramic practices were never developed in South
Texas. In the South Texas region, the period is represented by the recovery of a few diagnostic
arrow points at sites in east-central Hidalgo County and western Willacy County near La Sal
Vieja (Bousman et al. 1990:23). Although Bousman et al. (1990:23) discuss the presence of
diagnostic arrow points such as the Perdiz, Scallorn, Cameron, Bulbar Stemmed, Starr, and
Zavala types at sites within the region, they suggest that the small triangular bifaces may not be
associated with the Late Prehistoric period as temporal indicators, but may instead represent a
technology related to resource locations and transportation. Culture complexes defined for the
Rio Grande Delta area include the Brownsville and Barri! complexes, both associated with an
industry of shell modification/trade (Bousman et al. 1990:23). Other artifacts associated with the
Brownsville Complex include ceramics and conical pumice pipes (MacNeish 1958:186-189).
The Brownsville Complex is generally confined to the delta area, while the Barri! complex is
predominately in northeastern Tamaulipas, Mexico (Bousman et al. 1990:23).
Historic Contact
This period is defined by the presence of European cultural materials such as
projectile points, trade beads, and wheel-made, glazed ceramics in the context of prehistoric
site settings. A. E. Anderson was responsible for initially identifying such sites in South Texas
and the Rio Grande Delta (Bousman et al. 1990). It is likely that Cabeza de Vaca was one of
the first Spanish explorers to encounter aboriginal groups in the region sometime after his
entrance into Texas in 1542. Salinas' (1986:258) research documented aboriginal groups living
in the area as late as 1886 near Reynosa, Mexico.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 4-man Horizon crew completed the pedestrian survey of roughly 20 miles (32.18
km) of the proposed 40-mile (64.36 km) flow line. As per consultation with Debra Beene of the
THC, only areas possessing a high probability for cultural deposits were surveyed. These highprobabilily areas were determined based on the types of landforms where archeological sites
had previously been recorded, distance to water sources, and historic maps. In total, the highprobability areas represented roughly 50%, or 20 miles (32.18 km), of the 40-mile (64.36 km)
alignment, and established the total area of the survey. Out of the project's total area of
disturbance (387.9 acres), 194 acres were surveyed. As indicated in the Project Area
description (Section 2), the high-probability areas consisted of 5 reaches scattered along the
proposed 40-mile (64.36 km) pipeline ROW length. Reach 1 consisted of a single stretch of
ROW measuring roughly 15.4 miles (24.78 km) in length. Reach 2 measured 0.5-miles (0.8 km)
in length, while Reach 3 measured roughly 0.6 miles (0.97km). Reach 4 measured
approximately 3 miles (4.83km) in length, and Reach 5 measured approximately 0.5 miles
(0.8km) in length.
To facilitate the survey of the high-probability areas/reaches, the Horizon field crew
broke into 2 teams of 2. The crews conducted the survey in a leap-frog fashion, each crew
surveying segmented portions of the reaches and then skipping a section while it was surveyed
by the other crew. The survey consisted of both intensive surface inspection as well as
subsurface shovel testing. For linear projects, the Texas State Minimum Survey Standards
(TSMSS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile within ROWs measuring up lo 100 feet
(30 m) in width. As such, a total of 320 shovel tests were necessary along the roughly 20 miles
(32.18 km) of high-probability areas along the proposed ROW. In all, the Horizon crew
exceeded the TSMSS and conducted a total of 324 shovel tests within the high-probability
areas. All excavated matrix was screened through 1/4-inch (6-mm) mesh or trowel-sorted,
depending on the moistness and/or density of the soils. Only diagnostic artifacts were collected
from the surface and shovel tests. All other materials were tabulated and assessed in the field
and left where they were found. Following each shovel test, the depth, soil type, location, and
artifacts were documented on standardized shovel test forms. The location of every shovel test,
as well as surface material, was documented with handheld GPS units using the UTM
coordinate system and the NAO 27 map datum. Field notes were also maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, landforms, cultural material observed, etc. Photographs with a photo log were
completed as appropriate and are presented in Appendix A. Shovel test data are presented in
Appendix B.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

The cultural resources investigations conducted within the high-probability areas of
Valera's proposed 40-mile (64.36 km) pipeline ROW resulted in the documentation of 7 sites (5
newly recorded sites and 2 re-visited sites). These consist of 4 aboriginal open camps

(41HG136, 41HG198, 41HG199, and 41CF192), 1 aboriginal lithic scatter (41HG196), and 2
historic farmsteads (41 HG83 and 41CF193). An eighth site consisting of a historic cemetery
(41HG197) was also documented during the survey outside of the project's APE. Each site is
described separately below under the reach in which it was located. Shovel test and site
locations are presented in Figures 6a through 6h. Topographic excerpts of site locations as well
as site sketch maps are presented from west to east along the proposed ROW in Figures 7
through 17.
Reach 1
41HG196 (Watermelon Patch)
Site 41HG196 is located within the ROW in a plowed watermelon field (see Figure
6a, Figure 7). The site is a diffuse, prehistoric occupation of unknown age and use. The site
measures 98.4 feet (30 m) north/south by 426.5 feet (130 m) east/west The site consists of a
single tertiary flake, a small bone fragment (probably deer), a small charcoal fragment, and 1
piece of cobalt blue glass that is most likely of recent origin. The charcoal fragment was
recovered from a depth of 30 cm below surface (cmbs). All other artifacts were located on the
ground surface. Due to the site's sparse and diffuse nature and the distance between artifacts, it
is unclear if the bone or charcoal fragments are associated with the flake or if the 2 artifacts
were more recently deposited. See photographs 4 and 5 in Appendix A
41HG197 (Anahuac Community Cemetery)
Note: This site is not within the APE of the current project
Site 41HG197 is a historic cemetery located at the end of paved Mile 3 Road West
(Cemetery Road) and 1 mile north of the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 1015 and
FM 1925 (Figure 6c, Figure 8). It lies roughly 1020 feet (310 m) north of the northern edge of
the proposed ROW. The cemetery is separated into Anglo and Mexican-American sections, the
latter of which is much larger. The Anglo section is delineated by a chain-link fence and contains
only 2 grave markers. The standard cemetery furniture is present, including stone and cement
curbs and tombstones, along with some metal and wooden markers. All markers observed
exhibit inscriptions in Spanish with the exception of the 2 located within the Anglo section. The
Anglo grave stones mark interments placed in 1929. Some of the markers in the Hispanic
section date from slightly earlier. The overall size of the cemetery measures 262.5 feet (80 m)
north/south by 393.7 feet (120 m) east/west See photographs 7 and 8 in Appendix A Again,
this site is not within the APE of the current project

41HG198(CampoAlgodon)
Site 41HG198 is a prehistoric open campsite located in a fallow agricultural field
roughly 400 meters southeast of the Anahuac Community Cemetery (see Figures 6c, 9, and
10). The site consists of an 82-foot (25-m) north/south by 82-foot (25-m) easUwest lithic scatter.
Site size was determined by the limits of the observed surface scatter. Surface visibility was
excellent due to plowing and recent heavy rains. Artifacts recovered from the site include
quartzite and chert flakes, a distal fragment of a thin dart point, a thin biface basal fragment, and
2 deer-sized bone fragments. All artifacts were found on the surface. All 5 shovel tests
administered at the site were negative. Site 41HG198 sits squarely on Valero's proposed
pipeline alignment. See photographs 9 through 11 in Appendix A.
41HG199 (Playa Seca)

r·

Site 41HG199 is a prehistoric open campsite discovered in a recently plowed field
just south of a high voltage transmission line that the proposed alignment follows (see Figures
6d, 11, and 12). The site consists of a 115-foot (35-m) north/south by 82-foot (25-m) easUwest
scatter of artifacts situated on a slight upland just south of an ephemeral pond in a relic resaca
scar. Site boundaries were established by the limits of observed artifacts on the surface.
Surface visibility was nearly 100% due to recent ROW plowing. The artifact assemblage at the
site consists of a secondary chert flake, a tertiary chert flake, a chert core fragment, 2 deersized bone fragments, and a multi-use tool consisting of bifacially flaked and ground sandstone.
All artifacts were found on ground surface. Shovel testing yielded no subsurface cultural
deposits. See photographs 12 through 14 in Appendix A.
41HG136 (Playa Seca East)
Site 41HG136 was previously recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), in 1988
as a prehistoric open campsite. As originally recorded, the site boundaries spanned 164 feet (50
m) north/south by an unknown distance easUwest. Artifacts observed included a tertiary flake,
bone fragments, and burned lumps of clay. An unidentified isolated find was mentioned to have
been found 1300 feet (400 m) west of the site's center.
The site was revisited during Horizon's current field efforts (see Figures 6d, 12, and
13). Aboriginal artifacts similar to what the Prewitt staff observed were also recorded, including
9 mammal bone fragments, 1 turtle carapace fragment, and 3 pieces of burned clay (Photo 15
in Appendix A). Site boundaries were established as 820 feet (250 m) north/south by 229.7 feet
(70 meters) easUwest. Site size was determined by the uninterrupted horizontal extent of
observed surface artifacts. No cultural materials were recovered from any of the 5 shovel tests
administered during the site survey.

41 HG83 (Casa Llano Grande)

Il _,

Site 41HG83 was initially recorded in 1980 by PAI as a multi-component site. The
prehistoric component consisted of a compact lithic scatter measuring 98 feet (30 m)
north/south by 66 feet (20 m) east/west. Artifacts such as flakes, chips, cores, bone, and burned
clay were observed. The historic component consisted of recent historic ceramics, brick
fragments, miscellaneous historic trash, and evidence of a burned structure. Overall site
condition was determined as very poor due to heavy plowing.
An attempt was made to revisit this site during the current investigations. Upon field
inspection, only evidence of the historic component was found (see Figures 6d, 12, and 13).
The prehistoric component recorded for site 41 HG83 was most probably re-recorded as site
41HG136 by PAI. The 2 components were found to overlap very slightly in the southern portion
of 41HG136 and the western portion of 41HG83. The confusion can likely be attributed to the
redistribution of artifacts due to plowing activities and site visitations spanning several decades.
Current, discreet site boundaries for sites 41HG83 and 41HG136 can be seen in Figures 12 and
13. See also photographs 16 and 17 in Appendix A.
Reach 2

No sites were documented within Reach 2. The locations of shovel tests within this
reach can be found in Figure 6e.
Reach 3

No sites were documented within Reach 3. The locations of shovel tests within this

Reach 4

41CF192 (Garza Ranch Campsite)
Site 41CF192 is a prehistoric open campsite located in a fallow agricultural field lying
600 m south of El Garza Ranch (see Figure 6f, 14, and 15). It is located upon a slight rise 250
m northwest of an ephemeral pond in a relic resaca scar. These landforms are all but
nonexistent due to many years of leveling and plowing of agricultural fields. The site consists of
a 46-foot (14-m) north/south by 108-foot (33-m) east/west prehistoric open campsite. Site size
was determined by the limits of the observed surface scatter. Surface visibility was excellent
due to plowing and recent heavy rains. Artifacts recovered from the site include 2 burned clay
fragments, 3 small-sized mammal bone fragments, and an Incongruous Ark seashell pendant.
The shell pendant had been spire ground to create a hole for stringing (Andrews 1971 ). All
artifacts were observed on the site's surface. All 6 shovel tests administered at the site

produced negative results. Site 41CF192 sits squarely on Valero's proposed pipeline alignment.
See photographs 18 and 19 in Appendix A.
41CF193 (Garza Ranch South}

I
''

Site 41CF193 is an early 20th century farmstead located 600 m south of El Garza
Ranch (see Figures 6g, 16, and 17). A residence and barn structure corresponding with the
location of the historic scatter are represented on the 1956 USGS 7.5' Willimar SW, Texas,
topographic quadrangle map. No remnant of a residence or original barn structure was
observed during the survey. However, a later steel barn was found standing at the northern
edge of the scatter. Retired cotton trailers, a diesel tank, and an old cotton gin were located
near the modern barn. The scatter measured 459 feet (140 m) north/south by 328 feet (100 m)
east/west, though the southwestern boundary may extend further to the west. Site boundaries
were delineated by the presence or absence of historic trash on the ground surface. The artifact
assemblage consisted of green, purple, and clear glass; a screw-top bottle; a cork-top bottle
neck with molding marks; 4 pieces of crockery; 11 pieces of pottery; a bone fragment; and a
ceramic doll leg. No artifacts were recovered from any of the 6 shovel tests administered during
the site survey. The historic scatter sits on the northern edge of Valero's proposed pipeline
alignment. See photographs 20 and 21 in Appendix A.
Reach 5

No sites were documented within Reach 5. The locations of shovel tests within this
reach can be found in Figure 6h.

RECOMMENDATIONS

This section presents Horizon's recommendations for the 8 sites documented during
the current survey in regard to their NRHP eligibility status, as well as the degree of additional
investigations warranted at each site. Of the 8 sites recorded or revisited during the current
survey, 7 are located within the currently proposed ROW. The eighth site, the Anahuac
Community Cemetery (41HG197), is located well outside of the APE of the proposed ROW and
is not considered to be under the purview of the current investigation, as it does not lie within or
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW. The recommendations for each site are presented
separately below in the order in which they were documented.
41HG196 (Watermelon Patch)
This site is a diffuse surface scatter of sparse aboriginal debris that lacks stratified,
subsurface deposits. It is Horizon's opinion that it is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No
further work at this site is warranted.

As noted above, the Anahuac Community Cemetery (41HG197) is not located within
the purview of this investigation, as it is located well outside of the APE of the proposed ROW
(310 m north). It is in no danger of any impacts by the current project. However, the field crew
chose to formally document the location of the cemetery and assign it a trinomial designation
during a side trip to observe it. No other documentation was conducted at the cemetery aside
from this minimal documentation. As such, Horizon is reluctant to assess its NRHP status
based on this minimal data. However, because of the age of the cemetery, it could qualify as a
Texas Historic Cemetery under the THC's Historic Cemetery Program. Since it does not fall
within the purview of this investigation, an effort to designate it as such was not undertaken.

41HG198 (Campo Algodon)
Site 41HG198 is a prehistoric open campsite that possessed a fair mix of artifacts
including a dart point fragment and preserved deer bone. Although no subsurface materials
were encountered in the 5 shovel tests conducted at the site, the number of artifacts and the
preservation of fauna! materials suggest that this site may be able to address pertinent research
questions for the area if subsurface deposits are present. Additional testing-level investigations
are necessary to fully determine the nature of this site's deposits. As such, it is Horizon's
opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of this site is undetermined. Until its NRHP eligibility
status can be determined, Horizon recommends that this site be completely avoided and
protected from any proposed impacts.
41HG199 (Playa Seca)
Site 41HG199 is another prehistoric open campsite that also possessed a fair mix of
artifacts including chert flaking debris, cores, a bifacially flaked and ground sandstone
specimen, and bone fragments. Again, although no subsurface materials were encountered in
the shovel tests conducted at the site, the number of artifacts and the preservation of fauna!
materials suggest that this site may be able to address pertinent research questions for the area
if subsurface deposits are present. Additional testing-level investigations are necessary to fully
determine the nature of this site's deposits. As such, it is Horizon's opinion that the NRHP
eligibility status of this site is undetermined. Until its NRHP eligibility status can be determined,
Horizon recommends that this site be completely avoided and protected from any proposed
impacts.
41HG136 (Playa Seca East)
When originally recorded in 1988, this prehistoric open campsite's NRHP eligibility
status was undetermined. Horizon's current investigations found the site to still be intact and
possessing a variety of artifacts including preserved fauna! material, flakes, and burned clay.
Additionally, its boundaries have been considerably expanded based on the extent of the

surface materials. Although no subsurface materials were encountered in the 5 shovel tests
conducted at the site, the number qf artifacts and the preservation of fauna! materials suggest
that this site the may be able to address pertinent research questions for the area if subsurface
deposits are present. Additional testing-level investigations are necessary to fully determine the
nature of this site's deposits. As such, it is Horizon's opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of
this site is undetermined. Until its NRHP eligibility status can be determined, Horizon
recommends that this site be completely avoided and protected from any proposed impacts.
41HG83 (Casa Llano Grande)

I-

When originally recorded in 1980, this site was assessed as being a multicomponent site consisting of prehistoric and historic scatters. The current investigation found
the site to primarily consist of a scatter of historic debris that overlapped the prehistoric debris of
site 41HG136 (discussed above). Horizon's current investigation redefined the boundaries of
both sites, clearly showing that site 41 HG83 is a historic scatter associated with a potential
burned structure that was noted in 1980. No evidence of the structure is present today. The
investigators in 1980 noted that the site's condition was very poor. Horizon concurs with this
previous assessment and considers the site ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon
recommends that no additional investigations are warranted at this site.
41CF192 (Garza Ranch Campsite)
Site 41CF192 is a prehistoric open campsite possessing a variety of aboriginal
artifacts including burned clay fragments, preserved fauna! materials, and a marine shell
pendant. The shell pendant may be a dropped trinket, or could potentially be associated with a
human interment. Regardless, it suggests at least some association with the Brownsville
Complex culture to the south in the Rio Grande Delta. Although no subsurface materials were
encountered in the 6 shovel tests conducted at the site, the number of artifacts, the preservation
of fauna! materials, and the presence of the shell pendant suggestive of a Brownsville Complex
association indicate that this site has the potential to address pertinent research questions for
the area if subsurface deposits are present. However, at this time, the site has not been
thoroughly investigated enough to determine if human burials or other cultural features are
present. As such, the NRHP eligibility status of 41CF192 remains undetermined. Horizon
recommends that this site be completely avoided and protected from any proposed impacts. If
the site cannot be avoided and protected, NRHP testing efforts are recommended to formally
determine its NRHP eligibility status.
41CF193 (Garza Ranch South)
Site 41CF193 is an early 20th century farmstead noted on the 1956 USGS 7.5'
Willimar SW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. However, no remnant of a residence or
original barn structure was observed during the survey. A modern steel barn appears to have
been constructed over the locations of earlier structures. Because of its lack of integrity, it is
Horizon's opinion that this site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is
warranted at this site.

ADDENDUM:
REROUTES AND AVOIDANCE MEASl,JRES

INTRODUCTION

This addendum presents the results of an intensive pedestrian survey efforts
conducted within high probability areas along rerouted segments of the proposed pipeline ROW
during January and March 2005. It also presents Horizon's recommendations regarding sites
documented during the survey of the reroutes, as well has Horizon's recommendations in
regard to avoiding and protecting all sites documented during the surveys of the originally
proposed alignment and subsequent reroutes.
REROUTES
I

I.

At this time, Valero has informed Horizon of 9 reroutes to the originally proposed 40mile pipeline ROW. Of these 8 reroutes, 4 are considered to be within areas determined to
have a high probability for containing cultural deposits. These reroutes within high probability
areas total approximately 8.26 km (5.13 miles). Map excerpts of the proposed reroutes within
the delineated high probability areas, are presented below. Horizon surveyed the proposed
reroutes on 18, 19, and 24 January 2005 and 19 March 2005. The survey methodology
employed to assess the reroutes is the same as that presented within the Methodology section
in the main body of this report.
Results

The survey of the rerouted segments of Valera's proposed 40-mile pipeline ROW
resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site, 41CF197, described below. Map
excerpts showing the location of shovel tests and the newly recorded site are presented below,
as are sketch maps of the newly recorded site.
It should be noted that subsequent to the identification of site 41CF197 along a
proposed reroute, Valero implemented a secondary reroute north of both the original alignment
and the original reroute in the vicinity of this site. This additional reroute, while also assessed
by Horizon, followed an existing transmission line corridor adjacent to an elevated canal. The
entire length of this reroute around site 41CF197 had been heavily disturbed by construction.
41CF197 (Loma Hueso)
Site 41CF197 is a prehistoric open campsite located in a fallow agricultural field
roughly 800 m east of 41CF192. It is located upon a slight rise approximately 250 m north
northeast of relic resaca scar. The surface artifacts suggest that the entire rise was utilized at
various times as a campsite. Overall, the site measures roughly 225 m (738 ft) north/south by
140 m (459 ft} east/west. Site size was determined by the limits of the observed surface scatter
that, as previously mentioned, extended roughly the entire breadth of the landform. Surface
visibility was excellent due to plowing and recent heavy rains. Artifacts observed at the site

include a biface fragment, a chert flake, numerous burned clay fragments (daub), and a
considerable large amount of small bone fragments, some of which were burned or evidenced
cut-marks. No temporally diagnostic material was observed. The majority of the artifacts were
observed on the site's plowed surface. However, 4 of the 5 shovel tests conducted on the site
produced positive results, indicating the presence of preserved bone fragments between 20 and
75 cmbs. Based on location of site 41CF197 in proximity to 41CF192 (a site with a probable
Brownsville Complex component), both sites are undoubtedly associated.

i1

As discussed in the main body of this document, site 41CF192 may represent a site
with human interments due to the recovery of a shell bead from the site. The association of site
41CF197 with 41CF192, coupled with the large amount of bone fragments observed at site
41CF197, suggests that it may also contain evidence of human interments. Currently, most of
the recovered bone fragments appear to represent small mammals. However, their fragmented
nature prevents a formal determination in regard to whether any of the bone fragments may in
fact be part of a human skeleton. No other evidence of human interments was noted at site
41CF197, but there exists the potential for such interments to be present somewhere within this
expansive site. Because this site possessed such a large amount of artifactual material in
comparison to other sites recorded during the survey, as well as the presence of buried deposits
and the potential for human interments, it is Horizon's opinion that site 41CF197 is eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
Recommendations

41CF197 (Loma Hueso)
Site 41CF197 is an extensive prehistoric encampment that produced the largest
amount of aboriginal materials observed during the course of Horizon's investigations along the
proposed pipeline ROW. The presence of a large amount of bone fragments suggests several
things: 1) that preservation at this site is excellent and poses an opportunity to study aboriginal
dietary intake as well as resource exploitation strategies; and 2) that the chance exists for
human interments at the site. The presence of a large amount of daub fragments may also
suggest that extensive cooking episodes occurred at the site. The daub fragments at the site
may also suggest the past presence of habitation structures constructed via the "waddle and
daub" method. Additionally, shovel testing at the site suggests that buried deposits are present
at the site and extend at least 75 cmbs. Based on the extensive nature of the site, the presence
of buried deposits, the presence of preserved fauna! material, the potential for human
interments, and the overall ability for this site to prove a valuable resource in expanding the
knowledge of prehistory in the region, it is Horizon's opinion that site 41CF197 is eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends that this site be completely avoided and protected
from impacts. If avoidance and protection is not feasible, Horizon recommends data recovery
efforts at this site to salvage as much data as possible prior to impacts.

Note: Valero has subsequently rerouted the reroute proposed through this site. The new
alignment, which was surveyed along with all the other reroutes, completely avoids this site.
AVOIDANCE AND PROTECTION MEASURES

The text below presents Horizon's proposed avoidance and protection measures
recommended for all sites documented during Horizon's assessment of Valero's proposed 40mile refined products pipeline ROW. It includes all sites documented during the survey of the
originally proposed alignment, as well as those site documented during the survey of the
rerouted segments. In addition to proposed avoidance and protection measures, this section
also reiterates Horizon recommendations for any additional investigations on sites where
avoidance and protection (if warranted) may not be feasible.
41HG196 (Watermelon Patch}

i:
l

Site 41HG196 is a diffuse surface scatter of sparse aboriginal debris that is not
considered to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work at this site is warranted. As
such, no avoidance and protection measures are recommended.
41HG197 (Anahuac Community Cemetery)
The Anahuac Community Cemetery (41HG197) is not located within the purview of
this investigation, as it is located well outside of the APE of the proposed ROW. As such, no
avoidance and protection measures are recommended.
41HG198 (Campo Algodon)
Site 41HG198 is a prehistoric open campsite with an undetermined NRHP eligibility
status. Until its NRHP eligibility status can be determined, Horizon recommends that this site be
completely avoided and protected from any proposed impacts. The current plan to avoid and
protect this site consists of fencing the perimeter of the site to ensure that no heavy equipment
crosses the site. If it is not feasible to complete the construction of the pipeline in the vicinity of
the site without traversing it, Valero has indicated that they will install the pipe segments in this
area via Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD). The HDD will bore under the site at a minimum
depth of 3 meters (10 feet). As this is an upland site, it is Horizon's opinion that this depth will
sufficiently avoid impacts to any subsurface deposits. If these avoidance and protection
measures are not feasible, Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing measures at the site to
formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.

41HG199 (Playa Seca)
Site 41HG199 is another prehistoric open campsite with an undetermined NRHP
eligibility status. Until its NRHP eligibility status can be determined, Horizon recommends that
this site be completely avoided and protected from any proposed impacts. The current plan to
avoid and protect this site consists of fencing the perimeter of the site to ensure that no heavy
equipment crosses the site. If it is not feasible to complete the construction of the pipeline in the
vicinity of the site without traversing it, Valero has indicated that they will install the pipe
segments in this area via Horizontal Directional Drill (HOD). The HOD will bore under the site at
a minimum depth of 3 meters (10 feet). As this is an upland site, it is Horizon's opinion that this
depth will sufficiently avoid impacts to any subsurface deposits. If these avoidance and
protection measures are not feasible, Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing measures at
the site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
41HG136 (Playa Seca East)
[ :

!

When originally recorded in 1988, this prehistoric open campsite's NRHP eligibility
status was undetermined. Horizon's current investigations also resulted in similar findings.
Until its NRHP eligibility status can be determined, Horizon recommends that this site be
completely avoided and protected from any proposed impacts. The current plan to avoid and
protect this site consists of fencing the perimeter of the site to ensure that no heavy equipment
crosses the site. If it is not feasible to complete the construction of the pipeline in the vicinity of
the site without traversing it, Valero has indicated that they will install the pipe segments in this
area via Horizontal Directional Drill (HOD). The HOD will bore under the site at a minimum
depth of 3 meters ( 10 feet). As this is an upland site, it is Horizon's opinion that this depth will
sufficiently avoid impacts to any subsurface deposits. If these avoidance and protection
measures are not feasible, Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing measures at the site to
formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
41HG83 (Casa Llano Grande)
When originally recorded in 1980, this site was assessed as being a multicomponent site consisting of prehistoric and historic scatters. The current investigation found
the site to primarily consist of a scatter of historic debris that overlapped the prehistoric debris of
site 41HG136. Horizon's current investigation redefined the boundaries of both sites, clearly
showing that site 41 HG83 is a historic scatter associated with a potential burned structure that
was noted in 1980. No evidence of the structure is present today. The investigators in 1980
noted that the site's condition was very poor. Horizon concurs with this previous assessment
and considers the site ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. It is Horizon's opinion that no
additional investigations are warranted at this site. As such, no avoidance and protection
measures are recommended.

41CF192 (Garza Ranch Campsite)

[

.

Site 41CF192 is a prehistoric open campsite with a possible Brownsville Complex
component that appears to have the potential to address pertinent research questions for the
area if subsurface deposits are present. However, at this time, the site has not been thoroughly
investigated enough to determine if human burials or other cultural features are present. As
such, the NRHP eligibility status of 41CF192 remains undetermined. The current plan to avoid
and protect this site consists of fencing the perimeter of the site to ensure that no heavy
equipment crosses the site. If it is not feasible to complete the construction of the pipeline in the
vicinity of the site without traversing it, Valero has indicated that they will install the pipe
segments in this area via Horizontal Directional Drill (HOD). The HOD will bore under the site at
a minimum depth of 3 meters ( 10 feet). As this is an upland site, it is Horizon's opinion that this
depth will sufficiently avoid impacts to any subsurface deposits. If these avoidance and
protection measures are not feasible, Horizon recommends NRHP testing efforts on this site to
formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
41CF193 (Garza Ranch South)

I'

'

Site 41CF193 is an early 20th century farmstead noted on the 1956 USGS 7.5'
Willimar SW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. However, no remnant of a residence or
original barn structure was observed during the survey. A modern steel barn appears to have
been constructed over the locations of earlier structures. Because of its lack of integrity, it is
Horizon's opinion that this site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is
warranted at this site. As such, no avoidance and protection measures are recommended.
41CF197 (Loma Hueso)
Site 41CF197 is an extensive prehistoric encampment with preserved faunal
material, buried deposits, and the potential for human interments. It is considered to be eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon has recommended that this site be completely avoided and
protected from impacts. To this end, Valero has subsequently rerouted the reroute proposed
through this site. The new alignment, which was surveyed along with all the other reroutes,
completely avoids this site.
