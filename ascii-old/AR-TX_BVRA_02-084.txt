ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of a proposed 230 mile water line in Cass County,
Texas performed by AR Consultants of Dallas, Texas identified 32 areas believed to
have potential for the presence of significant archaeological sites. Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas conducted an archaeological survey of
those areas on April 17-19, 2001. Much of the proposed right-of-way is in low areas
and along the slopes of hills. The soils are shallow and sometimes disturbed. No
prehistoric sites were encountered. One historic site (41CS259), a farmstead probably
dating to the early 20th Century, was recorded in the project area. It was identified by
the presence of a hand dug well made of bricks and covered on the outside with mortar.
According to the landowner, a house had been moved from this site to another location.
No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Western Cass Water Supply Corporation (WSC) through
J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. of Palestine, Texas to conduct a Phase I cultural
resources survey of a proposed water line that will service the residents of rural Cass
County (Figure 1). Figure 1 depicts those points on each section that were evaluated
by the field survey crew, and each point is numbered according to its corresponding
section. As currently planned, the water line is 230 miles in length and will be placed on
private land when possible. The "Area of Potential Effect" consists of a 15 foot
permanent easement with a trench depth of 36 inches and a trench width of 6-12
inches. The 230 mile water line is divided into 112 sections scattered throughout the
county, and the areas investigated during this study are referred to according to their
section number and topographic quadrangle location.
Prior to the construction of the water line, an archaeological evaluation was
conducted as required by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission. This
project falls under the purview of the Texas Historical Commission because funding for
this project is to be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development, Rural Utilities Service. AR Consultants of Dallas, Texas performed the
evaluation in November and December of 2000 (Kent and Skinner 2001). This task
consisted of a records review, a summary of fieldwork conducted in the surrounding
area, a field inspection of the proposed pipeline routes, creation of a research design,
the methodology proposed to fit the research design, and a final report (Kent and
Skinner 2001:1). The field inspection consisted of a "windshield survey" and limited
ground truthing which consisted of "getting out of the vehicle in certain areas." As a
result of this activity, AR Consultants identified 32 areas near known sites or in
environmental settings believed to be likely areas for archaeological sites (Table 1).
These 32 recommended areas are the focus of this investigation. A letter from the
Texas Historical Commission from Mark H. Denton to Dr. S. Alan Skinner dated
February 7, 2001 states that the review staff, led by Ed Baker, concurs with his
recommendations. The project area is depicted on twelve 7.5' United States Geological
Survey topographical maps: Atlanta North (dated 1969), Atlanta South (dated 1969),
Bassett (1965; photorevised 1975), Bryans Mill (dated 1969; photorevised 1976),
Carterville (dated 1969), Cunningham Creek (dated 1961), Douglassville (dated 1969),
Linden (dated 1969), Marietta (dated 1965), Naples (dated 1965; photorevised 1980),
Sardis (dated 1965), and Wright Patman Lake (dated 1964; photorevised 1970).
Overall, Cass County is located in Northeast Texas in the Eastern Planning
Region, an area known to contain significant archaeological sites (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). Because of this archaeological potential, a cultural resource study by
professional archaeologists was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Since this is a federally funded project, no Antiquities Permit
from the State of Texas was required. The project number assigned by BVRA is 01-05.
The field survey was conducted on April 17-19, 2001 with William E. Moore assuming
the duties and responsibilities of Principal Investigator.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Cass County is located in Northeast Texas within the Eastern Planning Region
as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993). The following comments are taken from
their comprehensive document for this area, and the interested reader is referred to this
volume for more detailed information. Although significant archaeological sites have
been recorded in the county, the total number of sites (n=258) is not high. As of 1993,
for example, Cass County had less than .037 recorded sites per kilometer, ranking it
last in this area. The county is described as rural with less than 14.9 people per square
kilometer and a population growth of less than 5%. Environmentally, it is situated within
the Piney Woods, Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest area of East Texas. Artificial
disturbance in the county consists mainly of lignite mines from the near surface Wilcox
formation and the deep basin Jackson-Yegua formation and lakes Wright Patman and
Texarkana. In 1991, the county had a total of 137 recorded archaeological sites, of
which 13 were regarded as significant. No sites were listed in the National Register of
Historic Places. The archaeological chronology for the area includes sites dating from
Paleoindian times (9500 B.C. - 7000 B.C.) through Historic Caddoan (A.D. 1680 - A.D.
1860).
One of the major problems regarding our understanding of the archaeology of
Northeast Texas lies in the lack of data for sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic
components. "Despite the existence of a potentially rich data base, the body of useful
information on these time periods is small" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:70). The
authors credit this to the fact that most early materials have been found mixed with later
components. When found, they are difficult to interpret because of limited absolute
dating; poorly defined artifact chronologies; limited preservation of economic data such
as faunal and botanical remains, and the typically low density nature of the cultural
remains. No sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic components have been reported
for Cass County as recently as 1993. Sites attributed to the Hunter-Gatherer period
(prior to sedentism) have been identified in Cass County at 41CS34, 41CS94,
41CS116, and 41CS119). One of the problems with these early sites is that they
usually contain only lithic artifacts; rarely, some sites have yielded hardwood nutshells
and burned rock concentrations. "The scarcity of remains other than lithic artifacts is
due mostly to the relatively great age of these deposits and the poor preservation of
organic remains and nondurable features" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:75). The
minimum criterion for significance of these sites is the presence of non-artifactual data
such as cultural features and faunal and botanical remains and diagnostic projectile
points that allow confident chronological assessments.

5

Following the hunter-gatherer period (circa 500 B.C.), the emergence of
sedentism arrived in Northeast Texas and lasted until A.D. 1000. Sedentism is defined
by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:97) as "cultural systems where all or part of the
population resides at the same location for all or most of the year." Until recently, very
little research had been directed toward the emergence of sedentism in Northeast
Texas. Factors that are believed to have been causal in terms of this change include
population growth, territorial constriction, environmental change, technological
innovation, modifications in social organization, and/or changes in subsistence
strategies (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:97). During this time a major technological
innovation, the emergence of pottery and the bow and arrow, appeared. Sites dating to
this period are often referred to as Early Ceramic. One Early Ceramic period site in
Cass County (41CS8) has been tested (Jelks 1961).
The next period is referred to as the development of agriculture in Northeast
Texas before A.D. 1600. Study questions for this period should focus on the processes
that influenced the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas among prehistoric
Caddoan populations with agriculture defined here as a maize-based economy as
described in Fritz (1990). Major sites of this period include Caddoan archaeological
sites, particularly habitation locales with associated burials and burial furniture (usually
pottery). More than 4700 prehistoric archaeological sites have been recorded in both
the Northeast Texas region and adjoining counties where associations exist with the
Caddoan archaeological tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:124).
Approximately 80% of the significant sites in this region are prehistoric Caddoan
sites which were occupied sometime between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1600. These sites
include multiple and single mound centers; cemeteries; habitation sites such as villages,
hamlets, and farmsteads; and possible extractive/processing locations. Most of these
sites, unfortunately, are on private land and are not protected from vandalism. Less
than five important Formative-Middle Caddoan sites were known to exist in Cass
County as of 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.1). The number of
important Late Caddoan Period sites as of 1993 for Cass County is, however, greater at
15 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2).
In 1993, 39 Caddoan Period
archaeological sites with excellent faunal and floral preservation were known to exist.
Not one is in Cass County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.3).
Cemeteries and burial mounds are common throughout Northeast Texas, and
these archeological phenomena are viewed as extremely significant research data sets
because of the bioarchaeological, cultural, and sociopolitical information relevant to the
development of agriculture encoded in the mortuary practices, associated grave goods,
and pathologies/infections preserved in the skeletal remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:127). In 1993, 11 archaeological sites in Cass County had produced human
remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.5), and two single mound sites are
recorded in the county (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.6).

6

Fifty-three Critical Resource Zones have been defined in the Northeast Texas
region for sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture prior
to A.D. 1600. One of these zones, just above Wright-Patman Lake, is in Cass County
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.7). Black bayou (in the current project area)
and Black Cypress bayous in Cass County are identified as areas of potential
importance for the presence of significant archaeological sites of this period. Twenty-six
sites in Cass County along the shoreline of Lake Wright-Patman are considered
significant and worthy of further study (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:143). One of these,
41CS4, is a habitation site that occurs in association with a cemetery area that is
located close to Section 78a in the current project area.
The final archaeological period is that of European contact with native Indian
groups, especially the historic Caddo (circa A.D. 1685 - A.D. 1859). The infusion of
material goods and cultural traits brought to the area by the Europeans changed forever
the lifeways of the native Caddoan peoples. At least 89-90 Caddoan sites of this period
are known in Northeast Texas. In Cass County, five sites have produced historic
materials in association with native Indian artifacts (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:152).
These include sheet metal with a burial (41CS23), glass beads (41CS25), and a gunflint
and cut iron rod (41SC124). No Critical Resource Zones have been identified for
Historic Contact Period sites in Cass County. The major historic Indian group in Cass
County in the early 18th Century was the Kadohadacho (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.6.6).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field it is customary to conduct a records check which
consists of a visit to TARL in Austin, Texas, the state repository for site records. In this
case, however, this task was already performed by Dr. S. Alan Skinner who conducted
an archaeological evaluation for the Western Cass WSC. Skinner's report was
consulted during this survey for data regarding previously recorded sites in or near the
project area.* In addition, information pertaining to prior archaeological work in the
region was obtained from the library at BVRA. Since this is a federally funded project
governed by Section 106, no Antiquities Permit was necessary.
In the report by Dr. Skinner, 28 areas are identified for future evaluation.
However, when the topographic maps were checked against his Table (Kent and
Skinner 2001:36) and the text in the report, the actual number was 32. In order to
compensate for this error, certain section numbers were changed in Table 1 of this
report. Section 8 was changed to 8a and 8b, section 17 was added, section 73 was
changed to 53, section 78 was changed to 78a and 78b, and section 91 was changed to
91a and 91b. The four additional sections (8b, 17, 78b, and 91b) are not described in
his Table.
Skinner's record check at TARL revealed the presence of two archaeological
sites near the proposed water line (see Appendix II for site plottings). They are 41CS4
(Section 78a) and 41CS31 (Section 53). Skinner's report, however, does not make
specific recommendations as to how each section should be evaluated. Therefore, the
methods employed by the field survey crew followed a Research Design prepared by
BVRA and submitted to the reviewer, Ed Baker, prior to this investigation.
The field crew drove the water line, and each of the 32 areas was evaluated for
the presence of significant archaeological sites. In addition, road cutbanks were
examined for cultural materials. In many cases, the profile of the landform revealing the
sandy soil above the red clay was clearly visible. Four areas were only visually
inspected. These include two historic houses (sections 88 and 89) and two historic
cemeteries (sections 19 and 62). The houses will not be affected by the project as
planned, and the two cemeteries will be avoided by the WSC; therefore, they were not
recorded as historic sites.
In the remaining areas shovel testing was conducted. In all, 137 shovel tests
were dug. All earth excavated through shovel testing was screened using 1/4"
hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was kept. It should be noted that, in
addition to shovel tests, probes were dug with a shovel and auger to identify shallow
soils in some areas. These probes were not screened, numbered, or depicted on the
field maps.

8

As part of the field notebook, sketch maps depicting shovel test locations were
drawn. Profiles of all shovel tests were drawn in the field; and these profiles illustrate
the varying depths of soil throughout the project area. These notes are housed at
BVRA. Appendix II presents enlarged topographic maps depicting shovel test locations.
No shovel tests were excavated in low areas or on steep slopes. One area
(Section 112), a wide floodplain at Johns Creek, was under water. The entire floodplain
was not tested; however, certain dry areas and the banks on both sides of the creek
were examined. Section 97 was not investigated because the unpaved county road
was impassable due to standing water and fallen trees.
When possible, landowners were interviewed regarding their knowledge of
prehistoric sites in the area. Most stated that they had no knowledge of archaeological
sites on their land. A few, however, did mention that artifacts had been found on nearby
landforms out of the project area.
__________
* A check of in-house maps by the Texas Historical Commission noted the presence of
sites near the project area not mentioned in this report. A subsequent review of the
TARL site files by BVRA revealed that Dr. Skinner missed or failed to mention several
archaeological sites close to the project area. One potentially significant site (41CS189)
is directly in the path of the proposed water line route. This was reported to the client by
BVRA, and plans have been implemented to avoid it.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No previously unrecorded prehistoric sites within the project area were identified
as a result of this study. One historic site (41CS259), a 20th Century farmstead, was
found in Section 51 (see below). The absence of prehistoric sites appears to be the
result of less than ideal landforms selected for occupation or utilization by prehistoric
groups. Overall, sandy soils are very shallow overlying hard red or yellow clay. Also,
many of the areas selected by Skinner are viewed by BVRA as low probability based on
their environmental settings; slopes and low-lying areas, with some under water. It was
determined through the records check and discussions with local informants that sites
are present within the area, sometimes in close proximity to the project area right-ofway. However, as stated above, no evidence of cultural materials was found within the
"Area of Potential Effect." The shallow sandy soils may have been an important factor
in not selecting certain areas for habitation during prehistoric times. One site (41CS43),
recorded in the general vicinity and used here for comparative purposes, contained
numerous artifacts from the top level to 2.5 feet below the ground surface in a fine
sandy loam (Henderson 1979). No such setting was found in the current project area,
and shovel tests in the vicinity of this site revealed red sandy clay over a red clay with
no cultural materials present. Brief descriptions of the areas surveyed follow.
Section 8a
This area is described by Skinner as a "rise near Caney Creek." Two areas were
examined; west of the road corner and north of the road corner. Ten shovel tests
revealed shallow sandy soils overlying firm red clay between 8 and 17 cm. No tests
were dug in the boggy floodplain area directly adjacent to the creek. No cultural
materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 8b
There is no description of this area in Skinner's report. It was identified by
checking the topographic maps prepared by Skinner. As a result, Area 8 was changed
to areas 8a and 8b. Four shovel tests were excavated on the north bank. These tests
revealed shallow tan and red sands overlying firm yellow clay between 22 and 26 cm.
No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road
cutbank.
Section 17
This area is described by Skinner as a "ridge." Six shovel tests were excavated
on both sides of the ridge (three on either side), a tributary of Black Bayou, and
revealed sandy loam overlying firm red clay between 15 and 30 cm. Some ironstone
fragments were observed in the cutbank and in several tests. No cultural materials
were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.

10

Section 19
This area is described by Skinner as the "Courtland Church Cemetery." In his
report, Skinner recommends this area be avoided. The client has agreed to this;
therefore, no shovel tests were excavated.
Section 20
This area is described by Skinner as a "knoll west of Black Bayou." Five shovel
tests were excavated on this landform. Reddish sand was found to overly firm red clay
with ironstone fragments between 25 and 35 cm. No cultural materials were recovered
from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 28
This area is described by Skinner as a "bluff adjacent to Black Bayou." Six
shovel tests were excavated on the bluff top and slope and revealed red sand overlying
a firm red clay with varying depths of 20 to 30 cm and clay and sand mixed in two
areas. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the
road cutbank.
Section 29
This area is not described in Skinner's report. Five shovel tests were excavated
on the creek bank and revealed reddish sand overlying firm red clay at depths of 25 to
35 cm. Some ironstone fragments were present in several tests. No cultural materials
were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 40
This area is described by Skinner as a "ridge adjacent to intermittent tributary."
Six shovel tests were excavated on this ridge (both banks). The tests revealed a thin
sandy loam over dark clay between 25 and 35 cm. No cultural materials were
recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank and rodent burrows.
Section 41
This area is described by Skinner as "vicinity of Prairie and Bee Creeks." The
area to be examined was not shown on Skinner's map. BVRA tested a ridge
overlooking Prairie Creek. Four tests were excavated and revealed a sandy loam over
dark clay between 25 and 30 cm. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel
tests or observed in the road cutbank and rodent burrows.

11

Section 45
This area is described by Skinner as a "knoll." The area shovel tested was found
to be an old roadbed that was very disturbed. Four tests were excavated above the
creek that was very wet below the slope. Dark gray sand was found over yellow sand
and yellow sandy clay. Beneath this was firm red clay. Mixing was evident. No cultural
materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 51 (41CS259)
This area is described by Skinner as a "knoll." Seven shovel tests were
excavated at King's Branch, one on the west side (gully) and six on the east side. The
tests revealed red and tan sands overlying red clay between 6 and 24 cm. Gravels
were present in some of the tests. Just outside the right-of-way and beyond Shovel
Test 7 is a hand dug well that was part of a house site. The well was constructed of
brick and covered with mortar on the outside. The landowner told us that a house used
to be in the area but had been moved to another location. No historic artifacts were
observed in the shovel tests or on the surface within the 15 foot right-of-way. This area
was given the field designation TS-1 and later changed to 4CS259. The client was
advised to avoid this feature.
Site 41CS259 is classified in this report as a farmstead probably dating to the
early 20th Century. The well was measured at 18 inches high and 36 inches across. It
is believed to be made of low fired bricks and was covered with a Portland cement
mortar. This mortar may have been replaced several times. At the time of the survey
there were only a few cracks where bricks were visible. The ground in the right-of-way
was disturbed and revealed old asphalt in one shovel test. It was hypothesized by the
survey crew that an old road once passed close to the well. Figure 2 depicts the well
and its relationship to the right-of-way and shovel tests.
Section 53
This area (incorrectly identified by Skinner as Section 73) is described by Skinner
as a "knoll near Flat Creek." Six tests were excavated, three on either side of the creek.
They revealed tan sand overlying yellow clay between 30 and 40 cm. The tests were
excavated about 10 cm into the clay. No cultural materials were recovered from the
shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 60
For this area Skinner recommends that a route across Frazier Creek be
surveyed. No tests were dug on the north bank that was low and boggy. Three tests
were excavated on the south bank on the first terrace above the creek that was situated
below a sandstone outcrop. A red sandy clay and dark gray loamy fine sand was found
over firm red clay at 10 cm. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests
or observed in the road cutbank.

13

Section 62
This area is described by Skinner as a "historic cemetery." In his report, Skinner
recommends this area be avoided. The client has agreed to this; therefore, no shovel
tests were excavated.
Section 63
This area is described by Skinner as an "area near 41CS31" (Appendix II).
Prehistoric site 41CS31 is approximately 200 meters north of the right-of-way and on
the same landform. Six shovel tests were excavated. They revealed a fine sandy loam
and sandy clay over red and yellow clay between 12 and 16 cm. Shovel Test 6, dug at
the top of the hill on the east side of the creek, revealed a fine sandy loam mixed with
ironstone. The area below the hill was very boggy. Five tests were dug on the west
side of the creek on the hill and first terrace. No cultural materials were recovered from
the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 67
This area is described by Skinner as an "elevated area adjacent to Bee Creek."
Six tests were excavated on both sides of the creek. The tests revealed a fine sandy
loam over red clay between 8 and 15 cm. No cultural materials were recovered from
the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 75
This area is described by Skinner as "elevations near Flat Creek." East of the
creek the right-of-way consists of an old road cut with red clay at the surface. West of
the creek the area was under water. No shovel tests were excavated.
Section 76
This area is described by Skinner as a "ridge east of Mill Creek." Three shovel
tests were excavated on the ridge and revealed red sandy clay with ironstone fragments
over a firm red clay between 12 and 14 cm. One test and several probes revealed the
clay to be at the surface. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests.
Section 77
For this area Skinner recommends that the entire section be surveyed, but he
only marked a segment of the section on his map. Four shovel tests were excavated
and revealed red clay mixed with ironstone fragments. These tests were dug to 8-10
cm and terminated. The area examined covered that distance between the road and
adjacent county line. Shovel probes confirmed that this section was consisted of
shallow clay. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in
the road cutbank.

14

Section 78a
Only one Section 78 is listed in Skinner's report. After reviewing the maps, a
second area was identified. The revised sections appear in this report as 78a and 78b.
For this area Skinner recommends that the area opposite 41CS4 and new route be
tested (Appendix II). Two shovel tests were excavated in the site vicinity and revealed
very shallow red sandy clay over a firm red clay containing ironstone. The tests were
dug to 6-7 cm. Several probes were dug in the area; however, not one produced
different results. It should be noted that the water line route in this area is on the steep
slope of the hill below 41CS4. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel
tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 78b
There is no description of this area in Skinner's report. Seven shovel tests were
excavated on both sides and along a ridge between Caney Creek. These tests
revealed red clay with ironstone near the surface and a sandy clay over a red clay
between 16 and 20 cm. Areas near the creek were boggy. No cultural materials were
recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 83
For this area Skinner recommends that terrace benches be tested. Skinner's
map only depicts the bench on the east side of the creek as an area to test. Six shovel
tests were excavated, and shallow tan sand was found to exist over a firm red clay
between 12 and 20 cm. Ironstone fragments were found in one test. No cultural
materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 88
This area is described by Skinner as a "historic house." The field survey
observed that the house was outside the proposed right-of-way. Therefore, no tests
were excavated.
Section 89
This area is described by Skinner as a "historic house." The field survey
observed that the house was outside the proposed right-of-way. Therefore, no tests
were excavated.

Section 90
For this area Skinner recommends testing of a reported site location. At this
section Skinner was told of a prehistoric site nearby. BVRA interviewed the landowner
who stated that the site was on top of the hill and outside the proposed right-of-way.
Four shovel tests were dug in the right-of-way and found reddish sandy clay over
ironstone; no test was dug deeper than 20 cm. No cultural materials were recovered
from the shovel tests.
Section 91a
Only one Section 91 is listed in Skinner's report. After reviewing the maps, a
second area was identified. The revised sections appear in this report as 91a and 91b.
For this area Skinner recommends that possible site locations be tested. BVRA
interviewed the landowner who stated that artifacts might have been found in a garden
behind the house; however, this is outside the proposed right-of-way. Four tests were
excavated, two on each side of the creek. They revealed red sand with ironstone over
firm red clay between 20 and 30 cm. No cultural materials were recovered from the
shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 91b
There is no description of this area in Skinner's report. Four tests were
excavated; two on the north bank of the creek and two on the south bank. No tests
were dug on the lower slope that was very wet and boggy. The tests revealed a red
sandy clay with ironstone over a yellow clay between 10 and 25 cm. No cultural
materials were recovered from the shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 96
For this area Skinner recommends testing a bluff area. Four shovel tests were
excavated on the west bank of Thomas Lake. They revealed shallow red clay with
ironstone fragments at the surface throughout the area. BVRA interviewed one of the
landowners who mentioned a prehistoric site to the east but out of the project area.
Section 97
For this area Skinner recommends "survey and test segment." The road to this
area was impassable. Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The client has
agreed with the recommendation that the water line be placed in the disturbed highway
right-of-way.

16

Section 102
For this area Skinner recommends testing a high area. Four shovel tests were
excavated on the north bank of the creek. These tests began at the highest point on the
hill and continued to the low area adjacent to the creek. They revealed tan and dark
gray sands overlying yellow clay with water in the bottom levels of each test. Clay was
encountered between 10 and 22 cm. No cultural materials were recovered from the
shovel tests or observed in the road cutbank.
Section 109
For this area Skinner recommends that the surveyors "evaluate potential in field".
Six shovel tests were excavated, three on each side of the creek. The tests revealed
shallow tan and red sands overlying firm red clay between 10 and 38 cm. Numerous
pieces of ironstone were present in the lower levels of two tests, and one test produced
clay at the surface. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests or
observed in the road cutbank.
Section 112
For this area Skinner recommends testing Johns Creek Crossing. This is a
major creek crossing in the project area. It was very low and boggy in many areas. The
section was tested using a hand auger with holes placed on 100 foot centers going
north from the creek. In all, 13 tests were dug with three on top of the hill. South of the
creek is a low area with standing water for about 2000 feet. Ten tests in this area
revealed loamy fine sand and red sandy clay over a hard red clay between 6 and 18
inches. Then a small hill was observed. It was tested and found to contain sandy clay
over red clay at 8-10 cm.

17

SUMMARY
The route of the proposed water line follows a path adjacent to existing county
roads. No evidence of prehistoric sites was found in the right-of-way. The reason for
this is best explained in terms of the terrain encountered within the project area
boundaries. Most of the areas examined were found to be in settings containing
shallow sands and sandy clay soils overlying hard red and yellow clays. In fact, the
deepest that clay was encountered through shovel testing and with the auger was 40
cm below the existing ground surface. In several areas, clay was found to be present at
the surface, often mixed with ironstone fragments. In some cases, ironstone or
sandstone formed a solid layer beneath which shovel tests could not penetrate. It
should also be noted that all shovel tests in the project area were dug to clay or the hard
ironstone or sandstone mentioned above. In other cases, the project area followed the
slopes of hills, areas not likely to contain prehistoric sites. Thiswas particularly
evidenced by Section 90 where Skinner reported a possible site. When interviewed by
BVRA, it was learned that a site was present, although it was on top of the hill and out
of the proposed right-of-way. In other areas, the water line passed through low-lying
boggy areas, also not suitable for prehistoric occupation.

18

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that Western Cass WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Section 97 was not investigated because of bad roads. BVRA
suggests that the water line in this area be placed in public right-of-way so that
additional visits for shovel testing or monitoring will not be necessary. BVRA
recommends that the hand dug well at Section 51 (41CS259) be avoided. It is always
possible that areas containing cultural resources are missed during any archaeological
survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during
construction of the proposed water line, work in that area should be halted until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with
BVRA and Western Cass WSC.
