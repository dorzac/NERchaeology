ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey and deep testing on an estimated on 12.5 hectares (31 acres) of property proposed for
construction of the Steep Bank Village 16 (SBV16) residential development. The project
area is located immediately north of the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and two
oxbow lakes (Brushy Lake and Clear Lake), and immediately east of Long Point Creek near
Sienna Plantation in Fort Bend County, Texas. The project is being conducted at the request
of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. on behalf of Sienna Johnson Development in order to comply
with United States Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements associated with
wetlands impacted during construction in the project area.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) includes all 12.5 hectares (31 acres) of the project
area. Field investigation of the APE consisted of surface inspection, walkover, shovel testing,
and deep testing. Subsurface tests included the excavation of 12 shovel tests to an average
depth of 35 centimeters below the ground surface (cmbs) within the easternmost linear
segment of the project area. Shovel testing was supplemented by deep testing to study
paleosols identified during shovel test excavations. Using a backhoe with a smooth-edged
bucket, a total of 13 backhoe trenches (BHTs) were excavated to an average depth of 230
cmbs (7.5 feet).
BHT excavation revealed three paleosol soils including Lake Charles clays, Pledger
clay, and Brazoria clay that are common along the Brazos River and its tributaries in Fort
Bend County today.
During this investigation, cultural remains or features were not located within the
project area. Investigations indicate that for much of the Holocene, the parcel lay in a
dynamic low-floodplain setting with low to moderate archaeological potential. Its position,
just north of two oxbow lakes (Brushy Lake and Clear Lake), and proximity to the Brazos
River place it in an area frequently subjected to erosion and flooding. Due to the low
potential for near surface or deeply buried resources and lack of cultural resources identified
during this investigation, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological
work is required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as currently planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Between September 11 and September 14, 2006, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC. (HRA
Gray & Pape), at the request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. conducted intensive pedestrian
archaeological investigations and deep testing on approximately 12.5 hectares (31 acres)
associated with construction of the Steep Bank Village 16 (SBV16) residential development
near Sienna Plantation in Fort Bend County, Texas. Sienna Johnson Development owns the
project area. The project is being conducted in order to comply with United States Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) permitting requirements associated with wetlands impacted
during construction in the project area.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities
required to complete this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as
defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural
resources were located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). The APE is
includes all 12.5 hectares (31 acres) of the project area. The project took place entirely on
private property; therefore a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required. Fieldwork and
reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Texas Council of
Archeologists) and federal (NHPA) guidelines. Fieldwork required approximately 56 person
hours to complete.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area is located on the Long Point Creek United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic map (Figure 1). It is situated immediately north of the
Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and two oxbow lakes (Brushy Lake and Clear Lake),
and immediately east of Long Point Creek near Sienna Plantation in Fort Bend County,
Texas.
The area consists primarily of short grasses and the secondary growth of mixed
hardwood saplings and thick low shrubs. Disturbances within the project area include a
grassy levee and a small concrete pipe running north to south just under the ground surface
across the center of the project area. The levee is located in the northern section of the project
area and runs west to east. It is approximately 30 meters (100 feet) wide. It appears to have
been previously constructed in order to divert rising floodwater from Long Point Creek and
the two adjacent oxbow lakes away from nearby residences. No other significant
belowground disturbances were noted; however, a narrow spoil pile ridge with secondary
tree and shrub growth is present just inside the tree line south of the levee. This spoil ridge is
approximately oriented west to east and is 70 centimeters (27 inches) thick. It likely
represents the remnants of backfill soil leftover from the levee construction.

CHAPTER II. GEOMORPHOLOGY & SOILS

Long Point Creek, Brushy Lake, and Clear Lake are part of the Brazos River
floodplain, which is composed of low ridges, swales, and oxbow lakes (Abbott 2001).
Although once lined with woodland species such as oak, pecan, hickory, and elm, a
significant portion of the area appears to have been modified in the past, most likely from
agricultural use.

SOILS MAPPED IN THE PROJECT AREA
Soil Units in the project area are mapped as Lake Charles clays, Pledger clay, and
Brazoria clay that are common along the Brazos River and its tributaries in Fort Bend County
today. According to the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United
States Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA) (2005), Lake Charles series soils are
generally very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils found broad
coastal prairies. These soils formed in clayey sediments. The combined thickness of the A
horizons is 20 to 52 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) in thickness and is typically very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) clay exhibiting moderate fine blocky and subangular blocky structure. This is
underlain by three Bss horizons that range in thickness from 40 centimeters (15-inches) of
thick very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to light gray (2.5Y 6/1) clay with fine to medium angular
blocky structure with few iron-manganese concretions, many pressure faces, common
slickensides and some calcium carbonate concretions. The lower Bss horizons commonly
have some strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles. The Chorizon is generally 26 centimeters (10 inches) in thickness and is composed of massive,
very hard yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay with calcium carbonate concretions.
Pledger series soils are generally very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly
permeable soils found on nearly level flood plains. The soils formed from calcareous
stratified clayey alluvium. The combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to 76 centimeters
(12 to 30 inches) in thickness and is typically black (10YR 2/1) clay exhibiting moderate fine
granular and fine subangular blocky structure. This is underlain by two Bss horizons: Bss1,
typically a 25-centimeter (10-inch) thick black (10YR 2/1) clay similar in structure to the Ahorizon but exhibiting common prominent slickensides and many pressure faces; and the
Bss2, an approximately 50-centimeter (20-inch) thick dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay that
also can contain a few pitted concretions of calcium carbonate. A clear wavy boundary
separates the Bss2 from the underlying BCss-horizon, which is approximately 76 centimeters
(30 inches) thick. This stratum is composed of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay with weak
coarse prismatic structure. Distinct slickensides, thin discontinuous strata of silt loam and
silty clay and fine calcium carbonate concretions are also present in this stratum (SSS NRCS
USDA 2005).

The SSS NRCS USDA (2005) characterizes the Brazoria soil series as very deep,
moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick clayey sediments
found on the flood plains of the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. Brazoria soils are composed of
an A horizon followed by two Bss horizons. The A horizon is generally composed of dark
reddish brown (5YR 3/3) to reddish brown (5YR 4/3) cay that is 13-62 centimeters (5 to 24
inches) thick. These clays have medium subangular blocky to granular structure, are very
hard ad have few calcium carbonate concretions. The Bss horizons are typically made up of
dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) to dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) clay with moderate to fine
subangular blocky structure. These clays are very hard, very sticky, have common
slickensides, many pressure faces, and few calcium carbonate masses and concretions.

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING

Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of
middens of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains
such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are
more similar to generalized open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream
channels.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat
1953). The research done during that project initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay
Focus and the development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics and ceramics
(Aten 1983). Aten (1983) and Story (1990) have aptly described the cultural context of the
upper coastal region. This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a
complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleo-Indian period begins around 12,000 B.P. and
ends near 9,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). This period is poorly represented in the
archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for this period have been
verified. Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and
Golondrina point types (Aten 1983). Sites from this stage would be either buried by
alluvium or found in upland sites.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P.
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in the archaeological work in
the area but isolated finds of Bell/Calf Creek, Early-Side Notched, and Early Expanding
Stemmed dart points are attributed to this time period. The Archaic stage is thought to
include a shift towards a diet more geared towards plant processing but still includes hunting.
Plant processing technology seen during the entire Archaic period includes stone lined
hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools (Story 1990). Groups began to travel over
less of the landscape and population density seems to have risen.
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or
deeply buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). In situ, Early Archaic remains have been found at
the Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). Points from this
period include Bell, Carrollton, Trinity, Wells, and Early Stemmed. It is possible that the
Carrollton, Trinity, and Wells points continued to be used into the middle Archaic (Patterson
1996).
The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens often contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest
6

known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include
Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population
increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like the modern
climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found
in context with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the
possibility of trade (Hall 1981). Projectile points differ from earlier periods in that they are
corner-notched or expanding-stemmed forms, such as the Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain
types. Other types can be found, such as the unnotched Pamillas. These types are thought to
precede the Gary type, which can be found into the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990). During the
Late Archaic, more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late
Archaic assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten
1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late
Prehistoric include the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major
technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and late in the stage, the bow and arrow
(Story 1990). The cultural tradition during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast
has been designated as Woodland. Story (1990) has suggested the use of the term Mossy
Grove Tradition to define cultural patterns of the region. The Trinity River seems to be a
dividing line in this tradition with cultures east of the river being more similar to those in
Louisiana than to those west of Galveston Bay. The eastern tradition also seems to have
begun earlier than that in the west, beginning about 2,000 B.P. and lasting 600 years (Aten
1983; Story 1990).
Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into five distinct time intervals on the
coast, while noting that only two are found inland. Aten (1983) defined these intervals for
the area between the Brazos River and Galveston Bay as the Clear Lake (1850-1525 B.P.),
Mayes Island (1525-1300 B.P.), Turtle Bay (1300-950 B.P.), Round Lake (950-600 B.P.),
and Old River (600-250 B.P.) periods based on ceramic styles. Only the Round Lake period
is recognized by Aten for the West Bay-Brazos Delta due to the low artifact class diversity
compared to areas east of Galveston Bay as well as a time discrepancy in which equivalent
periods are later in time than those to the east (Aten 1983).
Early ceramics from this area are similar to Tchefuncte period wares found near
Sabine Lake and into Louisiana and include sandy paste varieties such as Mandeville Plain,
Goose Creek Plain (Anahuac variety), and Tchefuncte Plain (Aten 1983; Story 1990). These
early sites appear similar to pre-ceramic sites due to the low number of ceramic sherds found.
The appearance of sandy paste and sand-tempering occurs about 1900 B.P. with the O’Neal
Plain (variety Conway) being a good example (Aten 1983). Rocker-stamped decorations, a
distinctive marker for this period, are uncommon in the West Bay-Brazos Delta, as are
incised wares (Aten 1983).
The Mayes Island period brought about the introduction of the bow and arrow, which
was probably used along with the atlatl until the historic period (Aten 1983; Story 1990).
7

The arrow points during this period included both notched and expanding-stemmed forms
(Aten 1983; Story 1990).
Ceramic indicators for the Turtle Bay period include Goose Creek red-filmed along
with other decorated ceramics, all of which are rare in the West Bay-Brazos Delta area. At
the beginning of the Round Lake period, the earliest use of grog or large crushed ceramic
particles as tempering agents is seen. Typical varieties include Baytown Plain (variety San
Jacinto) and San Jacinto Incised. Along with these types, a reduction in Goose Creek types is
seen. Aten (1983) describes this period as having an increase in population due to the larger
number of sites in more specialized locations.
During the Old River period, a resurgence of Goose Creek ceramics is seen as the
Baytown types decrease in popularity. Contact with Europeans begins near the end of this
period, but visible changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D. 1750 along with
a rapid decline in population (Story 1990).

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENTS
Present day Fort Bend County was established on December 29, 1837, from parts of
earlier counties consisting of Austin, Brazoria, and Harrisburg. The town of Richmond,
which had been incorporated in May of that same year, was voted the county seat by the
citizens of the new county (Hardin 2002).
In 1821, the schooner Lively set sail from New Orleans and anchored at the mouth of
the Brazos River. Of this first contingent of Austin’s settlers, a small party continued 145
kilometers (90 miles) up the Brazos to a bend in the river. Here, in November of 1822, a
blockhouse was built. Other settlers followed and a small community that came to be
referred to as Fort Bend grew around the blockhouse. Fort Bend was located on one of the
primary fords of the Brazos River and as such, played a role in the troop movements of the
Texas Revolution. The site was abandoned when Santa Anna’s Mexican Army crossed the
river in route to the battle of San Jacinto. When the area was resettled, the new community
of Richmond was established (Leffler 2002).
The first Texas land grant is reported to have been made in 1731 for land near San
Antonio. The Mexican government continued the process after Spanish rule was toppled in
1821. The area of what is now Fort Bend County was originally settled in the 1820s as part
of the land grant to Moses Austin by the Mexican government in 1821. Having died that
same year, his son Stephen F. Austin was allowed to carry out the colonization. Of the 297
original grants to Austin, 53 were situated in present day Fort Bend County (Hardin 2002).
Persons who received grants often had a say in the size, shape, and location of the parcel,
with areas along streams and rivers the most sought-after. After the Texas Revolution, the
General Land Office (GLO) was established to manage land grants and surveys. Before new
grants or amendments to old ones could take place, the GLO required new surveys
accompanied by field notes, sketches, deeds, and other forms of documentation. Even so,
accuracy of some of the older property maps is quite flawed due to poor equipment,
inconsistent units of measure, and dangerous frontier conditions (TOBIN International 1992).
8

As was customary by the Mexican government, the league was rectangular shaped
with a quarter of it falling along the river. The original grant was written in Spanish and
appears to have been measured in varas, the Spanish yard. Barnett ultimately acquired three
leagues, two in Fort Bend County and one in Washington County, and made his home west
of the City of Richmond in Fort Bend County. Barnett attained a high degree of political
import over his life and held the titles of supernumerary member of the General Council, one
of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, chief justice of Austin County, and
House Representative of Fort Bend County for the congress of the republic. His home in
Richmond is a historic landmark (Kemp 2002). Some of Barnett’s original grant was later
purchased for the Sienna Plantation residential development located to the south (Jasinski
2002).
The Brazos River was a regional trade center in the following decades, with barges
and steamboats carrying the cotton, corn, and sugar produced in the region down to
Galveston. In 1853, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway proved a further boon
to business connecting Stafford Point to Harrisburg. African slaves were essential to the
plantation economy of the region and by the 1850s outnumbered the white inhabitants of the
county. Because of this economic reality, Fort Bend planters strongly supported the
Southern secession and the Civil War (Hardin 2002).
The economy of Fort Bend in the nineteenth century focused on cotton, sugar, corn,
and livestock production. In the 1890s, a one million dollar sugar refinery was constructed at
Sugar Land. The county also contains substantial amounts oil, gas, and sulfur deposits,
which have played a major role in the economic development of the area (Hardin 2002).
Missouri City, located near the current project area, consisted of land purchased by R.
M. Cash and L. E. Luckle, two Houston real estate investors, in 1890 and land purchased in
1893 by W.R. McElroy. All three promoted the area to citizens of St. Louis, Missouri with
McElroy eventually naming the area Missouri City to help boost the location’s appeal.
Families and businesses arrived in the area soon after the town’s official registration in Texas
in 1894. The Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado as well as the Sugar Land railroads
factored largely into Missouri City’s growth as sugarcane, cotton, corn, cattle, and the people
who worked them all used the rail for transport. Natural resources discovered and later
utilized by the city include oil, salt, and natural gas. The town eventually was incorporated
in 1956 (Cox 2002).
The current project area is a proposed development within the community of Sienna
Plantation and is situated on land originally granted to Old Three Hundred colonists William
Hall and David Fitzgerald in 1824. Parts of those leagues would eventually hold the largest
cotton and sugar plantation in Fort Bend County. In 1840, Jonathan D. Waters, a planter
from South Carolina, purchased property entailing over 1295 hectares (3200 acres). By
1860, the Waters Plantation included the main house, brick mill, sawmill, two sugar mills,
some 80 houses, and a shipping warf on the Brazos River. Over 500 slaves worked the
plantation and sugar mill (Wharton 1939). The prosperity of the plantation steadily
decreased due to the Civil War. The operation was sold to Thomas Pierce upon Waters death
in 1872 and was almost immediately sold again to Houston businessman T. W. House. Over
9

the next several years, the plantation recovered and was eventually sold to former Houston
mayor T.H. Scanlan in 1913. After Scanlan’s death, his daughters entrusted the estate to a
Catholic charitable foundation known as the Scanlan Foundation and named the property
Sienna Plantation, alluding to the Siena area of Tuscany in Italy. Through the 1950s and 60s
until 1972, the property functioned as a retreat operated by an order of nuns known as the
Cenacle sisters. Then, in 1978 the land was purchased for the planned community of Sienna
Plantation. By 2000, the development had a population of nearly 1900 (Glander 1984;
Jasinski 2002).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farms or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
Background research indicates that several cultural resources surveys have been
conducted in proximity to the project area (see Figure 1). Limited information was available
regarding the earliest survey conducted. This survey occurred in 1988 and was also
conducted on behalf of the USACE. It appears that no cultural resources were located during
that survey. In 1999, a linear survey was conducted on behalf of the Federal Highway
Administration in the vicinity of Highway 6 just north of the project area. No cultural
resources were located during that investigation.
A series of surveys were conducted in 2004. SWCA Environmental Consultants, Inc.
conducted an investigation of 1.17 hectares (2.9 acres) near Oyster Creek (Carpenter 2004).
The survey produced negative findings for cultural resources. Also in 2004, Greenstone
Geoscience conducted a survey of 10.92 hectares (27 acres) for the proposed Vicksburg
wastewater treatment plant in eastern Fort Bend County (Hubbard 2004). The survey
involved a revisit of Site 41FB155, also known as the Shipman Site. No additional cultural
resources were located during survey investigations. However, archaeologists recommended
partial protection of the Shipman Site. Finally, in 2004, HRA Gray & Pape conducted an
archaeological survey
HRA Gray & Pape also conducted an archaeological survey in the vicinity of the
project area in preparation for a temporary bridge crossing across Oyster Creek (Hughey et
al. 2004). This project consisted of survey of a 0.08-hectare (0.2-acre) section of Old Oyster
Creek in May 2004. Historic site 41FB292 was discovered during the course of the survey.
The site was composed of historic artifacts located primarily within the top 20 centimeters (8
inches) below the surface. Artifacts included low-fired brick fragments, glass, square nails,
and metal fragments. This site was not recommended for inclusion in the National Registry
of Historic Places (NRHP) (Hughey et al. 2004).

11

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization.
Background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records through the Texas Sites
Atlas (maintained by the Texas Historical Commission). As part of the literature search, HRA
Gray & Pape created a table to document previously identified resources located within a 1.6kilometer (1 mile) radius of the project area. Cultural resources identified during this literature
search included previously recorded archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural
resources surveys.

SURFACE AND NEAR-SURFACE SURVEY
Surface and near-surface field investigations consisted of intensive pedestrian survey
(a combination of walkover reconnaissance and shovel testing [Figure 2]). The entire project
area was visually inspected for historic structural remains and any evidence of artifacts on the
ground surface. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated in a staggered manner along one
transect within the easternmost linear section of the project area using a 30-meter (100-foot).
Shovel tests were excavated to an average depth of approximately 35 centimeters (13.5
inches) below the ground surface. Where possible, soils were screened through ¼-inch (.74centimeter) hardware mesh. Clayey soils were divided using hand tools and visually
inspected for artifacts. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of
each test were inspected for color or texture change potentially associated with the presence
of cultural features.

DEEP TESTING
Texas Historic Commission (THC) guidelines stipulate that for areas between 11 and
100 acres (4.45 and 40.47 hectares), one shovel test should be excavated within every two
acres (0.80 hectare). Because deep and dense clayey soils were encountered, a backhoe with
a smooth-edged bucket was used to conduct deep testing across an area covering
approximately 28 acres (11.33 hectares). A total of 13 backhoe trenches (BHTs) were
excavated within the project area (Figure 2). Typically, the BHTs measured approximately 5
meters (16.4 feet) in length with an average depth of 230 centimeters (7.5 feet). The
maximum depth of BHT excavation was 330 centimeters (10.8 feet). These depths were
pursued in an effort to reach the paleosols and determine whether any buried deposits
containing cultural resources may have been present. Eleven of the 13 trenches (BHTs 1-7
and BHts 9-12) were excavated in a north to south orientation. The two western most
trenches (BHT 8 and BHT 13) in the vicinity of Long Point Creek and two oxbow lakes
(Bushy Lake and Clear Lake) were excavated in an east to west orientation to capture

were screened or hand sifted as if they were shovel test samples.
Upon completion of BHT excavation, the eastern walls of the north to south oriented
BHTs (BHTs 1-7; 9-12) were profiled, while the northern walls of the east to west oriented
BHTs (BHTs 8 and 13) were profiled. The walls and floor of each BHT were inspected for
color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. All
trench excavations are conducted in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) excavation safety guidelines.
Soil profiles observed in all shovel tests and BHTs were described using tested
approaches for describing basic soil properties (see Munsell 2000; Schoeneberger et al. 2002;
Vogel 2002). Comparisons of soil profiles observed in the field to the soil series type section
descriptions available in SSS NRCS USDA (2005) and Mowery et al. (1960) were also
conducted.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and supplemented by consulting the on-line Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas
maintained by the THC. The goal of the research efforts was to produce a listing of all
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all historic
structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the project’s APE.
Cultural resources identified during the literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. No previously
recorded architectural resources or NRHP properties were located within the boundaries of
the current project area. Background research indicates eight previously identified
archaeological sites (41FB146, 41FB148, 41FB149, 41FB150, 41FB151, 41FB154,
41FB155, and 41FB157) are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area (see
Figure 1; Table 1).

black (2.5y 2.5/1) clay and did not facilitate screening, therefore the back dirt was hand
sorted in an effort to locate artifacts. All shovel tests were negative for cultural resources and
shovel test profiles conformed to descriptions for Lake Charles clay (SSS NRCS USDA
2005).
Deep testing conducted within the project area did not confirm the presence of any
deeply buried cultural resources. Soils revealed during mechanical trenching within the
eastern and central sections of the project were primarily composed of Lake Charles clay,
typically considered to have a low probability for containing buried cultural deposits. The
Brazoria and Pledger soil series were encountered in the western section of the project area
near natural water resources including Long Point Creek and the oxbow lakes (Brushy Lake
and Clear Lake). These soils typically have a moderate potential for containing buried
cultural deposits because of they can preserve older paleosols with intact cultural resources
(Abbott 2001:table 2), a flood prone Pledger A-horizon does not represent an environment
conducive to long-term prehistoric occupation.
While these soils generally exhibited dense clays, some evidence of a sandy/loamy
component was observed. The excavation of BHT 11 revealed a relic stream channel, which
consisted of thick deposits of very old sandy alluvium to depths below 3 meters (9.5 feet),
where the water table was encountered. Representative BHT profiles are provided in Figures
4, 5, and 6, while detailed descriptions of all excavated BHTs are provided in Appendix B.
Archaeological investigations within the project area confirmed that no cultural
resources were located within the project area during the surface to near-surface portion of
the investigation or during deep testing.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources
management survey and deep testing conducted on approximately 12.5 hectares (31 acres) of
property proposed for the construction of the Steep Bank Village 16 (SBV16) Development
near Sienna Plantation in Fort Bend County, Texas. Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a
background literature and site file search was conducted to identify the presence of recorded
sites near the project area. The search indicated that eight previously recorded archaeological
sites are located within 1.6-kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area. No previously
recorded cultural resources were identified in or adjacent to the project area.
Field investigation within the project area consisted of a combination of walkover,
shovel testing, and deep testing. Subsurface tests included excavation of 12 shovel tests
across the easternmost linear section of the project area. Shovel testing was supplemented by
deep testing to study paleosols identified during shovel testing. The deep tests included the
excavation of 13 trenches each approximately 5 meters (15.9 feet) in length.
Prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were not encountered during walkover
of the project area or during shovel test excavation and deep trenching. No evidence of
cultural features was observed in any of the soil profiles examined in shovel test profiles or
trench walls.
During this investigation, cultural remains or features were not located within the
project area. Soils data collected during survey indicates that the paleosols underlying the
parcel developed largely on low bottomland that was subjected to severe floods on a periodic
basis. Older pedons were eroded and the flood deposits formed thick layers of clayey
alluvium upon which younger soils eventually developed. The increasingly Pledger-like
character of the upper horizons in these paleosols suggests the project area was
topographically lower than today, and likely unsuitable for long-term human habitation.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required and that the
project be cleared to proceed as planned.
