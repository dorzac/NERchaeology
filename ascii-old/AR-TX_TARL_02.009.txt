ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In the nearly 10 years since the inception of the Blue Bayou project so many people and organizations have
freely given of their time and talent, not to mention financial assistance, that it becomes difficult for us to
know who to thank first. In fact, so many people filled so many different roles that it is by no mistake that
their names appear in several place. These acknowledgements follow a more or less chronological order of
the site investigations.
Speical thanks are extended to the discoverers and recorders of the site: William W. Binningham; Don Will;
and James V. Woodrick.
Following the discovery of the site, several professional and avocational archeologists met at the site to
discuss and plan excavation strategies: William W. Binningham; Grant D. Hall; Thomas R. Hester; Jake
Ivey; Ed Mokry; E.H. (Smitty) Schmiedlin; Sonny Timme; Edward A. Vogt, Jr.; Al Wesolowsky; Don Will;
and James V. Woodrick.
Shortly after the excavations were under way the Blue Bayou Committee was fonned to raise fund and
coordinate the excavations: Will Armstrong, Chainnan; William W. Binningham; Chris Buys; Melvin Lack,
Treasurer; Catherine McHaney; Sonny Timme; Edward A. Vogt, Jr.; Don Will; and James V. Woodrick.
The Blue Bayou Committee operated under the auspices of The Victoria Regional Museum Association
which was instrumental in securing a temporary lease and liability insurance for the work at the site, as well
as allowing all donations to be tax exempt.
A very special thank you to those who made financial contributions to the Blue Bayou Fund. These generous
donations made much of the field and analytical work possible: Armstrong Transfer & Storage Co.; Mr. &
Mrs. W.M. Averill; Dr. & Mrs. E.L. Bigelow; Mr. & Mrs. Lester Giese; Dr. & Mrs. Ira Jackson; Junior
League of Victoria, Inc.; Lack Stores, Inc.; Mr. Dennis O'Connor; Safety Steel Services, Inc.; Mr. Eldon
Spiegelhauer; Mr. & Mrs. Rob Thomas; The Victoria Advocate ; Victoria Chamber of Commerce; and
Victoria Preservation, Inc.
Many people spent long hot summer hours in the Victoria County sun over the two field seasons. To those
that spent many hours on the road getting to and from the site, and those who were just "next door'', goes
our deep and abiding appreciation: "The Victoria Bunch;" Will & Linda Armstrong; Dr. E.L. Bigelow;
William W. Binningham, Project Archeologist; Chris Buys ; Liz Conner; Mark Culver; Judy Farnsworth;
Pat Goebel; Susan Henderson; Melvin & Janey Lack; Catherine McHaney; Karen McWhorten; Ed Mokry;
Leigh Ann Robertson; Alex Shahan; Drusilla Singleton; Barbara Smith; Sonny Timme; Edward A. Vogt,
Jr.; Don Will; and James V. Woodrick.
Our appreciation is given to those representing the Houston Archeological Society: David Atherton; Richard
Gregg; Joe Hudgins; and Mike Johnston.
Sincere thanks is also offered to those fromThe University of Texas at San Antonio: Kenneth M. Brown;
Anne Fox; Margaret Greco; Dennis Knepper; Paul Lukowski; Ralph Snavely; Marlene Syverson; and Al
Wesolowsky.
Of this small, hardy, and dedicated group, several members stand out for special recognition:

vii

William W. Birmingham - For taking charging and not compromising one bit when it came to the
quality of excavation. Many of the gray hairs Bill has today are a product of his fifth child, Blue
Bayou.
Will Armstrong - For being instrumental in raising the capital and generating community support
for the excavations and a large portion of the analysis. Will also shot the black and white
photography at the site, often having finished proofs available the next day.
Al Wesolowsky - For his detailed burial feature assessments and continued support of the project,
even after leaving the State of Texas.
Liz Conner - For her uncommonly factual reporting the project in The Victoria Advocate, and
making Blue Bayou one of the top ten local stories in 1982.
Of course none of this would have been possible without the full support and cooperation of the property
owner, E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. Because of their involvement in the project, DuPont set an example
of corporate leadership in concert with archeologists and the community at large, that will be tough to follow.
The DuPont Victoria Plant, under Manager A.D. Cyphers and Assistant Manager James V. Woodrick
supplied a portable field lab, tool shed, sanitary facilities, shade screens and scaffolding to protect the
excavations and excavators from the elements. They also provided a surveyor to map the site, reproducing
and photo studio facilities for the duplication of site records, constructed an earthworks to divert rain water
run-off from the exposed site and erected a fence and a neon-vapor light to protect the site, which were
augmented by periodic security patrols. At the conclusion fop the field work, DuPont supplied crushed
limestone fill and topsoil to protect and conserve the site and erected a stainless steel plaque to mark the
location along with a security camera to monitor the site 24 hours a day.
The analysis that follows is the product of two Masters Theses. As graduate students we both owe a collective
debt not only to the people who provided us with the data and funding, but also to the scholars who persevered
with us during what seemed to be one of the most trying times of our academic careers, and possibly their's
as well.

We have greatly benefitted from the support, guidance, education and friendship of these fine gentlemen,
and can only hope we uphold their high standards as we pursue our doctoral degrees at The University of
Texas at Austin (JAH) and the University of Kansas (AGC).
Technical support for this research was provided by several individuals. Our thanks to Kathryn Reese-Taylor
who edited and typeset the mongraph, Ken Brown who drafted the maps and burial figures, Dan Julien who
photographed the artifacts, and Cathy Dodt-Ellis who drew the projectile points. Radiocarbon assays were
run by Sam Valastro, Jr. at The University of Texas at Austin laboratory, and stable isotope dietary analysis
were perfonned by Dr. Harold Krueger at Geochron Labs in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Both of these
scientists took the time to discuss the analytical results with the senior author which greatly benefitted the
interpretations of the site. Also, thanks to Wes Miller, soil scientist for Victoria County, for his soil core
descriptions.
Additional research grants from DuPont supported the stable isotope dietary analysis and fluoride dating.
These were authorized by plant manager Al Sampson, and the authorization for funds for the publication
of this monograph were supplied by the recent plant manager, Tom Springer.

We would be remiss if we fai1ed to mention the unflagging support offered outside the classroom. To our
many fellow grad students who patiently listened to our problems and bought us the occasional beer, thank
you. Our most heartfelt thanks to our parents, Jane and Albert Huebner, and Bonnie and Dallas Comuzzie.
Their patience, love, understanding and support insti11ed in us the drive and determination that will allow us
to fulfill our dreams. And finally, to our wives, Elizabeth and Diana, who at times must have felt cheated
upon as we directed our attention to our mistress, the word processor (and/or archeology?). Throughout this
project, and our most recent research, it is largely impossib1e to fully express our gratitude for your patience,
understanding and love, under what at times have been difficult circumstances.
Aside from the aforementioned acknowledgements, the Blue Bayou site has garnered several other awards.
Analysis of the stable isotopes was made possible through an Advanced Research Program grant (Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board) to Thomas R. Hester, The University of Texas at Austin. In 1982,
the Blue Bayou Committee was awarded the Heizer Award from the Southern Texas Archeological
Association for their efforts at the site. In 1991, DuPont was awarded the Excellence in Archeology
Preservation for the State of Texas award from The Texas Historical Commission.

CHAPTERl
INTRODUCTION

Blue Bayou (41 VT94) is a prehistoric cemetery site located on the E.I. DuPont chemical plant property in
Victoria County, Texas, approximately seven miles south of the city of Victoria. The site was identified by
three local avocational archeologists (Bill Binningham, Don Will, and Jim Woodrick) during an infonnal
survey of the DuPont property. Road construction for a new plant entrance had been halted by the
rediscovery of a circa 1940 Tenneco pipeline. From the removal of topsoil and subsequent erosion in the
construction area, two human burials were exposed in what would tum out to be the southern edge of one
of the largest mortuary sites in the Coastal Plain. Excavations at the site were carried out during two field
seasons in 1982 and 1983. The project was run by a group of avocational archeologists with the financial
and technical support of both the business and academic communities. A number of local citizens and
personnel from the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR), The University of Texas at San Antonio
(UTSA) turned out to help with the laborious task of excavation.
Based on the materials from these excavations two M.A. theses were prepared to report the results. The first
by Anthony G. Comuzzie was completed in 1987 at Texas A&M University on the bioarcheology of the
site. The second, finished in 1988, on the archeology of the site, was completed at The University of Texas
at San Antonio by Jeffery A. Huebner. The primary goals of these two studies were to fully describe and
analyze the recovered human and cultural remains in their contextual setting and to compare the findings to
similar sites and mortuary populations in nearby regions.
The initial chapter introduces the environmental setting for the local and regional climate, geology, soils,
and biota. Chapter 2 breaks the archeological background into three sections. The first section outlines the
local prehistoric chronology. The second documents the excavations and surveys that have been done by
both professional and avocational archeologists in Victoria County since 1932. The field methods used
during excavation, the character of the deposits, and the cultural stratigraphy are contained in Chapter 3.
Burial position, orientation, age, sex, and grave inclusions are described in Chapter 4 for each of the 30 burial
features, bone masses, and the seven burials partially exposed in the test pits. Chapter 5 presents the
bioarcheological analysis. Sections in this chapter contain data from the skeletal population on the topics
of demographics and biological affinity, stature and physique, and pathology, trauma, and anomalies. Other
issues discussed are the quality of subsistence, frequency and pattern of disease and metabolic stress as they
relate to the quality of life, prevalence of cultural modification of skeletal elements in particular dentition,
and the biological affinity of the Blue Bayou people with other groups in the region in tenns of genetics.
Chapter 6 documents the artifactual remains from the site. Of the few artifacts recovered, most were
primarily grave inclusions with very few individuals. These included lithic tools, primarily projectile points
and flake tools, and modified bone, antler, and shell.
The three different dating methods used at Blue Bayou are covered in Chapter 7. The temporally diagnostic
projectile E?,ints were cross-dated with the well known Central Texas chronology. Charcoal bone from the
4
site were c assayed, and a relative chronology of the burial sequence was obtained by fluoride dating.
Because the three methods do not show complete agreement, the discrepancies between the methods and
their possible resolution are further discussed.

2 /BLUE BAYOU

The final chapter, Chapter 8, is the summary and interpretation of the mortuary data. this chapter was not
contained in the original theses; it is based part on the original findings and part on new data such as stable
isotope ratio dietary analysis of the Blue Bayou population (cf. Appendix F).

Environment
The Blue Bayou site lies in a sandy terrace on the eastern edge of the Guadalupe River floodplain, adjacent
to the present day Victoria Barge Canal (Figure 1). The surface appearance of the site today, in its conserved
condition, is most likely comparable to its prehistoric state in physical appearance, if not in species
composition. It is grass covered, surrounded by motts of various oaks, elm, pecan, anaqua, and acacia. The
choice of this locale for a cemetery is easily understandable given the environmental setting of the site in
Victoria County specifically and the coastal plain in general.
CLIMATE
The climate of Victoria County is classified as humid subtropical. The dominating feature of the climate in
the Victoria region is the maritime-tropical air mass of the Gulf of Mexico, which is responsible for most of
the moisture in Texas. Fluctuations in temperature and rainfall reflect the changing of season.
During the winter, polar Canadian air masses (northers) sweep down across the Plains out into the Gulf. The
high pressure cells account for43% of the observed winds in this season (USEPA 1977:2-55). When these
storms come in rapid succession, moist air from the Gulf does not have the opportunity to come inland,
resulting in minimal humidity and precipitation (Carr 1967). Decreased frequency of northers, which is
more the norm, make for a cool, cloudy, and rainy winter with an average temperature of 55°, relative
humidity ranges between 60 and 90% during the days, with 65% of observed winds coming from the south
(USEPA 1977). Clear days are numerous with plenty of sunshine. Thunderstorms account for most of the
precipitation during the summer.
Fall is moderate: rainfall increases, but frequently there are periods of mild, dry, sunny weather (Miller
1979:2). During both spring and fall months, the Victoria region experiences mid-latitude and tropical
disturbances that cause heavy rains. Tropical disturbances during the late summer and early fall may cause
hurricanes. During the period between 1900 - 1956, 15 to 20 hurricanes made landfall between Galveston
Bay and Baffin Bay (USEPA 1977:22-48). Total annual precipitation is 38 inches with 65% falling in April
through September (Miller 1977:2).

The Blue Bayou Site lies in the West Gulf Coast section of the Coastal Plain Province (Fenneman and Johnson
1946). This region of flat, nearly featureless plain slopes gently northward from the Rio Grande Valley, to
an e1evation of 75 mat its boundary with the Balcones Escarpment, and stretches eastward into the adjacent
Gulf Coast States.
The Blue Bayou site sits on a Pleistocene to Holocene age Deweyville Formation terrace near its interface
with the recent alluvial deposits of the Guadalupe floodplain. The Deweyville group is younger than many
other fluvial and deltaic formations exposed in the Coastal Plain. These formations are from youngest to
oldest, the Beaumont, Lissie, Willis, Goliad, and Fleming, and together are comprised of poorly consolidated
to unconsolidated sediments that form generally concentric bands paralleling the coast (Barnes 1975).

Underlying these are a series of early Cenozoic and Paleozoic structures fonning the basin of the Gulf Coast
Structural Province (Hunt 1974).
The Deweyville fonnation in the lower Guadalupe Valley is a north to south trending terrace system. It is
bounded on the west by the recent alluvial Guadalupe floodplain and on the east by the Pleistocene age
Beaumont fonnation. Deweyville terraces occur along edges of the Guadalupe floodplain as far north as
Thompson and are most common near the Guadalupe's confluence with the San Antonio River. These
terraces were deposited over or cut into older material during the time span 13,000 - 30,000 years B.P.
(Aronow 1979). Geomorphic features within the terraces include point bars, natural levees, and dune
deposits; all are comprised primarily of sand, but also include gravel, silt, and clay (Barnes 1975). These
terraces show larger meander scar radii than the present day river channel. This is attributed to the greater
discharge associated with increased rainfall and glacial melt during parts of the Wisconsin glacial advanceretreat cycle (Aranow 1979).
The deposits of alluviwn in the Guadalupe floodplain are of recent or Holocene age. These consist mainly
of clays, silts, and in some areas, sands. Sand and gravel deposits found in the floodplain predate the present
alluviwn, and were caused by the same Pleistocene processes that funned the Deweyville fonnation.
The Beawnont fonnation is a massive fonnation comprised of interbedded clays, sands and silts in excess
of 60 min thickness. Concretions of calciwn carbonate, iron oxide and manganese are common in weathered
areas. Gravel deposits are common along the Guadalupe River which fonns a boundary in the topography
of the formation. To the west of the river, ancient playa lakes are associated with clay dunes aligned along
meander-belt ridges; to the east the surface is nearly featureless with poorly defined meander belt ridges
separated by black swamp deposits of clay.
The site is located approximately mid-slope at an elevation of 52.17 ft (15.9 m) MSL on the first terrace
above the Guadalupe River floodplain. This portion of the terrace juts out into the floodplain in a triangular
shape with the base along the terrace line and the apex directed to the northwest. South of the city of Victoria,
this portion of the terrace represents the most westerly point of the eastern floodplain terrace. The site is on
the southwest side of the terrace. Looking to the southwest from the site, the topography slopes down to the
:floodplain (ca. 25 ft. MSL) and the Victoria Barge Canal. The canal, constructed in 1966, utilired a portion
of a relic channel of the Guadalupe that is known as Blue Bayou. Blue Bayou has also been channeled so
that it now joins the river ca. 100 m upstream from its natural confluence. To the east the topography rises
to an elevation of ca 68 ft. MSL and opens onto the flat, almost featureless uplands.
Soils on the terrace are fine sandy loams overlying a Beawnont basal clay structure. The soils over the
Deweyville terraces belong to the Telfemer-Edena soil unit and are predominately of the Kuy, Rupley and
Rung series. These are described as: "somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained very slowly penneable
loamy soils, slightly acid in the upper parts grading to moderately alkaline in the lower parts" (Miller I
979:7).
In the :floodplain, the alluvial soils belong to the Seguin-Trinity unit. These soils are "well drained and
somewhat poorly drained, moderately penneable and slowly penneable clayey soils, moderately alkaline
throughout" (Miller 1979: 10). Soils on the upland plain are products of their Beawnont Formation parent
material. The Lake Charles - Dacoste soils are somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable clayey and
loamy soils, slightly acid in the upper parts to moderately alk.aline in the lower (Miller 1979:5).

The Soil Conseivation Seivice has identified the soil in which the Blue Bayou site lies as belonging to the
Runge Series (Miller 1979:75-76). These soils are described as "deep, gently sloping on breaks and hillsides
above large streams in irregular to elongated areas" (Miller 1979:29). A typical profi1e has a 30 cm thick
surface layer that is "neutral, very dark, grayish brown, fine sandy loam." The subsoil is ca. 95 cm thick
with a color gradient: The upper part is "neutral sandy clay loam that is dark reddish brown," the middle is
"yellowish brown," and the base of the subsoils is "a strong brown." Below the subsoil to a depth of 160
cm is a "calcareous, moderately alkaline, reddish yellow sandy clay loam." Confirmation of this data is
difficult in light of the machine scrapping on the site surface and lack of detailed excavation profiles. Based
on grain size, reaction, and Munsell color data provided in the County Soil Guide compared with soil samples
from the site, it appears that the soil in the site is indeed that of the Runge series.

BIOTA
The Coastal Bend region represents the southern edge of the Texas biotic province as defined by Blair ( 1950).
This province forms a broad ecotone between the wetter forested Austroriparian province to the east and the
dryer grassland and thorny brush country associated with the Tamaulipan province to the west (Blair 1950)
Within this ecotonal setting both forest and grassland environments are found creating a diverse ecological
setting with a number of community types.
The grasslands of this region have largely been removed by cultivation, of the estimated 8,000,000 ha of
native grasslands less than 10% remain (Smeins et al. 1989). These remnant grasslands constitute the Upper
Coastal Prairie of Texas (Diamond and Smeins 1984) which is the southern most extension of the Tallgrass
Prairie (Risser et al. 1981).
Two community types were identified by Diamond and Smeins (1984:329). These are based on topography,
soils and associated vegetation. The lowland community in clayey soils is dominated by Tripsacum
dactyloides (eastern gamma grass), and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) in poorly drained areas, and
Schizachyrium scoparium (little blue stem), Paspalum jloridanum (Floridia paspalum), and T. dactyloides
in well drained areas. Secondary species include Sorghastrum nutans (Indian grass), Bachloe dactyloides
(buffalo grass), Carex microdonta (sedge), Fimbristylis puberla (Fimbry), Scleria ciliata (nut rush), and
Aporobolus asper (meadow dropseed).
In the upland community the primary species is Schizarachyrium scoparium, followed by Paspalum
plicatulum (brown seed pasplalum), Sorghastrum nutans, and Fimbristylis puberula. Secondary species in
the uplands are Dichanthelium oligosanthes (panicium), Paspalum jloridanum, Scleria citicta, and
Sporobolus asper. Over clayey soils Buchloe dactyloides and Carex microdanta are important secondary
species, along with Aristida purpurascens (purple threeawn), Mahlen bergia capillaris (muhly), and
Paspalum setaceum (thin paspalum) over loamy soils. In the coastal margin Spartina sp. (cordgrass), Setaria
sp. (bristlegrass), and Scirpus bergsonii (bulrush) are common.

While the present day grasslands of the Upper Coastal Prairie still reflect the species listed above, cultivation,
the invasion of weed and woody species, the introduction of commercial grasses, and the heavy grazing of
cattle ranching has changed the overall balance of vegetation. It is thought that the successional pathways
of this tall grassland are more complex and diverse than others to the north, but these and the resultant
grassland communities as yet remain unstudied in any detail (Diamond and Smeins 1984).
Although grasses are the dominant plant species in the area, the Coastal Prairie was never a vast tree1ess
plain. Stands of hardwoods in the uplands and climax riparian forests in river and stream bottoms are

6 /BLUE BAYOU

characteristic of the area. Upland hardwood motts are dominated by Quercus stellata (post oak) and Q.
marylandica (blackjack oak) along with Q. virginiana (live oak). These upland stands generally have an
open understory, however, in many localities in the southern portion of the region, woody invaders such as
Acacia smallii (huisache), Prosopis grandulosa (mesquite), and Ehretia anacua (anacua) for a secondary
canopy. These species have recently established their own territories creating brushland areas reminiscent
of south Texas.
In the stream and river bottoms a diverse riparian climax community of woody species can still be found in
many areas. Primary species include Platanus occidentalis (sycamore), Carya illinoiensis (pecan), Ce/tis
pallida (hackberry), M orus rubra (red mulberry), Ulmus americana (elm), and U. crassifolia (cedar elm).
Along the stream edges, Saliz niga (black willow), and Populus deltoides (cottonwood) are nwnerous, and
Quercus virginiana is common along the up slope margins.
The rich diversity of floral species in the Coastal Prairie creates a mosaic of microenvironments that Lehmann
(1965) views as an assemblage of prairies. The upland hardwood motts and riparian communities divide
the diverse grasslands, making the Upper Coastal Prairie different from the other tall grass areas of North
America.
Terrestrial mammalian species are nwnerous throughout the Coastal Plain region, although none are endemic
to the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950: 101). The ecotonal nature of this province draws woodland species
from the east and grassland tax.a from the west and south to exploit its diverse primary community. Common
woodland species, which make up the bulk of mammalian community include Didelphis virginiana
(oposswn), Procyon lotor (raccoon), Odocoileus virginianus (white tail deer), Sciurus sp. (squirrels),
Sylvilagus sp. (rabbits), and Geomys personatus (Texas pocket gopher). Urocyon cinereoargenteus (gray
fox), Felis rufus (bob cat), and Scalopus aquaticus (eastern mole) are also prevalent along with at least three
tax.a of mice. Species common to grassland habitats include Dasypus noveminctus (nine band armadillo),
Lepus californicus (blacktailjackrabbit), Canis latrans (coyote), Baiolys taylori (gopher), and several tax.a
of mice. No longer present but found in the historical and archeological record are the tax.a Bison bison
(American buffalo), Antilocapra americana (pronghorn), Ursus americanus (black bear), Felis onca
(jaguar), and F. concolor (mountain lion). For further data on the mammals of the coastal plain and Texas,
the reader may consult Davis (1974) and Graham, Semken, and Graham. (1987: 10).
The class Aves is by far the most diverse group of vertebrates represented in the region. In their survey of
the Coleto Creek reservoir in Victoria County, Environmental Consultants, Inc. (1975) identified over 250
species of avifauna in that small area. The majority of these are songbirds, but economic avifauna such as
Anas sp., Aythya sp. (ducks), andBrants sp. (geese) migrate through the area annually on the central flyway
(Lincoln 1950).
The marine environments that correspond to the central Coastal Plain are known as the Rockport area. This
region, which stretches from Aransas Pass to Pass Cavallo, contains four bays or bay systems. These are
from south to north:
1. Aransas Bay Complex: Aransas, Copano, Mission, and St. Charles Bays;
2. Mesquite Bay;
3. San Antonio Bay Complex: San Antonio, Hynes, Guadalupe Bays, and Mission Lake;
4. Espiritu Santo Bay.
The varying fauna communities found in the Rockport area are largely products of the saline qualities of the
waters. The overall saline content of the Rockport area is more stable in terms of short term variation, but

/NfRODUCf/ON I 7

of higher saline content than the Mississippi delta region (Parker 1959:2104). Changes in salinity within
the bay systems are greatly influenced by the climatic patterns of the inland areas. During periods of
prolonged drought, the salinity of the bays increases slowly over a period of years until many of the bays
show a saline content higher than the Gulf beyond the barrier islands.
Therefore, drought conditions in Texas bays convert the bays' nonnal positive estuarine condition to
Pritchard's inverse estuarine condition in which evaporation exceeds river runoff and precipitation (Parker
1959:2109). Conversely, when rainfall and runoff are high such as in flood conditions, the salinity of the
bays can drop to nearly zero in a matter of days.
The San Antonio Bay system is fed primarily by the Guadalupe River, and the delta of this river is 32 km
from the Blue Bayou site. Within this bay/estuary system a variety of environmental types and faunal
communities are present; these are classified primarily on their salinity, along with temperature, bottom
sediments, and currents. Environments include seven types, three of which are in the San Antonio Bay
system.
In Mission Lake, Guadalupe Bay, Hynes Bay and San Antonio Bay, the river influenced environment type
is present. During periods of droughts and high salinity, the river influence type is confined to Mission Lake,
Guadalupe Bay, the north shore of San Antonio Bay, and the east shore of Hynes Bay. During periods of
high water, this type expands to cover all of Hynes Bay and the western half of San Antonio Bay. This type
is characterized by 1 - 30% salinity, with a temperature between 1 -38°C. Currents are weak, depth is 30130 cm, the bottom is clayey-silt, and silty-clay (Parker 1959:Table 7). Economic fauna include Rangia
cuneata (rangia), Macom mitchelli, and with the proper conditions, Mucrobrachium ohion (river shrimp)
(Hedgpeth 1949). These species are all common during periods oflow salinity.

The enclosed bay environmental type is characteristic of the outer area of San Antonio Bay. During high
rainfall and increased runoff, it is the northernmost area of this type as it extends southward into the Mesquite,
northern Aransas, and Copano Bays. When rainfall is scarce, this system is truncated at Mesquite Bay to
the south and increased salinity, open bay conditions encroach from the north. Oyster reefs are numerous;
these act to retard circulation in the bays and function as natural boundaries to separate this environment
from the low salinity river influenced and high saline open bay environments. The enclosed bay environment
is characterized by 3 - 40% salinity and a temperature between 10- 34°C. Currents are weak, depth is 30200 cm, and the bottom is silty-clayey, sand, silt, and clay (Parker 1959:Table 1).
Seven species of invertebrates are common to this environment with the pelecypods Tagelus plebius and
Ensis minor being of economic value. The oyster reefs particular to this environment are an important part
of enclosed bay assemblage but have been studied separately by a number of authors (cf. Norris 1953;
Galtsoff 1931). The primary species in these reefs is Crassostrea virginica (bay oyster). Optimal salinity
for this species is between 12 - 25% (Parker 1959:2122), but these conditions fluctuate and at present are
not evident in the Rockport study area. Puffer and Fmerson (1953:540) concluded that the reefs have a long
history, and the environmental conditions have caused long periods of productivity interspaced with periods
in which living oysters were not present. During periods of stable low salinity (less than or equal to 25% ),
Crassostrea virginica dominates along with the presence of fourother species represented at the reefs become
the habitat of at least 18 marine invertebrates more tolerant of the higher saline conditions (cf. Puffer and
Fmerson 1953; Parker 1959). Most remarkable of this community change is the reduction of live C. virginica
and the incre~e of Ostrea equestris (horse oyster) along with the addition of Crangon heterochelis (shrimp).

8 /BLUE BAYOU

The high salinity bay margin environment is found only during periods of low rainfall and high salinity. It
occurs along the inland side of the barrier islands and along the shoreline of Aransas and Espiritu Santo bays.
Its absence along the shores of the San Antonio and Mesquite Bays is the result of current patterns that move
river discharge along the south coast of San Antonio Bay into Mesquite Bay (Parker 1959:Figure 9). This
environment is characterized by 3 - 42% salinity with a temperature range of 3 - 36°C. The bottom is sand,
silt, and clay with a depth up to 160 cm; currents range from weak to strong (Parker 1955 :Table 1). At least
18 species of invertebrates are found in this environment with the majority being Palecypods. Economic
species include the clams, Trachycardium muricatum, Mercenaria campechienses, Macoma constricta, and

Cyrtopleura costata.

CHAPTER2
ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
Local Background
The first professional archeology done in Victoria coWity was at the Morhiss site (41 VTl) located along the
Guadalupe River six miles south of Victoria, Texas. A.T. Jackson and two associates trenched the central
portion of this river terrace remnant site in 1932 and recovered few artifacts (Woolsey and Jackson 1932).
Six months later A.M. Woolsey and students, primarily from The University of Texas, Austin, opened four
trenches in the site. The longest was 45 m in length and ranged between one and four meters in depth
(Woolsey 1932). After completion of the excavations atthe Morhiss site, Woolsey and his crew trench-tested
four other sites: Peach Tree Knoll, Spring Creek (41VTI), Doc Hiller(41VT10), and Vic Urban (41VT12),
in Victoria CoWity during JWie and July of 1932 (Woolsey 1932).
The Morhiss site was again the focus of archeological investigation when W.A. Duffen supervised WPA
work crews in excavations during the period from October 1938 through January 1940 (Campbell 1976:82).
These excavations showed two cultural zones, an upper layer of midden deposit and a lower Pleistocene
level separated by a Holocene terrace remnant (Duffen 1939). In February of 1940, Duffen's crew dug 11
test trenches in the Jackson site (41VT3). Duffen (1940:2) noted the cultural continuity of recovered
materials and commented that the projectile point types were common "to the burnt rock middens of Central
Texas; that is the deeply indented base type [Pedemales]."
The period between the closure of the Jackson site in 1940 and the opening surveys of the Coleto Creek
Project in 1975 represents a near hiatus in professional archeology in Victoria CoWity. Except for
Campbell's (1963) paper presented at the annual Texas Archeological Society (TAS) meeting in Victoria
and the 1968 TAS field school at Presidio Loretto (Davis 1968; Richmond, Richmond and Greer 1983),
there are no published data. Much of the archeology of Victoria CoWity was done by avocationals during
the latter part of this 40 year period.
During 1961 W.W. "Bill" Birmingham carried out an extensive excavation of the upper deposits of the
Johnston-Heller site (41 VT15) on Rocky Creek. These excavations showed extensive Archaic deposits, and
the erosional bluff face on the west edge of the site showed extensive cultural depth. Paleoindian projectile
points and Qear Fork tools from the site were reported by Birmingham and Hester (1976).
Throughout the period 1962 - 1965, Ed Vogt excavated a substantial portion of the Vic Urban site (41VTl2)
that was first tested in 1932 by Woolsey. Contrary to Woolsey's (1932) minimal recovery of two projectile
points and a scraper, Vogt's excavations Wicovered dense cultural and faWial remains including diagnostic
artifacts of the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic periods and several human burials.
Virgil Branch and Cecil CalhoWI conducted salvage excavations on a large portion of the Texas West Indies
Ranch site (41VT9) in 1961 after road construction had exposed several burials. During their field work
they documented seven burial features containing the remains of 14 individuals and collected the scattered
remains of at least eight others (Birmingham and Huebner 1991). Over 400 artifacts have been collected
from the site over the years. Diagnostic artifacts indicate occupation of the site during most of the Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods. Perdiz arrow points, bone tempered pottery, along with Scallorn arrow points,
are representative of the Late Prehistoric occupations. Many of these Scallorn points have denticulated

9

10 I BLUE BAYOU

lateral edges and asphaltwn on the hafted portion of the stem. Archaic-age artifacts include Palmillas,
Mortriss, and Tortugas dart points, as well as Guadalupe and Oear Fork tools.
The data presented for the above three sites was taken from the excavators' field notes. It is interesting to
note that the field methods utilized compare well with the professional standards of the day. The sites were
dug in five foot squares on a north-south horizontal grid using six inch arbitrary levels. They have permanent
datwns and proveniences for the artifacts recovered. Along with these excavations, local avocationals have
recorded and surveyed the majority of the known prehistoric sites in Victoria County. The most notable
survey is that of Birmingham and Schmiedlin along the Rocky Creek drainage where 18 sites have been
recorded and collected.
The first large scale survey in the Victoria County area was done in 1975 by the Center for Archaeological
Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio. This survey for the Coleto Reservoir Project located and
recorded 49 sites along the Coleto, Turkey, Perdido, and Sulphur Creek drainages that would be affected by
construction of the reservoir and associated power station (Fox and Hester 1976). Of these sites, 27 were
recommended for further survey and testing in the second phase of the project (Fox and Hester 1976:72).
The findings of the intensive survey and testing program reported by Fox et al. (1979) were that two
significant sites on the Goliad County side of Coleto Creek, 410021 and 410030, warranted full excavation.
The survey showed considerable temporal depth of occupation in the Coleto drainage; sites ranged in age
from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric with Archaic sites being the most numerous (Fox et al. 1979:61).
Excavations to mitigate damage to 41 GD2 l and 41002 lA were carried out using controlled excavation and
back hoe trenching during December 1977 and January 1978. Various special studies including geomorphology and paleoenvironmental analyses were conducted in conjunction with analysis of the prehistoric
cultural materials which ranged in age from Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric (Fox 1979). The only
radiocarbon date associated with the Mortriss Complex, a local Archaic pattern defined by Calhoun (1965),
was obtained from 410021. The 720 +/- 370 B.C. (TX-2925) assay suggests the Morhiss Complex falls in
the terminal Middle Archaic period.
At the Berger Bluff site (410030) a single 3 x 4 m controlled excavation unit was opened in the upper
deposits of the site, showing a period of occupation similar to 410021 (Brown 1983). Excavation on a
lower bench of the site near creek level revealed a hearth feature that has been radiocarbon dated by wood
charcoal. Two assays yielded ages of 11,550 +/- 800 yr. B.P. (TX-3569) and 10,190 +/- 160 yr. B.P. (Beta
16979), which place the site in the terminal Pleistocene. While no diagnostic artifacts were found, the site
is valuable for its fauna! remains and paleoenvironmental data (Brown 1978).
McReynolds (1981, 1983) reportedPaleoindianartifacts from surface contexts in the Coleto creek area, these
included Golondrina and Plainview dart points. Four Scottsbluff points from Victoria and De Witt Counties
were documented by Birmingham (1980). Two were from the surface and two from excavations.
Excavations at the J-2 Ranch site (41VT6) on Arenoso Creek were first undertaken by Birmingham and
Schmiedlin during 1961 - 1963, and later by the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) in
1976 - 1977 (Fox et al. 1978). The early excavations were primarily along the creek bank in thin soils.
Projectile points associated with the Paleoindian period recovered from excavation and surface contexts
include Plainview, Meserve, Golondrina, Scottsbluff and the "weak shouldered" lanceolate type that has
been reported at Johnston-Heller (Birmingham and Hester 1976). The STAA excavations concentrated on
the high ground above the creek banks. In these excavations Late Prehistoric through Paleoindian materials

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND / 11

exposed. The J-2 site has shown the most complete chronological sequence yet excavated in Victoria County.
Additional Scottsbluff points from J-2 were reported by Birmingham and Mitchell (1978).
A single human burial was exposed by construction at the Victoria Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.
This isolated burial was excavated by CAR (Center for Archaeological Research) staff and reported by Potter
and Spencer (1980).
Two multi-county surveys for pipeline and transmission lines have crossed portions of Victoria County.
Results of the South Texas Project transmission line were reported by Dillehay et al. (1975) and the Del Norte
pipeline survey was reported by Taylor (1979).
Another important site in Victoria County is the Burris Site (41 VT66). This site, which lies just outside the
study area of the Coleto Reservoir Project (see Fox and Hester 1976) was exposed by power line construction
on the D. L. Burris property in May 1978. The next month, Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority bulldozers
removed a large portion of the site during construction of a flume for the Coleto dam. The site was visited
and surface collected by local avocationals shortly afterward (Schmiedlin 1979) and again by the CAR staff
in June 1979 (Brown 1983). Cultural materials recovered consist of Archaic dart points, various bifaces and
preforms, and a modified quartzite cobble (cf. Chadderdon 1976). Various faunal remains were recovered,
including a number of bison skeletal elements. Schmiedlin (1979) conducted posthole tests and estimated
the cultural deposits to be at least two meters in depth. Recently, the Burris site has been investigated by the
senoir author and local avocationals. A 12 m square excavation block has exposed a Toyah Horizon bison
processing feature (Huebner 1987b) and sondage testing has shown that the cultural deposits are much deeper
than previously suspected, possibly as deep as four meters.
Outside of Victoria County, two large surveys are noteworthy. West of Victoria, in Jackson County, the
Palmetto Bend Reservoir was surveyed (Wakefield 1968; Mallouf, Fox, and Briggs 1973) and tested (McGuff
1978). The proposed Cuero Reservoir in Dewitt County to the north was surveyed by Fox et al. (1974). For
a complete review of the archeology of the Coastal Bend region, the reader is referred to Shafer and Bond
(1983).

Mortuary Sites Background
Late Archaic period and Late Prehistoric cemetery sites are not uncommon in the Central Coastal Plain and
adjacent archeological regions (Figure 2). Cemetery sites within these areas that are published, or for which
extensive field notes exist, are reviewed in this section. A cemetery site is defined here as one with five or
more human interments. Sites that contain five or less human burials are cited but not discussed in detail.
THE CENTRAL COAST AL PLAIN

The Vic Urban site (41VTl2) located 3.5 km southwest of Victoria, rests on the floodplain/terrace margin
on the western edge of the Guadalupe River floodplain. The site is a mixed occupation/cemetery site.
Thirteen human interments were excavated from as 8 x 16 m area of the site. Because this site is unpublished
and potentially important in defining mortuary patterns in the Central Coastal Plain region, individual burial
descriptions are presented here. These burials are interpreted from field drawings and photographs, and are
numbered in the same order as presented in the field notes.
Burial 1: This is a bundle burial consisting of a skull and long bones. The long bones are oriented
east-west with the skull face down to the north of the long bones.

Burial 6: 'Ibis is an extended burial on its back oriented southeast-northwest
Burial 7: 1his is a tightly flexed burial on its back. The legs and anns are drawn into the chest
oriented to the sagittal section. A second skull of an apparently younger individual was placed in
the neck region at the time of intennent. The burial is oriented east-west.
Burial 8: 'Ibis is an extended burial on its back, it is oriented southeast-northwest. The lower right
leg and foot are missing.
Burial 9: 'Ibis is a bundle burial consisting of long bones, ribs, and a skull. Ribs and long bones are
oriented east to west. The skull is facedown to the west of the other remains.
Burial I 0: 'Ibis burial was partially looted prior to excavation; all that remained were the pelvis and
legs. The burial was flexed with the feet drawn up under the pelvis. From this position it appears
that the individual was interred in an upright kneeling position facing to the northeast
Burial 11: This is an extended burial on its back oriented southeast-northwest.
Burials 12 and 13: These two burials are somewhat unique. Both are extended burials interred on
their backs oriented south to north. Both skulls and sagittal planes are oriented on a north-south line.
The northern most burial (Burial 12) has its legs crossed below the knees. The pelvis of Burial 13
is beside the skull of Burial 12 which is out of position of function. It appears that one of the two
following scenarios took place: The intennents were simultaneous, or Burial 13 was interred a short
time after Burial 12. The position of Burial 13 's legs make it appear that Burial 12 was encountered
during the preparation of burial 13 's grave. Therefore, the grave was enlarged to the west to
accommodate burial 13 's legs without disturbing the recently interred Burial 12.
All burials at the site were discovered between 60 and 75 cm below the present surface. No evidence of grave
pits is mentioned in the notes and all burials appear to be adults. No artifacts are associated with any of the
burials and preservation oflong bones and craniums appears to be good. Stratigraphically, the burials are in
a level with predominately Archaic materials, one to two levels below the bulk of the Late Prehistoric
assemblage.
Based on this evidence the dating of the burials is ambiguous. The extended burial position seen in six of
the burials, is a hallmark of the Late Archaic (cf. Hall in press), however the lack of grave goods and the
stratigraphic position of the burials suggests an early Late Prehistoric context. It is quite possible that this
site was used as a mortuary locality over both temporal periods.

The Goebel site (41AU1), is located in northern Austin County, Texas, along Mill Creek, a tributary of the
Brazos River. The site was discovered in October 1959 when it was bulldozed for fill dirt (Fleming and
Fleming 1959). The site was excavated by the Houston Archeological Society in that same year. A total of

14 I BLUE BAYOU

42 human burials were recovered in extended, flexed, and semi-flexed positions (Duke 1981). Artifacts in
association with burials included conch columella beads and gorgets from the outer whorl of the conch shell,
bone awls, and sandstone abraders. Blocks of sandstone were arranged around the head of each burial (Duke
1981). Artifacts recovered from the "midden" portion of the Goebel site suggested a long period of
occupation, spanning the Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Duke 1982a; 1982b).
The Ernest Witte site (41AU36), reported by Hall (1981), is the largest cemetery in southeast Texas. It is
located in southeastern Austin County on a bluff overlooking the Brazos River floodplain. Four stratigraphically discrete burial groups were identified spanning from the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric
periods. The latest burial group, Group 4, contained 12 flexed intennents oriented headward to the east and
southeast. No artifacts were found with these burials, and Hall (1981:53) dated them as" ... assuredly Late
Prehistoric ... probably deposited late in the sequence."
A total of 10 semi-flexed intennents constituted Group 3 at 41AU36; their headward orientation was
generally to the north-northwest (Hall 1981). Seven Godley points were found with Burial 154; no other
artifacts were associated with this group. Based on these projectile points, Hall (1981) dated this group to
the period ca. A.D. 550 - 950.
The largest burial group at the Ernest Witte site was Group 2, with a total of 145 individuals. The majority
of these were in an extended position oriented headward to the southwest. Other intennent styles included
a single flexed and 17 semi-flexed primary burials, two bundle burials, and three cremations (Hall
1981:85-86). Nearly half of the burials included grave goods in the fonn of conch beads and pendants, 11
fonns of worked bone, boatstones, "comer-tang bifaces," deer antlers, ocher, and dart points. Two
radiocarbon dates run on human bone from Group 2 yielded corrected dates of 520 B.C. and A.D. 360; the
latter was felt to be the more representative of the two dates (Hall 1981:53).
Burial Group l, the oldest in the site, contained 61 burials. The majority were extended with headward
orientation to the southeast. Flexed, semi-flexed, and cremations were also noted. Grave goods from this
group included a single Pedemales dart point and several worked bone artifacts. Two radiocarbon dates on
human bone yielded corrected dates of 1530 B.C. and 2610 B.C. (Hall 1981 :53).
The Brandes site (41AU55), in northern Austin County was discovered in 1987 when a small rise nearthe
Pecan Branch of Mill Creek was bulldozed for sand (Highley et al. 1988). Four individual burials were
excavated from the bulldozer cut and the remains of three more were recovered from the spoil pile. The
burials were in semi-flexed positions, on the right side with heads oriented to the south. Artifacts found with
the burials and in the bulldozer cut included three Ensor dart points and two large sterned bifaces. Artifacs
of bone and marine shell were typical of those found in mortuary sites in this region. Two pointed bone
tools, one with an incised pattern, along with a conch shell bead, pendant, and two long columella pins.
The Piekert site (41WH14), was located at the confluence of Qarks Branch and the West Bernard River in
Wharton County, five miles (8 km) west of Hungerford, Texas (Kindall 1980:5). A total of 10 burials and
a single isolated pelvis were recovered from the site. Headward orientation of the burials is predominantly
southward and all are in a semi-flexed position, with the exception being a single tightly flexed burial. Two
burials, a female and an infant, show evidence of violent death; a Yarbrough dart point was found in the ribs
of the woman (Kindall 1980:7). Only two burials had grave goods -- bone and shell beads occurred with
Burial 8 and a necklace of bone pendants was with Burial 1. Red ocher was found with most of the burials.
Hall (in press) dates this site as contemporary with the Crestmont site (41WH39), ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 400.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND / 15

The Crestmont site (41 WH39), was situated on a low rise south of a remnant channel of Chaney Creek and
northeast of the present-day Colorado River in central Wharton County (Vernon 1988). A total of 31 burials
was identified by Vernon (1981) in her skeletal analysis of the site. Headward orientation of the majority
was east to northeast with three to the southwest. The most common burial position was extended. However,
one flexed and one semi-flexed were also represented. Grave goods were included with 21 burials. These
were found to contain lithospermum seed beads, incised bone pins and ornaments, conch columella beads
and dangles, conch pendants and gorgets, one large-stemmed, unclassifiable biface, Palmillas dart points,
antler tines, sandstone, and ocher. Vernon (1988) hypothesized that the Crestmont site was used earlier in
the Late Archaic period by the same group of people that buried their dead at the Ernest Witte site (Group
2).
In southern Fort Bend County, the Albert George site (4lFB13) is located on the west bank of Big Creek, a
tributary of the Brazos River. A preliminary report by Walley (1955) documents two periods of excavation
in 1951 and 1954. While exact numbers are not given, 15 to 27 burials were excavated. Burial positions
were given for only two individuals, one semi-flexed, the other extended with legs crossed. No orientation
is noted. Grave goods include a large number of bone implements, many with incised designs and perforations
at the proximal end At least 26 of the these incised bone tools came from a single cache in Plot VIII (Walley
1955 :233). Other artifacts include six dart points with one burial, and a boatstone and two columella pendants
found on either side of the skull of a female burial. These pendants are 7. 0 - 7 .5 cm in length, are perforated
at one end, pointed at the other end, and incised around the 1.5 cm diameter.

THE CENTRAL COASTAL REGION
The Green Lake site (41CL13) is a small cemetery site located on a low bluff on the southeastern shore of
Green Lake in Calhoun County (Wingate and Hester 1972). Ten individuals, nine adults and one juvenile
were buried in flexed or tightly flexed positions. Skeletal orientation is predominately north and south with
the head being in either direction. The intennents intruded into a rangia and oyster shell midden which
contained sherds of Rockport ceramics and lithic debitage. Artifacts associated with the burials were an
incised bone object and bead, a carved stone disc and a reworked stemmed dart point (Wingate and Hester
1972: Figure 4).
In San Patricio County, Hester and Corbin (1975) reported two burial sites along the strand line of Red:fish
Bay, that were exposed by beach erosion. At 41SP64, the exposed burials were looted by locals and thus no
data is available on the number of individuals, burial positions, or extent of the cemetery area. Some of the
skeletal material and artifacts consisting of lithics, Rockport ceramics, and conch shell were donated to the
Corpus Christi Museum. Corbin carried out test excavations at the site in May of 1967 and recovered artifacts
associated with the Rockport Focus, but discovered no evidence of further human remains.
At 41SP78, which is approximately 760 m southwest of 41SP64, the remains ofat least five individuals, four
adults and one juvenile (Wesolowsky 1975), were excavated by locals (Hester and Corbin 1975). Interviews
with the excavators revealed that all the intennents were extended with the apex of the crania oriented
southward. The burials were tightly grouped but no data is available on the extent of the cemetery. Grave
goods associated with the burials included a conch shell object, a large biface, an Ensor-like dart point, and
two incised bone objects. Two of the burials contained stacks of bivalves with heavily worn edges that the
authors postulated acted as scoops for excavation of the graves (Hester and Corbin 1975:522).
In August 1950, Jack Hughes and crew excavated the Odem Burial Site (41SP1) located on an unnamed
minor drainage southeast of Odem, Texas. Ten human burials along with numerous isolated long bones,

16 /BLUE BAYOU

mandibles, and crania, labelled as features, were excavated (Hughes 1950). The intennents were flexed or
semi-flexed on their right or left side, cranial orientation was to the east or southeast. Five of the burials
(Burials 4,6,7 ,8,and 9) appear to be a single burial episode. A serrated Scallorn arrow point associated with
Burial 3 and three pieces of sandstone were the only artifacts in the cemetery.
The largest cemetery of suspected Late Prehistoric age in the Central Coast yet excavated is the Callo del
Oso Burial site (41NU2). This site, at the mouth of False Oso Creek, on Co:rpus Christi Bay was excavated
by The University of Texas in 1933 (Jackson 1933). Of the 93 burials excavated the majority were in flexed
positions on their left sides with hands to face. The apex of the crania were generally oriented eastward
toward the creek. Grave goods were generally sparse, and consisted of shell objects, bone tools, and few
lithics. Jackson (1933: 115) noted a high incidence of infant mortality as 32 of the burials were infants or
juveniles. The site was used over a long period of time as evidenced by a number of more recent burials
that intruded into and disturbed older intennents.
The Berryman Site (4 lNUl 73) was partially salvaged by avocational archeologist E.R. Mokry, Jr. of Co:rpus
Christi in 1978 and 1979. The site is approximately 14 miles east of Co:rpus Christi, on a terrace of Turkey
Creek, a tributary of the Nueces River (Mokry 1979). Excavations recovered 16 primary human burials and
16, possibly 18, other burials or partial burials were recorded prior to construction of a house on the site.
The majority of the burials were in flexed positions with hands to face; headward orientations were primarily
to the east and northeast. Grave goods were not common, and occurred with only four intennents. They
included modified bone, a Dinocardium sp. shell pendant, a triangular biface, a lump of river clay, and a
modified Busycon sp. shell from which a rectangular blank was removed from the body whorl by the groove
and snap technique. One individual (Burial lOB) apparently died a violent death. Three arrow points, two
serrated Scallorn and one triangular dart point, were found in the chest cavity; three of these imbedded in
bone. This burial is illustrated in Hester's Digging in South Texas Prehistory (1980a:Figure 4.16).
THE CENTRAL TEXAS REGION

The Asa Warner #2 site was located on a narrow sandbar that is part of a natural levee in the Brazos River
floodplain south of Waco, Texas. Five burials were excavated during fairly extensive testing of this site in
1941 - 42 (Watt 1956). Four of the burials were semi-flexed, two on their right side and two on their left.
The fifth was extended on its back with the lower legs folded under. The heels were in contact with the
buttocks. Burials were oriented to the west and north west. Perdiz arrow points were found with two of the
flexed burials, these were suspected by Watt (1956:13-14) to be the cause of death. A large biface was found
at the waist of the extended burial. A cache consisting of a turtle carapace containing two bifaces of the
same material as the larger one and a short section of antler, was found near this burial but the association
is not certain.
The Frisch Auf! site (41FY42) was located on a small knoll nearthe confluence of Buckner's Creek and the
Colorado River in central Fayette County, Texas. Five possibly six burials were identified in a 1 x 2 m area
(Hester and Collins 1969). The burials were in flexed positions deposited in round to oval burial pits.
Artifacts included with the intennents consisted of two Scallorn arrow points with Burial 1 and, an antler
tine, a shaped and smoothed object of petrified wood and a freshwater mussel shell with Burial 4. The
skeletal material from this site was analyzed by Wesolowsky and Ellzey (1969). A radiocarbon assay was
recently run on human bone from Burial 1, yielding a date of 1070 +/- 90 B.P., uncorrected radiocarbon
years (Huebner and Powell 1989).

ARCHEOLOGJCAL BACKGROUND / 17

The Pat Parker site (41 TV88) was on a small rise next to an eastward flowing tributary of Gilleland Creek
in northeastern Travis County, Texas (Greer and Benfer 1975). Between 17 and 20 individuals were
recognized in the three meters square cemetery area, with 10 of these in a complete or nearly complete
condition. The burials intruded into an earlier midden deposit, but no grave pits could be recognized. The
primary headward orientation of these flexed and semi-flexed burials is north toward the drainage. Grave
goods consisted of Darl dart points, Scallorn arrow points, and a marine shell pendant A cache of five or
six deer antlers was recovered near Burials 1, 3, and 4.
The Loeve-Fox site (41 WM230) was in an alluvial terrace on the left bank of the San Gabriel River in eastern
Williamson County, Texas. Twenty-five burials were excavated under controlled conditions and at least two
were removed by the land owner prior to Prewitt' s (1974a) investigations. All burials were in primary context
although five were disarticulated by later interments. Burials were in semi-flexed or flexed positions with
the latest burials in the latter position (Prewitt 1974a:42). The majority of individuals were oriented headward
in a west to north arc with two oriented to the southeast. All of the burials were in a small circular area,
approximately three meters in diameter. Outside of this area, 10 cremations in a three meter wide concentric
ring were identified during later excavations at the site (Prewitt 1982:69). The only artifacts with the burials
were a triangular conch shell pendant and an unmodified mussel shell; conch columella beads were with three
of the cremations. Scallorn points were associated with six individuals in the site and were suggested as the
cause of death (Prewitt 1974a:36). Radiocarbon dates from this site place the cemetery in the period AD.
650 - 1250 (1300-700 B.P.; Prewitt 1982:29).
The Olmos Dam site (4IBX1) was located in northwest San Antonio on the banks of Olmos Creek, just above
its confluence with the San Antonio River (Lukowski 1988). A total of 13 individuals in flexed positions
were recovered along with hearth features and diagnostic artifacts from the Middle and Late Archaic periods.
Two radiocarbon assays on charcoal 2200 +/- 70 B.P. (TX-3989), and 1920 +/- 160 B.P. (TX-3993), date
the burials to the Late Archaic, and provide the best absolute dates for a mortuary site of this period in greater
southern Texas. A wide range of artifacts were associated with the burials. White-tailed deer antler bases
were found over the bodies of seven individuals, ranging in number from 2-21 each, with a total for the site
of 66. Six of the seven conch columella and outer whorl pendants recovered were associated with burials.
The columellas were biconically drilled at an angle on one end in a similar fashion to those reported from
the Texas West Indies site in Victoria County (Birmingham and Huebner 1991). The outer whorl pendants
have biconically drilled suspension holes and geometric designs rendered with shallow punctations. One
adult male burial (B2) included ''two chert cobbles, four incised columella dangles, a punctated conch body
whorl pendant, unmodified mussle shell, cut mussel shell pendant fragments, a bone awl, four bone beads,
one biface, one distal fragment of a biface, a core, a ground stone slab, 21 deer antler bases with numerous
additional fragments of beams and tines, and red ocher stains were within the grave" (Lukowski 1988:22).
Burial 5 appears to have died from a dart wound to the head.
The Loche Farm site (41CM25) was found on a little knoll, approximately 400 m from the head spring of
the Comal River. Nineteen burials were excavated by crews from The University of Texas in April and May
of 1936 (Woolsey 1936). These were found in flexed and semi-flexed positions, in two separate groups,
seven in the north end of the site and 12 further south. Based on the grave goods found with some individuals,
this site may date to the Late Archaic period. The artifacts include a boat stone, a stone gorget, conch
columella and whorl pendants, a large biface, and red ocher.
Other Late Prehistoric sites in the Central Texas region that contain a mortuary component with less than
five burials include the Kyle site (Jelks 1962), Pictograph, Sheep, and Greenwade Shelters (Stephenson 1970),
Little Buzzard Cave (Long 1961), Lehmann Shelter (Kelley 1947), Cottonwood Terrace (Benfer and Benfer

18 /BLUE BAYOU

Benfer 1965), and Pecan Springs (Sorrow 1966). Archaic or temporally undetermined mortuary sites in this
region are Aycock Shelter(Watt 1936), the Locke Fann site (Woolsey 1936), and Fall Creek (Jackson 1938;
Jackson and Woolsey 1938). A mnnber of other unpublished sites with hmnan interments are briefly
described by Prewitt (1974a:Table 4).
THE UPPER COASTAL REGION

The Shell Point Site (41BZ2) is located near the mouth of Chocolate Bayou on the eastern shore of
Galveston's West Bay in southeastern Brazoria County Texas. The remains of nine individuals have been
recovered from this site; five were excavated under controlled conditions and four were recovered after
eroding out of the site (Hole and Wilkinson 1973). The burials were in flexed positions and headward
orientation was to the west and northwest The authors suggest that the five individuals recovered in the
excavations were buried simultaneously (Hole and Wilkinson 1973:19). These interments were closely
packed in a single pit and were completely articulated. The cause of death for these five people is speculated
to have been hypothermia, as no evidence of violent death is present. Grave goods include five biconically
drilled conch colmnella beads, two conch outer whorl pendants, two bone awls, one with incising and a bone
bead fabricated from a deer long bone.
The Caplen site (41GV1) is located on a small knoll at the eastern end of the Bolivar Peninsula in eastern
Galveston County, Texas. The site was excavated by A.M. Woolsey in the early 1930's, some of the artifacts
were reported by Jackson (1935), and Woodbury (1937) analyzed several of the crania prior to Campbell's
(1957) final site report. A total of 66 burials were recorded and skeletal remains recovered represent at least
80 individuals. Burial positions were both flexed and semi-flexed, generally oriented headward to the east
or west. Approximately 25% of the interments had grave goods including shell, bone and glass beads, an
incised bone pendant, projectile points, lithic drills, and a tortoise shell rattle. Additionally, red ocher was
included with five of the intemient.
The apatite fraction of nondiagnostic bone from two of the burials were radiocarbon dated to provide an
absolute date range for the site. Ages, corrected for 13C, are 380 +/- 140 B.P. (TX-6100) for Burial AC 24
&:: 13c = -8.5o/oo) and 810 +/- 120 B.P. (TX-6101) for Burial AC 2 &:: 13c = -8.5%0) (Powell and Huebner
1989). These age detemiinations are in general agreement with Aten et al. (1976:63) relative dates of A.D.
1200 - 189 (750 - 150 B.P.) which were based on the recovered artifacts and the shallow depth of the
intemients.
The Harris County Boys School Cemetery (41HR80) is located on the east bank of Mud Lake near the
western edge of Galveston Bay in Harris CoWlty, Texas. Twenty-nine hmnan interments were recovered
during R. M. Gramley's 1968 excavations and Aten's 1969 field work; data from both of these episodes are
docmnented by Aten et al. ( 1976). The primary burial position was flexed, with a single semi-flexed burial,
and two secondary bundle burials, one of which appears to have been interred inside a large Goose Creek
Ceramic Vessel. Headward orientations were variable, being to the north, northeast, northwest, southeast,
and southwest. Grave goods found with 12 of burials included conch colmnella beads, bone artifacts in the
fomis of flageolets, awls, dice and fishhooks, a conch pendant, and a possible rattle. Also included were
mussel shells (Modiolus) and ocher. Based on artifacts, the site is dated to the period between A.D. 600 950 (1350 - 1000 B.P.; Aten et al. 1976:57)
The Jamaica Beach Cemetery (41GV5) is located near the center of Galveston Island on the West Bay side.
Data from the excavation by Aten et al. (1976:72-75). Nineteen flexed or semi-flexed primary burials with
headward orientations to the northwest were excavated from the site. Grave goods were included with two

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND / 19

two incised bone beads, a canine tooth pendant, an incised and punctated bone awl, and two bone needles
with Burial 5. Five radiocarbon dates run on shell show two clusters around AD. 1200 (750 B.P.) and AD.
1500 (450 B.P.); the latter was considered the most representative date for the site.
THE LOWER COAST AND RIO GRANDE PLAIN REGION

The Floyd Morris site (41CF2) is located on a low sandy-clay ridge two miles north of Harlingen, Texas. A
total of 15 individuals in 11 burials were excavated; these were in flexed positions with headward orientation
variable possibly due to the temporal depth of the site (Collins, Hester, and Weir 1969:145). Burial 11 is the
most remarkable in the site. 1his burial feature contains four individuals; an earlier interment was disturbed
by the burial of an articulated female and an infant with the disarticulated skeletal remains of an old adult
male in her lap. Grave goods associated with these burials included bone and shell beads, shell tinklers,
canine tooth pendants, disc shaped beads and modified human bone (Collins, Hester, and Weir 1969:144).
A disarticulated burial showed coatings or red and black pigments (ocher and asphaltum).
The Ayala site (41HG1) lies on a high terrace on the east bank of the Sardinas Resaca, a remnant channel of
the Rio Grande, two kilometers south of McAllen. Campbell and Frizzell (1949) reported 15 individuals
from 11 burials; these were all in flexed positions. Grave goods included Oliva sayana, conch columella.
and incised bone beads. In 1952, F. Ruecking returned to the site and documented 44 more burials by
descriptive data is largely lacking (Hester and Ruecking 1969). Grave goods included the same type of
artifacts reported by Campbell and Frizzell (1949) plus a pendant fabricated from outer whorl of a conch, a
complete deer antler beam, incised bone pendants and canine tooth pendants. Both of these sites are related
to the Brownsville Complex, a Late Prehistoric cultural pattern quite different from the remainder of South
Texas (Black 1986:244).
Other Brownsville complex burial site include 41HG27 (Hester and Rodgers 1971) and the Unland site
(41 CFll, Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979). Two other pertinent papers are Hester's (1969a) discussion on burial
practices and his (1969b) description of human bone artifacts from this region.

Local Chronology
The chronological sequence of the Central Coastal Plain is probably one of the most poorly known in Texas.
1his region, in which the Blue Bayou site is located, is a transitional area between the better understood
Central Texas and Coastal Bend archeological regions. From the few sites that have been excavated and the
substantial collections of several local avocational archeologists, influences from both areas can be seen. The
establishment of a firm chronological sequence is further hindered by a paucity of radiocarbon dates. Using
127 radiocarbon dates from over 100 sites in Central Texas, Prewitt (1983) has proposed a chronology of 13
phases based on Weir's (1976) earlier model of five phases. These phases span the period 8500 B.P. to 200
B.P. (6550 B.C. -AD. 1750) encompassing the entire Archaic and Late Prehistoric sequence.
The chronology of the Coastal Bend does not start until ca 4,000 B.P., about the time of the formation of the
barrier islands (Corbin 1976). The coastal Archaic Aransas Complex (Corbin 1974) starts about this time
and continues until ca. 850 B.P., when it is replaced by the Late Prehistoric Rockport phase (Corbin 1974).
Based on our present knowledge of the cultural history of the Coastal Plain, neither of these chronologies
can be pressed into service completely, although both are useful in relative terms. Thus the tentative
chronology proposed by Fox and Hester (1976:5), and modified by Brown (1983:8-11) will be used with
slight adjustments based on recent findings and analyses in the region.

20 I BLUE BAYOU

chronology proposed by Fox and Hester (1976:5), and modified by Brown (1983:8-11) will be used with
slight adjustments based on recent fmdings and analyses in the region.
THE PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,2000 - 6,000 B.C.)

The earliest manifestation of human occupation in the region is the Clovis projectile point type. An example
has been reported from the Johnston-Heller site (41VT15) in Victoria County (Binningham and Hester
1976). It was found in a deep erosional gully at the site; also recovered from deep in this deposit were later
Paleoindian types including Plainview, Golondrina, and an untyped weak-shouldered lanceolate style. At
the Buckner Ranch in Bee County, Site 1 produced various species of extinct megafauna (Sellards 1940).
Along with these, several types of Paleoindian points were reported, including a Clovis basal fragment and
Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura projectile points.
At the Berger Bluff site (41GD30) in the Coleto Creek Reservoir area two radiocarbon dates of 11,550 +/800 B.P. (TX-3569) and 10,190 +/- 160 B.P. (Beta-16976) were obtained from Feature 5, a hearth, ca. six
meters below the surface (Brown 1987). Whi1e no diagnostic artifacts or extinct fauna were recovered, snails
and other fauna are presently being analyzed to gain a better understanding of the late Pleistocene
environment in the region (Brown 1987).
Recently an obsidian Clovis point was found at site 41CL72 in Calhoun County (Hester 1988:2-4). This
badly "beach rolled" artifact was subjected to non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis to detennine the
origin of obsidian. Unfortunately, this test proved inconclusive as to the geologic source of the obsidian.
Late Paleoindian materials are much more common in the region, but the vast majority are surface finds.
The only excavated material is a Plainview-like basal fragment from the J-2 Ranch site in Victoria County
(Fox et al. 1978). Point types such as Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura have been reported
from numerous sites including J-2 Ranch, the Miller site (41 VT5), the Willeke site (41 VT16), and 41 VT43
(Hester 1980b).
Due to the substantial rise in sea level during the Holocene, it is doubtless that the waters of the Gulf of
Mexico have now submerged many Paleoindian sites (Hester 1980:7). The rise of sea level in response to
the wastage of the Wisconsin age glaciers effected the base levels of the rivers flowing into the Gulf. As
base levels rose and gradient dropped, river channels began to aggrade and develop the deep terraces that
obscure many inland Paleoindian sites.
THE ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. - A.O. 700)

The Archaic of the Coastal Plain cannot be easily rendered into the tripartite divisions of Early, Middle and
Late as recognized in the Central Texas chronology. Based largely on projectile point types, the Archaic
shows a shift from Paleoindian lanceolate forms to stemmed, notched, and triangular forms. The earliest
manifestations of the Archaic, once tenned the "Pre-Archaic" (Sollberger and Hester 1972) are Bell, Gower,
Early Comer Notched and Early Triangular. Examples of these types have been recovered in surface finds
at 41VT16,41 VT20, and 41GD22 in the Coleto Creek area (Fox and Hester 1976) and from the Miller site
(41VT5) in the upper Rocky Creek area (E. H. Schmiedlin personal communication, 1987). Chandler
(1983:7-10) reported 10 Bell points from San Patricio County, all of which were from surface context. The
J-2 Ranch site, mentioned earlier, also hinted at these early Archaic manifestations with an Early Triangular
point recovered during the Southern Texas Archaeological Association's (STAA) excavation at the site (Fox
et al. 1978: 11).

ARCHEOLOG:CAL BACKGROUND/ 21

Castroville, Montell, Fairland, Ensor, and Dari have been recovered from sites in the Coleto Creek drainage
(Fox and Hester 1976), Cuero Reservoir area (Fox et al. 1974) and numerous other sites in Victoria and De
Witt counties (E. H. Schmiedlin personal communication, 1987).
Evidence of coastal Archaic adaptations have been seen in middens composed of marine or brackish water
bivalves. Stemmed dart points found with these middens are Palmillas, Bulverde, and Morhiss. The
triangular forms of Catan and Matamoros are also common. These sites are found in the estuary zone near
the mouths of the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers.
A local Archaic manifestation is the Morhiss Complex (Calhoun 1965; Campbell 1976). This is the only
defined Archaic cultural complex in the Coastal Plain. Morhiss sites are found in the lower reaches of the
Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers and many of their tributaries (Calhoun 1965:4). Morhiss dart points are
the hallmark of the complex, but numerous other stemmed and triangular forms are also represented. Antler,
bone, and marine shell, used both as tools and ornaments, are very common. The only radiocarbon date
associated with the Morhiss Complex comes from 41GD21. A date of 2670 +/- 370 B.P. was obtained from
charcoal from Soil Zone A (Fox 1979:78). Along Rocky Creek in Victoria County, a number of sites show
heavy Morhiss influence, and all are buried in a steep bluff which is another trait mentioned by Calhoun
(1965:4).
A number of tool forms manufactured from various species of marine shell are also present in these sites.
Principal forms are adzes made from the outer whorl of Busycon sp., scrapers made from Callista nimbosa
(sunray venus) and gouges made from Pleurophloca gigantea (Florida horse conch).
THE LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 700 • A.D. 1528)

The appearance of the bow and arrow and associated smaller projectile points generally characterize the Late
Prehistoric period. The hunting and gathering lifeways of the Archaic are maintained, but tool technology
and hunting techniques appear to change. In the Coastal Plain, influences of both the Central Texas and the
Coastal Bend traditions can be seen.
The Central Texas Late Prehistoric is divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah. The Austin Phase is
characterized by Scallorn arrow points and a variety of tools made of flakes (Jelks 1962:85). The Toyah
Phase represents a radical departure from previous time periods: Bison become a prime hunting target and
the lithic tool kit changes to reflect this (Prewitt 1981:84). Representative artifacts are Perdiz arrow points,
unifacial scrapers, and beveled bifaces. Pottery is also common; the predominant type is bone tempered Leon
Plain (Prewitt 1981:83).
In the Coastal Bend, the Late Prehistoric starts later, around 650 - 750 B.P. (Story 1969). It is identified by
a single complex, the Rockport. Various arrow points including Scallorn, Fresno, and Perdiz are found in

sites along with a sandy paste Rockport pottery. This sandy paste ceramic ware is often decorated or mended
with asphaltum.
The Coastal Plain seems to demonstrate an amalgam of both influences. Modified marine shell was found
in the upper levels of 41GD21 associated with Late Prehistoric remains (Fox 1979), while at Berger Bluff,
Brown (1983:80) identified early Late Prehistoric remains as being "classic Central Texas Austin phase
remains." Two other sites, the Berclair site (Hester and Parker 1970) and the Burris site (Huebner 1987a,
1987b), both show classic Toyah phase traits of bison hunting and the associated tool kit, but also have coastal
type sandy paste ceramics.

1987b), both show classic Toyah phase traits of bison hunting and the associated tool kit, but also have
coastal type sandy paste ceramics.

CHAPTER3
THE EXCAVATIONS

Field Methodology
At the start of the 1982 field season at Blue Bayou a horizontal grid was established using the primary datwn
as a center point (Figure 3). The primary datwn, a three inch stainless steel disk is marked "Blue Bayou
41VT94, Elev. 52.17 ft/15.90 M, 'O' N.S.E.W." From this point, near the assumed center of occupation,
north-south and east-west baselines were laid in using a transit. The baselines are set on magnetic north,
which is 46° 13' 58" east of the north bearing used by DuPont at their Victoria plant. Secondary datwns
were placed at the tenninus of the north, south, and west legs of the horizontal baselines. These are also
stain1ess steel disks and are marked with the distance from the primary datwn. All datwns were set in
concrete.
With the primary datwn designated as the zero point, all coordinates increase as they go away from the
datwn. The basic excavation unit was a 1 x 1 m square. Units were arranged in various configurations along
with smaller extension units based on the requirements of data recovery. Units were designated by the comer
closest to the primary datwn; thus units in the northwest quadrant of the site are identified by the southeast
comer and those in the southwest quadrant by the northeast comer. No excavation was carried out in the
eastern half of the site.
Vertical control was established from the primary datwn. The datwn 's actual elevation was tied into a nearby
bench mark and was used throughout the excavations. The elevation of 52.17 ft. was converted to metric,
giving the datwn an elevation of 15.90 m AMSL. Finally, a contour map of the site was made using a plane
table and alidade.
During the 1982 field season, the primary goal was to salvage the burials exposed by construction and those
in imminent danger of erosional damage. In addition, 50 x 50 cm test pits were dug to identify the limits of
the site. Excavation was accomplished using hand tools and 15 cm arbitrary levels. All matrix was screened
through 1/4" hardware cloth, and cultural materials recovered from the screen were placed into plastic ziplock
bags labeled with the unit, level, date, and excavator.
The burial and bone masses in the construction area were completely exposed, pedestalled, and carefully
cleaned using trowels, bamboo splints, dental picks, brushes, and a wide variety of custom tools fabricated
by the excavators. After final cleaning the fully exposed burials were documented by black and white print
and color slide photography. Most of the photographs contained a north arrow, and a metric scale, and a
menu board with site, unit burial number, and date listed. A detailed and scaled drawing was made of each
burial and bone mass, and a standardized burial record was completed. Samples were collected from any
stain or inclusion encountered in the soil matrix. Samples were also taken from the pelvic/abdominal region
of several burials. These were bagged, labeled, and recorded on the appropriate burial record and on a master
sample register.
Artifacts recovered in situ within a burial were recorded, sketched, and left in place for photo documentation.
They were then bagged separately and labeled with the provenience data.

THE EXCAVATIONS/ 25

Prior to removal of the individual, skeJetal remains were treated with a preservative coat of thinned Elmer's
Glue-All. As the skeletal elements were removed, the physical anthropologist on hand, A.B. Wesolowsky,
made preliminary observations on the sex, age, pathology, and anomalies for each burial. These were
included with each burial record. Each treated bone or composite of bones wrapped separately and boxed
by burial.
Burials and bone masses were each assigned a different set of numbers. A bone mass was designated if the
interment had been badly disarticulated by the construction equipment and burial position and orientation
could not be ascertained. Disarticulated remains caused by aboriginal or natural disturbance were labeled
as burials.
Thirty-five 50 x 50 cm test pits were dug to find the boundaries of the site. These excavations were terminated
when a human interment was encountered or upon reaching the basal clay. When a burial was uncovered,
a scaled sketch was rendered, the bones were covered with aluminum foil, and the unit carefully backfilled.
In the other test pits an aluminum can was placed at the bottom and then backfilled.
Any material culture found in situ was mapped with three-point provenience and recorded on a standard
form. All recovered material was placed in a single bag labeled with the test pit number and site coordinates.
During the 1983 season, excavationresumedin a high probability area identified during the previous season's
testing, and burials exposed by recent erosion were recovered. The primary horizontal control was again
the 1x1 meter unit. No smalJerextension units were opened. Burials exposed in the unit walls were mapped,
but not recovered with the exception of Burial 25, where the exposed skull was removed for study. All
excavation methods were unchanged. No bone masses were identified, and only two test pits were dug.

Character of the Deposits
The physical and structural characteristics of the site were not thoroughly investigated during the excavations. Based on the observations made by the excavators during the test pit operations the site stratigraphy
is somewhat confusing, and thus only broad general statements can be made about the deposits.
The site deposits can be divided into three zones based on the color and texture of the matrix. It is possible
that other zones existed prior to the removal by construction activity of the upper 50 to 100 cm of deposit,
but there is no data on this.
The upper zone is described in the field notes as a sand or sandy loam with colors ranging from dark brown
to light brown. Several thin clay laminations were noted in several test pits. When moist, the matrix was
easy to dig; when dry it became hard, leading to difficulties in both excavation and screening. Rapid erosion
from rain water runoff was a problem during the excavations leading to the re-excavation of several burials
and wall slump in deeper units. Numerous rodent runs and dens were identified; this is thought to be one
of the major causes ofbioturbation at the site. Small scatterings of cultural material and all the human burials
were recovered from this upper zone.
The middle zone is a sandy clay loam, yellow tan to red in color. There does not appear to be a distinct break
between this and the upper zone, but more of a gradient, with the clay content increasing and the color lighter.
No cultural material was recovered from this zone.

26 /BLUE BAYOU

The lower wne is a heavy orange clay, which is the top of the Beaumont fonnation. It is devoid of cultural
material.
During late May 1988, the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Scientist for Victoria County,
Wesley C. Miller and two of the original excavators, Bill Binningham and Don Will, conducted six soil
cores in the site area. These tests confinned the confusing picture of the soils at the site. Three types of soil
were identified on the terrace. Nearthe top of the terrace, upslope from the site area a Telfemer series sandy
clay loam soil was identified over Beaumont fonnation clays. At the midslope to the west of the site are
soils that are similar to the Runge series but have distinctly different B and C horiwns. The fine sandy soils
at the site are different from the expected sandy clay loams typical of the runge series (cf. Miller 1979:76).
Just above the lower half of the side slope and in an area just southwest of the site, two test cores identified
a soil series that is unnamed because no soil like this has been mapped in Victoria, Refugio, or Jackson
Counties. These loamy and sandy, brownish soils show little profile development except for dark colors
caused by organics in the soil.
The soil proftle from Miller's Core Test 3 is shown below.
A - 0 to 55 cm; very dark grayish brown (lOYR 3/2) fine sandy loam; grayish brown (lOYR 5/2)
dry.
Bt - 55 to 70 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry.
Btk- 70 to 80 cm; yellowish brown (lOYR 5/4) sandy clay loam; very pale brown (lOYR 7/4) dry;
calcareous.
Ck- 80 to 100 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay loam; reddish yellow (7.5YR 8/6) dry;
40 to 50% medium and coarse soft masses of calcium carbonate; calcareous.
2C - 100 to 155 cm; pale brown (lOYR 6/3) fine sand; very pale brown (lOYR 8/3) dry; calcareous.
This profile is similar to the Runge series with the differences noted above. The following profile is of the
unnamed soil disturbed during the construction activities. This area is not pictured on the site map and is
south of the site boundary, but would lie approximately 10 m southwest of test Pit 14.
Al - 25 to 80 cm; very dark grayish brown (lOYR 3/2) fine sandy loam; grayish brown (lOYR 5/2)
dry.
Bt - 80 to 120 cm; yellowish brown (lOYR 5/4) sandy loam (about 18% clay); very pale brown
(lOYR 7/4 dry).
Ck- 120 to 150 cm; yellowish brown (lOYR 7/4) sandy loam (about 18% clay); very pale brown
(lOYR 7/4) dry; about 3% fine concretions of calcium carbonate; calcareous.
2C- 150 to 190 cm; light yellowish brown (lOYR 6/4) fine sand, very pale brown (lOYR 8/4) dry;
calcareous.
The soils at the site, while not confonning with known soils of the area, still reflect the geologic history of
a Deweyville fonn terrace. A brief history of the area is a) Beaumont age sediments are deposited; b)
Guadalupe River cut and terrace fonnation is deposited; and c) fluvial and eolian sands and loams are
deposited on top of the terrace bench.
While the soils found at the site do not confonn with what is already known, their geologic origin is secure.
Presently we need to learn more about the depositional sequence and the cyclic clay weathering and
eluviation that created the laminations found in the upper Bt horiwn.

THE EXCAVATIONS/ 27

Cultural Stratigraphy
All cultural materials recovered during the excavations were found in the upper zone of the site. These
represent the Late Prehistoric period for the most part with a small amount of Archaic materials also present.
Human burials were the only occupational features recorded. Associated with these were Scallorn arrow
points, deer antlers, bone awls, mussel shell pendants, and unmodified marine shells. Other artifacts
recovered included utilized flakes, a Scallorn arrow point, and an Ensor dart point. Llthic debitage,
fragmentary marine shell, and bone, much of which is human, are present in limited quantities throughout
the site matrix. Based on the limited evidence, it is impossible to demarcate a stratigraphic boundary between
the cultural periods represented.

CHAPTER4
HUMAN BURIALS

The only features excavated at the Blue Bayou site were human burials. Three types were identified; primary
inhumations, secondary inhumations or "bunclJe burials," and bone masses. Primary inhumations were
identified by a fully articulated skeleton, or a portion thereof when partially disturbed by a later burial or
construction activities. Secondary inhumations were recognized as assemblages of disarticulated long bones
with similar orientations with or without the presenre of a skull. Bone masses were skeletal elements that
had been greatly disturbed by the construction activities to the point that their fomi was unrecognizable. At
the time of burial, these were most likely primary intemients, but the amount of disturbance rendered a fimi
judgment impossible.
The descriptions of the burials presented in this chapter were derived from the excavators' field notes,
sketches, and photographs. Data pertaining to the age, gender, and state of preservation of each burial was
gleaned from the field assessments of the physical anthropologist on site, A.B. Wesolowsky, and from the
laboratory analysis of A.G. Comuzzie. For a complete description of the physical remains, the reader is
referred to Appendix A (this volume).
The burials and bone masses are described individually. The descriptions include the following elements:
1) Burial num her- Excavation area and the coordinates of the unit (s) in which the burial was located.
2) Description - A general description of the burial including state of preservation, age, sex, and
body position. Body position will include the position of the anns and legs, if present. Overall body
position temis are as defined as follows:
a) Flexed - The knees are pulled tight to thorax with the heels near the pelvis and the anns in close
proximity to the thorax or skull.
b) Semi-flexed-The femurs are at an angle greaterthan45° but less than 120° relative to the frontal
section with the knees flexed bringing the heels near the pelvis.
c) Extended-The femurs are at an angle greaterthan 120° relative to the frontal section, with the
knees extended.
3) Orientation - The directional orientation of the line between the base of the skull and the pelvis.
Headward direction is always listed first. The facing is detennined based on a line drawn from the
opisthocranion through the eye orbits (cf. Bass 1971:59).
4) Artifacts - The catalog num her and the artifact type or descriptive tenn and the figure of illustration
are provided along with the relationship to the burial.
5) MNI-Minimum Number of Individuals perburial; the first number represents the archeologist's
assay and the second number represents the physical anthropologist's laboratory detennination (see
discussion below and in Appendix A).

28

HUMAN BURIALS/ 29

6) Elevation - This is the highest and the lowest elevation of skeletal remains within the burial. The
skeletal element of the elevation is also given; in some cases, the lowest elevation is the bottom of
the grave pit.
7) Samples -This gives the location and elevation, if recorded, of soil and radiocarbon samples taken
during excavation.
During the two seasons of excavation at Blue Bayou, a total of 30 burials and six bone masses were identified
and excavated. Thus the archeologist derived a population count of 36 individuals for the portions of the
site excavated.
In the analysis of the skeletal remains from the site, the physical anthropologist (1987:Appendix A) indicates

a total population of 45 individuals. The discrepancy which occurs between archeologists' and physical
anthropologists' counts, is a phenomenon that has not gone unnoticed in the past Hall (1981:53-54) noted
that the methods utilized by physical anthropologists regard "each burial feature as a discreet unit of analysis
having no relationship to surrounding features." This method does not take into account the effects of post
depositional disturbances such as later intrusive burials or the activities of burrowing animals and in the case
of this site, the heavy machine damage. Therefore, extra skeletal elements within a burial feature containing
a complete skeleton caused the burial to be regarded as two or more individuals by the physical anthropologist. An attempt to reconcile extra skeletal elements with nearby burials met with little success. The different
methods used by the archeologist and the physical anthropologist yielded the following counts:

Wesolowsky pointed out a possible articulated elbow related to possible cranial fragments that could indicate
a primary inhumation. Along the same line, the skeletal elements are too scattered and do not resemble any
other secondary intennents in this site or the Victoria area. Conversely, the remains are badly deteriorated
and unidentifiable except for the ann bones. Based on the data available, it is impossible to be certain of

BIOARCHEOLOGICAL METHODS

The hmnan remains from the Blue Bayou site are an important skeltal population for a better understanding
of the biological adaptations and affinitiets in the central Coastal Plain. The site displays all the characteristics suggestive of a hunter-gatherer society of Terminal Archaic to Late Prehistoric age, there are few
other sites from the immediate area for comparison. To date the only other major cemetery site in Victoria
County of comparable antiquity is the Modliss site (41 VTl ).
This site was excavated in the 1940's but there has been only been a brief description published (Campbell
1976). This severely limits its usefulness for comparative work. It is this lack of detailed analysis and
descriptions for large samples from this geographic and temporal setting that makes the detailed analysis of
Blue Bayou of interest.
As a result of this minimal amount of docmnented comparative material, one of the major purposes of the
present work is to provide a data base on the skeletal biology and demography of Blue Bayou for use in
future comparative studies. A well docmnented comparative collection for this geographic region and time

frame is essential if an appreciation of the natural range of variation for such biological aspects as stature,
robusticity, and sexual dimorphism is to be established. Without well docmnented comparative collections,
it will never be possible to develop useful models for the interpretation of the prehistoric lifeways of the
populations from the Coastal Plain of Texas.
More specifically, there are several questions of immediate interest which can be explored preliminarily by
use of the hwnan remains recovered from Blue Bayou. It has long been a common practice to portray the
subsistence patterns of many of these prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups as marginal at best and often on the
brink of starvation (Hester 1980; Rathbun et al. 1980). However, it has recently been suggested by Comuzzie
et al. (1986) that this might not be the case for prehistoric populations from the lower Texas coast. The
material from Blue Bayou offers the opportunity to begin to assess the quality of subsistence offered by
hunting and gathering for this region of the Coastal Plain based on the skeletal evidence for the frequency
and pattern of disease and metabolic stress (Qarke 1978; Milner 1982). Such an assessment would then
allow for comparisons of the health and general quality of life of the Blue Bayou sample with other samples
which have been suggested to have utilized similar lifeways.
Another topic which can be addressed by use of this sample is the prevalence and structure of culturally
induced modification of the skeletal elements. Recent studies in the dental anatomy of prehistoric populations from the Texas coast have revealed some very interesting wear patterns (Comuzzie et al. 1986;
Comuzzie and Steele 1987). It has been suggested that pedlaps these patterns of wear are associated with
specific cultural practices common to this type of lifeway. The material examined from Blue Bayou shows
evidence of the type of wear docmnented from other prehistoric coastal populations as well as a few unique
patterns.
Also of interest is the possibility of assessing biological affinities based on physical structures (Jantz 1974;
Ossenberg 1974; Wilkinson 1977; Droessler 1981; Comuzzieet al. 1986) for prehistoric populations from
this region. The issue is of interest due to the general lack of cultural remains recovered from sites in this
region with which to make assessments of population affinities. Based on work done on prehistoric
populations from the Texas Coast at Shell Point (Wilkinson 1973), and Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986),

50

B/OARCHEOLOGICALMETHODS I 51

there appear to be physical characteristics which are shared by these populations and tend to distinguish these
prehistoric coastal populations from other populations in the region. The biological assessment of the Blue
Bayou sample in relationship to these samples is important in providing a clearer picture of the type of
isolation, both biologically and culturally, which might be occurring (Wilkinson 1971; Leslie 1977; Droessler
1981; Owsley et al. 1981).
While there has long been a strong interest, and a great deal of speculation on the physical anthropology of
the Texas coast (Aten 1965; Wilkinson 1973, 1977; Comuzzie et al. 1986), there remains few lack of
comprehensive and integrated studies of the bioarcheology of the Prehistoric period of this region. There
have been a number of previous works dealing with relatively small burial samples (Wilkinson 1973; Hester
and Corbin 1975; Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979; Comuzzie et al. 1986) along with a few others dealing with
slightly larger samples (Jackson 1933; Aten et al. 1976; Hall 1981) but none have dealt with populations from
Victoria or immediately adjacent counties. The Blue Bayou sample is significant then because it represents
the first relatively large prehistoric burial sample to be analyzed in any detail for the central portion of the
Coastal Plain. Furthermore, many of the previous works have concentrated on describing the structural
features of the individuals analyzed without attempting to provide a detailed bioarcheological analysis such
has been done forother regions (e.g. Wilkinson 1971; Jantz 1972, 1973; Ubelaker 1974; Buikstra 1976, 1977;
Owsley and Bass 1979; Droessler 1981; Owsley et al. 1981). It is the author's intent to provide as complete
a documentation as possible of the vital statistics for the individuals recovered for use in future comparative
studies, along with beginning to address some of the previously less considered topics of a bioarcheological
nature such as demographic structure, quality of health, success of subsistence strategy, and population
affinity.

Materials and Methods
The purpose of this research is to provide information concerning the skeletal biology and demographic
profile of the human remains from Blue Bayou. At present the physical anthropology of the central Texas
Coastal Plain is only poorly understood. This study was designed to provide one of the first bioarcheological
studies of a population recovered from the region. The sample is noteworthy because its relatively large size,
and the care with which it was excavated and analyzed
The remains excavated at Blue Bayou consisted of what was described in the field notes as 30 primary burials
and six bone masses. It is now felt, based on this analysis, that these "bone masses" actually represent
secondary interments consisting mostly of fragmented and partial remains of single individuals. The rest of
the sample appears to be from primary interments, and with few exceptions limited to single burials. At least
45 separate individuals are represented in the recovered material.
Basically the objectives of the study were three fold The first objective was the conservation, reconstruction,
and curation of these remains to allow for the retrieval of the maximum amount of information on the skeletal
biology of the Blue Bayou sample. The second objective was to provide as complete a description as possible
of the structural features of the individuals represented. The third objective and the most important, was to
compare this sample to other samples from this same time and geographical area. As pointed out by Buikstra
( 1976), all too often there is little or no effort made at integrating the research designs and data of the physical
anthropologist in the development of a regional synthesis. It has been shown, however, that biological data
has much to offer in terms of increasing the understanding of the cultural prehistory of an area (Wilkinson
1971; Jantz 1972, 1973; Ubelaker 1974; Buikstra 1976, 1977; Owsley and Bass 1979; Droessler 1981; Owsley
et al. 1981). Due to the modest amount of bioarcheological research which has been done on the central

52 /BLUE BAYOU

central Texas coast, the analysis of the Blue Bayou samples provides some new insights in the bioarcheology
of these early prehistoric inhabitants.
While the material recovered from Blue Bayou represents a relatively large sample for analysis, the remains
were initially recovered in a rather fragmented condition. Thus, the first objective of the project was the
cleaning and reconstruction of the skeletal elements. It appeared that most bones were broken in situ by
ground pressure probably resulting from the swelling and shrinking of the sandy clay soil in which these
remains were deposited. Fortunately a high percentage of the fragments were recovered. In terms of actual
preservation the substructure of the bone was relatively solid, which greatly facilitated cleaning and
reconstruction. In order to provide a usable sample the bony elements were cleaned of any remaining matrix
and then consolidated by immersion in a solution of Vinac B-15. In a large number of instances it was
possible following this procedure to reconstruct many of the elements by joining the fragments with a solution
of Vinac B-25.
Upon completion of the cleaning and conservation, the remains were separated by individual per burial and
assigned a three digit code number for analysis. The first two digits of this code designated the burial
association, and the last digit represented the individual (i.e. 110 =burial 11 individual 0). All individuals
were analyzed separately, observations and measurements were encoded on standardized forms, and coded
data entered into a computerized data base. A synopsis of the analysis of each individual is provided in
Appendix A.
The analysis of each individual consisted of both quantitative and qualitative observations, the goal being
to record as much data for each individual as possible. Forty-seven separate measurements were taken, with
as many of these as possible being recorded for each individual. A description of these measurements is
provided in Appendix B. The measurements were taken with standard anthropometric instruments and
following the techniques and landmarks outlined by Stewart (1952, 1978), Montague (1960), Olivier(1970),
El-Najjar and McWilliams (1978), and Rogers (1984). The qualitative portion consisted of a visual
assessment of the remains with the goal being to develop an appreciation of the physical variation and
anomalies characterizing this population. A description of these observations is provided in Appendix C.
The numerical data were analyzed statistically in two ways. Tests for significance in the number of
individuals between the sexes was made by use of chi-square analysis at the .05 level of significance.
However, the test for possible significance between the sexes within the various age categories was done
utilizing the Kolmogorov-Smimov test at a .05 acceptance level. Comparisons of metrical data for
significance in differences of both inter- and intra- sample means were made by use of a two-tailed T-test
at a .05 level of significance. The calculated values of these statistical tests are provided in Appendix D.
One of the primary goals of this research was to provide a demographic profile of the sample to facilitate
the interpretation of mortality rates and quality of life within the Blue Bayou population. As a result, the
determination of an individual's sex and age was of basic importance since this information is critical for
the reconstruction of the demographic profile of a population (Ubelaker 1978). Due to the general lack of
preservation of pelvic remains in the sample the techniques employed had to utilize skeletal elements often
felt to give a less accurate determination (Bass 1971; Krogman 1962; El-Najjar and McWilliams 1978;
Ubelaker 1978; Steele and Bramblett 1988). Therefore, the determination of sex was made whenever
possible by use of several different techniques to assure as much accuracy as possible (Keen 1950; Bass
1971; Black 1978a; Stewart 1978). As with determination of sex, the assessment of an individual's age was
based on as many different criteria as possible to provide a more accurate estimation. The assessment of
age for immature individuals was made based on various developmental criteria (Bass 1971; Krogman 1962;

B/OARCHEOWGICAL METHODS/ 53

McWilliams 1978; Stewart 1978; Steele and Bramblett 1988), many of which are associated with the dentition
(Schour and Massler 194-0). For mature individuals the assessment of age was based on the degree of
degeneration (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971; El-Najjar and McWilliams 1978; Stewart 1978; Steele and
Bramblett 1988), particularly the extent of dental attrition (Miles 1963). Unlike the determination of sex,
however, age could not always be accurately assessed so age categories were utilized
In addition to the demographic analysis an assessment of the possible biological affinity of the Blue Bayou
material was also conducted. The samples chosen for comparison were from Palm Harbor (41AS80), a Late
Prehistoric cemetery site suspected of being Karankawan (Comuzzie et al. 1986), and Mission San Juan
Capistrano (41BX5), a historic cemetery sample reportedly documented as Coahuiltecan (Humphreys 1971 ).
The assessment of biological affinity followed the work of Wilkinson (1977), and Finnegan and Marcsik
(1979). Wilkinson (1977) suggested that it was possible to recognize pre-contact Karankawans by a suite of
cranial features such as size and shape of browridges and mental eminence. The technique developed by
Finnegan and Marcsik (1979) was based on the presence and absence of discrete traits in the populations
being compared. A list of the traits utilized is provided in Appendix E.

Along with the sex and age of the sample the stature and robusticity of each individual was assessed when
possible. Due to the fragmented condition of the long bones it was necessary to estimate their intact length
by use of the method developed by Steele (1970) before estimations of stature could be made. Once long
bone length was estimated, stature estimations were made utilizing formulae developed by Genoves (1967).
It was decided the formulae developed by Genoves (1967) based on a Mesoamerican sample would provide
a more accurate estimation of the stature in this population than the formulae developed by Trotter and Gieser
(1952) based on American whites and blacks as well as a mongoloid sample. This assumption was based on
the similarity of the reconstructed mean long bone lengths from the Blue Bayou sample to those of the sample
used by Genoves (1967).
Along with stature, the robusticity of the individuals was assessed. These characteristics, stature and
robusticity, provide the data necessary for quantifying the degree of sexual dimorphism present in the Blue
Bayou sample. This was done since sexual dimorphism may indicate the quality of health in the sample (Stini
1969, 1972; Tobias 1972; Brauer 1982). An understanding of the amount of sexual dimorphism present also
helped in determining the sex of ambiguous individuals in the sample as well as providing yet another basis
for comparison between this and other prehistoric cemetery samples.
In conjunction with the description of the demographic and physical profiles of the sample the final objective
of the research was to assess the types and prevalence of pathology, trauma, and metabolic insult as a means
of assessing the quality of health at Blue Bayou (Steinbock 1976; Qark.e 1978; El-Najjar and McWilliams
1978; Ortner and Putschar 1981; Milner 1982; Steele and Bramblett 1988).

Markers of physiological stress due to disease, injury, or poor nutrition are often reflected in bone and teeth
as either macro or microscopic alterations which can be observed and often times the etiology diagnosed
(Steinbock 1976; El-Najjar and McWilliams 1978; OrtnerandPutschar 1981; Patterson 1984). In the analysis
of the Blue Bayou material both a gross and microscopic analysis were made of all identifiable remains. Due
to their excellent state of preservation elements of the dentition were strongly emphasized in this portion of
the research. The dentition was carefully examined for any evidence of enamel hypoplasia or other defects
since this has proven to be a particularly good indicator of chronic disease and metabolic stress during the
developmental years (El-Najjar et al. 1978; Patterson 1984; Goodman 1987). Along with the identification
of pathologically induced changes, all the remains recovered were analyzed for evidence of traumatic injury
or cultural modification.

CHAPTER VI
ANALYSIS OF THE SKELETAL POPULATION

Demographics and Biological Affinity
To facilitate comprehension of both the biological and the cultural characteristics of a population it is first
necessary to establish the demographic profile of the study sample (Weiss 1973; Ubelaker 1974, 1978; Weiss
and Ballonoff 1975; Ward and Weiss 1976; Owsley and Bass 1979). This requires accurately estimating
the sex and age of all individuals represented (Ubelaker 1978). The determination of sex is important since
it allows for the construction of sex ratios which can in tum provide insight into variations in levels of stress
between the sexes. Establishing the age of individuals is of interest since this permits delineating age periods
of high susceptibility to disease, nutritional deficiency, or trauma.

SEX
The determination of the sex of an unknown individual has long been of major concern in forensic
anthropology (Stewart 1978; Bass 1979). Consequently, a wide variety of techniques have been developed
for the assessment of sex (i.e. Keen 1950; Hana and Washburn 1953; Phenice 1969; Giles 1970; Ditch and
Rose 1972; Steele 1976; Black 1978a,b; Brown and Townsend 1979; Kelly 1979; Iscan and Miller-Shaivitz
1984; MacLaughlinandBruce 1985). It is unfortunate, however, that the most successful of these techniques
are based on the utilization of the pelvis, a skeletal element infrequent! y recovered in the sample from Blue
Bayou. Therefore, the assessment of sex of individuals in this sample was made by methods other than those
requiring evaluation of pelvic remains. With this general lack of pelvic remains the gender estimations for
Blue Bayou were based in large part on sexually dimorphic traits of the skull and long bones. When possible
this assessment was based on cranial architecture following the methods outlined by Keen (1950), Krogman
(1962), Bass (1971), Wilkinson (1977), and Stewart (1978). Features considered were the size of gonial
angle, and the robusticity ofbrowridges and mastoids.
It appeared that males could be identified by the presence of a relatively heavy supraorbital torus, and well
developed mastoids. While the females also displayed a relatively strong degree of robusticity with respect
to these features they did not express it to the same extent as the males. Of all the cranial indicators for sex
the size of the gonial angle proved to be the most useful. The gonial angle was measured whenever possible,
with males defined as those individuals with an angle smaller than 120° and females with an angle greater
than 120° (Table 3 and Figure 16). It was possible by use of the gonial angle to classify eight of the
individuals in the sample as to sex. The assessments made utilizing this technique agreed with those made
previously for these individuals based on the other methods utilized.
Along with the crania, the mid-shaft circumference of the femur (Black 1978a) also provided a way of
assessing sex. This method is based on the differences in the mid-shaft circumference of the femur between
the sexes. Assessments were made by recording and plotting these measurements by individual and then
locating the mid-point for the sample (Figure 17). In the Blue Bayou sample males were considered to be
those individuals with a mid-shaft circumference greater than 85 an and females with a mid-shaft
circumference below this sectioning point (Table 4). It was possible by use of this method to assess the sex
of 9 individuals from the sample, 5 males and 4 females. The sex assessment of those individuals made by
other techniques agreed with the observations based on this method as well.

It was not possible to estimate sex for all individuals in the Blue Bayou sample. Since the skeletal

characteristics utilized in the determination of sex are the result of sexual differentiation it was not possible
to accurately assess the sex of immature individuals. Of the 52 discrete individuals recovered from Blue
Bayou 40 were identified as being of sufficient maturity to be classified as adults. Because of the incomplete
nature of most adults it was possible to make an assessment of sex for only 22 of these 10: Ten were classified

as females and 12 as males (Table 5). The sex assessment for each of the individuals analyzed is provided
in Appendix A.
In a population with no bias in selective pressure with regards to sex, a ratio of 1: 1 is to be expected.
Comparing the number of females to the number of males represented in this sample a Chi-Square analysis
indicates that the num her of females is not significantly different from the number of males. Based on this
there appears to be no reason to suggest the presence of a differential selective pressure, such as disease or
physiological and nutritional stress, operating with a bias towards either sex.
While natural selective pressures represent a primary force in shifting sex ratios, cultural pressures can also
play a significant role in human populations. One explanation generally offered for culturally induced
differential sex ratios in archeological cemetery samples is that males dying from injuries suffered in
aggressive activities (i.e. warfare) away from home, are not brought back for burial in the cemetery. Since
the sex ratio at Blue Bayou appears to be 1: 1 there does not seem to be any reason to suggest that males from
this group are being lost in hostile activities away from the camp in any appreciable numbers. This
interpretation is further supported by the fact that only one individual within this sample displays evidence
of what is most probably mortal wounds suffered as a result of human aggression. 1bis same 1: 1 ratio might
also seem to suggest that female infanticide was not a common practice as has been suggested for some of
the historical groups of this region (Hester 1980; Newcomb 1961; Aten et al. 1976). Inmost societies where
female infanticide is practiced it is common to see it result in an under representation of adult females in the
population. Furthennore, it would not appear on the basis of sex that one portion of the population is being
afforded any special treatment with regards to burial within the cemetery.

AGE
As with sex, a reliable assessment of age is an important aspect in the reconstruction of demographic trends

for a population (Stewart 1978; Bass 1979). Consequently, there are many techniques which have been
developed for age assessment (i.e. Miles 1963; Kerley 1965; McKern 1970; Ericksen 1979; Hoffman 1979;
Lovejoy 1985; Meindl and Lovejoy 1985). While some of these procedures, particularly those based on
developnental sequences (Schour and Massler 1940), can give quite precise age estimates, those based on
degenerative processes, typically associated with old age, tend to be less accurate. Since the assessment of
adult age cannot always be precise, individuals were generally assigned to age categories rather than to an
actual chronological age. In the case of the Blue Bayou sample five major age categories based on qualitative
observations were used: infant (birth to 2 years), early childhood (3 years to 5 years), late childhood (6 years
to 12 years), adolescent (13 years to approximately 20 years), adult (21 years to approximately 45), and old

58 /BLUE BAYOU

adult (46+ years) (El-Najjar and McWilliams 1978; Steele and Bramblett 1988). These were further
supplemented by two additional categories; adolescent/adult and adult/old adult which were used to
accommodate those individuals which showed characteristics of both the categories.

As with the assessment of sex the limiting factor in the selection of techniques for age determination is the
preseivation of skeletal elements necessary for evaluation. Since teeth were the most frequently recovered
element useful for age deteITilination the primary obseivations for the assessment of age were made utilizing
the dentition (Schour and Massler 1940; Miles 1963). When possible these techniques were supplemented
with techniques utilizing other skeletal elements (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971; E1-Najjar and McWilliams
1978; Jurmain 1980; Meindl and Lovejoy 1985; Steele and Bramblett 1988). The age estimations for all
individuals analyzed is provided in Appendix A.
In the case of those individuals in the sub-adult categories it was generally possible, based on the eruption
sequence of the dentition (Schour and Massler 1940), to assign a fairly accurate age to the specimen in
question. When preseivation permitted it was also possible to estimate the age of a sub-adult based on the
degree of epiphyseal fusion (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971). Since these techniques are based on predictable
developnental sequences the age estimates obtained are generally very accurate.
For mature individuals age estimations utilizing the dentition (Miles 1963), as well as other skeletal elements
(JuITilain 1980; Ortner and Putschar 1981 ), were based on the extent of degeneration of the structure under
obseivation. With respect to the dentition the measure of age was based on the extent of occlusal attrition
exhibited following the technique developed by Miles (1963). The degree of attrition for these individuals
was scored on the basis of none, slight (crowns of teeth polished), moderate (some exposure of secondary
dentin on the occlusal surface), heavy (the complete loss of enamel from the occlusal surface), and severe
(the complete loss of enamel from all aspects of the tooth with subsequent reshaping). While the rate of
attrition can be quite variable between populations as a result of differences in the abrasiveness of the diet
or cultural practices in the utilization of the teeth (Dahlberg 1963a,b; Brace and Molnar 1967; Molnar 1968,
1970, 1971, 1972; Cybulski 1974; Patterson 1984) it tends to be fairly constant for individuals within an
egalitarian society. Based on the archeological material recovered from Blue Bayou there appears to be no
evidence of social stratification, so attrition rates for individuals within the population were assumed to be
homogeneous.
Age for mature individuals was also estimated based on the presence of degenerative conditions in the joints
associated with arthritis (Jurmain 1980; Ortner and Putschar 1981 ). In most cases it has been suggested that
degenerative arthritis does not appear until at least the onset of the fourth decade of life (Ortner and Putschar
1981), thereby, making it primarily a condition associated with the old adulthood category of this sample.
Age of mature individuals was also estimated when appropriate, on the degree of obliteration of the cranial
sutures (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971; Meintl and Lovejoy 1985). Of all of the methods utilized to obtain age
estimates this is the least accurate because completely fused sutures are generally associated only with
relatively old individuals. Because these techniques utilized for the assessment of age in adults were open
to a greater range of uncertainty than those for sub-adults, age estimations of mature individuals was based
on as many different techniques as possible.
Of the 52 individuals identified46 were classified as to age (Table 6). Figure 18 shows the age distribution
for the sample. Based on these distributions it appears that the population had experienced an 83% mortality
rate prior to reaching the old adult category (Table 6). As a result it would appear that the mean age at death
was approximately 35 - 40 years. When we statistically compare, by use of Kolomogorov-Smirnov, the age
distributions of the males and females (Table 3 and Figure 18) we find no significant difference between the

number of individuals found in each age category. Th.is suggests that there were no significant differences
in mortality rates between males and females. Th.is indicates that the sample should be relatively reliable
for demographic inteipretation (Ubelaker 1978). However, when we look at the frequency of individuals
assigned to the early childhood category (Table 4 and Figure 4), it appears early childhood was a stressful
period oflife, but individuals smviving past this stage had a fairly strong chance of reaching adulthood. Th.is
inteipretation is supported by the fact that no individuals classified in the late childhood category (Table 4)
were recovered, thereby, suggesting the mortality rate for individuals in this age category was most probably

60 I BWE BAYOU

low. It should be kept in mind that these conclusions are based on a relatively small sample, and can only
be considered tentative.
In summary, the demographic data suggests that at Blue Bayou there was an equal representation of males

and females in all adult age categories which suggest the absence of any biased se1ective pressure between
sexes, either biologically or culturally. Furthennore, the age distribution is generally felt to be in agreement
with those associated with other prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies with respect to the adult population
but juvenile remains appear to be somewhat under represented. The mortality rate appears to be relatively
high during the years of early childhood with an apparent decrease in the juvenile years followed by a rather
strong increase again in adulthood. In general the life span appears to be of modest duration, on the average
not usually exceeding 35 -45 years. However, there are enough individuals surviving to this age and beyond
to suggest that the quality of health might be somewhat better in comparison to what has previously been
suggested for other groups utilizing a similar lifestyle (Hester 1980; Rathbun et al. 1980).
BIOLOGICAL AFFINITY
One aspect of the bioarcheology of the prehistoric Coastal Plain of Texas which has received little attention
to date is the question of the possible biological relationships of the various reported samples within the area.
The evaluation of biological aff'mities of human populations has proved quite beneficial in the understanding

of the bioarcheology of other regions (Wilkinson 1971; Jantz 1974; Ossenberg 1974; Buikstra 1976, 1977;
E1-Najjar 1978; Droessler 1981; Owsley et al. 1981). The only real study directed toward this question for
prehistoric coastal populations of Texas is that of Wilkinson (1977). He suggested that it was possible to
identify pre-contact Karankawans based on the structure and robusticity of the mandible and skull, and that
Shell Point, Jamaica Beach and the Oso Creek material represent samples of this population. This idea was
further considered by Comuzzie et al. (1986) to suggest the possible biological relationship of the Palm
Harbor material to these sites.
For this study, comparisons of the Blue Bayou material with other samples followed Wilkinson (1977), and
Finnegan and Marcsik (1979). The Blue Bayou sample was compared to both the Palm Harbor sample
(Comuzzie et al. 1986), suggested as representing pre-contact Karankawan, and material from San Juan
Capistrano (Humphreys 1971), a sample identified as historic Coahuiltecan. It should be noted, however,
that upon examination of the San Juan Capistrano material for this comparison it became apparent that this
may not be as biologically a homogeneous a population as previous!y reported.
Based on a visual assessment of the mandibles of the three samples, utilizing the characteristics outlined by
Wilkinson ( 1977), it would appear that the Blue Bayou material is more similar in appearance to the Palm
Harbor sample than to the San Juan Capistrano sample. Statistical comparisons of the means for measurements of the mandible documented no significant difference between Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor for gonial
angle, height of ascending ramus, and mandible length (Tables 7 - 9). However, there was a significant
difference between these populations with respect to minimum breadth of the ascending ramus (Table 10).
This suggests that the Blue Bayou population is more closely associated with these prehistoric coastal
populations than to the historic Coahuiltecan sample. The lack of similarity between Blue Bayou and San
Juan Capistrano is not swprising since the two samples are separated chronologically from each other by
approximately a thousand years. However, the similarities between the Blue Bayou sample and Palm Harbor
is important since they suggest that there is some degree of relationship between the slightly inland Blue
Bayou population and those living directly on the coast

*(cf. Finnegan and Marcsik 1979).

Comparisons between Blue Bayou, Palm Harbor and San Juan Capistrano were also made following the
technique of Finnegan and Marcsik (1979). This technique assesses similarity based on shared discontinuous
traits of the skull and mandible. It has been shown that these characteristics have a high genetic component
and the differences in the frequencies with which they occur in different populations may be a reflection of
genetic relationships (Leslie 1977; E1-Najjar 1978; Finnegan and Marcsik 1979). Individuals from the three
samples were scored for the presence or absence of the 42 characteristics listed in Appendix E. While actual
biological distance statistics were not calculated some relationships did begin to emerge. Once again the
Blue Bayou material shared few characteristics with the San Juan Capistrano sample and more with the
sample from Palm Harbor. Table 11 provides the number of individuals exhibiting each of the various
characteristics from each of the sites compared.

ANALYSIS OF SKELE/'AL POPUIAT/ON / 63

Along with the discrete characteristics of the skull and mandible (Finnegan and Marcsik 1979) the Blue
Bayou sample exhibits what Taylor (1978) considered relatively rare dental variations (see below). None
of these dental variations were reported for Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986) or San Juan Capistrano
(Personal observations). Based on the presence of these relatively rare genetic traits of the dentition it would
appear that the Blue Bayou sample might represent a fairly isolated breedin population (Leslie 1977;
E1-Najjar 1978).
While these assessments are only tentative they should offer a starting point for future research in this area.
At present it would appear that the Blue Bayou sample might have been relatively isolated as a breeding
population. This point is supported not only by the dental evidence but also by a statistical analysis of the
means of cranial measurements between Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor which tends to suggest a slight
difference in cranial shape (Tables 12 - 15). However, it does share similarities in the structure of the
mandible and cranium (Wilkinson 1977) with individuals from the Palm Harbor sample which might
suggests a possible biological affinity with this and other prehistoric populations from the coast

Stature and Physique
As with sex and age, the estimation of stature and physique of individuals plays an integral part in the

interpretation of the biology of a population. Stature and robusticity can serve as an indicator of the general
quality of health of an individual and it has even been suggested that perhaps the degree of sexual dimorphism
expressed in a population might be a strong indicator of the success of the subsistence pattern being utilized
by that population (Stini 1969, 1972; Doran 1975; Brauer 1982; ).
STATURE

When attempting to reconstruct the physical appearance of an individual from a skeletal sample the easiest
and most useful estimations are those of stature. This is in large part due to the many discriminant function
fonnulae which have been developed for the estimation of stature (i.e. Trotter and Gieser 1952; Genoves
1967; Steele 1970; Musgrave and Harneja 1978). While the theory behind the reconstruction of stature is
relatively simple, the material recovered does not always avail itself to these fonnulae. As with sex, an
estimation of stature can only be accurately attempted with the remains of mature individuals. Furthennore,
it is generally only the long bones of the appendicular skeleton that are of use in stature estimations. Often

ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL POPULATION/ 65

in archeological samples, such as in Blue Bayou, these skeletal elements necessary to reconstruct stature are
incomplete.
There were no intact long bones recovered from Blue Bayou making it necessary to first estimate their intact
lengths before any estimations of stature could be attempted. This was accomplished following Steele and
McKem (1969), Steele (1970), and Steele and Bramblett (1988). Of 52 individuals from Blue Bayou it was
possible to reconstruct the lengths of 16 long bones; 6 femurs, 3 ti.bias, and 7 humeri (Table 16) representing
a total of 10 individuals.
Of the formulae developed for the estimation of stature the two most commonly followed are those derived
by Trotter and Gieser (1952) and Genoves (1967). The formulae of Trotter and Gieser (1952) were developed
from measurements of long bones of American whites and blacks taken from the Terry collection and a
Mongoloid sample taken from WW II casualties. The formulae of Genoves (1967) were based on long bone
lengths of a Mesoamerican cadaveral sample. As a result of the use of different study samples the two
methods do not yield the same estimation of stature for an unknown individual (Table 17).
Therefore, to insure as accurate an estimation of stature as possible mean long bone lengths from the Blue
Bayou sample were compared with those utilized in the creation of the formulae developed by Trotter and
Gieser (1952) and Genoves (1967). The mean long bone lengths for this sample are shown in Table 18.
Upon comparison it was found that the mean long bone lengths from Blue Bayou more closely corresponded
to those of the Mesoamerican sample utilized by Genoves (1967). Consequently, the stature estimations for
the Blue Bayou sample were made utilizing Genoves's (1967) fonnulae.

Based on reconstructed lengths following Steele (1970).

Stature was estimated for six individuals from Blue Bayou. Four of the individuals analyzed were identified
as males, one as female, and one as sex indeterminate. For the individual for which it was not possible to
determine sex, stature estimates based on both the male and female formulae were calculated. This was done
to give a possible range of stature for this individual regardless of its actual sex. The stature estimations for
these six individuals are provided in Table 19 and again in Appendix A. The mean stature for both the males
and the females is provided in Table 17.
In Table 20 the mean stature, based on the length of the femur, for males from Blue Bayou is compared with

those for males of two other prehistoric sites from the Coastal Plain area of Texas, Shell Point (Wilkinson
1973) and Oso Creek (Wilkinson 1973). Since mean female statures were not provided for these two
comparative samples, the comparison of stature at Blue Bayou to that of Shell Point (Wilkinson 1973) and

Oso Creek (Wilkinson 1973) is restricted to the male values. Based on a statistical analysis of the male
means there does appear to be a significant difference in the means between Blue Bayou and Shell Point
(Wilkinson 1973) and Oso Creek (Wilkinson 1973). It appears that the mean stature for Blue Bayou is
slightly less than that for the other sites mentioned.Also, when the range of stature at each site is compared
it is seen that the range of the Blue Bayou sample generally falls outside the low end of the other samples.
However, the mean stature for Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986) appears to be very near that of Blue
Bayou. Unfortunately since the remains from Palm Harbor were recovered in a commingled condition
(Comuzzie et al. 1986) it was only possible to provide a mean stature based on the combined long bones
present making a comparison by sex with other samples impossible. However, when the mean of the Palm
Harbor sample is compared to both the male and female mean from Blue Bayou there appears to be no
significant difference. It has been suggested by Comuzzie et al. ( 1986) that the mean stature at Palm Harbor
is very close to that of Shell Point, Oso Creek and other prehistoric coastal sites from Texas. Therefore, the
apparent difference in the mean as well as the range of stature between the Blue Bayou sample and those of
Shell Point and Oso Creek may either reflect a true difference from these samples or may only be the result
of the relatively small size of the samples from which they are drawn. It is possible that the mean stature of
Blue Bayou may indeed be slightly less than that of other prehistoric populations since statistical comparison

those from the coastal region, do show a significant difference (Table 21).
ROBUSTICITY

Robusticity is an important parameter in the reconstruction of the general physique of a sample and the extent
of sexual dimorphism present. While the robusticity of an individual is not as quantifiable as stature,
estimates of robusticity still seive as important indicators of the general quality of health in a population
(Acheson 1960; Stini 1961, 1971, 1972, 1982; Tobias 1972; Van Geiven 1972; Doran 1975; Anderson et
al. 1977; Brauer 1982; Hamilton 1982). While most fotmal studies of robusticity have been based on
quantitative data, in this case they were also supplemented with qualitative obseivations (Anderson et al.
1977; Wilkinson 1977). Measurements were made whenever possible for all identifiable elements with these
means presented in tables 22 - 29.
From the qualitative analysis the Blue Bayou sample appears to be relatively robust. Based on visual analysis
the cortical bone of most of the individuals examined appears relatively thick, with most sites of muscle
attachment are well defined, the browridges were readily apparent, and the mandibles appeared massive and
bilobed. This visual assessment is also supported by the metrical data.
The means from the metrical analysis of the skull and mandible (Tables 22 and 23) were compared (Tables
7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30, and 31) with those of Palm Harbor, a prehistoric coastal sample which has
been described as relatively robust (Comuzzie et al. 1986) and San Juan Capistrano, a historic Coahuiltecan

sample, that on personal observation is felt to be relatively graciJe. All statistical comparisons were made
utilizing the male mean for a measurement.
Based on statistical analysis of comparable measurements for Blue Bayou and San Juan Capistrano, parietal
thickness (Table 30) and mastoid length (Table 31), the means from Blue Bayou were significantly larger,
while there did not appear to be a significant difference between Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor for parietal
thickness (Table 30), maximum cranial breadth (Table 15), mastoid length (Table 31), gonial angle (Table
7), height of ascending ramus (Table 8), and length of mandibular body (Table 9). These parameters are felt
to be a very good reflection of robusticity (Anderson et al. 1977) and are in large part responsible for giving
the cranial remains from Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor their characteristic structure (Wilkinson 1977;
Comuzzie et al. 1986). However, there were significant differences between Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor
for the mean values of maximum cranial length (Table 14), horizontal circumference of the cranium (Table
13), minimum frontal breadth (Table 11), and minimum breadth of ascending ramus of mandibJe (Table 10).
With the exception of minimum breadth of the ascending ramus, the differences with these other measurements is felt to reflect differences in the shape of the skull and face of the Palm Harbor sample rather than

a difference in robusticity. It is also suggested that the difference in the means of the minimum breadth of
the ascending ramus is most probably a reflection of sample size. As a result it is felt that the skulls and
mandibles from Blue Bayou are close in robusticity to what has been described for other prehistoric samples
from the Texas coast (Wilkinson 1973, 1977; Comuzzie et al. 1986).
The mean values for measurements of the long bones from Blue Bayou (Tables 24 - 27) were also compared
with those of other samples, and tended to support this assessment of relative robusticity. This time the male
means for these measurements were compared with those from other prehistoric populations from Texas

grouped by cultural area utilizing the values reported by Doran (1975). The cultural areas utilized for
comparison were defined as Central Texas, Caddo, Coastal, and Trans - Pecos (Doran 1975). The means
forthese areas were compared to those from Blue Bayou for humerus length (Table 32), femur length (Table
21), and tibia length (Table 33). In addition the mean midshaft circumference of the femur for Blue Bayou
and Palm Harbor were also compared (Table 34). The samples from central Texas, the coastal region, and
the Caddo were all described as relatively robust while the sample from the Trans - Pecos was felt to be
relatively gracile (Doran 1975). For all of these cultural areas compared with Blue Bayou there was no
significant difference in the means for the length of the humerus (Table 32). However, it must be noted that
there is a significant difference between the means for humerus lengths for the Trans - Pecos sample
compared to those of the central Texas and coastal samples (Table 32).
In telills of femur length there is a significant statistical difference between the mean of Blue Bayou and the

central Texas and coastal samples but no significance between those of the Caddo and Trans - Pecos sample
(Table 21). The statistical comparison of the mean length of the tibia for Blue Bayou with these other samples

and non-significance tends to indicate that perhaps Blue Bayou is relatively robust, but not quite to the degree
of the central Texas and coastal samples. However, this apparent difference is probably more a reflection
of differences in mean stature since it is the length of the femur that did not appear as large while there was
no significant difference in the mean midshaft circumference.

*This sample may not reflect a homogenesis biological population.

In general this sample displays a greater degree of robusticity to that of many prehistoric samples from this

region as well as elsewhere (Phenice 1969; Wilkinson 1971; Bass et al. 1971; Aten et al. 1976; Marek 1985)
and very similar to that seen in other prehistoric samples from this region (Jackson 1933; Aten 1965;
Wilkinson 1971; Comuzzie et al. 1986).
Along with the apparent robusticity there appears to be a relatively pronounced degree of sexual dimorphism
present in the Blue Bayou sample. This estimation of the degree of sexual dimorphism is based on both a
visual assessment as well as a statistical comparison of mean values between males and females for the
metrical data. Those characteristics which are typically regarded as being the most reflective of sexual
variation, characteristics of the skull and general size of sites of muscle attachment throughout the skeletal
system, were given the most emphasis during qualitative observations.

*Data obtained from Comuzzie et al. (1986) and personal observation.

Based on a visual assessment the differences in the mandibles of the males and females appeared to be very
similar to those described for the two sexes from Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986), Shell Point and Oso
Creek (Wilkinson 1977). For all of these sites this difference in shape and size of the mandible has been
reported as a strong indicator of sexual dimorphism (Wilkinson 1977; Comuzzie et al. 1986). Also there
was a noticeable difference in the extent of expression of the browridges in the sexes. Again the degree of
differences observed appears to be very similar to that reported for this same feature for other prehistoric
populations from this site (Aten 1967; Wilkinson 1973, 1977; Comuzzie et al. 1986). Comuzzie et al. (1986)
have also suggested that there may be sexually related differences in the shape of the cranium of individuals
at Palm Harbor and Oso Creek. However, these differences do not appear to be present in the Blue Bayou
sample.
The sire and shape of the mandible was of particular interest since it has commonly been considered an
indicator of sexual dimorphism (Anderson et al. 1977; Wilkinson 1977; Milner 1982). The means for males
and females from Blue Bayou were compared statistically with respect to length of mandibular body,
minimum breadth of ram.us, and gonial angle (Table 23). Based on this analysis it was found that the male
means for all three of these measurements was significantly greater than that of the females. It is the result
of these metrical differences between the sexes which contribute greatly to the structural differences of the
mandible on visual assessment. It is interesting to note, however, that for those cranial measurements for
which statistical comparisons could be made, frontal chord, frontal arc, and mastoid Jength (Table 22), there
were no significant differences between the sexes. While there is no statistical difference between the mean
mastoid Jengths of males and females the male mastoids still appeared larger and more developed than those
of the females. It is highly possible, due to the limited sire of the sample analyred, that there may actually
be more variability in mastoid lengths between the sexes than the statistics suggest. The lack of significance
in the means of frontal chord and frontal arc may be a reflection of the possible homogeneity of cranial shape
between the sexes.
Statistical comparisons were also made for the male and female means for the humerus, femur and tibia
(Tables 24, 26, 27). For the humerus the mean maximum length and mean minimum circumference were
compared between the sexes and not found to be significantly different. It has been suggested that the sire
of the femoral head and neck as well as the width of the epicondyle are a very accurate indicator of an
individual's total body mass and sexual dimorphism (Hirsch and Frankel 1960; Jolicoeur 1963; Van Gerven
1972) while midshaft measurements tend to be slightly less useful. Unfortunately, the femur measurements
recorded for the Blue Bayou sample, which were applicable for comparison between the sexes, were

76 I BLUE BAYOU

restricted to measurements of the midshaft. These included the anterior- posterior diameter of the mid- shaft
and mid-shaft circumference (Table 26). There is no significant difference in the means of the anterior posterior mid-shaft diameter but those for mid-shaft circumference are significant Of the two measurements, that of mid-shaft circumference is a much better indicator of sexual differences, as demonstrated by
Black ( 1978a). Measurements for the tibia, anterior-posterior diameter of mid-shaft, medial-lateral diameter
of the mid-shaft, anterior-posterior nutrient foramen diameter, and medial lateral nutrient foreman diameter,
were also compared between the sexes (Table 27). The only means which proved significantly different
were those for the anterior-posterior diameter of the mid-shaft. In general both the visual and statistical
analysis suggest the presence of a relatively large degree of sexual dimorphism in this sample comparable
to that reported for other prehistoric populations from this same region of Texas (Aten 1963; Wilkinson
1973, 1977; Comuzzie et al. 1986).
Several studies conducted on living populations have suggested that there might be a connection between
the amount of sexual dimorphism displayed within a population and the quality of the subsistence level of
that population (Stini 1969, 1972, 1982; Tobias 1972; Brauer 1982). From an archeological perspective
recent authors (Doran 1975; Milner 1982; Comuzzie et al. 1986) have begun to suggest that perhaps the
degree of sexual dimorphism seen in skeletal samples from archeological sites might also be a reflection of
health and subsistence in prehistoric populations as well. This argument is based on the assumption that
body sire in tenns oflarge muscle mass will be reflected in the robusticity of the sites of origin and insertion
of the muscle. It has also been suggested that females tend to be evolutionarily buffeted against shifts in
body sire due to the requirements of child bearing so that it is the body mass of the male which is going to
respond in growth efficiency to the quality of the subsistence available (Brauer 1982). As a result the greater
the sire difference between males and females of a sample the better the subsistence base, while decreased
sexual dimorphism would indicate a poorer level of subsistence. This same idea has been proposed for the
interpretation of skeletal populations (Doran 1975). Based on the comparison oflong bones Doran (1975)
has suggested that of all the cultural areas he considered, the material from the Trans - Pecos region showed
the least amount of sexual dimorphism while the samples from central Texas and the coast showed the
greatest sexual dimorphism. Doran (1975) further states the environmental and archeological data tend to
suggest a much less successful subsistence pattern for the Trans - Pecos sample than that of the populations
for the central Texas and coastal areas. Given that the Blue Bayou sample tends to express a similar degree
of robusticity and sexual dimorphism as that seen in the coastal samples from Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al.
1986), Shell Point (Wilkinson 1973), Jamaica Beach (Aten 1963), and Oso Creek (Wilkinson 1977) it is
possible to suggest similar findings to those of Doran (1975). It would appear then that the subsistence
pattern for the Blue Bayou population provided a relatively strong dietary base and contributed to a generally
high level of health, a condition supported by the data for pathology and demographics. This is significant
since it again suggests a hunter-gatherer pattern of subsistence might be more successful than it has often
times been portrayed (Newcomb 1961; Hester 1980; Rathbun et al. 1981).

Pathology, Trauma, and Anomalies
The identification and interpretation of pathological conditions, traumatic injuries, and physical anomalies
has long been a major focal point of the analysis of osteological samples from archeological sites (Jarcho
1966; Steinbock 1976; E1-Najjar and McWilliams 1978; Morse 1978; Ubelaker 1978; Ortner andPutschar
1981; Shipman et al. 1985; Steele and Bramblett 1988). The types and prevalence of these conditions is a
primary measure for the quality of life in a population. The analysis of pathological conditions has been
used by E1-Najjaret al. (1978), Rose et al. (1978), Harris et al. (1980), Rathbun et al. (1981), and Patterson
(1984) as a means of assessing how well a population has adapted to its environment. Other studies have
utilired the types of traumatic injuries present as indicators of specific cultural practices (Ubelaker et al.

ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL POPULATION/ 11

1969; Ubelaker 1979). The integration of this type of information with that of sex, age, and physique,
therefore, can provide an excellent foundation for the understanding of the biological aspect of these early
populations. A description of the pathologies, trawna, and anomalies encountered by individual for the Blue
Bayou sample is provided in Appendix A.
DENTITION

As a result of their density and compact size the elements of the dentition were generally the best preserved.
Fortunately, analysis of the dentition is relatively easy and offers a wealth of biological information. The
analysis of the teeth and associated structures has been shown to have much to offer as an indicator of chronic
disease and metabolic stress in individuals and populations (El-Najjar et al. 1978; Rose et al. 1978; Sciulli
1978; Jablonski 1983; Patterson 1984). The attrition of the dentition also reflects patterns of usage associated
withfoodandmaterialprocessing (Brace andMolnar1967; Molnar 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972; Cybulski 1974;
Comuzzie and Steele 1987) as well as cultural practices (Ubelaker et al. 1969; Comuzzie et al. 1986).
In terms of pathologies the teeth of individuals of the Blue Bayou sample were analyzed for indicators of
chronic disease and metabolic stress as well as diseases specific to the oral cavity. This analysis revealed
symptoms of infectious disease along with evidence of possible episodes of metabolic stress in a relative!y
large portion of the sample. Of the 52 individuals identified a total of 11 individuals exhibited evidence of
oral pathology or enamel defects generally associated with chronic disease or metabolic stress (El-Najjar et
al. 1978; Rose et al. 1978; Sciulli 1978; Jablonski 1983; Patterson 1984). Of these individuals, 7 exhibited
signs of periodontal infection (100, 160, 200, 230, 240, 250, 290), often with associated resorption of the
alveolar bone (Figure 19). Four of the individuals, (010, 200, 210, 250), exhibited signs of carious activity
(Tables 35 and 36), some of which was also associated with periodontal infection (Figure 20). One of the
individuals, (010), exhibited a tooth with sufficient decay to have caused damage to the nerve (Figure 20).
Three individuals, (200, 250, and 290), exhibited what might be evidence of hypercementosis, perhaps
associated with severe attrition (Spouge 1973; Comuzzie and Steele 1987) (Figure 16 ). One individual,
(240), had lost much of the hard palate as a result of a generalized infection apparently caused by a traumatic
injury (Figure 21).

A high percentage of the dental elements recovered from Blue Bayou also possessed a relatively heavy
accumulation of calculus. The presence of calculus, or plaque, is generally believed to be a primary causative
agent in the develoIJIIent of periodontal infection as well as tooth decay (Hill 1949; Boyle 1955; Gorlin and
Goldman 1970; Shafer et al. 1974). Several studies (Boyle 1955; Davies 1972; St. Hoyme and Koritzer
1976) have suggested that the high levels of attrition characteristically seen in prehistoric populations, along
with a diet typically low in simple carbohydrates played a major role in preventing a build up of plaque.
Attrition has been considered a primary factor in helping to prevent periodontal infection and tooth decay
by literally abrading away any cracks or crevices in which food particles could become lodged along with
keeping the surface of the teeth polished (Hall 1976; St. Homye and Koritzer 1976). The appearance of
agriculture along with a trend toward increased civilization in many populations has been correlated with a
marked increase in the amount of carious activity (Boyle 1949; Davies 1972; Turner 1979). The increase
in caries of agriculture based populations is attributed to the increased use of processed carbohydrates in
their diet.
There appears perllaps to be a difference in the frequency of carious activity between the Blue Bayou sample
and that of Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986), Shell Point (Wilkinson 1973), and Jamaica Beach (Aten
1965) (Table 37). For these sites carious activity was only identified in one individual per sample and limited
to a singJe tooth. The degree of attrition seen at Blue Bayou, Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et al. 1986), Shell

Point (Wilkinson 1973), and Jamaica Beach (Aten 1965) appear to be relatively equal. This is important
since it has been shown that populations with high levels of attrition tend to have low levels of caries (St.
Hoyme and Koritzer 1976) and as a result it would seem that the frequencies of caries should be relatively
equal for all of these samples. However, other studies have shown that this difference in the frequency of
carious activity between coastal and inland groups is quite common (Dunning 1953; Davies 1972). These
differences in frequency might suggest that there was some fundamental difference in dietary components
between the Blue Bayou sample and these more coastal adapted groups. It is possible that the Blue Bayou
sample might have been relying more heavily on simple carbohydrates than these other populations.
However, this should not be taken to imply the practice of agriculture with this population since there was
no cultural evidence recovered to suggest its presence.
Teeth of four individuals (010, 080, 100, 120, and 190) along with several surface collected teeth show what
appears to be evidence of enamel hypoplasia. Several studies have shown the correlation of enamel defects
to chronic disease or metabolic stress during an individuals developmental years (El-Najjar et al. 1978; Rose
et al. 1978; Sciulli 1978; Jablonski 1983; Patterson 1984). Hypoplastic lines are left in the enamel whenever
the individual experiences sufficient stress to cause an arrest in growth. It is the sire and number of these
lines which can serve as an indicator of the quality of health within a population.
Based on the enamel defects observed in the Blue Bayou individuals it appears that this sample may have
been subjected to occasional periods of mild to pronounced metabolic stress, perhaps as a result of a
fluctuation in the level of subsistence, or disease. This interpretation is suggested by the fact that five
individuals exhibited at least one relatively well defined hypoplastic line in the enamel of a tooth. The
presence of hypoplastic lines has not been reported for other samples from this region most probably as a
result of the small sample sires previously analyzed along with the relative recency of research into the
prehistoric records of dental hypoplasia.

*Only represents the nwnber of individuals with ~ociated dentition.

In tenns of traumatic injuries associated with the dentition, the most oommon oondition enoountered was
attrition. 'This is not unusual since marked levels of attrition appear to be characteristic of hunter-gatherer
societies (Hinton 1981 ). All the mature individuals with associated dentition, (010, 020, 080, 090, 100, 120,
140, 160, 170, 180, 200, 230, 240, 250, 290, 300), from Blue Bayou displayed some degree of attrition, with
12 of these individuals described as exhibiting moderate to severe levels (Figure 22). While there has been
an increasing trend to view attrition as a natural process (Lavelle 1969; Berry 1976; Hall 1976; Mills 1976;
Hinton 1981), it still oonstitutes a degenerative change in the structure of the tooth as a result of external
forces. Recent wmks have pointed out the relationship between attrition and the maintenance of proper
occlusion through the formation of the helicoidal plane (Hall and Gennan 1975; Roydhouse 1975; Hall
1976). However, in those situations where the levels of attrition exceed that which is necessary to maintain
proper occlusion pathological oonditions may result (Lavelle 1973; Berry 1976; Comuzzie and Steele 1987).
Severe levels of attrition can often result in the displacement or reorientation of the affected tooth (Reinhardt
1983) along with major changes in the occlusal surface (Comuzzie and Steele 1987).

It has been suggested that hypercementosis may be a pathological response to traumatic levels of attrition
(Spouge 1973; Comuzzie and Steele 1987). This is of interest since the three individuals from Blue Bayou
which display evidence of hypercementosis, (200, 250, 290), also were described as exhibiting heavy levels
of attrition. In all three individuals it is one of the first molars which displayed evidence of hypercementosis
as well as the beginnings of a distinctive wear pattern which has also been described for individuals with
severe levels of attrition from the Texas ooast (Comuzzie et al. 1986; Comuzzie and Steele 1987) as well as
elsewhere (Taylor 1963; Rheinhardt 1983). Past studies have suggested that such patterns of wear and
attrition may be associated with special dietary practices (Campbell 1925; Taylor 1963; Smith 1972; Hinton
1981) or cultural utilization of the dentition (Campbell 1925; Dahlberg 1963; Davies 1963; Molnar 1970,
1971, 1972; Cybulski 1974).
Another unusual pattern of wear was enoountered on the lingual surface of the upper incisors of six
individuals (010, 020, 080, 170, 230, and 250) (Figure 23). Associated with this is the presence of marked
wear facets on the occlusal surface of the incisors on several individuals (Figure 23). When possible the
maxillary and mandibular dentition were placed in nonnal occlusion which, however, failed to explain these
patterns as a result of nonnal mastication. It is suggested therefore, that these wear facets are most likely
the result of dietary or cultural practices involving the use of the incisors to grasp or prepare materials.
Only two individuals from Blue Bayou (100 and 240) displayed evidence of traumatic damage most probably
resulting from aggressive or accidental injury. In the case of individual 100 the damage was limited to the

chipping of the right second maxillary molar. In individual 240 the right central and lateral maxillary incisors
appear to have been broken in life and subsequent! y infection and abscessing of the hard palate in the region
of the tooth occurred (Figure 21).
Considering physical anomalies, the dental sample from Blue Bayou exhibited several interesting variations.
The most common variation encountered in this sample was the presence of extremely shovel shaped
incisors. While this condition is generally not seen in most populations it is characteristic of Amerindian
groups (Dahlberg 1949). One of the individuals, (230), possessed impacted mandibular third molars causing
twisting and overlapping of the anterior dentition as a result of crowding (Figure 24). While impacted third
molars can be common in both modern and prehistoric groups of many ethnic backgrounds (Taylor 1978)
they generally have not been reported for prehistoric populations from the Coastal Plain of Texas. Davies
(1972) suggested that impacted third molars are rare among Amerindian groups due to the generally high
level of interproximal attrition which creates sufficient space for their eruption. The low frequency of
malocclusion among Texas coastal populations could be a result of the relatively small numberofindividuals
from this region which have been extensively analyzed to date.
Two individuals examined (090 and 230) each possessed an enamel pearl on a molar tooth (Figure 25).
Enamel pearls are quite common anomalies within a population (Taylor 1978). There is also evidence of
atypically small and peg shaped third molars in two individuals (090 and 120), a condition which Taylor
(1978) has reported as being relatively rare (Figure 11). Both mandibular canines of one individual (200),
exhibited double roots, another dental variation described as rare (Alexandersen 1963; Taylor 1978) (Figure
25). Individual (250) exhibited a gap of approximately 4.0 mm between the left and right central maxillary
incisor a condition listed as somewhat rare by Taylor (1978) (Figure 25). It is possible that the presence of
this collection of relatively rare dental anomalies within this sample might be a reflection of an isolated
breeding population since it is generally common for gene flow between populations to reduce the occurrence
of rare physical variations (Turner 1967; Leslie 1977; El- Najjar 1978).

SKELETON
While the skeletal material from Blue Bayou was examined for evidence of pathology, trauma, and anomalies
it did not yield as much information as the dentition. This is partly due to the fact that the elements of the
skeletal system were typically incomplete or recovered in fragmented condition. Furthermore, the skeletal
system does not generally record episodes of metabolic stress or chronic disease as well as the teeth. Even
with these problems the skeletal material from Blue Bayou did exhibit some pathological conditions.
For evidence of pathological conditions in prehistoric populations to be recovered, the diseases present must
have some direct effect on the skeletal system of an individual (Steinbock 1977; El-Najjar and McWilliams
1978; Shipman et al. 1985; Steele and Bramblett 1988). Unfortunately a great majority of diseases leave no
record on the skeletal elements. However, two diseases which do leave such evidence, arthritis and either
osteomyelitis or periostitis, are present in this sample.
Two individuals (050 and 450) display evidence of arthritis (Figure 26). In both cases the condition is
manifested as arthritic lipping of the articular ends of the affected bones. In individual 050 this condition
was noted in the middle phalanges of the foot, and in 450 the proximal joint of the right ulna. While the
development of arthritic lipping of the joints is generally a reflection of age it can also result from repeated
stress to a joint (Steinbock 1976; Jurrnain 1980; Ortner and Putschar 1981). In the case of individual 050
this condition is most probably a result of the aging process since 050 was assessed as an adult/old adult,
the age category in which degenerative arthritis often begins to occur (Junnain 1980; Ortner and Putschar

1981). However, the age of individual 450 is estimated to be in his late teens to early twenties thereby
suggesting that the arthritic lipping seen is most probably the result of severe stress resulting from repeated
injury or constant utilization (Steinbock. 1976; E1-Najjar and McWilliams 1978; Ubelaker 1978; Ortner and
Putschar 1981; Shipman et al. 1985; Steele and Bramblett 1988).
The development of arthritis appears to be a fairly common phenomenon in most prehistoric hunter-gatherer
societies due to the constant stress and strains of every day life (Ortner and Putschar 1981). In comparison
with other samples from this region of Texas the number of individuals reported from this sample as
exhibiting evidence of arthritic activity is low. However, this difference in numbers of individuals is most
probably a direct reflection of the lack of articular ends for most of the material recovered from Blue Bayou
and not a reflection of significant differences in lifestyles.
Also present in this sample is evidence of possibly either osteomyelitis or periostitis. Both of these conditions
can be caused by a wide range of pathological agents but are generally indicative of wide spread infection
in the individual involved (Steinbock. 1977; Ortner and Putschar 1981). The evidence for these conditions
at Blue Bayou come from the presence of secondary bone growth on the femurs of two individuals (060,
and 440). In the case of individual 060 there is a large mass of secondary bone located on the lower medial
surface of the right femur measuring approximately 30 mm x 12 mm (Figure 27). In individual 440 there
is evidence of reactive bone growth on the posterior aspect of the left femur (Figure 27).
In the case of osteomyelitis the causative agent is a bacteria, typically Staphylococcus, which can be
introduced to the bone by several means (Steinbock. 1976; Ortner and Putschar 1981). This introduction is
generally brought about by the infection of traumatic injuries, either in the immediate proximity to the
affected bone, or from remote sites of infection by passage through the blood stream (Steinbock. 1976; Ortner
and Putschar 1981).

The etiology of periostitis is even more enigmatic. Periostitis is typically not a disease in itself but rather a
reaction to pathological conditions by the bone involved (Steinbock 1977; Ortner and Putschar 1981).
Periostitis can arise in response to infection and inflammation of the periosteum as a result of traumatic
injury as well as the result of several osteologically unidentifiable diseases. Therefore, it is not possible to
suggest more than the presence of severe and perllaps widespread infection or trauma in these two individuals
(060 and 440) as a cause for the conditions noted.
Evidence of traumatic injury was limited to one individual in the Blue Bayou sample. This individual, ( 160),
was recovered with an arrow point in tight association with the vertebral column. Based on the proximity
and orientation of the point to the vertebral column it would appearthat the individual was shot from behind.
Since the point was recovered in context with the remains it is felt to most likely to have been the cause of
death. This could pemaps tend to suggest that there might have been at least some limited aggressive activity
between this population and another on occasion.
In comparison to the dental material the anomalies encountered in the skeletal material is very limited. Two
individuals (160 and 210) exhibit what appears to be an incomplete fusion of the metopic suture (Figure 28).
In most individuals this suture, which is located on the frontal bone, has fused by early childhood. The
recognizable presence of this suture beyond the second year of life is considered to be relatively rare
(Breathnach 1965; E1-Najjar and McWilliams 1978). Studies have shown that the presence of an unfused
metopic suture is often associated with other anomalies of the skull and hands (Montague 1937; Hess 1946).
Other research has suggested that the retention of the metopic suture is a dominant trait (Torgersen 1951)
and one that tends to be slightly more common in females (Akabori 1934; Ossenberg 1969). Since this is a

ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL POPULATION/ 89

genetically detellllined characteristic its presence or absence in other groups suspected of being related to
the population of Blue Bayou might prove useful in assessments of biological affinity (Turner 1967; Leslie
1977; Finnegan and Marcsik 1979).

CHAPTER VII
SUMMARY OF BIOARCHEOLOGICAL DATA

Blue Bayou is one of the largest prehistoric hunter-gatherer samples from the Central Coastal Plain to be
analyzed to date. The sample consists of a total of 52 individuals of both sexes and all ages. While the
skeletal samples from Oso Creek (Jackson 1935), and Morhiss (Campbell 1976), are larger, there have been
no detailed biological analyses done on the Morniss sample and only one study on the Oso sample, published
50 years ago. The majority of nearby prehistoric coastal sites which have been studied have generally
consisted of fewer than 10 individuals (Aten 1963; Wilkinson 1973; Mallof and Zavaleta 1979; Comuzzie
et al. 1986). Yet it is from these small samples that our current understanding of the physical anthropology
of this region is based. The analysis of the Blue Bayou sample then provides needed support for most of the
previously held views, as well as offering several new ones, concerning the biology of the prehistoric
inhabitants of the Texas Coastal Plain.
The statistical analysis of the sex ratio for the Blue Bayou sample suggests that the mnnber of males to
females is not significantly different. There is also no statistical difference in the number of females to the
number of males within each of the age categories were sex could be assessed. Ten individuals from a sample
of 22 individuals assessed to sex were identified as female and 12 were identified as male. It would appear
that there were no selective forces, either biologically or culturally, operating on the basis of sex in this
sample. This is important since it has been reported that several of the historic populations from this region
may have practiced female infanticide (Newcomb 1961; Aten et al. 1976; Hester 1980), a custom which can
lead to a change in the expected sex ratio of a population. The presence of a 1: 1 sex ratio for this sample
also tends to suggest that there was no preferential treatment of individuals with regards to burial practices
on the basis of sex.
The age distribution appears to be similar to distributions reported for other hunter-gatherer populations. It
was possible to estimate the age of 36 of the 52 individuals recovered with 5 classified as early childhood,
1 as adolescent, 5 as adolescent/adult, 19 as adult, 4 as adult/old adult, and 2 as old adult There were no
individuals recovered assignable to the late childhood age category. This may either represent a bias in
recovery or may be a reflection of a lowered mortality rate for this group. Statistical analysis of this age
distribution with respect to sex showed no significant difference in the number of males to females within
each age category. Based on the statistical analysis of the distribution of individuals between age categories
it appears that the number of individuals classified as adult, 19, is significantly higher than all the others.
As a result the mean age at death in this population is approximately 35 - 40 years of age. From this
distribution it appears that early childhood was a relatively stressful period. A decrease in mortality is seen
in late childhood and adolescence. However, upon reaching maturity, adolescent/adult, the mortality rate
again begins to increase reaching its maximlllll during the adult age category with the population having
suffered an 83% mortality rate by this time.
A limited assessment of the possible biological affinity of the Blue Bayou sample was also made in attempt
to place this sample in context with other prehistoric populations within this region. The material from Blue
Bayou was compared with a sample from Palm Harbor, a Late Prehistoric coastal population identified as
possibly representing pre- contact Karankawan (Comuzzie et al. 1986), along with a sample from San Juan
Capistrano, a historic sample identified as being Coahuiltecan(Humphreys 1971). The Palm Harbor sample,
from Aransas county, Texas, was chosen because it is the best documented and analyzed sample from this

93

94 I BWE BAYOU

region. The San Juan Capistrano sample, from Bexar County, Texas, was utilired primarily as an outlying
group since it is historic in age and from an adjacent inland area
The comparisons were made using both the characteristics suggested by Wilkinson (1977) forthe identification of pre-contact Karank.awans as well as the analysis of discrete cranial characteristics as presented by
Finnegan and Marcsik (1979). It appears that the Blue Bayou sample is similar to the Palm Harbor material
with respect to architecture of the mandible and skull, and noticeably different than the individuals from San
Juan Capistrano. A comparison of discrete characteristics also suggests a similarity between the Blue Bayou
sample and the coastal material from Palm Harbor. However, the presence of enamel pearls, double rooted
mandibular premolars, small peg-shaped third molars, and impacted third molars, genetically controlled and
relatively rare dental characteristics, in the Blue Bayou sample suggests that this population might have been
fairly isolated with respect to gene flow (Turner 1967; Leslie 1977; El-Najjar 1978).
The stature and general physique of the sample was estimated in an effort to possibly detennine biological
affinity and the quality of health and subsistence in this population. Stature estimates were made following
Genoves (1967). It was decided to utilire the fonnulae of Genoves (1967) since the mean lengths of the
long bones for the population he used in deriving the fonnulae corresponded more closely to those from
Blue Bayou than did those of Trotter and Gleser (1952). However, before stature estimations could be
conducted it was first necessary to reconstruct the lengths of the long bones from Blue Bayou following
Steele (1970). This was required due to the fragmented condition of the elements recovered.
The mean stature for males at Blue Bayou was estimated to be 164.64 +/- 6.05 (cm) while that of the females
was 154.19 +/- 5.77 (an). While the Blue Bayou material is felt to possibly be related in someway to the
coastal populations of this time it shows a significant difference in tenns of stature. A statistical comparison
of the mean statures of males from Blue Bayou to those from Shell Point and Oso Creek (Wilkinson 1973)
suggests that the Blue Bayou population is significantly shorter.
The question of robusticity in this sample was also addressed. It has been suggested that the prehistoric
coastal populations from this region are characterired by a malked degree of robusticity. Even though the
stature for Blue Bayou appears somewhat shorter than those of the coastal samples, a statistical comparison
of other metrical criteria suggests that they are fairly similar in robusticity. A comparison of mean values
for males of the midshaft circumference of the femur between Blue Bayou and Palm Harbor (Comuzzie et
al. 1986) showed no statistical difference. This is significant since Palm Harbor has been described as a
relatively robust population and is fairly representative of the physical structure of the prehistoric coastal
populations from this area This interpretation of robusticity of the Blue Bayou sample is also suggested by
a visual assessment of these remains. The sample from Blue Bayou exhibits well defined browridges,
pronounced sites of muscle attachment, and a large well developed mandible, traits which are typical of
prehistoric Texas coastal populations.
Even though both sexes in this sample appear relatively robust, there seems to be a pronounced degree of
sexual dimorphism present 'Ibis conclusion is based on the statistical comparison of metrical parameters
as well as a visual assessment of the material. The males are taller in stature with larger and more well
developed long bones. While members of each sex exhibit the presence of browridges they appear much
more pronounced in the males.
The presence of a discemable degree of sexual dimorphism may serve to indicate the overall health and
quality of subsistence in this population. Several studies have shown that in living populations suffering
from chronic disease or nutritional stress that the degree of sexual dimorphism expressed is great! y reduced

SUMMARY OF BIOARCHEOLOGICALDATA / 95

non-existent (Stini 1969, 1972; Brauer 1982). Doran (1975) has suggested that the same may be true for
prehistoric samples as well. If this is indeed the case then the findings on the Blue Bayou sample would tend
to indicate that this population may have been fairly free of chronic disease and other metabolic stresses.
1his concept is further supported by the general lack of any osteological evidence for widespread disease or
nutritional deficiencies.
The analysis of the dental remains from this sample revealed a relatively low level of pathogenic activity.
Seven individuals examined exhibited evidence of periodontal infection. 1his is not surprising given the
amount of calculus observed on many of the dental elements. What is interesting, however, is the presence
of such large quantities of calculus given the high levels of attrition seen in this sample. It has been suggested
(St.Hoyme and Koritzer 1977) that high levels of attrition in prehistoric populations served to remove deposits
of calculus thereby greatly reducing the chance of periodontal infection.
Five individuals were also encountered with sites of carious activity. This is significant again because a high
rate of attrition generally helps to prevent the development of tooth decay. It is also significant because it
may suggest a slightly higher frequency of caries in this population than seen in those samples from the coast.
It has been suggested (Davies 1972) that inland populations tend to experience a higher rate of carious activity
than coastal groups even if they are of the same ethnic background. The Blue Bayou sample seems to support
Davies (1972) conclusion.
The teeth of this sample were also analyzed for evidence of metabolic stress in the form of enamel hypoplasia.
Several studies have shown the correlation of these enamel defects with periods of chronic disease or
nutritional stress during an individual's developmental years (El-Najjar et al. 1978; Rose et al. 1978). Of all
the teeth examined four exhibited signs of enamel hypoplasia. These were all characterized as single
relatively large defects suggesting at least one episode of marked metabolic stress during the developmental
years of the individual. It might be possible that the individuals which posses these enamel defects represent
the survivors of whatever forces which were responsible for the mortality rate seen in the early childhood
age category.
With the exception of attrition, traumatic damage to the dentition was very limited. While it has become
increasingly common to view attrition as a normal process it still represents a modification of a structure by
outside forces. Of the 25 individuals with associated teeth 16 of these were described as exhibiting evidence
of attrition, with 12 of these exhibiting severe attrition. Two individuals exhibited evidence of ante-mortem
damage to teeth. One case is relatively minor exhibited as a chipping of a molar while the other appears
much more severe. In the second case it appears that the breakage and loss of an incisor lead to a subsequent
infection which destroyed part of the bani palate.
In temts of dental anomalies there were several interesting variations exhibited in this sample. One individual
~ed

impacted third molars, two individuals possessed enamel pearls, one individual possessed double
rootailimandibular canines, and two others possessed thirdmofars which appeared small and atypically peg
shaped. M©f1bl!:E oonditions are described by Tay),©1r(t9:Z8) as;relatively rare. It is possible, based on the
presence of tfume:rrdmvely rare.c.haracteristics, that.Blue Bayou might represent a relatively isolated breeding
population (Tum.\tlr Il%3; LesUe 1917; Ell-Najjar 1978).

In general the analysis of tf.re' skeletal remains did not show any evidence of rampant disease, trauma, or

physical variations. Two individuals exhibited evidence of either osteomyelitis or periostitis. Both of these
conditions represent infection of the periosteum as a result of traumatic injury or disease (Ortner and Putschar
1981) and can not be distinguished from one another on the basis of osteological criteria. Their presence

96 I BLUE BAYOU

does suggest, however, that these two individuals might have suffered from a widespread infection, possibly
as a result of traumatic injury. Only one individual from this sample exhibited undeniable proof of traumatic
injury, probably as a result of intentional aggression. This individual was recovered with an arrow point in
contact with the vertebrae of the lower back which is felt to have been the cause of death. In teIIIls of physical
anomalies the post cranial remains appear normal. However, two of the individuals examined exhibited a
non-fusion of the metopic suture of the frontal bone. Since this condition is considered relatively rare
(Breathnach 1965; El-Najjar and McWilliams 1978), it too indicates that perhaps the breeding patterns of
this sample might have been relatively restrictive.
The analysis of the bioarcheology of the Blue Bayou sample provides an interesting picture of a prehistoric
hunter-gatherer society from the Texas Coastal Plain. While this sample appears slightly shorter in stature
than the previously described coastal samples from this area it still seems to be fairly robust. Furthermore,
despite the robust nature in general of these remains there is still a pronounced degree of sexual dimorphism
discemable. The presence of this sexual dimorphism along with the general lack of osteological evidence
of pathologies suggests that this population might have enjoyed relative freedom from disease and metabolic
stress. This is an important finding since it has been suggested that prehistoric populations exploiting these
environments most probably suffered from chronic disease and malnutrition (Newcomb 1962; Rathbun et
al. 1982).

CHAPTER VIII
THE ARTIFACTS

Artifacts recovered by excavation at the Blue Bayou site are divided into four categories for description:
chipped stone, antler, and shell. Each artifact is described individually according to the following criteria:
1) Artifact type - This will identify the artifact by recognized type or by descriptive terms based on
artifact morphology.
2) Field Catalogue Number (FCN) - This is the number assigned to each artifact recovered during
the excavation. These numbers were maintained during the analysis phase.
3) Figure - This is the number of the figure in which the illustration of the artifact appears.
4) Artifact provenience - This will give the excavation area, the unit designation, the burial that the
artifact is associated with (if any), and the actual elevation at which the artifact was found.
5) Form - This will give a description of the artifact, its color, and any other data pertinent to its
manufacture.
6) Dimensional data - All pertinent measurements for each artifact category are given in the metric
system, centimeters for dimension and grams for weight. An asterisk (*) notes an incomplete
measurement.
7) Comments - This includes additional information about the artifact or its type. References to
published sources and descriptions are also included.

Chipped Stone
Relatively few chipped stone artifacts were recovered. These consist of Scallorn arrow points, an Ensor dart
point, biface fragments, and several utilized flakes.
ENSOR DART POINT. FCN 22 (Figure 29a)

Provenience: Nl0/W4 under Burial 11, Elevation 16.21 m
Form: The blade is triangular with straight lateral edges. broad side notches have produced an expanding
stem, one shoulder is missing, and the other is strong and pronounced. The basal edge is slightly convex.
It was manufactured from a brown chert.

Stem Width: 2.1 cm
Weight: 4.6 gm

Length: 3.5 cm
Width: 2.2 cm
Thickness: 0.8 cm

Comments: Ensor points have been recovered from two other mortuary sites, the Ernest Witte site, 41AU36,
(Hall 1981:133) and the Brandes site, 41AU55, (Highley et al. 1988) in the upper Texas coastal plain.
Temporal placement for this projectile point type falls in the Late to Transitional Archaic ca. 2150 - 1350
B.P. (Turner and Hester 1985:94).
SCALLORN ARROW POINT. FCN 3 (Figure 29b)

Provenience: B-4, Elevation 14.83 m
Form: The blade is triangular with straight lateral edges and barbed shoulders. The expanding stem is formed
by corner notching. The base is well-thinned, slightly convex, and slightly narrower than the shoulders; it

97

98 I BLUE BAYOU

is biconvex in cross-section. The distal tip and one basal ear are missing, both appear to be impact fractures.
Flecks of asphaltum are present on the stem. The point was manufactured from a tan chert.
Length: 1.9 cm*
Width: 1.6 cm
Thickness: 0.4 cm

Stem Length: 0.5 cm
Stem Width: 1.0 an*
Weight: 1.0 gm

Comments: This projectile point was found resting against the dorsal aspect of this individual's right foot.
Due to the deterioration of the phalanges and metatarsals, it is impossible to detennine if this point caused
a wound, but the impact fractures and asphaltum used as mastic for hafting the point argues for this possibility.
Scallorn arrow points have been identified as the cause of the death from two sites, Loeve-Fox, 41 WM230
(Prewitt 1974:36), and the Berryman site, 41NU173 (Mokry 1979). This point type is found over a large
geographic region and is dated to the period 1250- 750 B.P. (Turner and Hester 1985:189).
SCALLORN ARROW POINT. FCN 4 (Figure 29c)

Provenience: Area H, S9/W3, Burial 4, Elevation 14.78 m
Form: The blade is triangular with straight, serrated lateral edges, the shoulders are strong, and barbs are
absent. The base is well-thinned, slightly convex, and narrower than the shoulders; the cross-section is
biconvex. One of the basal ears is missing, and the distal tip is 7° off the midline of the point; flecks of
asphaltum are present on the base. It was manufactured from a medium grained quartzite that is tan with
yellow inclusions.
Length: 3.1 cm
Width: 1.8 cm
Thickness: 0.3 cm

Stem Length: 0.7 cm

Again, evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not it caused a wound.
SCALLORN ARROW POINT. FCN S (Figure 29d)

Provenience: Area H, S9/W3, Burial 3, Elevation 14.80 m
Fonn: This well made point has a long triangular blade with straight lateral edges and slightly barbed
shoulders. The expanding stem is fonned by comer notching. The base is well thinned, slightly convex,
and narrower than the shoulders. The cross-section is biconvex and flecks of asphaltum are present on the
stem. It was manufactured from a fine grained, light brown, translucent chert.
Length: 3.1 cm
Width: 1.6 cm
Thickness: 0.3 cm

Stem Length: 0.55 cm
Stem Width: 1.5 an
Weight: 1.1 gm

Comments: This specimen was found resting between the ribs of a badly deteriorated burial.
SCALLORN ARROW POINT. FCN 34 (Figure 29e)

Provenience: Area D, N5/W8, Burial 16, Elevation 15.84 m
Fonn: This large well made arrow point has a triangular blade with slightly convex lateral edges and barbed
shoulders. The base is thinned and appears concave. One barb is missing, as is the basal ear on the opposite
side. The distal tip has been removed by an impact fracture. In cross-section, the point is biconvex and a

THE ARTIFACTS/ 99

trace of asphaltum is present on the stem. It was fabricated from a fine grained dark brown chert devoid of
any inclusions.
Length: 5.6 cm*
Width: 2.1 cm
Thickness 0.5 cm

Stem Length: 0.8 cm
Stem width: 0.9 cm*
Weight: 5.75 gm

Comments: This large point was in contact with the thoracic vertebrae of Burial 16. Its position was roughly
parallel to the axis of the spine, but no penetration of the bone was noted.
SCALLORN ARROW POINT. FCN 31(Figure29f)

Provenience: Test Pit 24, S7.5/W7.5, No elevation given
Fonn: The blade is triangular with slightly convex lateral edges and small barbs. The expanding stem is
fonned by comer notching. The base is straight, well thinned, and slightly narrower than the shoulders. The
distal tip is missing from an impact fracture. The point is biconvex in cross-section, and asphaltum is present
on the stem. The distal tip is 5° off the midline. The point was manufactured from a light brown, translucent
chert.
Length: 2.7 cm
Width: 1.5 cm
Thickness: 0.4 cm

Stem Length: 0.7 cm
Stem Width: 1.45 cm
Weight: 1.4 gm

Comments: No vertical provenience was recorded for this artifact, but it may have been associated with the
burial (articulated ribs, phalanges, and long bones) found at 14.71 m. This possible association is based on
the fact that it was one of the last artifacts recorded just prior to encountering the burial in Test Pit 24.
ARROW POINT MEDIAL FRAGMENT. FCN 2 (Figure 29g).

Provenience: Area H, S9/W3, Burial 3, Elevation 14.79 m.

Width: 1.4 cm
Thickness: 0.3 cm

Stem Length: N/A
Stem Width: N/A
Weight: 0.7 gm

Comments: This fragment was found just anterior to the vertebral column between the first and second
thoracic vertebrae.
PROXIMAL BIFACE FRAGMENT. FCN 39 (Figure 30a)

Provenience: Area D, N5/W8, Elevation 15.27 m
From: This specimen has slightly contracting lateral edges and a straight well thinned base. All edges show
some battering, and the entire artifact, including the snap fracture, has a high sheen and waxy feel, indicative
of heat treatment.

straight, curving slightly at the distal end. The exterior or cortical side shows no markings or wear except
for a single V shaped groove that runs from lateral edge to lateral edge near the proximal end. The interior side of the bone has been modified by abrasion. The marrow cavity has been expanded so that the
channel grows wider toward the proximal end, flaring to the lateral edges in the last centimeter. The
proximal end is beveled, and small striations less than a centimeter in length are present along the long
axis of the bone. The distal end of the tool is rounded and poorly preserved with the cancellous tissue visible on both sides. The interior groove terminates 2.8 cm from the distal tip. Both sides and edges of the
artifact are smooth.

Comments: A number of functions have been hypothesized for this type of blunt tipped bone implement
based on context. Those found in close proximity to the skull of an individual have been identified as
hair pins at several mortuary localities including: Unland (Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979), 41WY50 (Day,
Laurens-Day, and Prewitt 1981), Brandes (Highley et al. 1988), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988).
When in post cranial associations they have been identified as awls (Duke 1970) or have been given no
stipulated function (Hall 1981). In a recent review article, Hall (1988) has assembled both archeological
and ethnographic data pertaining to the function of these implements. These include: basketry tools,
scratchers, ornaments, louse crushers and sweat scrapers. Based on contextual data from Texas mortuary
sites, Hall (1988: 172) concludes that these implements may have been multifunctional as hair pins/head
scratchers/louse crushers.
The location of the Blue Bayou example, along the right humerus, does not completely rule out the idea
of a hair pin. If Burial 24' s hair was long, it and the bone implement may have fallen over the arm during
interment. This scenario might also explain the displacement of the shell ear drop (FCN 40) away from
the individuals head (Figure 10). Another, more plausible situation is that the bone implement was held
in a hide or fiber band on the upper arm. In this position, with the proximal end toward the shoulder, it
would be easily available to crush lice, scratch, scrape sweat or carry out whatever function the implement performed.

THE ARTIFACTS/ 107

In her discussion of the occurrence of antler racks with burials, Highley (in press) noted that most racks were
complete and retained a portion of the skull. At Blue Bayou, the antlers included a section of skull, but only
the main beams were recovered, all of the tines had been removed prior to inclusion with Burial 24. Due to
the deteriorated condition of the antlers, the racks were treated in situ with the same Elmer's glue solution
used for the burials. This and the inclusion of some soil matrix on the antler made it possib1e to detennine
the exact method used to remove the tines. However, the surfaces are relatively flat, and it is apparent that
this is not a case of differential preservation, the tines were intentionally removed.

The removal of the antler tines presents an interesting question: Is it possible that the tines were too valuable
a commodity to be sacrificed at the time of intennent for Burial 24 (L. C. Bement personal communication,
1987). Antler tines have often been associated with the flintknapping technique of pressure flaking, and the
main beams associated with the percussion technique (cf. Hester 1980a:120). In this case, the main beam
may have been too small in diameter for a bil1et, and thus less valuable.
Additionally, all three antlers recovered from Burial 24 were from different animals. This conclusion was
based on the basal diameter and fonn of each specimen.

Modified Shell
Artifacts of both freshwater and marine shell were recovered from the site. These include mussel shell
pendants and numerous whole marine shell and fragments.
MUSSEL SHELL PENDANT. FCN 40 (Figure 33d)

Fonn: This triangular concave/convex shell artifact was manufactured from a freshwater mussel shell. It
has a small perforation near the apex, 0.2 cm in diameter, for suspension. All work done to fabricate this
artifact was done from the interior of the shell. Along its three edges, the interior surface exhibits a
bevel, whereas the exterior edge is square. The suspension hole is conical in cross-section; the walls of
the hole slope inward toward the exterior of the shell.
Length: 4.4 cm
Thickness: 0.1 cm

Width at base: 2.9 cm
Weight: 1.8 gm

Comments: This artifact was found with the exterior of the shell facing up, approximately 30 cm north of
the Burial 24 skull. At the time of burial, this artifact was probably next to the skull, and the aforementioned rodent disturbance was responsible for its movement
MUSSEL SHELL PENDANT. FCN 41(Figure33e)

Provenience: Area E, S2/W7, Burial 24, Elevation 14.67 m
Fonn: This artifact is similar in shape and manufacture technique to artifact 40, with few exceptions.
This pendant has two perforations at the apex, the superior hole either broke or wore through, leading to
the drilling of the second, 0.4 cm below the first. This second hole displays evidence of expediency in its
production. Around this second perforation, there is a concentric ring of damage that is not evident
around the other perforation nor the perforation in item 40. It appears that the tool used to cut this hole
was contracting edges whereas the original perforation was accomplished with a more parallel sided tool.
Length: 4.0 cm
Thickness: 0.2 cm

Width at base: 2.8 cm
Weight: 2. 7 gm

Comments: this artifact was found with the exterior side in contact with the left side of the skull of Burial
24.
MUSSEL SHELL FRAGMENT. FCN 43

Provenience: Area E, S2/W7, Burial 24, Elevation 14.63 m
Form: This small subtriangular fragment is a spall from the exterior surface of item 40. It fits in the left
basal corner of that artifact.
Length: 1.5 cm
Thickness: 0.06 cm

Width: 1.5 cm
Weight: 0.1 gm

Comments: This fragment was found less than five centimeters north of the right side of the Burial 24
skull. It was probably closer to the original position of item 40 at the time of the interment of Burial 24.
Based on the provenience of these artifacts in relation to Burial 24, it appears that they were some form of
adornment, most likely ear drops. They were probably suspended from a perforation in some portion of the
exterior ear by a thin cord or leather thong. Pendants of similar size, shape, and material were reported from
Callo del Oso (41NV2) by Jackson (1933:8,9). Eight of these pendants were found under the skull of the
articulated burial within the limits of Burial M-1, which included the disarticulated remains of several other
individuals.
The articulated burial was a female interred in a semi-flexed position on her right side with both hands to
her face. Tue pendants from Burial M-1 ranged in length from 3.4-4.6 cm. Tuey also had small notches
cut on the interior side: Tue notches varied in number from 40 - 90 (Jackson 1933). Tue notching of the
pendant edges is absent on the Blue Bayou specimens as is any other form of edge treatment. Otherwise,
the artifacts from both sites are nearly identical.
MARINE SHELL CACHE

Provenience: Area C, N6/W7, Elevation 16.09 m
Form: This cache is comprised of six complete, giant Atlantic cockles (Dinocardium robustum) stacked
together with the exterior side of the shell up. No other cultural materials were included with these shells.
Comments: This cache does not appear to be associated with a burial, but the excavations were closed down
after only a single 15 cm level was dug in Area C. Based on the elevations recorded for the burials in Areas
B and D, and calculating the slope of the terrace, if a burial is associated with this cache, it would have been
encountered in the next two excavation levels.
A similar cache of these shells in the same position was discovered at 41 VT80, although no burial has been
found in association with it (W. W. Birmingham personal communication, 1987). Outside the region, a
cache of eight large bivalves inside a poorly fired pottery vessel was reported by Bowen (1976:43) from the
central coast of Sonora, Mexico. The shells (Laevicardium elatum) were thought to be part of a kitchen
cache and were not associated with a burial in this case (Bowen 1976).
MARINE SHELL CACHE. FCN 89-14 (Figure 13 and 14)

Provenience: Area E, S3/W8 - S3/W7, Burial 21, Base elevation 15.04 m
Form: This loose group consists of three complete and three large fragments of D. robustum above and
slightly west of Burial 21. Three are exterior up (S9, 11, and 13), and three are interior up (SlO, 12, and 14).

110 I BLUE BAYOU

Comments: these shells were approximately 16 an above the skull of Burial 21. Because no outline of the
grave pit was identified, it is difficult to detennine if they were included in the grave fill or placed on top.
If they were placed on top, the depth of the grave would have been fairly shallow, around 30 cm.

Dinocardium robustum is one of the more common marine shells found in inland sites in the Coastal Plain
and south Texas regions (Hester 197la, 1971b). It is the largest cockle found on the Texas coast, ranging
the coastline from Virginia to Campeche, Mexico (Andrews 1981). Its habitat is open bay margins and inlet
influenced areas that generally have high saline content (Parker 1959:2162).
Fragments and whole shells of the giant Atlantic cockle (Dinocardium robustum) were found throughout
the excavations in the southern half of the site (south of NO/EO). They occurred in every test pit and
excavation area except Test Pits 13, 14, 21, 26, and 28, plus, plus the machine damaged Areas F and G. All
specimens of this taxa recovered do not appear to be modified by any means such as drilling, cutting, or
grinding. The presence of these shells in great numbers at the inland site gives rise to three hypotheses for
their function.
First, Hester and Corbin (1975:522) postulated that two stacks of bivalve shells found with separate burials
at 41SP78 may have been used as "scoops in digging graves in the soft sand." This idea reinforced by the
heavy wear on the edges of the shells.
Because Blue Bayou is also located in a terrace with sandy soils, the author undertook the experiment
suggested by Hester and Corbin (1975). Using D. robustum shells gathered from the coast by E. Vogt of
Victoria, Texas, the author dug several small holes in the sandy loam soils belonging to the Eufaula soil
association in south Bexar County.
Prior to excavation, both artifacts from 41VT94 and the collected shells were examined with the unaided
eye and by lOx and 30x microscopy. Both sets showed edge wear in the fonn of smoothing and rounding.
Under the higher power examination, small striations were obseived on both interior and exterior surfaces
of the shells.
After 15 minutes of digging with each of the three shells in the experimental set, the same examinations
were conducted. Two of the shells broke during excavation, but use was continued with the remaining
portions.
The findings of these examinations and comparison with the artifact set were inconclusive. Both sets were
nearly identical in wear pattern before and after excavation. It appears that the beach tumbling experienced
by the experimental set was largely responsible for the edge damage, and the excavation experiment showed
wear indistinguishable from natural processes. While it is still possible that these shells, which fit well in
the hand, may have assisted in the excavation of the grave pits at both sites, the results of this limited
experiment do not and cannot provide conclusive proof.
At Blue Bayou the shell cache in Area E was at an elevation above the burials. This leads to the hypothesis
that the large marine shells were used as a fonn of grave marker. This cache appears to be associated with
Burial 21 which is the next to last burial in the site based on the fluoride dating technique (see dating section).
The last burial, Burial 19, is slightly west of Burial 21 and may have been interred only a short span of time
afterwards. It may have been placed in its location due to the shell marker over Burial 21.
The large amount of shell and fragments of shell argues for both this and the first hypothesis. Natural
processes may have displaced other markers over time. The small number of intrusive burials in Area E and

THE ARTIFACTS / 111

the time span between those that are intrusive adds credence to the idea that these shells may have been a
semi-pennanent grave mruker.
A third hypothesis for these marine shells is that they held some fonn of perishable offering to the deceased
(K. Brown personal communication, 1987). The large cup fonned by the inverted shell would have made
an excellent receptacle for liquids and dry materials such as seeds or nuts.
The major drawback with this proposal is that only a single complete shell was found with the interior side
up. While post-burial disturbances by animals or natural processes may be responsible for the position of
the shells at the time of excavation, present data does not support this hypothesis.

CHAPTER IX
DATING METHODS

Three techniques of dating have been applied to the Blue Bayou site. These include the relative method of
cross-dating with the diagnostic lithic artifacts and the absolute process of radiocarbon dating. The third
method, which is also of a relative nature, measures the absorption of fluoride in the bone of individual
burials, thus allowing for the establishment of an intrasite burial chronology. In this section, the results and
a brief description of each method will be reported, followed by a discussion of their implications on the
chronology of the site and the Coastal Plain.
Cr~-Dating

Cross-dating as a method of relative dating is based largely on the geological principle of superposition.
Within this context an artifact or groups of artifacts found at a stratigraphically lower level of excavation
will be older than those of different types found above. Thus the stratigraphic sequence from a series of
sites allows for the establishment of a cultural chronology within a given archeological region. Cross-dating
can also be used with ecological data such as from geomorphology, paleontology, and palynology for
explaining cultural change and behavior (Michels 1973:84). Although these methods have proven useful in
many areas in both the new and old worlds, the primary usage of cross-dating in this paper will be on lithic
artifacts.
Cross-dating as a method of age determination is difficult to use in the Central Coastal Plain since few
excavations have been conducted in sites with well defined stratigraphy. Secondary to the lack of data, the
stratigraphy of the Blue Bayou site is poorly known, so the cross-dating used here is limited to temporally
diagnostic artifacts.
The Berger Bluff site (Brown 1983) presents itself as the best stratigraphic sequence with which to cross-date
the material culture of Blue Bayou on an intraregional basis. Both diagnostic projectile point types recovered
during excavation at Blue Bayou were also recovered in stratigraphic context at Berger Bluff. Brown's
(1983:74-89) interpretations of the Berger Bluff sequence places Scallorn arrow points in the "Austin phase"
context and Ensor dart points in the "Late Archaic II" inteival, or the younger of the of the two Late Archaic
occupations at the site. It is notable that chronology and component names used in identifying the
occupations are those of the Central Texas region. Indeed, it was noted that the cultural materials associated
with Scallorn arrow points "seem to reflect a classic central Texas Austin phase occupation" (Brown
1983:80).
Scallorn arrow points have been found associated with human burials at several other sites in this and adjacent
regions. These sites, listed along with several others, have mortuary practices that could be used in
cross-dating. These will be discussed in detail in the following section because many of the traits go beyond
the needs of dating, and the chronological placement of Blue Bayou does not rely solely cross-dating.

DATING METHODS/ 113

The first chronological framework postulated for this region was based on that of Central Texas (Fox and
Hester 1976:5) and with its refinement over recent years (cf. Prewitt 1983) it appears to offer the best scheme
at present for cross-dating sites in the Coastal Plain.
Radiocarbon As.says

The radiocarbon method is by far the most common method of absolute dating used in North American
archeology today. Its popularity is predicated on the wide range of sample materials that are available from
prehistoric contexts, the number oflaboratories that provide the service, and the experimental improvement
that have refined both the method and calibration with dendrochronology. Radiocarbon samples do not
require any special field collection strategies such as planting dosimeters for thennolumanence or plaster
jacketing of archeomagnetic samples, thus samples can be selected from field collections during analysis to
answer particular questions that may arise.
The method is based on the principle that there is a continuous, constant source of the radioactive 14C isotope
which is in equilibrium with all living things. As 14c decays it emits a beta particle, the half-life is measured
by counting the number of beta emissions per minute per gram of sample.
The official or "Libby" half-life is 5568 years and is the basis for standard reporting. It is now known that
the half-life of 14c is 5730 +/-40 years (Godwin 1962, Olsson 1968). The Libby half-life is still used today
to avoid confusion and maintain a standard of convention. To convert reported dates to the more accurate
5730 year half-life, multiply the date by 1.029.
A suite of four radiocarbon assays from the Blue Bayou site were analyzed at the Radiocarbon Laboratory,
The University of Texas at Austin. Three of these were done on human bone and the fourth on wood charcoal
associated with a burial. The results of these and a fifth assay from the Frisch Auf! site (Huebner and Powell
1989) are shown in Figure 34 and Table 38.
The decision to use human bone for radiocarbon age detenninations was necessitated by the poor quality of
recovered charcoal. While small flecks of charcoal were noted throughout the soil matrix, only four carbon
samples were collected: two of burned bone, one of charred seeds, and a small lump of wood charcoal. After
careful scrutiny of the sample's provenience, associations, and quality, only the wood charcoal sample was
deemed suitable for dating. This sample was very small, weighing only 1.63 gm after hand cleaning to
remove rootlets and soil matrix. This small weight, despite extra counting time, is the reason for the large
standard deviation in TX-5865 (S. Valastro, Jr. personal communication, 1987).
The three burials chosen for radiocarbon analysis were Burials 16, 20, and 24. Long bones from the legs of
these burials were submitted after the field physical anthropologist had examined and recorded their
osteological data. None of these bones were treated with any fonn of preservative, and all were wrapped in
aluminum foil immediately after exhumation.
The choice of which burials to date was made by the avocational group of excavators. Their parameters of
selection were based on artifact associations and quality of bone preservation. Burial 16 was chosen because
of the two arrow points associated with it, Burial 24, because of the shell, bone, and antler artifacts, and
Burial 20 was selected because it was the deepest burial and thought to be the oldest
Radiocarbon analysis was perfonned on the inorganic fraction of the human bone. The use of this fraction
in radiocarbon dating is a subject of controversy in the literature (cf. Taylor 1991). The major problem with

apatite is its propensity to exchange with groundwater carbonates in the environment (Berger et al. 1964).
However, if the samples are properly pre-treated all extraneous carbonates can be removed while leaving
behind the original apatite. The organic fraction or collagen would have been the preferred sample material.
Unfortunately, in the case of the Blue Bayou skeletal remains this fraction, which makes up approximately
25% of dry bone weight, was deteriorated to the point that it was insufficient for radiocarbon analysis.
Based on the material culture found with the burials at the site, the calibrated radiocarbon assays were
expected to fall between AD. 700 - 1300. Unfortunately, the midpoints of the raw radiocarbon ages ran
between 1590 -1120 B.P. (1636 - 1152 B.P. for 5730 y.h.l.), which is somewhat older than expected. The
charcoal date from Burial 1 (TX-5865) and bone date from Burial 24 both lie within the expected range,
albeit very close to the early end. The remaining two dates, TX-4972 and TX-4894, both fall short of the
expected range. Although the latter does cross the 1250 B.P. threshold in its two sigma range, owing to its
large error factor.
When the Stuiver and Becker (1986) calibration is applied, the situation is improved as all of the dates become
younger (Table 39). However TX-4972 still does not cross the 1250 B.P. line, even at its two sigma range,
assuring a 95% probability that the correct date is within that range. The date of TX-4972 is even more
provocative given the presence of the two arrow points, a large Scallorn and a smaller medial fragment, that
may have caused the death of the individual in Burial 16.

As stated previously, the inorganic fraction of bone can exchange isotopic carbon from the environment, but
this exchange is almost always younger carbon causing dates that err on the younger side. Thus if this date
is correct, Burial 16 may provide one of the earliest occurrences of arrow points in Texas. Further
ramifications of the radiocarbon dates will be discussed after a review of the third dating method, fluoride
analysis.

Fluoride Dating
Fluoride dating is used to establish an intrasite burial sequence. By measuring the amount of fluoride
absorbed by human bones, the age of a burial can be detennined relative to others in the site. The absorption
rate of :fluoride is different from site to site. The environmental factors of the site matrix, such as ground
water and soil type, effect the bone differently and consequently, this method can only be used within a
sing1e site. It is also necessary to use the same material, either cortex or cancellous, due to the uneven
distribution of fluoride in these tissues (Marchbanks 1987).
These tests were conducted on samples from 24 of the 30 burials in the site. The remaining six did not have
sufficient non-diagnostic bone that could be sacrificed The results of the analysis is shown in Table 40, and
the resulting chronology is illustrated in Table 41.
The results concur with the limited stratigraphic analysis that could be conducted within the individual
excavation areas. One of the most puzzling stratigraphic relationships, that of Burial 5 and Burial 18, was
solved. It is also possible to see temporal as well as spatial groupings of burials and to identify the pattern
of usage at the site over time.
The sharp rise in fluorine content seen in the burials in Excavation Areas A, B, F, and G suggests that these
burials are of much greater antiquity than those in Areas D, E, and H. Since there is no other data on the
rates of fluoride uptake in bone to compare with the Blue Bayou data we don't know if it increases
arithmetically or exponentially, or even if this is constant one way or the other from site to site. Assuming
that it increases arithmetically it is possible to figure the temporal range of the cemetery using the two
acceptable radiocarbon dates. There is difference of 46 ppm of fluoride and 120 radiocarbon years between
Burials 24 and 1. Given the contemporanity of Burials 24, 7, 2, and 4, and Burials 22 and 1, the fact that
the two sets are in sequence, and that the radiocarbon assay for Burial 1 has a large standard deviation, 50
ppm will be considered equal to 100 years for the purpose of this analysis. Further all fluoride dates are
assumed to have a standard deviation of+/- 100 years to compensate for those of the radiocarbon assays.

Using this equation, Burial 19, the latest intennent, yields an age of 694 B.P. and Burial 10, the oldest
intennent, is assigned an age of 6130 BP. The tenninal date of roughly 700 B.P. for the cemetery is in
agreement with the end of the Austin Phase and the beginning of the Toyah Horizon in South Texas (Black
1986) and the Coastal Plain (Ricklis 1989). On the other hand, the age assigned to the first intennent, Burial
10, seems absurdly old.

If Blue Bayou started as a cemetery in the Early Archaic it would be the earliest known mortuary site in
Texas. This great antiquity is considered highly unlikely. While a crude, battered thick biface (FCN37)
bearing resemblance to Group 4 Distally Beveled Tools from Choke Canyon (Hall et al. 1982), which date
as far back as the Early Archaic, was found in Area D it was 56 cm below the lowest burial in that area, and
in no way associated with the cemetery. The next oldest diagnostic artifact is an Ensor dart point found 14
cm below, and not associated with Burial 11 in Area B. This projectile point type dates as early as 2150
B.P. (Turner and Hester 1985). Since the earliest burials in the site are also in Area B, this date may be
slightly older than the first intennent at Blue Bayou. Given these contingencies, the period of use for the
Blue Bayou site as a mortuary locality is 700 - 2000 +/- 100 B.P. An explanation for the roughly 4000 year
discrepancy will require further research in fluoride dating. Hypothetically, the burials in Area A and B with
abnonnally high fluoride content may have been subject to increased high fluoride content ground water
flow that occurred prior to the later intennents. The different types of soil found on the site could also be a

contributing factor. Unfortunately, we do not have a detailed map of the soil associations on the site to
detetmine if this is causal factor. A radiocarbon date on one of the older, high fluoride content burials might
make it possible to calculate more accurately the age of the burials in Area A & B. Again, unfortunately,
the quality of bone preservation precludes an assay of these burials which would be the only potential
radiocarbon samples from Blue Bayou.
The resulting chronology and fluoride dates for all burials is shown in Figure 35. One of the most interesting
features of this chronology is the fluoride date for Burial 16. The fluoride date is ca. 180 years younger than
the radiocarbon assay and the 1310 +/- 100 B.P. date reconciles much better with the Scallorn arrow point
found with this burial, although it is still better than half a century too young. The fluoride chronology
indicates that the break between the Late Prehistoric and the Late Archaic intetments at Blue Bayou falls
between Burials 16 and 5 based on the Central Texas chronological framework.
Two other cemetery sites that have Scallorn arrow points in association with human burials date later than
Blue Bayou. Frisch Aufl in Fayette County has a radiocarbon age of 1070+/-90 B.P. (TX-5986) run on bone
apatite (Table 38). At the Loeve-Fox site, along the San Gabriel River in Williamson County, three assays
were run on charcoal fotm the mortuary portion of the site (Prewitt 1974a, 1982). These dates 940 +/- 60
B.P. (TX-1923), 870 +/- 60 B.P. (TX-1925) and 1250 +/- 60 (TX-3402) span much of the Central Texas
Austin Phase (Prewitt 1983). Further up the Coastal Plain in Austin County, a radiocarbon date of 1070 +/60 B.P. (TX-2125) was obtained from charcoal in association with a Scallorn arrow point bearing strata at
the Leonard K site (Hall 1981:Table 3). While there are no human burials associated with this date, it
indicates agreement with the bone date from the Frisch Aufl site which is ca. 75 km northwest of Leonard
K.

DATING MEIHODS / 119

Two of the Blue Bayou dates, TX-4895 and TX-5865 (Table 38), fall within the range of those presented
above, albeit toward the early portion of the time span. The two remaining assays are far too old for the
material culture at Blue Bayou, or do not fit well with the interment sequence established via fluoride dating.
The 1490 +/- 90 B.P. (TX-4972) assay from Burial 16 is problematic due to the associated Scallorn arrow
point. This Scallorn point is rather large in size and would be questionable in terms of typology if not for
the smaller arrow point fragment also associated with the burial. Since this smaller fragment is unquestionably a portion of an arrow point, and these do not appear before 1250 B.P. in Central and South Texas (cf.
Prewitt 1983; Black 1986:251-253) it would appear that there are problems with the radiocarbon assay.
Given the known exchange problems with the apatite fraction of bone and our limited knowledge of the
depositional environment at the site, post mortem contamination of the sample is suspected.

Discussion of Dating Methods
The three methods used to date the site served as cross-checks for each other. While the application of each
individual method produced useful data, the cross-check showed that not all methods agree. The problems
are small compared to the inteipretative data gained, but they still warrant brief discussion.
The overall earliness of the radiocarbon dates in comparison to the Central Texas chronology showed an
14
incongruity between C and cross-dating. This is a problem that requires further study. The lack of sites
in the region with which to cross-date and the paucity of applicable radiocarbon assays necessitates the use
of an established adjacent region's chronology that may not be completely applicable.
There is little doubt that there are major similarities between occupation sites in the Central Coastal Plain
and the Central Texas regions during the Late Prehistoric period. But local influences such as the Archaic
Morlrlss complex and its associated mortuary component may have had an effect on the cultural patterns
expressed at Blue Bayou. There appears to be a change in burial patterns over time based on the results of
fluoride analysis. Just when, why, and how these changes take place is largely unknown.
The otherlroblem is between the radiocarbon date TX-4894 and fluoride analysis associated with Burial
20. The 1 C date is the oldest from the site, but the fluoride placed the burial as the fourth youngest in the
site. The pattern of burials by area established by fluoride argues strongly for Burial 20 to be late in the
sequence. When this radiocarbon date is removed from the analysis, the other dates agree with the fluoride
sequence.
The techniques of fluoride dating are in their infancy in this region, and thus have not been placed under the
scrutiny that has been afforded radiocarbon dating. With this in mind, a second set of fluoride tests were
conducted on Burial 20; the results replicated the original tests (M. Marchbanks personal communication,
14
1988). The expense and amount of bone necessary for a C date precluded a second assay; however with
the known problems of apatite dating and the large sigma of TX-4894, it is possible that the sample was
environmentally altered or inadequate in some other form that skewed the results.
The most fascinating piece of inteipretative data to come from the dating methods was the identification of
an Archaic mortuary component. The pattern established from the amounts of fluoride in the bone shows
the burials in Areas A and B to be of a much greater antiquity than those further south in the site. Several
other burials in the site may also be of Archaic age, but it is difficult to accurately draw a line between the
Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods at the site.

DATING METHODS/ 121

It has been proposed that a mathematical curve could be calculated against the three sequenced radiocarbon
dates if another date could be run on one of the earlier burials. This possibility was stalled by the high
deterioration of the human bone in these burials which would have been used to provide the radiocarbon
sample. Based on the available data and for the purpose of this inteipretation, the break between the Archaic
and the Late Prehistoric inte11Dents lies between Rank 13 and 14, Burials 16 and 5 (Table 41).

CHAPTERX
SUMMARY AND INTERPRETATION
OF THE MORTUARY DATA

The Blue Bayou site (41VT94) is a large prehistoric mortuary site near the confluence of Blue Bayou and
the Guadalupe River in south central Victoria County, Texas. A total of 30 human burial features and six
badly mixed human bone masses were excavated over the course of two field seasons. Forty-six individuals
were represented in these 35 features, and seven other unexcavated individuals were identified in the test pit
operation, for a total known site population of 53 individuals, of both sexes and all ages. Blue Bayou is, at
present, one of the larger hunter-gatherer cemeteries in the Central Coastal Plain.
The site is located on the south end of a north-south tending terrace, mapped as a sandy remnant of the
Pleistocene/Holocene age Deweyville Fonnation (Barnes 1975). On the east bank of the Guadalupe River,
this feature extends westward into the Guadalupe River floodplain. Given the tools available to the aboriginal
people who used this site, the selection of a locale with a sandy substrate for a cemetery is significant. The
excavation of a grave in the floodplain orupland clayey sediments, using only shell scoops, bone, and digging
sticks, would be a difficult task.
The develOJlllent of a mortuary site in this location indicates the periodic return of people to the general
vicinity over a long time frame. This may have been linked to the harvest of consistently available seasonal
resources. The diversity of resource zones and microenvironments present in the Lower Guadalupe Valley
would have pennitted extended occupations in the area resulting in the steady enlargement of the mortuary
population over time. The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human dietary patterns at Blue
Bayou indicate that these people had a terrestrially based diet with a heavy reliance on C3 pathway foods,
which constitute the bulk of available economic species in the Coastal Plain. The proximity of Blue Bayou
to the coast (28 km to the head of Guadalupe Bay, 50 km to the strand line) and the absence of a marine
dietary component implies a cultural or territorial boundary down river that separated the people of Blue
Bayou from coastal subsistence products, but not from other marine items such as shell and asphaltum.
Based on the evidence from the excavations, Blue Bayou functioned solely as a mortuary site until very late
in prehistory. No evidence of hearth features, trash pits or refuse middens was discovered during the
excavation that would indicate habitation of the site during the time it served as a cemetery. Artifacts
recovered from the road construction spoil which was stratigraphically superior to the mortuary component
of the site include; Perdiz arrow points, end scrapers and ceramics (not reported here), which are associated
with the Toyah Horizon that post-dates the use of Scallorn arrow points which were found with several of
the human burials at the site.
The mortuary component at Blue Bayou is dated ca 2000-700 B.P. This age detennination is a product of
three different methods: artifact cross-dating, radiocarbon, and fluoride. It is truly unfortunate that each
method was generally inconclusive by itself, but the datable materials at the site were limited to the small
number of diagnostic lithic artifacts and the human skeletal remains, except for the charcoal found under the
skull of Burial l. In concert, these methods support each other to indicate the practice of the mortuary ritual
at the site for over 1000 years. The three critically accepted radiocarbon assays (TX-4895, TX-4972,
TX-5865) anchor calendrical dates provided by the fluoride assay. The stratigraphic position of Burial 11
in relation to the Ensor dart point (FNC 22), provides an founding date ofless than 2200 B.P. (cf. Turner
and Hester 1985) for the initial burial at the site, and the Toyah Horizon occupation debris collected from

122

/NTERPREI'ATION OF MORTUARY DATA/ 123

the disturbed surface postdates the end of the site's use as a cemetery ca. 750-700 B.P. A stratigraphic break,
such as that documented at the Ernest Witte site (Hall 1981:44-48) in Austin County, between the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric burials, is not evident at Blue Bayou.
Because the road construction removed much of the upper deposits from the site and changed the slope of
the terrace, it was impossible to use burial depth and actual elevations to obtain any sense of patterning to
the sequence of interments. However, the fluoride analysis of human remains from 24 of the 35 burial
features provided an intrasite chronology that allows for the temporal and spatial pattern of human burials
to be established independently of traditional methods. Areas A and B in the northern portion of the site
were the first to be used, followed by Areas F and G in the most southern part of the site. These four
excavation areas represent the bulk of the Late Archaic burials at the site. The burials in Area H, also in the
southern end of the site, overlap the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric Periods. Area E, near the center of
the site, which was the last used and has a slight temporal overlap with Area H and dates completely to the
Late Prehistoric as do both the burials in Area D.
The individuals interred at the site were found primarily in flexed of semi-flexed positions (Table 2) Due
to modem disturbance from the oonstruction activities, prehistoric reuse of the site, variable bone preservation and the actions of burrowing animals, in only 18 of the 30 discrete burial features could body position
be definitively identified. Of these 18, 14 (78%) were primary interments in flexed or semi-flexed positions.
Four individuals (22%) were secondary "bundle" burials. These four burials were all associated with the
Late Archaic areas of the site.
The majority of primary interments at the site that oould be reoognized were deposited on their left side
(Table 2). These constituted 61 % of the primary interments (n=l 1), with three (17%) on their right side,
and four (22%) in a supine position.
The headward orientation of the primary interments at Blue Bayou was in a generally southern direction.
Ten of these were oriented to the southeast (56% ), four were due south (22%) and three were to the southwest
(17% ). A single individual was oriented to the east. The four seoondary interments show little in the way
of a pattern. Of the three with the crania included, two had long bones oriented southeast-northwest, and
the other's long bones were oriented east-west. In all three cases the skull was located at the southern end
of the long bone pile. The remaining seoondary burial was oriented north-south and did not include a
cranium.
From the distribution of age, sex, status and health conditions noted in the burial population, there appears
to be no differential treatment in the mortuary ritual. The Late Prehistoric burials in Area E show a mix of
all ages and sexes not seen elsewhere in the site. This may be a factor of bone preservation more than cultural
practice. The later burials in Area E exhibit the best preservation in the site; however, the remains of the
sub-adults and children in this area showed ahigher degree of deterioration than the adults. It is quite possible
that sub-adults and children were interred in the other areas of the site, but were not preserved to the degree
that they could have been reoognized during the excavations. The poor condition of Burial 28 supports this
hypothesis, as does the minimal change in the general mortuary pattern observed over the site's history.
The inclusion of grave goods with the human intennents at Blue Bayou was rare. Scallorn arrow points, the
most common inclusion, were found with three individuals, and in one case a Scallorn arrow point may
possibly have been the cause of death. This type of projectile point is one of the most common temporally
diagnostic artifacts associated with human burials in Central Texas (Pat Parker, Frisch Auf!, and Loeve-Fox)
and on the Coast (Berryman and Odem). Examples of this arrow point have flecks or stains of asphaltum

124 /BLUE BAYOU

on the stems. Asphaltum, used as a mastic in the hafting of projectile points, has been observed in several
collections from this region going back into the Middle Archaic Period (ie. Morhiss points). Non-lithic items
were also uncommon, being associated with only two individuals. The bulk of these items including, bone,
antler and mussel shell were found with Burial 24. The inclusion of such an array of grave goods with this
individual, in contrast to the scarcity of material items with the other burial features, suggests that this adult
male may have had high standing within his social group. Aside from the material inclusions with this
individual, the remainder of the mortuary ritual, as can be recognized in the archeological record, is little
different from the other burials at the site.
The presence oflarge numbers of complete and fragmentary Dinocardium robustum shells suggest that these
marine shells may have played a particular part in the mortuary ritual at Blue Bayou. Since the dietary
pattern identified by stable isotopes indicates a terrestrial subsistence regime, these marine shells may have
been acquired specifically for the mortuary ritual. This theory is supported by lack of any intentional
modification on any of the Blue Bayou examples, and that this species has been rarely reported as a modified
item of personal adornment in this, and adjacent regions (Steele 1988). The robust construction, size and
shape of the shell make it a good digging tool in comparison to freshwater mussel shells (cf. Hester and
Corbin 1975). Secondarily these shells may have been used as semi-permanent grave markers. If this were
the case, then not only could a recent grave be avoided, but a cache of tools for the next excavation was
readily available. The pattern of breakage noted during the digging experiment is quite similar to the pattern
seen on the shell fragments recovered during excavation; this suggests that despite the potential for reuse, a
steady supply offresh shells was necessary. The presence of these marine shells and the asphaltum residue
on the Scallorn arrow points indicates contact with coastal environments or peoples, that were apparently
unrelated to subsistence activities. Given the proximity of the coast, these items could have been obtained
either through direct excursion or by trade.
Evidence for human aggression and vio1ence is minimal in the Blue Bayou skeletal population. Only a single
individual (Burial 16) displayed any evidence of vio1ent death. No evidence of healed or unhealed
ante-mortem fractures were noted in the cranial or post-cranial remains recovered from the site.
In general, the data recovered from the Blue Bayou site indicates a stable mortuary pattern for the Late
Archaic and early Late Prehistoric Periods. The only significant difference in the interment pattern is the
discontinuance of secondary burials in the Late Prehistoric.

Affiliations
Three other prehistoric mortuary sites have been excavated in the lower Guadalupe River drainage. Two of
these, the Texas West Indies Ranch (TWI) site (41 VT9), and the Vic Urban site (41 VT12) were excavated
by local avocational archeologists in 1960's, and the third, the Morhiss site (41 VTl) was excavated by the
Works Projects Administration in the 1930's. Like Blue Bayou, these three sites were all in sandy terrace
deposits. TWI and Vic Urban were located in deposits mapped as Deweyville Formation (Barnes 1975)
along the western edge of the Guadalupe floodplain. Morhiss was located on a terrace remnant of Pleistocene
age that stood in the eastern floodplain away from the edge of the modem terrace.
Unlike Blue Bayou, these three sites had extensive evidence of human occupational debris along with their
mortuary component. Over 40 hearth features, comprised of burned rock of burned clay lumps, or a mixture
of both, were recorded at Morhiss. The upper deposits of this site consisted an extensive midden accumulation, nearly four meters thick in the centerof the site, that contained a wide range of cultural debris including
lithic, bone and marine shell tools, and over 250 human burials (Campbell 1976). No occupational features

INfERPREJ'AT/ON OF MORTUARY DATA/ 125

were recorded at Vic Urban, and only two, both shell accumulations were reported from TWI. However,
both of these sites produced extensive collections of lithic and bone tools, some ceramics, and several conch
shell (Busycon sp.) ornaments.
The temporal range of these sites is difficult to assess. The cultural stratigraphy of all three was badly
disturbed and mixed by the activities of burrowing animals, and no radiocarbon assays exist. The only gauge
of time is the presence of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and this too is not without problems. At Morhiss
the earliest occupations are represented by the Late Paleo-Indian types: Plainview, Meserve and Angostura,
with the latter being the most common; however these may be in secondary context (Campbell 1976). The
bulk of diagnostic projectile points are Archaic in age. The most abundant types are Morhiss, Lerma and
Tortugas, none of which are well dated from other contexts. Less common types are Refugio, Kinney,
Pandora, Nolan, Travis and Darl. Late Prehistoric artifacts include Scallorn, Fresno and Perdiz arrow points
and some ceramics. This time period seems to be the least well represented at the site (Campbell 1976).
Thus it would appear that Morhiss was occupied over most of prehistory. Unfortunately the temporal context
of the mortuary component of the site is less clear. Information from Duffen's original field notes (TARL
files) indicates one bundle burial (Burial 61) was associated with five gouges and 31 Marginella beads.
Based on this, Hall (ms.) has suggested that this and the other bundle burials at the site may date to the Middle
or even the Early Archaic Period. Other burials, in particular Burials 39 and 50 were associated with Busycon
sp. beads and pendants. Similar grave goods were found with a large number of individuals in the Late
Archaic Burial Group 2 at the Ernest Witte site, which dates roughly 2400-1600 B.P. (Hall 1981).
The dating of TWI and Vic Urban sites is even more ambiguous. Diagnostic artifacts from the TWI surface
collection are indicative of Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric occupations. Typical point types
recovered are Morhiss, Tortugas and Palmillas dart points; Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points and ceramics
(Birmingham and Huebner 1991) were also found. Several long, unique conch columella beads and incised
bone implements were also recovered from the surface. These items may have been included with the burials,
but road construction may have removed them when it exposed and scattered several of the burials. The
association of columella beads and incised bone implements with a number of Late Archaic cemeteries in
Texas (Birmingham and Huebner 1991: Table 3), suggests a similar age for the TWI cemetery. This
argument is further supported by the presences of a stemmed dart point in association with Burial 3 at the
site.
At Vic Urban, the stratigraphic mixing of diagnostic artifacts throughout the site makes it difficult to assign
a temporal period to the mortuary component (Vogt field notes) Based solely on the numbers of artifacts
recovered, it appears that the Late Prehistoric occupations at the site, represented primarily by Scallorn and
Perdiz arrow points and bone tempered ceramics, were more intense than those of the Late Archaic
represented by Ensor and Marcos dart points. It is suggested, based on the extended body position of six of
the burials, and their depth of burial within the site, that the mortuary component is of Late Archaic age.
However, the total absence of grave goods is a markedly Late Prehistoric trait. It is wholly conceivable that
the Vic Urban mortuary population overlaps both these time periods, much like Blue Bayou. In summary,
the Morhiss burial population appears to pre-date Blue Bayou, as might TWI, and Vic Urban may be
contemporaneous, at least with the early burials at Blue Bayou.
In his cross-cultural study of mortuary ritual, Kroeber (1927: 308) noted that these practices have less stability
than normal day-to-day activities. In separating mortuary practice from other social and economic pursuits
disposal of the dead falls rather into a class with fashions, than with either customs or folkways on the one
hand, or institutions on the other (Kroeber 1927:314). The interment patterns documented at these three
sites illustrate a similar diversity of mortuary ritual as that observed by Kroeber; with a mixture of flexed,

extended, and secondary bundle burials, on their right or left sides. Considering the dating problems, the
only identifiable change which can be marlced in time is the discontinuance of secondary burials at Blue
Bayou at the end of the Late Archaic period.
In comparison with the mortuary traditions of both coastal regions and those of the greater Coastal Plain and
Central Texas, Blue Bayou is similar in some regards, but different in others. In all of these regions both
isolated intennents (see Appendix F), and discrete mortuary sites are found. There is an overall trend toward
the selection of soft terrace substrates (sand or loam) and the use of a spatially restricted area for burial
localities. Grave goods are sparsely distributed within Late Prehistoric cemeteries when compared to Late
Archaic sites. A final similarity is that all regions, except for the Upper Coast have mortuary traditions going
back a minimmn of 2000 years or more.

The mortuary pattern exhibited at Blue Bayou shows the greatest relationship with the inland traditions of
the Coastal Plain and Central Texas. Despite the geographic proximity of the coast, and a similar skeletal
morphology to coastal populations, the people of Blue Bayou were a different cultural group. The closeness
of relationship between Blue Bayou and the other inland sites of similar periodicity is itself difficult to
establish with the available data. Given the diversity displayed in the mortuary ritual at the four sites in the
lower Guadalupe valley, it would be most inappropriate to use criteria such as burial position or orientation
to establish a direct cultural relationship. The absence of marine shell grave goods at Blue Bayou during
the Late Archaic is unique considering their presence locally at TWI, and over the coastal plain from the
Albert George site in Fort Bend County eastward to the Olmos Dam site in Bexar County. A possible
explanation for this is that the Blue Bayou population were late comers to the lower Guadalupe during the
latter stages of the Late Archaic and as such were not involved with the indigenous traditions. The rare
dental anomalies of impacted third molars, double rooted canines, enamel pearls, and peg shaped molars
found at Blue Bayou suggest a relatively isolated breeding population. This hypothesis could be tested with
more detailed dentition studies.
During the Late Prehistoric the mortuary ritual at Blue Bayou resembles that of the Central Texas, Loeve-Fox,
Pat Parlcer and Frisch Aufl sites and Ernest Witte Burial Group 3. The major difference is that Blue Bayou
was an established cemetery when the Central Texas sites were founded, and it does not show a stratigraphic
break between Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric burial episodes seen at Ernest Witte. However, before we
go in search of significant similarities in these sites, more infonnation is needed on other aspects of culture
not found in mortuary sites. In the Coastal Plain we have abundant data on mortuary sites, but very little on
occupation sites, which is where future research should be directed.

Cultural Ecology
As a research perspective, cultural ecology can be succinctly defined as a method of inquiry directed at the
comprehension of interrelationships between people, resources and space (Butzer 1989). The use of this
approach to gain insight into the behavioral adaptation represented by Blue Bayou, or other mortuary
localities in the Coastal Plain, is hampered by the fundamental lack of systematically collected data necessary
for its full implementation. This is not to say that relevant data of all forms and kinds are absent, but that
their integration at various scales is made difficult by the different levels of resolution in collection and
analysis. Within these limitations it is still possible to examine Blue Bayou from a cultural ecology
perspective, however, the questions ask of, and inferences drawn from the aggregate of available data must
by necessity be broad and general.

INI'ERPREI'ATION OF MORTUARY DATA/ 127

The relationship between people and resources is the best illustrated by the data from the skeletal remains
this hunter-gatherer population. The bioarcheological analysis of the burial population indicates a pattern
of good overall health and quality of subsistence. The robusticity and marked sexual dimorphism in the
sample, along with a low level of both skeletal and dental pathologies suggests a general freedom from
chronic disease and metabolic stresses.
The most typical dental pathology found was periodontal infections in seven individuals, these were
accompanied by fairly large amount of calculus. Only four teeth from the entire sample exhibited enamel
hypoplasia, a defect associated with metabolic stress during the developmental years. Each of these teeth
showed only a single, albeit large, defect indicating only one period of stress. Dental caries were associated
with five individuals. Ante-mortem dental attrition was found in 16 of 25 individuals, with 12 of these
exhibiting severe cases. No discrete pattern ofloss as recogniz.ed by Hartnady and Rose (1991) in the Lower
Pecos region was seen at Blue Bayou.
Skeletal pathology was limited to two individuals. In both cases osteomyelitis or periostitis as a result of
traumatic injury or infection was identified.
The quality of the subsistence pattern that supported this generally healthy population was drawn from
terrestrial and fresh water ~uatic species. The stable carbon isotope analysis points to a diet of primarily
C3 pathway foods, with a 1 C interval that is representative of a heavy reliance on plant foods over meat.
The diet of these people along the Guadalupe River is quite similar to that of the Late Archaic Burial Group
2 at Ernest Witte along the Brazos River. The Ernest Witte results support Hall's (in press) hypothesis that
populations in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys subsisted on a diet based on rich, reliable and
non-mobile foods such as nuts, with deer being the primary protein source (Huebner and Boutton 1992).
Given the similarity of these Coastal Plain environments, a diet based on the same staples can be inferred
for the Blue Bayou population. The stable nitrogen ratios from Blue Bayou are slightly enriched relative to
populations elsewhere who subsisted on a terrestrial dietary base. The inclusion of fish and fresh water
invertebrates, which generally have depleted 13C values and enriched 15N ratios, in the diets of these
people seems likely within their ecological setting. The lower Guadalupe valley in the vicinity of the site is
drained by several creeks and bayous which flow into the river; and numerous lakes are found in the river's
floodplain. Based on these results aquatic species appearto have been an additional source of dietary protein.

Stable carbon isotope analysis indicates a slight change in human diets through time in the Coastal Plain.

While this change is not significant within the Blue Bayou population, the
Ccollagen values from 10 Late
Archaic individuals from Burial Group 2 at the Ernest Witte site are similar to the those from the Archaic
age individuals at Blue Bayou (Figure 36). As hypothesized by Huebner and Boutton (1992) increasing
social complexity in hunter-gatherer groups of this region may be manifested by the use oflower order foods
that required higher levels of energy to harvest and process. In the Coastal Plain, foods such as grass seeds

order, more expensive foods. While the difference is not statistically significant, the trend of the data offer

males consumed a food in the field that they did not bring back to camp, or a social restriction will require
further research.
The lack of a marine component in the Blue Bayou diet and the close proximity of Haynes, Guadalupe and
San Antonio Bays suggests that a cultural boundary existed down river from the site. Based on mortuary
traditions this line would have fallen between the southern end of Linn Lake (41 VT9) and the southern shore
of Green Lake (41CL13) which are 19km apart, and45 km and 26km,respectively, from the strand. Ricklis
(1990) has identified a similar boundary during the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods. The distribution
of sites oontaining ooastal Rockport ceramics fall within a roughly 40 km wide strip paralleling the ooastline.
The similarity of these findings implies that the boundary between coastal and inland adaptations has
oonsiderable time depth.
The oontinued use of mortuary sites from the Late Archaic through the Late Prehistoric period as seen at
Vic Urban and Blue Bayou is not present at most of the mortuary sites in the Brazos and Colorado drainages.
With the exception of the Late Prehistoric Burial Groups 3 and 4 at Ernest Witte, all of the mortuary sites
in these two drainages oontain only Late Archaic age burials. The large number of mortuary sites between
the drainages of the Guadalupe and Brazos rivers dating to this period suggest that groups had defined
territories which may have limited mobility and subsistence range. The cessation of interments at these sites
around the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period may mark the breakdown of these boundaries in the
upper two drainages while they were oontinued in the lower Guadalupe drainage.
The Blue Bayou diet which is characterized by heavy reliance on terrestrial C3 pathway foods is not oonsistent
with the subsistence strategies documented for protohistoric-historic Mariame (Campbell and Campbell
1981). The Mariame spent roughly nine months of the year in the lower Guadalupe River area, and the
remaining three months 125 to 170 km to the southwest gathering and oonsuming Opuntia sp. (prickly ~ar)
fruits. Had the people of Blue Bayou practiced a mobility strategy similar to that of the Mariame, their 13c
ratios would be more enriched. Opuntia sp. is a CAM plant. In the southwestern United States CAM plants
have 13 values that resemble Ci plants. 13 values from the total organic fraction of modem examples
of Opuntia engelmannii from Big Bend National Park averaged -12.7%0 (Eickmeier and Bender 1976), and
cellose nitrate from four species of Opuntia from the Lower Peoos region averaged -12.5+/-1.0o/oo (Sternberg
et al. 1984). Late Archaic people from the Lower Peoos region who oonsumed CAM plants have o13Ccollagen
values that range from-15.7 to -12.6o/ooand o13Capatite values between -7.3 to -8.6o/oo (Huebner 199la). Hadd
13
the people of Blue Bayou eaten Opuntia sp. as a major dietary staple for a quarter of the year, their o C
values should be enriched by approximately 2.5 to 3.0%o to their observed values, which would be closer to
the result obtained by Bousman (1990) from 41WY113.

Territories and cultural patterns established during the Late Archaic in the lower Guadalupe drainage, and
maintained during the early part of the Late Prehistoric broke down in the early thirteenth century with the
return of bison, and the Toyah Horizon people who hunted them (Huebner 1991b). At roughly this same
time, burial activity at Blue Bayou terminates, which oorrelates with the change in settlement and subsistence
patterns associated with a more mobile bison hunting lifeway. The Mariame, as described from Cabeza de
Vaca's narrative by Campbell and Campbell (1981), do not match what has been documented in the
archeological record as the Toyah Horizon in the Coastal Plain (cf. Hester and Parker 1970; Black 1986;
Huebner 1987b; Ricklis 1989). Thus it would appearthat the evolution ofbilobate territories, such as those
used by the Mariame, is a late development in the prehistory of the Coastal Plain, and post dates the use of
Blue Bayou as a mortuary site.

APPENDIX A
DESCRIPTION OF PHYSICAL REMAINS

The following appendix provides a complete physical description of the material recovered from each burial.
Individuals identified from each burial were given a three digit identification number. The first two digits
represent the burial from which the material was recovered and the third represents the individual within
that burial (i.e. 110 = burial 11 individual 0). In the case of the material from the "bone masses" this
identification number always begins with a 4, the second digit represents the number of the "bone mass,"
and the third represents the individual (i.e. 440 =Bone mass 4 individual 0). The completeness of each
element recovered in a burial is coded by a number between 1 and 5 (i.e. femur (4)): 1 - element only
represented by a few fragments, 2 - element less than half intact, 3 - approximately half the element intact,
4 - element approximately three-quarters intact, 5 - element complete.

Burial 1
Coordinates: S9 - W3/S8 - W3.
Context: This burial was recovered disarticulated with the elements fragmented.
Artifacts: None associated.

Invento~ of Remains: UID cranial fragments (1), rightl1, ri~t12 ·rifht C-, rightPM 1, rightPM2, rightM 1,

right M , right M 3, left 11 left12, left C-, left PM1. left PM , left M ,left M2, left M3, right femur (3), left
femur (3), several UID long bone fragments (1).
Minimum Number of Individuals: One (010).
Sex: Female. This assessment was made based on the mid-shaft circumference of the femur (Black 1978a).
Age: Adult. This assessment was made based on the presence and occlusion of the permanent dentition
along with the degree of dental attrition observed. Following Miles (1963) the degree ofattrition observed
suggests that this individual was in their late thirties.
Stature: Indeterminate.
Pathology: The right upper central incisor shows evidence of nerve or root damage with associated
discoloration and decay. Also the right upper lateral incisor shows evidence of carious activity on the lingual
surface.
Trauma: There is a heavy degree of attrition on all the teeth observed with severe wear also being displayed
on the occlusal surfaces of the incisors. The wear on the first molars is severe enough to have resulted in
the exposure of the dentine.
Anomalies: The incisors display a matked degree of shoveling. Also the upper central incisors display an
unusual wear pattern on the labial surface of the crown.

right radius (2), left radius (2), right ulna (2), right femur (3), left tibia (2), right second metacarpal, two
second phalanges.
Minimum Numberoflndividuals: One(020).
Sex: Female. This assessment was made based on the relatively gracile nature of the shafts of the humerus,
femur, and tibia.
Age: Old Adult This assessment was based on the presence and occlusion of the permanent dentition along
with the heavy degree of attrition on all the molars (Miles 1963).
Stature: Indeterminate.
Pathology: None discernable.
Trauma: The incisors display an unusual wear pattern on their lingual surface while the rest of the dentition
displays a relatively heavy degree of attrition in general.
Anomalies: The incisors from this individual display a marked degree of shoveling.

Burial 3
Coordinates: S9 - W3.
Context: This specimen is composed of several unidentifiable fragments recovered in a disarticulated
condition.
Artifacts: Two Scallorn points were recovered in association with this burial.
Inventory of Remains: Several UID long bone fragments.
Minim um Number of Individuals: One (030).
Sex: Indeterminate .

164 I BLUE BAYOU

Age: Mature. Due to the overall size of these fragments it is felt that they represent a mature individual but
it is impossible to be certain of the exact age range.
Stature: Indeterminate.
Pathology: None discernable.
Trauma: None discemable.
Anomalies: None discemable.

Burial 4
Coordinates: S9 - W3/S8 - W3.
Context: This burial was recovered in a semi-flexed position resting on its left side. The burial was oriented
northeast to southwest with the skull to the southwest. Bone to bone contact between Burial 4 and Burial 6
was encountered and based upon the archeological evidence is felt to suggest simultaneous interment.
Artifacts: Two Scallorn points were recovered in association with this burial.
Inventory of Remains: Pelvis fragments (4) (shattered in matrix), right radius (4 ), left radius (4 ), right femur
(4), left femur (4), right tibia (4), left tibia (4), left patella (4), several UID hand fragments.
Minimum Number of Individuals: One (040).
Sex: Male. This assessment was made based on the robusticity of the femur and tibia fragments along with
the mid-shaft circumference of the femur (Black 1978a).
Age: Mature. The remains of this individual represent those of a mature individual based on the fusion of
the epiphysis of the pelvis but it is not possible to determine if the individual wasadult or old adult due to
the limited nature of the remains.
Stature: Indeterminate.
Pathology: None discemable.
Trauma: None discemable.
Anomalies: None discernable.

Burial 5
Coordinates: S8 - W3/S9 - W3.
Context: This burial was recovered in an extended position with its legs drawn up resting on its back and
left side. The burial was oriented northwest to southeast with the skull to the southeast. Burial 5 is directly
overlain by Burials l, 2, 4, 6, and 7 as well as what was described in the field notes as bone masses 1 through

Minimum Number of Individuals: Three (050, 051, and052).
Sex: (050) Male. Individual 050 is felt to be male based on the well developed sites of muscle attachment,
mid-shaft femur circumference (Black 1978a), the relatively thick cross-section of the cranial fragments,
and the general overall robusticity of the remains. (051 and 052) IndeteTIDinate.
Age: (050) Adult to Old Adult. Tilis assessment was made based on the presence and occlusion of the
peTIDanent dentition along with the degree of attrition displayed by the molars (Miles 1963). Based on the
extent of attrition present it is felt that this individual was in their late thirties to early forties (Miles 1963).
(051) Adult. This assessment is based on the low degree of attrition displayed and the non-eruption of the
third molars. Both of these suggest an individual in their early twenties (Miles 1963, Schour and Massler
1940). (052) Old Adult. This assessment is based on the degree of attrition displayed by the molars (Miles
1963).
Stature: (050) 160.40 +/- 6.38 cm. The stature of 050 was estimated by first reconstructing the length of
the left femur following Steele (1970) giving a reconstructed femur length of 41.6+/- 1.31 an which was
then used in the stature foTIDula developed by Genoves (1967).
Pathology: Individual 050 displays evidence of several pathological conditions most of which appear to be
associated with degenerative conditions. Three of the middle phalanges of the foot display evidence of
arthritic lipping. The distal portion of the left fibula displays evidence of laminar bone growth. The left
femur displays a large and abnonnally developed site of muscle attachment on its proximal dorsal surface.
Trauma: All the teeth of individual (050) display a relatively heavy degree of attrition.
Anomalies: The incisors of 050 display marked shoveling.
Taphonomy: The right tibia and fibula of 050 displays evidence of rodent gnawing.

Stature: lndetenninate.
Pathology: Individual 240 displays evidence of infection and abscessing of the anterior portion of the right
half of the maxilla (hard palate) from what appears to be traumatic damage to the maxillary right central and
lateral incisors. Individual 241 displays evidence of infection of the right maxillary associated with the
premolars and suggests the possibility that this intrusive fragment might belong with the maxillary fragment
of individual 231.
Trauma: Individual 240 appears to suffered traumatic injury to the maxillary right central and lateral incisors
resulting in the antemortem loss of the crown of the central incisor and resulting in a subsequent infection
and abscessing of the hard palate. There is evidence of only a slight degree of attrition.
Anomalies: The incisors of 240 display a marked degree of shoveling.

APPENDIXF
AN ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF DIETARY PATTERNS
AT BLUE BAYOU

The cultural progression from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric in the Central Coastal Plain of Texas
is marked by the introduction of a new subsistence technology, the bow and arrow. The emergence of this
new technology raises questions about adaptive shifts and changes in hunter-gatherer subsistence economy
that might accompany such an innovation. The analysis of material culture within this and adjacent regions
suggests little change in lithic tool fonns, save for projectile points, between the two periods (Fox 1979;
Prewitt 1981; Brown 1983). Subsistence studies in the Coastal Plain involving faunal remains have been
hampered by generally poor preservation and as such, have been limited to species identification and MNI
tabulation for entire sites, with no reference to change through time (Rawn 1978; Butler 1979). Attempts
to recover plant remains in the fonn of macro fossils and pollen have met with little success, and while the
recovery and identification of opal phytoliths shows great promise, the few studies that have been done in
the region suffer from poor chronological controls (Robinson 1979, 1982). As a consequence, knowledge
of prehistoric subsistence strategies in the Central Coastal Plain is limited to a list of terrestrial and aquatic
animal species that would have been available to the prehistoric inhabitants of the region.
Evidence for prehistoric settlement patterns, derived from archeological survey data, indicate that Archaic
and Late Prehistoric cultural materials often co-occur on the same site in this region. These sites, which are
nonnally found on terraces, or bluff tops overlooking secondary, and tertiary drainages would have allowed
the occupants easy access to resources of both the riparian forests and stream courses, as well as the upland
prairies and woodlands. Inland sites of these two cultural periods commonly contain coastal materials in
the fonn of marine shell tools and ornaments, and asphaltum stains on projectile points and other tools. The
presence of these products and the close proximity of the strand suggests contact with coastal environments,
and the possibility of a marine component in the dietary pattern of the Coastal Plain' s prehistoric inhabitants.
Given these spatial and environmental parameters, a chemical investigation of the dietary pattern of these
hunter-gatherers, utilizing the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios preserved in their skeletal remains,
was undertaken to better understand their subsistence regimes and cultural ecology. Since the mean
residence time (MRT) of the diet signal preserved in in vivo bone tissues turns over at a rate of 30+ years
(Stenhouse and Baxter 1979; Krueger 1988) this method is very useful in assessing lifetime diets in
archeological populations.
In this report the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human remains from the Blue
Bayou mortuary site are presented. These results will be discussed in reference to the dietary patterns

identified and their change through time.
The ratios of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone tissues reflect the isotopic composition of the plants
at the base of the food chain (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981). Most plants and plankton use one of two
photosynthetic pathways C3, or C4. These are identified by how they fractionate carbon during the first step
of photosynthesis. The average o13C value of C3 and C4 plants is -26.5%0 and -12.5%0 respectively (Smith
and Epstein 1971). C3 plants represent the majority of the plant kingdom; these include trees, most shrubs
and most herbaceous dicots. C4 plants include largely tropical and sub-tropical grasses and some forbs. In
the Coastal Plain the major grasses were predominantly C4. as a re a small nurn ber of weedy forbs; the bulk
of the potential economic plants used the C3 pathway.

193

194 /BLUE BAYOU

Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or CAM, plants which are primarily desert succulents and cacti represent a
third pathway. Some facilitative members of this group have the ability to use either pathway to adapt to
changing environmental conditions and will have an isotopic value somewhere between those of C3 and Ct
plants (Lennan and Queiroz 1974). However the majority of CAM plants are complacent and maintain a
steady isotopic ratio over their entire life. In Texas CAM plants such as Opuntia and Agave have o13c values
simi;ar to Ct plants (Bickmeier and Berdes 1976)
When plants, and the herbivores that feed on them are consumed by humans their carbon is assimilated into
bone tissues. during metabolic break.down bone is enriched in 13C relative to that of the diet. This
fractionation effect deposits differinf: amounts of 13c in each of the two major bone tissues. The organic,
or collagen fraction of bone has a o 3C of +5%0, and the inorganic, or apatite fraction has a o13C of +8 to
12%0 relative to the average of dietary intake depending on the amount of plant vs. animal foods in terrestrial
diets (Krueger and Sullivan 1984). More recent research by Lee-Thorp et al. (1989) indicates that the apatite
may be + 12%0 regardless of the ratio of plant and animal foods. This difference, or ll. between collagen and
apatite o13C shows a mrut.ed decrease, as small as 2%o, in diets based on marine resources (Lee-Thorp et al.
1989). The ll. values of terrestrial diets have a nonnal range of 4-7%0.
Nitrogen isotopes are also useful in the interpretation of human diets. The lightest o15 N values are found in
legumes such as the acacias, beans, and mesquite which have the ability to obtain nitrogen from the air due
to a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria, where other plants get nitrogen only from the soil.
The o15N of Je gum es averages 0%o, whi1e other plants average between 2-10%0. Plants associated with saline
environments tend to have higher o15N values (Heaton 1987), as do marine animal species which feed on
them (Chishohn et al. 1982; Schoeninger et al. 1983; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). In arid environments,
those with less than 50 cm of rainfall per year, o15 N ratios may be useful forthe analysis of paleoenvironments
(Heaton et al. 1986). However in the case of the Central Coastal Plain which receives between 70 to 100 cm
of annual rainfall (Haragan 1983), these ratios may be more indicative of marine dietary components.
The o15N values in animal tissues are enriched by 3%o relative to their diet (De Niro and Epstein 1981 ). This
fractionation is cumulative by trophic level with herbivores being enriched by 3%o, and carnivores by 6%0
(Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984; Sealy et al. 1987).

Materials and Methods
Eleven samples of human bone from Blue Bayou were drawn from the site collection maintained by the
Department of Anthropology, Texas A&M University. The selection criteria included those adult burials
that had been dated by fluoride and radiocarbon to insure that the samp1e included individuals from both the
Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic periods. Only compact cortical bone from the extremities was used to
minimize potential diagenetic effects, although the overall preservation of the samples was variable.
The preparation and analysis of the samples was prefonned at Geochron Laboratories, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following is a summary of their procedures abstracted from Krueger and Sullivan (1984).
Bone samples were manually, then chemically cleaned in Alconox followed by an overnight bath in lN
acetic acid until all reaction with any remaining carbonates ceases. The samples are neutralized, then crushed
to a 1 mm powder and again reacted with lN acetic acid until all reaction stops.
One gram of bone powder is demineralized under vacuum with lN HCl which releases C02 which is
cryogenically purified and then analyzed as the apatite fraction. The collagen fraction is separated by

APPENDIX F: DIETARY PAITERNS f 195

decantation and :filtration on :fiberglass. It is kept acidic by the addition of a small amount of HCl, then
dissolved by boiling. The hot broth is then :filtered and the filtrate is evaporated and transferred to teflon
crucibles and dried to crystalline gelatin in an oven at 70°C.
Approximately 20 mg of gelatin along with CuO are placed in a Pyrex tube, evacuated, sealed and held at
500°C over night. Combustion results in C02, H20, and N02 which are cryogenically separated and
analyzed.

Results and Discussion
The results of the stable isotope analyses for both carbon and nitrogen are presented in Table 43. As seen
in Table 44, there is no significant difference between groups when sorted by sex and temporal period with
13
13
the exception of the <3 Capatite values between the sexes. The range of variation in <3 Ccollagen values in
the total sample is 2.5%o which is slightly more than double that of lab animals raised on monotonous diets
(DeNiro and Schoeninger 1983/: but within the limits of the isochronous human population (3.4o/oo) reported
by Boutton et al. ( 1991 ). The () 3c values obtained from the apatite fraction have a greater range of variation
than those of collagen. This 6.0o/oo range is nearly identical to that exhibited by a diachronous population in
15
N ratios are within the
a uniform environment from South Africa (Lee-Thoip et al. 1989). Variation in
limits reported for both human (Schoeninger et al. 1983), and animal (DeNiro and Schoeninger 1983)
populations subsisting on similar diets.

o

The dietary pattern seen in the Blue Bayou population indicates a heavy reliance on C3 pathway foodstuffs.
When these results are compared to other prehistoric populations (cf. Schoeninger et al. 1983; Schwarcz et
al. 1985; Lee-Thoip et al. 1989; Huebner and Boutton 1992), a terrestrial diet is indicated; however, there
is some ambiguity. Krueger and Sullivan (1984; see also Krueger 1985) developed a predictive model to
13
identify dietary regime based on the cross plot of <3 C ratios from collagen and apatite. When the Blue
Bayou <3 13C values are referred to this model, those with collagen values heavier than l 9%0 fall within diet
Group 7 (C3 plants and marine), while the others lie largely within diet Group 1, C3 plants (Pigue X).
However, when the <>15N and <313Ccollagen values are plotted on a second Krueger (1985) model, they are
encompassed completely within the terrestrial dietary realm.
Further evidence for a terrestrial dietary pattern at Blue Bayou can be drawn from three sources. The d
13
d C:ollagen-apatite values in the Blue Bayou sample have a mean of 6.7+f-2.04. Compared to a human
population that subsisted on a marine diet, this d value is roughly three times greater (Lee-Thotp et al. 1989).

196 /BLUE BAYOU

In this case the

o13Capatite values of both the South African and Blue Bayou samples are very similar, but

the o Ccollagen values are different This variance can be explained by the way the three principal
components of food affect the o13C ratios in the two fractions of bone (Krueger and Sullivan 1984; Lee-Thorp
et al. 1989). Proteins, in the fonn of meat. are responsible for the isotope ratios in the collagen fraction of
bone. The energy component of diet, carbohydrates from vegetal sources, and lipids (fats) along with
proteins not used for growth, contribute to the isotope ratio of the apatite fraction of bone. Since the marine
reservoir of carbon is enriched in 13c, human diets containing marine faunas will yield enriched collagen
values relative to those relying on terrestrial faunas. In a study of the isotopic ecology of Red.fish Bay, Parker
13
(1964) detennined the o C values of 21 plant and animal species common to the bay. Seven of these animal
species, which may have been exploited by humans, have a mean meat o13C value of -15.6%0. Thus the d
values and the o13C collagen values of the South African sample (-17.9 to -10.6%0) indicate a marine protein
contribution in the dietary matrix, and those from Blue Bayou (-20.7 to -17.8o/oo) show a terrestrial dietary
pattern. The o13Capatite values are similar in both samples indicative of the consumption of C3 plants, which
is supported in the analysis of Lee-Thorp et al. (1989), and that of economic plants available to the people
of Blue Bayou.
13

In a small contract study from deep South Texas, Bousman (1990) analyzed two humans, one from an inland
site (41WY113), and the other from a coastal setting (41WY50). The o13Cconagen values showed a clear
se~aration, with the coastal individual bring enriched by 6.0%orelative to the inland value of -15.7%0. The
o1 Cco11agen ratio of the 41WY113 sample is enriched in comparison to the Blue Bayou mean, which indicates
a different inland dietary pattern in deep South Texas that contained a greater amount of C4/CAM foods.
However, keeping in mind that this is a small sample, what is most interesting here is isotopic separation
between the inland and coastal diets.
The o15 N values also point toward a terrestrial diet at Blue Bayou. The mean 0 N value of 10.5%o is slightly
enriched relative to the range of previously analyzed populations in other terrestrial settings (Schoeninger
et al. 1983). These enriched ratios suggest very little, if any dependence on legumes, but may indicate some
fresh water aquatic species in the diet. Fish tend to have enriched o15 N values that are intennediate between

marine and terrestrial organisms (Pang and Nriagu 1977; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1983; Katzenberg 1989;
Huebner, unpublished data). The principal species of fish remains found in archeological sites along the
lower Guadalupe River and its tributaries is Lepisosteus sp. (gar); the remains of this species are more
prevalent and visible due to the bony nature of their scales. Many other species of fish are available in these
streams, however their remains are much more susceptible to deterioration, and not represented in existing
site collections. While the nitrogen isotope ecology of the Central Coastal Plain is unknown, the elevation
15
N values seen at Blue Bayou, relative to other populations with terrestrial dietary patterns,
in the human
may well be attributable to an aquatic dietary component

o

Some idea of the ratio of plant to animal products in the Blue Bayou diets can be gleaned from the isotopic
3
data Returning to the Krueger (1985) model for ~>1 Cconagen-apatite the greater portion of the points fall close
to the herbivore line (Figure 37). These results are in general agreement with the analysis by Prewitt (1981)
that the subsistence patterns of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric populations relied heavily on plant
resources.

o13

Capatite ratio ranges between the sexes at Blue Bayou may be indicative of differential
The variance in
plant intake (Table 44). The 13 values in males are enriched relative to those of females. This may
represent male consumption of a C4. plant food source while separated from the females, such as on the hunt,
or a product of a restrictive food taboo imposed on the females. These findings of a dichotomy of dietary
pattern between the sexes runs against the data reported by other analysts (Boutton et al. 1991; Lovell et al.
13
1986); however none of these studies have examined the apatite fraction of bone. While
Capatite values
have been a point of controversy in dietary studies (cf. Schoeninger and DeNiro 1982; Sullivan and Krueger
1983), recent research (Krueger 1988; Lee-Thorp et al. 1989) has shown, that with proper preparation can
be as useful as collagen. The dichotomy between the sexes identified in Blue Bayou population though the
sample is small, is statistically real. A Students t test (T=3.0943, df=7) shows the means to be significantly
different a the .02 level (2 tailed test).

oc

o

Dietary change through time in the Blue Bayou population is negligible (Table 44). These results indicate
no increase in the meat component of diet which might be expected with the introduction of the bow and
arrow. The 13Cconagen values of the Late Archaic burials at Blue Bayou are very similar to those seen in
the Burial Group 2 population at the Ernest Witte site (41AU36) to the northeast (Huebner and Boutton
1992). The Late Prehistoric population at Blue Bayou shows a trend towards an increased intake of C4. foods.
The parallel hunter-gatherer dietary patterns in the Late Archaic in these two sites indicates long term
subsistence stability in the Coastal Plain, with slight changes in the Late Prehistoric. Hall (in press) has
suggested that large cemeteries developed in the Coastal Plain because the availability of superabundant
food resources permitted the establishment and maintenance of territories. Principal economic resources in
the prehistoric Coastal Plain included nuts, in particular pecans, deer, turkey, squirrels, raccoons, along with
fish and shellfish. While there are no isotope data for these species in Texas, elsewhere they have depleted
carbon isotope ratios (Katzenberg 1989), which is consistent with the human data from both Coastal Plain
cemeteries.

o

The Blue Bayou diet which is characterized by heavy reliance on terrestrial C3 plants and animals that
consumed C3 plants is not consistent with the subsistence strategies documented for Proto-historic-Historic
Mariame (Campbell and Campbell 1981 ). The Mariame spent roughly nine months of the year in the Lower
Guadalupe River area, and the remaining three months, 78 to 104 miles to the southwest gathering and
consuming Opuntia sp. (prickly pear) fruits.

o

Opuntia sp. is a CAM plant. In the southwestern United States, CAM plants have 13c values that resemble
C4 plants. The 13c values of modern examples of Opuntia engelmannii from Big Bend National Park
averaged -12.7o/oo (Eickmeier and Bender 1976), and four species of Opuntia from the Lower Pecos region

o

averaged -12.5+/-1.0o/oo (Sternberg et al. 1984). Late Archaic people from the Lower Pecos region who
consumed CAM plants have o13Ccollagen values that range from -15.7 to -12.6o/oo and o13Capatite values
between-7.3 to -8.6o/oo (Huebner 1991). Had the people of Blue Bayou eaten Opuntia sp. as a major dietary
staple for a quarter of the year, their o13C values should be enriched by approximately 1.5 to 2.0o/oo to their
observed values, which would be closer to the result obtained by Bousman (1990) from 41WYl13.
Territories established during the Late Archaic in the Coastal Plain and maintained during the early part of
the Late Prehistoric appear to have broken down in the early thirteenth century with the arrival of the bison,
and the lithic technology adapted to their exploitation. This period has been identified in the archeological
record as the Toyah Horizon. At roughly the same time, burial activity at Blue Bayou terminates: This
correlates with the change in settlement and subsistence patterns associated with a more mobile bison hunting
lifeway. The Mariame, as described from Cabeza de Vaca's narrative by Campbell and Campbell (1981),
do not match what has been documented in the archeological record as the Toyah Horizon in the Coastal
Plain (cf. Hester and Parker 1970; Black 1986; Huebner 1987b; Ricklis 1989). Thus it would appear that
the evolution of the bilobate territories, such as those used by the Mariame, is a late development in the
prehistory of the Coastal Plain.

Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that the introduction of the bow and arrow did not have a substantial effect
on the dietary pattern of the people of Lower Guadalupe River valley. The pattern of diet in the Late Archaic
components at Blue Bayou and Ernest Witte are very similar. The Late Prehistoric population at Blue Bayou
shows a slight increase in the consumption of ~ foods. These results point to a stable terrestrial
hunter-gatherer adaptation, with slight late variation, in the Coastal Plain for the period ca. 2400 - 700 BP.
This adaptation involved the exploitation of terrestrial resources, primarily C3 plants and their consumers.
While there is some conflict between various models as to whether or not a marine component is represented
in the Blue Bayou diet, the preponderance of evidence suggests there is not. The best evidence for the lack
of a marine component inthe diet is the large Ii o13Cconagen-apatite values, and the o13Cconagen ratio separation
between Blue Bayou and 41 WY50.
Future research needs to address the isotopic variability of specific prehistoric resources. These should
include well preserved faunal remains from securely dated contexts and modem plants, since prehistoric
examples are unavailable from this region. An analysis of coastal resources and human remains would
provide a comparative sample for the Blue Bayou data, sites such as 4 INUl 73 and41SP1 which had Scallorn
arrowpoints associated with burials should have high priority.
