ABSTRACT
On March 30, 2017, Apex TITAN, Inc. (Apex), at the request of Texas Gas Service (TGS, a
subsidiary of ONE Gas, Inc.), conducted an intensive non-collection cultural resources survey of
high probability areas (HPAs) along the east side of Farm to Market (FM) 973 located north of
State Highway (SH) 71 in Travis County, Texas (Project No: 453185-001). TGS is proposing to
construct approximately 7,405 linear feet of new 8” pipe on the east side of FM 973 within the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Austin District right of way (ROW). The
southernmost 2,062 feet of the proposed line was identified as a HPA for intact cultural
resources. The 100% pedestrian survey of the HPA, augmented by strategically placed backhoe
trenches (BHTs), was negative for cultural resources. Based on these data, Apex recommends
that the proposed improvements east of FM 973 be allowed to proceed as planned as no cultural
resources will be affected.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

PROJECT TITLE: Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed FM 973 8” Steel Gas Main Line,
Travis County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: On behalf of TGS, Apex conducted an intensive non-collection
cultural resource survey of the HPA along the proposed 8” steel main line in Travis County, Texas
(Apex Project No. 453185-001). The proposed HPA consists of approximately 2,062 linear feet
along the east side of FM 973 within the TxDOT 40-foot wide ROW for a total of 1.89 acre.
PROJECT LOCATION: The proposed TGS pipeline is located in a rural area of Travis County,
Texas on the eastern side of the FM 973 from approximately 590 feet north of its intersection
with Tyrone Drive and extending north for approximately 7,405 feet on the USGS 7.5 minute
Webberville topographic quadrangle.
DATE OF WORK: March 30, 2017
PURPOSE OF WORK: Apex assisted TGS in their due diligence under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC).
PRINCIPLAL INVESTIGATOR: Debra L. Beene
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES CODE PERMIT NUMBER: 7957
NEWLY RECORDED SITE: none
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: none
COMMENTS: The pedestrian survey, augmented with strategically placed BHTs, was negative
for cultural resources. Apex recommends that the Project proceed without further cultural resource
investigation as the proposed construction would have no effect on cultural resources eligible
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, augmented with backhoe
trenching, of the HPAs located within the proposed FM 973 Steel Gas Main in Travis County,
Texas. Locational maps of the proposed Project and survey boundaries of the HPAs are provided
in Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2, on aerial imagery and topographic maps, respectively.
This work was completed in support of TGS’s proposed 8” steel gas main located within the
TxDOT ROW on the east side of FM 973 from approximately 590 feet north of its intersection
with Thyone Drive and continuing north for approximately 7,405 feet; hereafter referred to as the
proposed Project. Initially, the proposed Project corridor was assessed by the Principal
Investigator to identify HPAs for significant cultural resources. Based on the results of previous
investigations in similar settings to the proposed project, the HPA for intact cultural sites was
identified; the remaining area of the proposed Project was not included in the HPA due to
significant impacts from aggregate and sand mining operations. The HPA was identified as the
southernmost 2,062 linear feet of the proposed Project; hereafter, referred to as the Area of
Potential Effect (APE).
Because the proposed Project will occur on property owned or administered by a political
subdivision of the State of Texas (TxDOT), the project is subject to TAC found in Title 13, Part II
of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation requires any political subdivision of the State
of Texas, defined as a local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this
state, must identify potential State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) through survey of public lands
prior to actions that could potentially damage those cultural resources. The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) administers the TAC and reviews scopes of work (SOW) and issues TAC
permits. This project was conducted under TAC Permit No. 7957 issued to Principal Investigator
Debra L. Beene.
Although unlikely, the proposed Project may require the TGS to obtain a United States EPA
storm water discharge permit and, as such, the proposed Project may also be subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966. The intent of the NHPA is to protect significant
cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or
which occur on federal property. The State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in
Texas by the THC, provides dual federal and state review and comments of the report.
The cultural resources investigation was conducted to identify archeological and historical
resources within the proposed APE. The survey methodology followed the Survey Standards of
Texas developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) (1987) and THC (n.d.). The
investigation included an intensive cultural resources survey augmented with strategically placed
BHTs in the HPA (area identified as having a high probability of containing intact cultural
resources). The negative survey report follows the short report format (CTA 1987).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is located in the Central Texas archeological region in southeastern Travis
County. It is within the Blackland Prairie division of the Gulf Coastal physiographic zone and the
Plains Grassland vegetation habitat (Perttula 2004). Geology, hydrology, topography, vegetation,
and soils within the proposed APE are briefly summarized below.
3.2 Geology
The local geology of the proposed Project consists of Pleistocene-aged Fluviatile terrace deposits
(QT) associated with the Colorado River and Elm Creek (Barnes 1981). Due to historic flood
events, overbank deposition has probably been the dominant geomorphic process throughout the
Holocene.
3.3 Hydrology
The proposed Project is located in the Colorado River floodplain; this large flat floodplain extends
between 0.61 mile and 1.42 mile west of FM 973 to the east bank of the Colorado River in the
Hornsby Bend area. (see Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2). The Hornsby Bend Sewage Disposal
Facility is located approximately 0.34 mile to the west of the southern terminus of the proposed
Project.
3.4 Topography
The elevation of the proposed Project ranges from approximately 437 feet above mean sea level
(msl) near the northern terminus to approximately 455 feet above msl at the northern terminus.
In general, the topographic relief of the proposed Project is relatively flat. Aggregate and sand
mining and agricultural activities have significantly altered a minimum of 70 percent of the
landscape within the proposed Project. A topographic map of the proposed Project is included as
Appendix A, Figure 2.
3.5 Vegetation
Most of the proposed Project had been cleared and plowed for use as cropland prior to the largescale development of aggregate and sand mining activities. Little, if any, of the native Blackland
Prairie grasslands have survived; the vegetation observed during the survey consists of Johnson
grass, Bermuda grass, and miscellaneous short grasses and forbs.
3.6 Soils
Three soil units are intersected by the proposed Project (NRCS 2013). Soils from north to sout h
consists of Bergstrom silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (BeA) on floodplain steps, Pits, gravel, 1 to
90 percent slopes (GP), and Bergstrom silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (BgA) on floodplain
steps. The BeA typical profile is silt loam (0 to 9 inches) (H1) over silty clay loam (9 to 60 inches)
(H2) resting on silty clay loam (60 to 80 inches) (H3). The BgA typical profile is silty clay loam (0 to
25 inches) (H1) over silt loam (25 to 60 inches) (H2), resting on silty clay loam (60 to 80 inches)
(H3). The GP consists of 100 percent gravel.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The traditional cultural sequence of central Texas includes the Paleoindian period (11,500 to 8800
BP) followed by the Early (8800 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 4000 BP), and Late (4000 to 1300
or 1200 BP) Archaic periods; the latter Late Prehistoric period (approximately 1200 to around 250
BP) is followed by the Historic period (250 BP into the mid-to late 19th century) (Collins 2004).
These temporal divisions are reflected in changes in technologies and subsistence adaptations.
Archeological site types range from lithic scatters and isolated heaths to open camps, burned rock
middens, hearth fields, lithic procurement/quarries, rockshelters and cemeteries. Within the
general area of the proposed Project, most of the prehistoric sites are open camps situated on
alluvial terraces near streams or rivers. The cultural assemblage may include fire cracked rock
(FCR), lithic debitage, lithic tools (hammerstones, unifaces, bifaces, diagnostic projectile points),
ground stones, and ceramic sherds. Historic site types range from Mexican period ranchos, early
Anglo farmsteads and settlements to the Camino Real de los Tejas, a network of roads linking
outposts and supply towns. Most of the historic sites, within the general area of the proposed
Project, are homesteads and tenant farms dating to the late 19th century.
A search of the restricted use online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (ATLAS), maintained by the
THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), was conducted to identify any
known cultural resource sites (including cemeteries) and previous investigations conducted within
0.5 mile of the APE. Five cultural resource investigations have taken place and three cultural
resource sites have been documented within the 0.5-mile study area (ATLAS 2015). None will be
impacted by the proposed Project.
In 2015, a survey of the east side of FM 973 was surveyed by Apex for Texas Gas Service under
TAC permit number 2693 (ATLAS 2017). This negative survey is Iocated immediately north of
the proposed Project.
In 2004, a north/south linear survey for the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) was carried
out by PBS&J under TAC permit number 2693 (ATLAS 2017). It crosses the northern extent of
the proposed Project. None of the 97 recorded sites, which included deeply buried prehistoric open
camps, historic farmsteads, and a human burial, are located within the study area.
In 2003, a linear survey for State Highway (SH) 130 was carried out by Hicks and Company under
TAC permit number 3001 (ATLAS 2017). It is located approximately 0.42 mile (0.70 km) east of
the proposed Project. Twenty-nine previously recorded sites were revisited and 14 new sites were
recorded; of these, one multi-component prehistoric and historic site (41TV2162) was
recommended for NRHP eligibility testing and one prehistoric site (41TV2161) was recommend
as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (ATLAS 2017). The 43 recorded sites, which included
prehistoric lithic scatters, prehistoric open camps, historic scatters, historic farmsteads, and a
human burial, are located within the study area. Of the 43 sites, two historic sites are located within
the study area; these are presented below. Site 41TV902, an abandoned domestic structure, is
located approximately 0.42 mile east of the proposed Project; archival research was
recommended if it was threatened by development (ATLAS 2017). Site 41TV2064, a scatter of

historic debris, is located approximately 0.49 mile east of the proposed Project; it has been
impacted by the TXI access road, property boundary road, and plowing and no further work was
recommended (ATLAS 2017).
Site 41TV516, an historic household, is located approximately 0.45 mile southeast of the
proposed Project. It was recorded during an Onion Creek Project survey in 1980 and
recommended ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further data is available on the ATLAS
(2017).
In 2001, a linear survey for the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) was carried out by PBS&J
under TAC permit number 2692 (ATLAS 2017). It is located approximately 0.64 mile (0.80 km)
east of the proposed Project. None of the 29 recorded sites, which included deeply buried
prehistoric open camps, historic farmsteads, and a human burial, are located within the study area.

METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field investigation, the proposed Project was assessed for HPAs for containing
significant cultural resources. The THC’s ATLAS database (ATLAS 2015) and the Texas State
Library and Archives Commission’s (TSL) historical county maps (TSHD 1940, 1961) were
reviewed to identify significant cultural resources. No standing structures, cultural resources sites,
or previous investigations were found within the proposed Project. Based on the results of previous
investigations in similar settings to the proposed project, the HPA or APE was identified as the
southernmost 2,062 linear feet of the proposed Project.
The cultural resources investigation did not commence until the Principal Investigator received
the TAC permit from the THC. The investigation was conducted to identify cultural resources
within the proposed project and make recommendations about their significance. Portions of
the proposed project location, within Hornsby Bend of the Colorado River, have a high probability
of containing significant cultural resources; numerous sites have been found in similar landforms
and are often deeply buried. However, much of the proposed project has been impacted
by aggregate and sand quarrying and has been destroyed; the fieldwork will be restricted
to the areas within the proposed project with relatively intact soils. One HPA was identified within
the southernmost 2,062 feet of the proposed Project.
Backhoe trenching is proposed on the floodplain terraces in the southern HPA; a minimum of 2
BHTs and a maximum of 6 BHTs will be mechanically excavated to assess for buried cultural
resources. The archaeologists will oversee the trenching, describe the stratigraphic profile, and
document any identified cultural resources. Any deviations from the Survey Standards of Texas
will be fully documented and justified.
The current field investigation was designed to comply with appropriate archeological field
methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the CTA (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC (n.d.) in
conjunction with the CTA. The primary intent of the survey is to identify and describe all
archeological resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and, should eligible archeological sites be located, make recommendations for future
management options, such as avoidance and preservation or further investigations. No cultural

Texas Gas Service

materials will be collected; however, any newly discovered materials will be professionally
photographed and illustrated in detail.
A draft technical report will be prepared; it will meet the standards for cultural resource reports
adopted by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists. The report will briefly describe the
natural and cultural history of the project area, discuss the methodology and results of the
survey, and conclude with recommendations about site NRHP eligibility (if applicable) and
whether further archeological work should be conducted in the project area. The draft report will
be submitted to the THC and TxDOT for review. Any concerns will be addressed and final reports
will be provided to the client, TxDOT, and THC.

RESULTS

The identified HPA was 100 percent pedestrian surveyed for archeological and historical
cultural resources and documenting disturbances (see Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2 for the HPA
identified for the cultural resources survey). After the pedestrian survey, the HPA was reduced
to the southern 1,482 feet as the remainder has been developed as a plant nursery,
commercial and residential development. The majority of the HPA is currently being cleared
for future residential communities.
The HPA was surveyed using the proposed Project alignment provided by TGS. The locations
of the subsurface investigations were dictated by the presence of buried utilities; trenching
was restricted within 2 feet (30.5 inches) east of the buried utility (one AT&T fiber optic line was
the sole utility in the APE), which was clearly marked in advance of the survey. The BHTs were
recorded, photographed, and their locations plotted with a hand-held Trimble unit. The BHTs
measured between 10 and 20 feet (3.05 and 6.1 meters) in length, averaged 3 feet (0.9 meters)
in width, and were excavated to depths ranging between 5.0 and 6 feet (1.52 and 1.8 meters).
The field crew made thorough field notes about the location, maximum depth, and number of
soil strata observed for the subsurface tests. Digital photographs were taken across the APE.
Table 1 summarizes the results of the BHTing; their locations are mapped in Appendix A,
Figure 3.
The soils are mainly loamy clay in the APE. The six BHTs revealed similar soil profiles with
minimal roots and very little else; the typical profile consists of dark brown loamy clay over mottled
reddish-brown and dark brown loamy clay resting on reddish-brown loamy clay. All 6 BHTs were
negative for cultural resources (see Table 1); see t he BHT profiles in the below photographs.
The APE proved to have negligible probability for cultural resources within the TxDOT ROW
due to previous impacts and lack of topographic relief (see Table 1).
Due to the negative survey and subsurface excavation results, this report is presented in
accordance with the short report format guidelines as outlined by the THC’s Rules of Practice
and Procedures (as per Section 26.24), which refers to the Council of Texas Archeologists’
Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The southernmost 2,062 feet of the proposed line was identified as a HPA for intact cultural resources;
however, after the pedestrian survey, the HPA was reduced to the southern 1,482 feet as the remainder
has been developed as a plant nursery, commercial and residential development. The majority of the
HPA is currently being cleared for future residential communities. The entire HPA was subjected to a
100 percent pedestrian survey, supplemented with BHTing. Six BHTs were excavated by the
archeologists across the HPA or APE (see Table 1 and Appendix A, Figures 1 through 3).
No cultural materials were encountered during the pedestrian survey or during the subsurface
testing. It is the opinion of Apex that there is negligible potential for the proposed Project to contain
intact archeological or historic resources eligible for listing as SALS or inclusion in the NRHP.
The work reported here represents a reasonable and good faith effort to ensure that the
proposed Project will not affect historic properties; and no further work is recommended.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
currently proposed infrastructure, then further archeological investigations may be necessary in
those areas prior to any construction. If evidence of intact archeological and historic resources
is identified during construction, work in the immediate area should cease until the resources
are assessed by a professional archeologist.
