Pictographs of Indian Masks at~ Hueco Tanks

PICTOGRAPHS OF INDIAN MASKS AT
HUECO TANKS
By FORREST KIRKLAND
During the summer of 1939, the writer and his wife spent ten
days at the historic Hueco Tanks, located about thirty-five miles
northeast of El Paso, copying and studying the many interesting pictographs painted on the rocks near the water holes. The location
consists of several huge masses of bare igneous rocks which rise
out of a desert plain to a height of over 400 feet. The formation,
which is very irregular, covers roughly about one square mile.
There are crevices and depressions at a number of places near the
base of the rocks that collect and ho!d rain water, like large cisterns, from one rain until the next; hence the name Hueco Tanks.
This supply of good water must have been a great attraction to
the Indian, as it was to the "forty-niners" and other early travelers
whose names are mingled with the Indian pictures on the wails of
the shelters at the base of the rocks. During our investigation, we
examined more than 60 shelters which had smoke covered walls and
ceilings and 37 of these contained pictographs. We also found pictographs under 13 overhanging cliffs and in 23 niches and crevices
too small to have been used as living quarters. The picture sites
are distributed over all of the rugged parts of the formation, but
the shelters near the l~rge water holes contain the greatest number
and variety of pictures.
Little Damage So Far by Vandalism

In view of the fact that the site was a favorite camping place
during pioneer days and a picnic ground in recent years for the
people of El Paso, it seems remarkable that the pictographs have
suffered so little from vandalism. Many of the designs are dim
from natural weathering, particularly blowing sand, but few have
been .seriously injured by the thousands of names and dates carved
and written on the rocks.
Juan Escontrias, who lives at the place and whose family has
owned the site for many years, shows a keen appreciation for its
historic value and is to be commended for his intelligent supervision

of the site as a private park.

We are deeply indebted to him and

his wife for the many courtesies shown us while we were there.
As might be expected at such a well used watering place, there
are many kinds and ages of pictographs at Hueco Tanks.

Some are

undoubtedly very old, many are late prehistoric, and others are so
recent that they show men wearing European clothes.

Indeed one

group showing cavalrymen painted apparently with Indian colors,
overlaps a name and date of 1849. These pictures were classified
as the work of the white man, but it is quite possible that they were
made by an Indian who visited the site later than 13¢9.
Three Distinct Types o! Pictographs

A careful study of this great jumble of crude, overlapping, and
faded pictures reveals at least three easily recognized types:
Type One--Quite large, crude drawings of horses and men in
modern dress, painted chiefly in chalky white; but some are in
black, red, and yellow; and a few in gray clay, or mud. This type
contains several interesting dancing groups and a number of obscene
figures. It seems to be entirely historic and is perhaps the work
of the late Apaches. It is found only on the northeast side of the
site near the principal water tanks.
Type Two--Smaller and much more skillfully drawn pictures,
including mountain sheep, deer, serpents, birds, kachina-like figures,
masked heads, blanket-like designs, and other objects too highly conventionalized to be easily identified.

These pictures are in a wide

range of colors--red, black, white, yellow, brown, gray, blue, and
green.

They are found in large numbers at all parts of the site and

show no evidence of European contact.
Type Three--Many tong zigzag lines, check marks, circles, and
other geometrical forms accompanied by a few small, crude, and
conventionalized human and animal figures.

Most of these designs

are painted in red; but a few are in white, yellow, and gray.

of the geometrical forms are in black. They are found chiefly along
the north side of the site, but in small numbers in most other sections.
There is no doubt that Types One and Two were produced by entirely diff~ent and unrelated people, and that some time elapsed
between the two periods; but the evidence is not so clear as to who
produced Type Three--and when. Similar geometrical forms are
found to some extent among the pictu.res of almost all cultures; however, certain Indians seem to have limited "their artistic efforts exclusively to geometrical figures.1 My opinion, based on a study
of both the colors and desgins, is that a few of the Type Three
designs may belong to Type One; a large number belong to Type
Two; but the greater part, especially the designs on the north side
of the site, belong to a late prehistoric people who followed the
Type Two culture and preceded Type One.
There are two or three other types of pictographs at the site but
in too small numbers to justify description here.
Mask Paintings Suitable ]or Detailed Study

Certainly the most interesting designs at Hueco Tanks are among
the Type Two pictures; and the mdsked heads which are the subject of this paper, offer the best material for a detailed study. The
ease with which such highly specialized designs can be recognized
among cruder and commoner forms, makes them especially valuable
for study. Their highly individual features can be positively identified and definitely related to similar features in pottery designs,
drawings, or other kinds of Indian art. Such pictographs, although
seldom found, afford the best possible opportunity for profitable
investigation.
I was, therefore, keenly interested in finding so many fine mask
drawings at Hueco Tanks. The discovery was somewhat of a surprise; too; because, although a few examples of the masks were
among the illustrations, they were barely mentioned by Crimmins2
and Jackson3 in their reports on the pictog.raphs at the site.

T~zas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Robertsz~ recognized similar mask drawings among the pictographs
in the nearby Hueco Mountain caves, and devoted some space to
their description in his report. He found fragments in one cave of
what, he thought, might have been a mask like those painted on the
wall.
Type o] Mask Paintings
There are 89 of these masks on our complete copies of the pictographs at Hueco Tanks. They are of two distinct types: 51 are
drawn in outline in the conventional manner (Plate 2) ; 38 are built
up of solid masses of color as if made with a stencil (Plate 3).
These two types, which for convenience we shall call outline masks
and solid masks, are found together in many of the shelters. They.
vary in size from 4 to 12 inches wide.
The workmanship of the outline masks is generally much cruder
thar~ that of the solid type, The paint in most cases is thicker and
less expertly appl~ied and the designs are less artistic. Nearly all of
the solid masks were painted with thin liquid color that seemed to
have soaked into the rock like dye. Each individual block in the
masks is sharp and distinct; and the designs themselves reflect considerable artistic ability.
Colors Used

Forty-six of the outline masks are painted either in red or black
or a combination of the two; three are in gray; one in white; and
one in gray and white. Most of the stlid masks are either red, black
or white; three are in brown; two are in red and yellow; three in
red and blue; and one in red and green--the only green we have
found, so far, in Texas. Thus, the outline masks appear in only
four colors while the solid masks are in eight.

Conventionalizatiora

Some of the outline masks are quite .realistic, showing eyes, ears,
nose, and mouth. Some have amusing expressions, reminding one
of comic strip faces. Others are conventionalized or incomplete;
but in all but a very few~ cases (Plate 5, No. 6, 7, 11) the features
of the face can easily be recognized. The solid masks, on the other
hand, are highly conventionalized at best. Many of them barely
retain the features of the face; more than 15 are lacking such features, and can only be classified as masks because of their general
resemblance to the more realistic examples (Plate 3, No. 13-17).
Location o] the Mask Paintings

The location of most of the mask paintings is interesting if not
significant. We usually find pictographs on the wails and ceilings
of open shelters or under overhanging cliffs; but 70 of these 89
masks were found in smal~ niches, crevices or shelters too small or
otherwise unsuited for habitation; but adjoining or near very large
well used shelters. Some of the mask paintings were reached with
difficulty, and were copied while lying flat on the back, there being
hardly room enough to sit erect under the .Tocks on which they- were
painted. Others were in small recesses, difficult to reach, immediately above the main shelter in plain view of the living quarters.
Kachina-L~ke Figures
Associated with and closely related to the mask paintings are
about 20 drawings of kachina-like figures (Plate 6, No. 1-7).

A

majority of these figures present a profile view, and in several cases
it appears that they wear a mask.

Five of the figures presenting

a front view wear masks similar to the mask paintings.

One figure5

in white has large horns and an elaborate face in the solid mask
style.

The two figures shown at the top of Plate 5, are painted in

solid gray and outlined in white.

They are chiefly of interest be-

cause their head dress represents highly conventionalized animal
heads.

Two of the kaehina-like figures are phallic and one shows

the female organ (Plate 6, No. 1)--a representation extremely rare
among Texas pictographs.

"Blanket" Designs
Another style of design belonging to the Type Two pictures at
Hueco Tanks is found in considerable numbers at all parts of the
site. It consists of united series of geometrical patterns similar to
certain textile designs,6 usually in a rectangular shape. When
the pattern is inclosed by a border, as it sometimes is, the design
resembles an Indian blanket. An interesting detail is added at the
top of a number of these "blanket" designs in the form of a square,
circle or other shape, placed in the position of a head on square
shoulders (Plate 6, No. 8-12). In fact, in a few cases facial features are suggested, and in two or three cases there can be no doubt
that a head was intended. These "blanket" .designs like the mask
paintings were frequently found under low hanging rocks or outof-the-way places. One notable, exception was a large well smoked
shelter containing twelve such designs in white on its black ceiling.
Although these designs have little resemblance to the kachinalike figures, th~ colors used and the meticulous manner of painting
leaves little doubt that they were made by the same artists. This
is likewise true of a variety of small designs and animal and bird
pictures. Many serpent pictures also belong to Type Two; but the
very conspicuous serpent pictures on the ceilings of caves near the
principal water tanks are in the style and colors of the late historic
pictures---Type One.
In]ormation Lacking on New Mexico Pictographs
We have found mask paintings at no other site in Texas, and so
far as I know, they have never been reported by any one else outside of E1 Paso County. It would be interesting to know, therefore,
how far they extend north and west into New Mexico. Unfortunately,
little information is available about the pictographs in this district;
consequently, we must await further investigation for more knowledge of their distribution. However, since Renaud7 reports similar

mask drawings among the carved pictures of North Central New
Mexico, it appears that we may be describing a type of art which
centers somewhere in New Mexico and of which Hueco Tanks is
only an outpost.
Lacking material on pietographs in New Mexico with which to
compare the mask drawings, we turn to the modern Indian masks
themselves. For this comparison we have numerous reports8 containing detailed information and excellent reproductions of the
masks. Among these ,reports is J. W. Fewkes’ "Hopi Kachinas"
with more than 200 color drawings of kaehinas by native artists,
which has proven most valuable for this study.
Mask Paintings Resemble Kachina Masks
Only a brief examination of this literature is necessary to conclude that the Hueco Tanks mask paintings have only the most
general resemblance to the masks of the Eskimos, the Indians of
the Northwest, and those of Mexico and Central America; but with
the Pueblo kachina masks it is different. Although no single mask
painting is identical with a pa.rticular kachina mask, a general similarity is at once apparent.
Like the mask paintings, there a~e two types of kachina masks-more or less realistic faces and highly conventionalized faces. Some
of the kachina masks totally lack facial features, like many of the
mask paintings. There is a general similarity of the decorations
on the face--the lines on the cheeks, around the mouth, and on the
chin. Although most of the mask paintings show only the face, a
few have horns or other decorations on the head resembling many ~f
the kachina masks. Both the masks and paintings show examples
of pendants hanging from the ears.
Pueblo Emblems on Mask Paintings
One mask at Hueco Tanks (Plate 6, No. 7) and two in a near by
cave9 feature the terraced plaque, a common Pueblo symbol of the
rain cloud, used on fifteen of the kachina pictures by Fewkes, Five
8.

Tezas Archeologizal and Paleontological Society

other terrace designs not connected with masks were found at Hueco
Tanks. The crescent .rain symbol, another favorite emblem on Hopi
kachina masks, is found at Hueco Tanks but not as a part of a mask
painting. Several examples of the Pueblo star emblem also w~re
found at Hueco Tanks, two of which form the eyes of the well known
green and red mask (Plate 1, No. 2). This star emblem appears on
eight of the Fewkes kachina masks and in one case as the eyes.
In addition, to the similarity of the design elements on the paintings and the Pueblo masks, two of the colors---blue and green--used
on the paintings are extremely rare in Texas and are said to be common in the Pueblo district.
Pueblo Potsherds at Hueco Tanks

Still another connection between the mask paintings at Hueco
Tanks and the Pueblo Indians is the presence of Pueblo type potsherds1 o in large numbers at every part of the site. It must be admitted that there is no direct evidence that this pottery was made and
used by the Indians who painted the masks; but the distribution of
the potsherds is general over the entire square mile as are also the
Type Two pictographs, whereas the other picture types are confined
to certain limited districts. This fact certainly suggests the relationship.
Probable Purpose o] the Mask Paintings
A clue to the purpose of the mask paintings was furnished by
Fewkes11 in his description of Pueblo shrines in small caves and
shallow depressions. These shrines, usually close by the village
or house, contained pictures, dolls, idols, prayer sticks, and other
sacred objects. The mask paintings at Hueco Tanks, in their small
elevated or secret niches, may well be all that remains of ancient
shrines similar to those of the Pueblos.

Lacking stratigraphie evidence from the middens at Hueco Tanks,
and finding too few cases of over painted pictographs to work out
a time sequence of the cultures by that method, it would be unwise
to venture more than the general order of the main types as suggested above, this suggestion being based almost entirely on the
absence or presence of European objects among the pictures. But
there can be little doubt that the Type Two pictures were produced
by a culture c!osely related to or identical with the great Pueblos
of New Mexico. And the great number and wide distribution of
these pictures at the site indicates that it was occupied by this culture over a long period of time.
There is little doubt, also, that the great majority of the mask
paintings were made by this culture prior to historic time. But
certain of the more realistic outline masks are cruder than the average Type Two picture and may be the work of later Indians who
undertook to imitate the old mask paintings.
It must be admitted, in conclusion, that although these highly
specialized mask paintings have furnished an unusual opportunity
to compare pictographs with another form of Indian art, the kachina
masks of the Pueblos, we have at most only been able to show a
general relationship between the two. And judging from this study,
it sesms that we should not expect too much from such comparisons.

THE TYPE, DISTRIBUTION, AND
OCCURRENCE OF FLINT
GRAVERS IN TEXAS
By

WELTY WRIGI~T

Gravers are those artifacts made by the Indians for the purpose
of engraving bone, shell, horn, wood, and stone. They are, in most
cases, made of a material having a fine grain and a dense composition with a conchoidal fracture, such as flint, jasper, chert, chalcedony, agate, and similar materials. They consist of a short sharp
point, flat on the under surface and triangular in cross-section,
worked on a fortuitous flake, a scraper, or some other artifact.
As in most artifacts there was a development from a more rough
and primitive form. The first gravers were probably any hard
stone, with a natural break leaving a sharp point, suitable for engraving. These although roughly serving the purpose, were easily
blunted and probably unsuited for holding in the hand. We know
that the primitive engravers did use naturally formed gravers, because all through the Southwest we find quartz crystals whose naturally sharp ends have been blunted by use. From this beginning
the engravers learned through experience what materials and shapes
were best adapted to engraving, and then they learnd to further
improve upon natural gravers by making and shaping gravers to
suit their needs.
Study of gravers shows that three principal types can be distinguished. There are variations within the types, but basically they
fall within one of the three types.
Type I is designated simply as graver.
Type H is the chisel-graver.
Type IH is the graver usually made by reworking a former artifact.
For convenience, Type I will be divided into Type Ia and Type
Ib.

There is no appreciable difference between the gravers, the

difference being in the piece upon which the graver is worked.

82

Type Ia may be called the flake graver, as the graver point is
worked on a simple fortuitous flake. There is very little if any
workmanship exhibited other than around the graver point. The
maker simply took advantage of a conveniently shaped flake and
worked a graver point on it. Such flint flakes usually exhibit a dorsal ridge which resulted from the striking off of two large flakes.
This dorsal ridge usually tapers out to an edge, and the maker by
chipping out an indentation on each side of this dorsal ridge, where
it tapers, out to the edge, secured a short sharp point, triangular in
cross-section, consequently strong and not easily broken. The under
surface of Type Ia is always flat, the result of the striking off of
one single flake.
Type Ib is essentially the same as Type Ia as far as the graver
point is concerned. Type Ib is a combination tool. The most frequent combinations are of the graver-scraper type, both side and
snub-nosed scrapers being found in combination with the graver.
The graver point on Type Ia and on Type Ib is made in the same
way with the exception that where the ridge around which the point
is chipped on Type Ia is natural the one on Type Ib ba~ to be
flaked out, and as a result more work was necessary in making
Type Ib.
Type II is the chisel-graver. It is made in ~nuch the same manner
as Type I but the shape is altogether different. The chisel-graver
is easily recog-nized by its point, which is broader than Type I, and
usually straight across the end; sometimes, however, it is convex.
Another characteristic feature is the distinct bevel on the end of the
point, giving it a chisel-like appearance; too, the point is usually
longer than that on Type I.

The workmanship on this type is usually

better and the whole artifact has been given definite shape.
Type III, if it can be called a graver, is usually made by reworking fragments of former artifacts, such as knives, choppers,
arrow points, and occasionally one is found on what is apparently
a complete artifact.

This type does not come under the definition

of gravers as given at the beginning of this paper, but since this type
is .recognized as a graver in Central and East Texas it is well to
include a discussion of it. Future studies of gravers may either
confirm this type as a graver, or definitely prove it not to be.

III differs from the other types in that it lacks tho flat under surface. It has been worked on all faces and conforms more nearly
to the drill or borer in shape. The only thing which distinguishes
it from the drill or borer is that the point is too short to have been
of much value in making perforations of any sort. This type could
have served for engraving, and evidently did, for we find engraved
artifacts in the region in which they predominate and in which very
few true gravers are found. The difficulty wifla Type III is in
being able to distinguish between gravers and drills or borers.
The size of gravers varies within the various types. In Type Ia
the flakes on which graver points have been worked vary from
pieces three-eighths of an inch in diameter to pieces three inches in
diameter and one-half inch thick. The graver points are of the
same type, however, although one may be minute and have a needlelike point while the other is heavier and consequently much stronger.
The small specimens seem to predominate in the North Panhandle,
while the large specimens predominate in the Abilene region.
Type Ib has its variations in size also; .however, the variations
are not so great as in Type Ia.
Type II is the least numerous of all types and like Type Ia the
small specimens come from the North Panhandle, while the heavier
and larger specimens come from the Abilene region and East Texas.
Type III has a great variation in size.

In Central Texas, in the

burnt rock middens, large choppers or knives four inches long will
have a small sharp point on one end, and from the same region a
small reworked arrow point one-half inch long will have a similar
point.

The wide range in sizes allowed for a variety of uses.

The very small needle-like graver points would have served excellently for tattooing, a use which Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
suggests.1 The larger forms would have served for notching arrow
shafts, or cupping atlatl shafts, in the making of bone awls and
needles, and for engraving designs.
There has been some objection to calling these artifacts gravers
because they are not the same as those found in Europe. This argu1.

ment is weak because there are variations in the types of gravers
or burins found in Europe. Some of the gravers found here are
very similar to some of the European types, yet they are not recognized as such simply because they are not exactly like those in
Europe. We have artifacts in the Southwest which are definitely
engraved, and since there are no other tools which could serve the
purpose better than those designated as gravers, why not accept the
fact that, though they are not European in type, they are still
gravers ?
Evidence seems to point to the fact that gravers have practically
covered the known span of man’s existence in America. They, or
evidence of their use, have been found with some of the supposedly
most ancient cultures in the Southwest. Its distribution seen~ to be
limited to the western portion of the United States and Canada.
Mr. Porter Montgomery of Dalhart, Texas, has sixty-two gravers
which he has collected in Dallam and Hartley Courtty, Texas, and
Texas County, Oklahoma. Nearly all of these specimens have
come from blow-out sites in what were once Pleistocene lake beds.
They are found on the surface with Folsom and Yuma artifacts and
fossil bones of the horse, camel, elephant, bison, and several species
of unidentified fresh water shells. There are forty-four of Type Ia,
fourteen of Type Ib, three of Type II, and one of Type III, a reworked Folsom point.
Dr. Cyrus N. Ray of Abilene, Texas, has the most extensive collection of artifacts from that region which has a wealth of archeological sites. Dr. Ray has made an extensive study of the Abilene region and its artifacts during the last twelve years. Dr. Ray’s work
has been mostly of a reconnaissance nature, and no major excavation work has been done yet, although the Works Progress Administration has recently begun such an excavation under the sponsorship of Texas Technological College. The report when published
should give us valuable information with regard to the stratigraphy
of the various cultures found in that region.
In a letter to the writer, Dr. Ray has the following to say conPlate 7
Shows three main types of Texas flint gravers.

Type, Distrib~t~on and Occurrences of Flint Gravers

cerning gravers. "The flint gravers are mainly found here in the
Clear Fork Culture. The artifacts of that culture are occasionally
found on old eroded surfaces with Folsorn points.
"A few long narrow beautifully made scrapers of s~nall size have
graver points at the ends opposite to the cutting ends.

These and a

type of side scraper having a small sharp graver in the center are
quite likely of a later type.

"The European types of gravers found with the Clear Fork Culture are: 1, Beak shaped points on flint flakes; 2, small narrow
chisel points on flakes; and 3, multiple points on flakes; sometimes
two and infrequently more points on one flake."
In an article entitled, "~m Pottery Complex Artifacts of the
Abilene Region," published in the Texas .4rcheological and Paleontological Society Bulletin, Vol. 7, 1935, Dr. Ray describes tile combination graver-~raper. "In Site No. 17 a distinctive form of very
small, finely flaked, narrow keel-backed scraper occurs. Many of
these have the ends opposite to the round cutting ends brought to
sharp points, so that such a tool could be used as a scraper ou one
end, and as a graver on the other."
Gravers of the Clear Fork Culture are found in the Abilene region
along what were evidently small streams, now dry, and apparently
dry for a long period of time. The gravers and other Clear Fork
artifacts are eroded from several feet below the surface in old mountain side catnpsites and from gravel terrace deposits along dry
branches of creeks. The~ specimens are deeply patinated and very
similar to paleolithic types of Europe.~
Dr. Ray has sixty gravers of the Clear Fork type, which are heavily patinated.

From Site No. 17 he has thirty-one of the combina-

tion graver-scraper type, some of which are patinated.

With a skeleton of the Abilene Man type, three bone tubes, each
about three inches long, were found. These had an incised design
on them showing the use of a graver.3 However, Dr. Ray has never

found any of the Clear Fork Cuhure artifacts with burials of the
Abilene Man and the Abilene points are regarded as much older
than the Clear Fork.
In the Abilene region we appear to have gravers associated with
some of the oldest cultures, regarded by some authorities a~ the
ohtest cultures yet found in A~nerica.

Andrews County has yielded four gravers, three of Type Ib now
in Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona, and one of Type III which is in the
collection of Mr. W. C. Fritz of Midland, Texas.
Mr. Powell Goodwin submitted data on seven gravers from Archer County.

Of five from a surface site on Onion Creek, two are

of Type Ia, two of Type Ib, and one of Type III.

From a site on

the South Fork of the Little Wichita two gravers of Type la were’
found.
From Bandera County the University of Texas has two gravers.
One, a large tanged knife or spear point measuring three and oneball inches by one and three-fourths inches was found fifty-three
inches below the surface on the J. W. Edwards farm. The other
specimen measuring two and one-half inches by one and fiveeighths inches, from the same site, twenty inches below the surface.z~

Mr. A. E. Anderson of Brownsville reports that in his collection
from Cameron County he has an excellent graver of Type Ia; a
thin flake about one inch square with ma excellent point worked in
the middle of one side. He also reports other flakes suitable for
gravers, but exhibiting no type characteristics.
From Cass County there are four gravers of Type III. Two
are small and were found at depths of eight and eleven ind~es on
the Clements Brot h er ’s farm. Another, apparently a reworked portion of an arrow point, was found three and one-half inches below the
surface on the E. A. Coker farm. The fourth was found on the
Goode Hunt farm.
Cherokee County has one graver of Type Ib which was found

twenty inches below the surface in site ET-221. It is a combination side scraper-graver which is very well made.
Clay Count~ is represented by one graver of Type Ia which was
reported by Mr. D. L. Bennett of Henrietta, Texas.
The University of Texas also has one of Tye Ill, a reworkcd point
or knife. One of the Type la specimens is unusnal in that the
point is the longest seen by the writer while making this study. The
point is five-eighths inch long, but has the flat under surface and
beveled edges characteristic of the graver point. It could be a
transitional form between the graver and the drill, as some anthorities seem to think that the drill or awl had its beginning in
the short graver points.5
From d~c Willis Cutp farm, Coryell County, there are two gravers
of Type III. One is a small roughly flaked knife with a sharp
point on each end; the other is a large chopper with a point on
one end.

Type Ia specimen has two point.s, one of which is very similar to that
described frown Comanche County in that the point is unusually
long. It could be another transition form, but shows no evidence
of having been used in a boring or drilling motion, which certainly
would have sheared the thin edges. Just behind the base of the long
point is a typical graver.
From the P. G. Hightower farm in Franklin County there is one
specimen of Type IlL It is a reworked arrow point, and came from
a depth of twenty-two inches.
From the Espirita Santo Mission site in Goliad County there are
three gravers of Type III. They were found at depths of twentyone and thirty-two inches. The depth of the third is not known.
Mr. Floyd Seaman of Plainview, Hale County, Texas, has sixteen
gravers which he has found in surface sites where occasional Folsom
and Yuma artifacts are found. Four are of Type Ia, ten are of
Type Ib, one is of Type II, and one is of Type III.
Henderson County has yielded one graver of Type III from the
De Rossett farm three and one-half miles northeast of Frankston.
The farm of Mrs. H. L. Culpepper in Hopkins County yielded
one graver of Type III from a depth of seventeen inches.
Two gravers of Type la from Hutchinson County are in the Gila
Pueblo collection, Globe, Arizona.
From the Works Progress Administration excavation, sponsored
by Texas Technological College, at the Hedge site in Jones County
there is one graver of Type Ia. It is the only graver from the
Abilene region on which there is a definite stratification. It was
found in the fourth level of occupation from the top at a depth of
eighteen feet and eight inches. It was stratified with a bifurcated
asymmetrical projectile point. It is possibly related to the lowest
level of the Central Texas burnt rock middens.6

Lubbock County has yielded one graver of Type Ia from a site
about three and one-half miles northwest of the town of Lubbock.

In Morris County one graver of Type III has been found on the
R. L. Cason farm at a depth of fourteen inches.
Mr. Temple Rominger has in his collection a graver of Type Ib
trom Bitter Creek in Nolan County. It is a thick side scraper with
a graver worked on one end.
From the C. W. Ellis farm in Polk County the University of
Texas has three gravers of Type III. One is a reworked arrow point
and the other two are reworked fragments of knives.
From Presidio County there is one graver of Type III.

From Webb Island, Nueces County, Texas, there is one graver
of Type IIl. Another very unusual form is a graver of Type II
which is made of shell. It has all the characteristics of a graver of
Type II made from flint. Mr. A. T. Jackson has suggested that
since there is a scarcity of flint on the island and there is some
inci~d pottery, it would have ~rved very well for incising plastic
pottery.
San Patricio County has one recorded graver of Type lb, a nicely
worked thin scraper with a graver worked on one end.
From Fall Creek, Site 2, Midden 1 in San Saba County there is
one graver of Type III.
Mr. Floyd Seaman has iu his collection one graver of Type Ia
from the Poelake farm in Swisher County.
In the Gila Pueblo collection there is one graver from Terrell
County. It is of Type Ib and exhibits fair workmanship.
From Titus County there are three gravers. One a knife with a
graver on one end, was found on the surface on the Farrar Brother’s
farm. Another of Type III was found on the W. A. Ford site, and

Texas Archeological and Paleo~to!ogical Society

42

the third is a knife with a graver at one end from the Thomas B.
Ca]dwell plantation, and was found at a depth of fifteen inches.

Travis County has yielded several gravers, all of Type III except
one which is doubtfully Type II. The Type II specimen is in all
probability a chisel as the point is five-sixteenths inch wide. It
came from a depth of forty-two inches on the Sid W. Stewart place.
Two other specimens of Type III come from this same site. From the
Percy Hancock place, Site 8, Mound 2, a graver of Type III found
at a depth of twenty-one inches has been reported. Two specimens
of Type III came from the J. H. Hudson place, about three and
one-half miles northeast of Tcck and one-half nfile west of the
river. From the A. J. Trammell farm in Travis County there is one
graver of Type III found thirty-two inches below the surface. There
is also one graver of Type Ib from Williamson County.
At a site four and one-half miles east of Quitman, Wood County,
Texas, a graver of Type III was found on the surface.
Mr. A. T. Jackson reports a graver, Type III, from the recently
excavated Morhiss Mound, about ~ven miles southeast of Victoria
on the east side of dm Guadalupe River, Victoria County, Texas.
It is apparently part of a broken knife which had a graver on one
end. It was found at a depth of eighty inches.
From Site NT-5, M. D. Harrell farm, Junction of the Clear Fork
and Salt Fork of the Brazos River, one mile north of South Bend,
Young County, Texas, Mr. Jackson reports two gravers of Type
III.

One, found at a depth of fourteen inches, has three graver

points on it, two of which could have been used for engraving
parallel lines or a circle. The other has only one point, and was
found at a depth of twenty-two inches. Mr. Powell Goodwin reports three gravers, one each of Types Ia, Ib, and IIl, from a she
on the Brazos River near New Castle, Young County. He also has
one each of Type Ia and III from a site about twelve miles up the
Brazos from New Castle.

From Hansford County, Texas, Mr. Vincent Dale of Guymon,
Oklahoma, has one graver of Type lb.
Mr. J. Charles Kelley reports a number of gravers from the Big
Bend Area, but does not state from which counties they come. These

Type, Di~ibu$ion and Occu~’ences of Ftin$ Gravers

43

specimens have been tentatively dated at 4,000 B. C. in the lowest
level and 1700 A. D. in the upper level.
The distribution of gravers outside of Texas is as follows:
Mr. Vincent Dale of Guymon, Oklahoma, has ten gravers of Type
Ia, two of Type Ib, four of Type II, and three of Type III, from
Texas County, Okla. From a site in Cimmaron County, Oklahoma,
he has one of Type Ia. All are from surface sites.
Mr. David A. Baerreis of the University of Oklahoma reports two
gravers from Hopewellian sites, one at the mouth of Honey Creek
in Delaware County and the other from a site near the mouth of
the creek.. Both are of Type IIL
From New Mexico there is a record of two sites where gravers
have been found. Mr. E. B. Howard of the University of Pennsylvania reports at least twenty gravers from the Clovis site near
Clovis, New Mexico. The horizon from which they come is Folsom
and Yuma.
Mr. Frank C. Hibben, Curator of the Museum of Anthropology
of the University of New Mexico, reports a number of gravers from
Sandia Cave near Albuquerque, New Mexico, and says the association with Folsom artifacts there is very definite.
From Colorado there is the report of Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
on the Lindenmeier site near the Wyoming line.

Here again there

is definite association of the graver with the Folsom Culture. In
all probability gravers have been found in other parts of Colorado
as Folsom and Yuma artifacts have come from a number of sites in
the state.
Mr. W. D. Strong reports some seventy-seven gravers from Signal
Butte, Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. These are stratified in three
levels and are very similar to those from the Lindenmeier site in
Colorado.

From Carbon County, Wyoming, two gravers of Type III, and
fl’om Sweetwater County, four of Type III, have been reported. All
are reworked arrow points. There are also, two gravers of Type
Ib from Sweetwater County. All the gravers from Wyoming were
~eported by Mr. J. G. Ata,’ood of Rawlings, Wyoming, who says he

finds a number of Folsom and Yuma artifacts in the same region.
All are surface finds.
From California we have the report of the Campbells on the Lake
.Mohave site which lies between Soda Lake and Silver Lake some
sixty-five miles northeast of Barstow, Califoria. Some forty gravers
of Type Ib have been reported from this site.
In the January, ]939, issue of American Antiquity pages 277 to
279, Mr. E. B. Howard reports on some Folsom and Yuma artifacts
~ound in the region around Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Among

the arti~[acts found are gravers, three of which are illustrated. They
are very similar to those from the Clovis and Lindenmeier sites.
Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., says that gravers are found in material from along the Columbia River, and in Alaska.
localities they semn to be much later than Folsom.7

In those

The distribution of the graver extends over much of the western
portion of the United States and into Canada and Alaska. We find
gravers in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska,
Wyoming, and California.

The lack of information from other states

does. not necessarily mean that gravers do not exist there, but (hat
they may have been overlooked or not reported. In fact, it is reasonable to assmne that gravers are present in Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, Kansas, and Montana, since they lie between states iu which
gravers have been found.

The graver has a fairly wide distribution

and seemingly covers the known vertical range of man in the Southwest.

The graver is definitely associated with artifacts which exhibit the
greatest degree of perfection in flint chipping found in the New
World.

This would seem to indicate the development of an artistic

sense, especially of proportion and symmetry. ]t is logical to
sume that the gravers found with these cultures were. used for engraving.

We kuow that European aborigines were familiar with

engraving, and although we had aborigines in the Southwest who
equaled or even surpassed them in the art of chipping and working
with flint, they still are not given credit, by some, with having
knowledge of the art o[ engraving. It is true that we have very few
examples of m~graving, but as ~urther excavation is completed
the Southwest more will undoubtedly be discovered.
The graver was evidently not in rise among the iPueblo Indians of
the Southwest. The only reference, with which the writer is familiar, made to a graver in a Pueblu site is in Dr. A. V. Kidder’s,
Arti]acts oJ Pecos, in which he illustrates and describes one artifact
which he says could probably have been used as a graver, though it
more nearly resembles dm drill or awl.

It is hoped that this paper will have the same effect as the one

Type, D~,v$.ribu~io~n and Occur’fences of Flin~ Gravers

47

published by Dr. J. T. Patterson, of the University of Texas, on
The Corner-Tang Flint .4rti]a.cts o] Texas, in arousing interest in,
and in the securing of additional data on the graver. The cornertang artifacts were relatively unknown until Dr. Patterson published
his paper. Immediately upon its publication additional information
as to distribution and occurrence began to pour in, making it necessary to publish a supplementary paper.
Further study will undoubtedly add more knowledge as to types,
horizons, and distribution of the graver. It is hoped that this
paper will stimulate interest in the graver and serve as an incentive
for further and more comprehensive study.

HOUSE TYPES AMONG THE CADDO
INDIANS
Bx¢ CLARE.BICE H. W~BS
Considerable historical and archaeological evidence exists concerning dwellings of the various Caddoan tribes, but very little of
this relates to the Kadohadacho or Caddo proper in the region of
their historic confederation on Red River in northwest Louisiana
and southwest Arkansas.
The simplest Caddoan house type, which was frequently described
by French and Spanish travelers of tile 16th and 17th centuries,
was the grass lodge, which persisted among the Wiehltas up to
within recent years. Fletcher (1) states that in making these beehive shaped houses, a circle was drawn on the ground, along which
a number of crotched posts were set, beams being laid across the
crotches. Clo~ly-placed poles were leaned inward across the beams,
the tops drawn together and tied, and willow rods laced across them.
A close thatch of grass was laid and bound down with similar rods.
Surmounting the peak of the house were two rods crossed to indicate
the cardinal points.

For ceremonial houses, four openings or doors

were left on the sides corresponding to the cardinal points; for the
ordinary dwellings, openings on the east and west sides were used
in the mornings and afternoons, respectively.

Joutel (2) described similar dwellings among the Cenis and the
A~onis, stating that their cabins were in groups of seven to fifteen,
separated by their fields. Houses of the Cenis were large, sometimes
60 feet in diameter, accommodating eight to ten families.
Professor Bolton (3), in "Texas of the Middle Eighteenth Century," published a drawing of a Caddo village near Texarkana, in
1691, showing beehive-shaped grass houses as described above,
also a second type, which had grass thatched roofs and mud-plastered
wails. Similar wattle-and-daub construction of round and oval
dwellings is seen in a photograph of a Caddo village by Soule
(1868-72) which is reproduced by courtesy of the Smithsonian
Institution (Plate 8, No. 1). Members of the tribe are seated beneath a platform of the type used to dry the corn.
A third type of house, u~d by the Pawnees and other Caddoan

tribes of the Plains area, was the earth lodge. Fletcher (1) states
that after digging a circular excavation of 2 to 4 feet, a grassthatched structure was built, using two circles of supporting posts,
then covered with sod. A single entrance on the east side, also sod
covered, projected 6 to 10 feet from the wall. Skin curtains closed
the entrance way and, during the winter season, were also placed
around the inner circle of supporting posts, making a smaller room
around the fire.
Inside arrangements of the lodges have been described by Joutel
(2), Father Manzanet (4) and others.

The floors were smoothed

and hardened; in the center a small excavation accommodated a
fire, the smoke from which escaped through a small hole in the
roof.

Beds or couches were placed around the walls, separated by partitions of buffalo skins, which also served for blankets. Large
shelves above the door and on the opposite side of the lodge held
hampers and baskets of cane or bark, in which shelled corn, nuts,
beans, acorns, and other foods were stored. Pottery and other household utensils were also placed on these platforms or shelves.
Larger ceremonial structures were made iu similar fashions. Jackson (5), who excavated a circular house floor in the Asinai area
which evidently represented one of the ceremonial fire-temples,
quotes the description by Father Manzanet of the house of the Governor of the Nabedache, a large grass lodge as described above.
In the center of the house was a fire which was never extinguished
and from which the fires of all the suri’ounding households were
kindled.

Similar fire houses were stated to be at the Neches and

among the Nacogdoches and Nasonis.
To the east of the Caddo area, Swanton (6) states that the "fire
temple" was a characteristic feature of lower Mississippi culture.
The Natchez and Taensas built oval temples, with vertical wails of
wattle-work, peaked roofs covered with cane mats and surmounted
by carved figures of three birds. Inside each temple, a fire was
kept burning continuously by elders of the tribe, appointed for this

specific duty.

Dry hickory and oak logs were used and only the

ends of the logs were lighted, to keep the fire from blazing too
brightly.
Farther afield, the council houses of the Cherokees and Creeks
were very large, "capableof accommodating several hundred people," according to Bartram (7).

A large central post was sur-

rounded by two or three circular rows of upright posts, the roof
covered with bark layers, occasionally mud coated.

The Chickasaws

and possibly the Choctaws of Mississippi were stated to have built
earth lodges similar to those of the Pawnee.

Turning to archeological evidence, besides the description of the
east Texas fire-site by Jackson, the most pertinent is that of Harrington (8), who excavated many sites between the Red and
Ouachita rivers in southwest Arkansas, where the preponderance
of artifacts was Caddoan. In some thirty instances, at nine sites,
he mentioned either floor levels in mounds, with post molds, fire
places or charred timbers; or floors on the ground level, covered
with a small mound of earth, one to three feet high. There seemed
to be little uniformity of detail, the shapes being square, oval,
round, rectangular and square or rectangular with rounded corners; sizes varied from 16 feet square to 33 feet in diameter; fire
pits were central, eccentric or sometimes lacking. Of the five structures where entrances were identified, one each faced east, west,
southeast and southwest, while the fifth had entrances to both southeast and southwest. In the six instances where post molds were described, only a single row or circle was found.
Charred timbers, cane, grass and wattle-work were found in many
instances, covered with one to five feet of sand or clay, indicating a
widespread custom of burning the houses on deserting them. Harrington apparently considered all of these structures to be the remains of earth lodges, covered with earth from the collapsed house,
with additionaI earth used in some instances to build the mound
higher. It is significant that his assistant, Alanson Skinner, (9~
described the one house which he excavated as a burned grass lodge,
although its details were not greatly different from others described
by Harrington.

House I, Belcher Mound Site
During the past four years, Mr. Monroe Dodd and the author,
with the assistance of various friends, have conducted excavations
in a small mound site on a lateral stream in the Red River Valley
near Belcher, located twenty miles north of Shreveport, in Caddo
Parish. A complete report is being prepared for publication and
those interested in detailed features are referred to this report. For
the purpose of the present description of house types, it suffices
to note that we have uncovered four habitation levels in Mound B,
with a structure on each level, immediately superimposed and separated by about two feet of sand fill between each level, with a fifth
structure on the surface immediately adjoining Mound B: No trade
objects have been found and pottery types all fall within the Caddo
classification as given by Ford (10).
Houses 1 to 4 occurred in the. succeeding levels of Mound B and
are numbered from the surface downward. The floor of House 1
lay under an 8 to 12 inch layer of soil, the lower 4 to 6 inches of
which was black humus containing many sherds, small segments of
charred timbers and cane, masses of baked clay, mud-dauber nests
and other debris. This refuse material was especially abundant on
the slopes of the small mound and around the outer circle of post
molds. The structure outline was incomplete, as the western half
had been disturbed by deep plowing. The eastern half (Plate 8,
No. 2), was a semicircle of post molds, 15 feet in radius, the molds
being 6 to 9 inches in diameter, 1 1-2 feet in depth and spaced at
intervals of approximately 2 feet. Grouped post molds and heavy
masses of burned clay in the northeast segment suggested this point
as the entrance. No projecting post molds were found.
A second circle of grouped post molds, most of which contained
charred segments of cypress posts, was found 6 to 7 feet within the
outer circIe.

These posts were 7 to 10 inches in diameter, larger

than the outer molds, and evidently served as roof supports.

In the center of the structure there was a bed of extremely white
a~es, 2 by 2 1-2 feet in size and nearly a foot in depth. It was de-

void of sherds or animal bones, although these occurred in abundance around a smaller ash bed which lay just outside the outer
circle of post molds. An intact small pottery jar and fragments of
a pipe lay near this outside fire bed.
At two points on the house floor (Plate 8, No. 2) heavy masses of
pottery sherds lay together. Four vessels, including two large olla
types, were reconstructed from one of these sherd masses. The
second mass was found to be a single large jar, crushed in situ, with
an inverted and unbroken bowl nearby. Around these were charred
hickory nuts. The positions of these objects suggests that they
fell or were crushed when the lodge burned.
House H, Belcher Mound B
Approximately 2 1-2 feet below floor 1, separated by a practically
sterile sand fill, lay a level floor of packed white sand, which could
be perfectly delineated because of the charred materials which had
fallen on it. The absence of a humus layer indicated that the building had not been used very long before it was burned. Almost immediately underlying the semicircle of House 1 was a circle of post
molds (Plate 9, No. 1) which could be completed for its entire circumference. The circle was mathematically exact, no mold varying more than 6 inches from a perfect circle, 30 feet in diameter.
Parallel lines of post molds, 3 feet in width, formed an entrance
way (Plate 10, No. 1) which projected 7 feet from the northeast segment of the circle. Seven posts were used on each side of the entrance way. A large or double mold marked the point where the
entrance joined the outer wall of the structure. The extra mold
inside the doorway, with the inset terminal mold on ~e north line,
may represent posts to support a bench, as Skinner (9) suggested
of a similar occurrence in the Flower’s mound structure; or, possibly, supports for doors. It is mentioned of the Natchez ceremonial
structures, that entrances were kept carefully closed to prevent children from entering these lodges.
The floor of the entrance way was of hard packed sand, which
e~-tended inside the lodge toward the central fire. In the middle of
the entrance there was a 10 inch square bed of white ash, (Plate
10, No. 1) possibly the result of some ceremony related to entering
~)r leaving the lodge.

58

Texas Archcological and Paleontological Society

An inner circle of molds (Plate 9, No. 1) was spaced as in House
1, apparently 8 groups which were 5 to 8 feet apart. Strong (11)
reports 4 to 8 central posts in the Pawnee lodges, stating that their
number and location had ceremonial significance.

Some of the

groups in House 2 were destroyed by burial pits, but it is to be
noted that the north and south groups are exactly on the compass
line through the center of the structure. Shallow cache pits, containing only pottery sherds, surrounded several of these grouped
molds. Over and around this inner circle of post molds lay masses
of burned clay which showed impressions of poles, sticks and grass.
Many had one side quite smooth, often greenish in color, as though
covered with a green wash. The abundance of this material around
the inner circle of molds suggests a wall or partition dividing the
inner room from the outer portion of the building. Over the outer
portion of floor, between the two circles of posts, heavy masses of
charred materials lay on the floor--a layer of grass usually next the
house floor, then a layer of split cane, then poles and sticks. This
probably was roof material and must have inverted in falling, as
masses broke loose from the burning structure, otherwise the relative
position of the materials is difficult to understand. It is unlikely
that the roof was sod covered, since this sod would have fallen between the house floor and the grass-cane layers when they inverted.
Several inset post molds between the two circles suggest seats,
bunks or partitions.
In the exact center of the structure there was a large .post mold,
12 inches in diameter and 18 inches deep, partially surrounded and
covered by an oval shaped bed of very white ash (Plate 10, No. 2),
identical with that of House 1. In both instances the ash was so
white and free of charcoal or burned materials as to have the appearance of lime.

It is probable that carefully selected ash or oak wood

was used and the fires carefully tended, as reported of the Natchez.
The large post must have been temporary, such as those used by the
Asinai in constructing their lodges, otherwise the fire would not
have been built on this spot.

Six large masses of sherds lay on the floor, from which a dozen
nearly complete vessels were assembled. Sherds of a single vessel
were often found in three or four separate heaps and, after these
vessels were con~pleted, comparatively few sherds remained. These
facts suggest that the vessels were broken shortly before destruction
of the building and were thrown or swept into the separate heaps.
At, one place in the back half of the house, sherds of two entire vessels were found with fragments of charred basketry and charred
seeds. In other places a small pipe and a water bottle, both intact,
lay on the floor.
The floor was cut through by eight burial pits which started from
the fill between floors 1 and 2. Details will be found in the complete report. The pottery found in these burials, as well as the
sherds on House floors 1 and 2, was of the highly developed Caddo
type.
House 111, Belcher Mound B
The flat summit of a small circular mound was found two feet
beneath the floor of House 2. The mound was covered in its entirety with a cap of charcoal-streaked red clay, about 1 foot in
thickness. Two circles of post molds were found (Plate 10, No. 3),
the inner circle of 5 to 8 inch molds, about 2 feet in depth, forming
an irregular oval, 13 by 15 feet in diameters. The outer circle of
smaller molds, 3 to 4 inches in diameter and only 1 foot in depth,
slanted slightly inward. It was 20 by 22 feet in diameter, and both
circles were interrupted by the second floor burial pits, which apparently cut through the entrance way on the northeast side. The
absence of charred materials or post suggests that the building may
not have been burned, as were the other structures. Internal post
molds were irregularly placed. A small ash bed, surrounded
~erds and animal bones, lay between the circles of molds on the
south side. A moderate number of sherds was found on the floor
and the slope of the small mound.
House IV, Belcher Mound B
The mound described above was found to overlie the remains of
a burned structure (Plate 11), which had been built on the original
ground surface, 3 feet under House floor 3 and 8 feet beneath the
summit of Mound B. This surface was of clay, stained dark with

62

humus. House 4 wreckage consisted of heavy masses of baked clay
daub over the central areas of the house; charred timbers, split cane
and grass over the outer portions. In a straight line along each
wall, charred timbers projected upward 1 to 1 1-2 feet into the
covering sand. Their molds extended do~ into and through wall
trenches, for a total depth of 21/~ feet (Plate 12, No. 2). The trenches,
8 to 10 inches wide and 18 inches deep, extended the length of each
wall, failing to meet at the corners by about 3 feet, this space being
filled in by three post molds, 4 to 6 inches in diameter, to produce
a rounded corner. Red clay to the height of one foot was banked
against the outside of each wall. The structure was 24 feet wide, 20
feet 8 inches in length (Plate 12, No. 1).
The front wall had two trenches with a 3 foot opening in the
center, from which projected a 7 foot long entrance, similar to that
of House 2. The entrance floo~ had been built up one foot to ’form
a ramp or incline, declining to floor level within the structure. Atop
the ramp, midway of the entrance, was a small white ash bed
(Plate 11), identical in size and relative position to that of the
House 2 entrance. Projecting laterally from the ends of the doorway were one foot high walls of clay (Plate 11), paralleling the
front wall of the structure. Outside of the right wall, a smooth,
crescentic bank of clay, 2 feet high, 8 to 9 feet long and 3 to 4 feet
wide, faced toward the southeast.
The structure contained two large ash beds. Near the center of
the house, a shallow basin of yellow clay, 3 to 3 1-2 feet in diameter,
contained very white ashes. In the northwest corner of the structure, there was a larger ash bed with many sherds and deer bones.
Spaced on opposite sides of this fire bed were four post molds,
probably representing cooking supports.
By the opposite (south) wall of the house, 4 post molds formed
a 4 1-2 foot square, probably a platform of some type. Just within
the doorway, closely placed molds formed an irregular circle, but
these started beneath the clay ramp and may have represented some
earlier structure. A large clay pipe of modified platform type lay
in the wreckage of the back wall.
Two large burial pits started just beneath the clay cap of House
floor 3, Pit 11 cutting through and six feet below House floor 4,

PLATE 11

House Types Among the Caddo Indians

65

Pit 12 extending just to this floor. The pottery, although Caddoan
in type, differed from that of the first and second levels, being
scanty in amount, cruder in manufacture and plainer in ornamentation.
House V, Belcher She

About 15 feet northwest of Mound B, another circle of post molds
was discovered (Plate 13, No. 1). The center of this structure lay
under 6 inches of topsoil and humus; the periphery sloped downward slightly and, immediately beyond the circle of post molds,
the black humus layer dipped downward for 2 feet, forming a
small house mound (Plate 12, No. 3).
The outer circle was 36 to 37 feet in diameter, of 6 to 8 inches
molds, spaced 2 to 2 1-2 feet apart. The western segment of the
house had washed into the small stream. The entrance was in the
northeast segment, formed by a number of grouped posts on each
side of a steep ramp, in the center of which was a large mold filled
with very black loose charcoal and ash. No projecting entrance way
was found.
An inner circle of grouped post molds resembled those of Houses
1 and 2. Many irregular molds occurred. Two small cache pits,
1 1-2 to 2 feet in diameter, contained sherds, shells, bones and baked
clay material. Several disturbances indicated burial pits, but these
have not been investigated.
A single ashbed was found in the exact center of the structure,
about 2 feet in diameter and surrounded by scattered sherds. On
the house floor and in the covering humus were a moderate number
of sherds, 8 to 10 diminutive arrow points, 2 ear ornaments, several
whetstones, fragments of flaked stones, numerous flakes, a few
pieces of charred timbers and moderate amounts of baked clay daub
material. Sherds and daub material were more abundant in the
post molds and down the slopes of the house mound.
House I, Greer Site, Gibslalut
About 3 miles east of Gibsland, Bienville Parish, Louisiana, a
mixed Coles Creek-Caddo site lies along Black Bayou, on the Ed
Greet farm. In 1938 a burial was struck by the plow, and with the
assistance of Mr. Greet, we uncovered the skeleton, finding no arti-

66

facts in association.

We noticed a layer of very white sand and on

following this, uncovered numerous molds (Plate 13, No. 2), which
probably represent two separate structures.

The floor was formed

by a layer of firm white and yellow sand under about 8 inches of
cultivated soil. Post molds were 5 to 12 inches in size, I to 1 1-2 feet
in depth, containing dark humus and occasional sherds. No charred materials were found.

A definite entrance way projected from the southeast side of the
structure, near the burial, arid a possible entrance way was on the,
northeast side. Three fire beds and three small cache pits were
found, the cache pits containing sherds, shells and animal bones.
No other artifacts were discovered.
Fire Pit A was large, 5 by 4 feet, containing a thick layer of very
black ash and humus, with a few sherds. Opposed post molds suggested cooking supports. We were amazed, after removing two feet
of the black ash, to break through into a cache pit beneath the fire
bed which had been dug into the hard clay for a depth of about 4
feet, the pit was 2 1-2 feet in diameter. It contained a number of
Caddo sherds, but no whole artifacts. This is the first deep cache
pit of the Nebraska type (11) found in this area, so far as we know.
We conclude that this structure is Caddoan, rather than the earlier
Coles Creek, because the sherds found on the floor, in the pits and
post molds were almost exclusively Caddoan in type.
Discussion
Mound B a[ Belcher affords interesting evidence of temporal
~quence in house types. The first people who lived here built a
rectangular house on the level ground, using the trenching technic
for placement of the wall posts, then covering the house with poles,
split cane mats and sedge grass. The trenching technic, a method
not previously found in this area, was reported for the circular
structures at Deasonville, Mississippi, by Collins (12). It was also
described by Cole and Deuel (13) for rectangular.houses of the
Middle Mississippi phase in Fulton County, Illinois. Numerous

69

rectangular structures at various sites in the Norris Basin of Eastern
Tennessee, as described by Webb (14), exhibited the trenching
technic.

They also showed centrally placed ceremonial ash beds

in prepared ciay basins, and construction of cane, grass and wattleand-daub, these materials being preserved by incomplete burning.
House 4 differed from the Norris basin structures in having a projecting doorway and having the burial pits cut through the fallen
debris. Horizontal log molds found in the trenches of the Norris
Basin structures and the clay seats or pedestals inside these structures were lacking in House 4 at Belcher. However, the 2-foot-high,
crescentic ridge of clay in front of House 4 may have served as a
seat.
Incompleteness of data allows us to draw few conclusions from
the small structure (House 3) which surmounted the first small
mound heaped over the remains of House 4. It lacked a centrally
placed firebed and is the only structure found at Belcher which
showed no evidence of burning. The unique feature of this floor
is the complete capping over of the small mound with the layer of
red clay before construction of House 3.
The people who built Houses 1, 2 and 5 had the culture traits of
the later Caddos, who had developed a high degree of proficiency
in pottery making. It is probable that they were intrusive into this
area, displacing at Belcher the crude pottery makers of floor levels
3 and 4. It is interesting to note, as we have discussed in our complete report, that the simpler incised straight line type of Caddo
pottery is widespread over this area, the highly developed engraved
curved line pottery complex appearing much less frequently. Dickinson and Lemley (15) in Arkansas and Goldschmidt (16) in East
Texas, present evidence of this same intrusion of engraved, curvedline Caddo wares into an indigenous complex of inferior pottery
~-ith incised designs.
These later Caddos built circular structures using an outer circle
of grouped posts for roof supports, with coverings of poles, stakes,
split cane and grass. Wattle.and-daub, often plastered with a green
slip (Skinner (9) also found green coloration of the clay plastering) was used for the walls. The central fire bed, the ash bed of
the doorway and the lack of cooking fires in Houses 1 and 2 suggest

70

Tex~s Archeologica. l a~d Paleontological Society

that they were ceremonial structures, identical with the "eternal
fire" lodges of the Asinai and Natchez.
The constructional features mentioned above are quite similar
to the structures of the historic Pawnees, Cherokees and Creeks,
previously described. There is no evidence of excavated floors
such as the earth lodges of the Pawnees had, but the projecting
doorway is quite similar in type.

The cache pit of ttouse 1 on the,

Greer site suggests Plains affinities.
The question of earth lodges among the southern Caddo tribes
is an interesting one.

The Chickasaws and Choctaws among south-

ern tribes were stated to have built earth lodges, similar to the
Pawnees of the midwest. Webb (14) concluded that the square
structures excavated in the Norris Basin area gave evidence of having had sod covered roofs, which on collapse of the burning buildings, covered over and preserved the charred materials.

Harrington

(8) reached similar conclusions of the Caddo structures in southern
Arkansas, and Fowke (17) attributed to collapsed Caddo earth
lodges the thousands of low mound-like elevations seen over a wide
area of Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, eastern Oklahoma and East
Texas.
With respect to these mound-like elevations, Fowke’s conclusions
were based on incomplete observations.

Hundreds of them in North

Louisiana have been cut through during road construction, and none
of those examined by local geologists or ourselves show any evidence of habitation.

They dot the hills of this area, often miles from

water courses, and are attributed by geologists to some peculiar erosional feature of geological formation.

The following reasons lead us to believe that at Belcher the
structures were not earth lodges:
1. The surface structures, Houses 1 and 5, were covered with a
relatively thin humus layer, showing no evidence of heaped
up earth.

2. The earth covering the deeper structures was a clear sand,
instead of the clay or sod which would be expected had they
been earth lodges.
3. The san~ immediately overlying the fallen burned structures
had the same appearance as the higher sand fill.
4.

The burned clay daub material which appeared with the house
debris was tightly pressed, showing imprints of sticks, cane
and grass.

One surface was usually smooth, indicating its

use as an adobe or piaster in wall construction.
5. The greater abundance of charred materials around the periphery suggests that earth was thrown on the collapsed structure as it burned.

Inversion of the roof sections, with grass lying directly on the
floor, then cane, then poles, would not be expected if the roof
had been sod covered.
We advance the hypothesis that when death of important personages, epidemics, war, or depreciation of the buildings made it
desirable to construct a new lodge, the Caddos had the custom of
burning the old structure, probably intentionally breaking the potteries used therein (House 2) and, as a part of the ceremony, gathering around the burning structure to heap on earth as it collapsed.
Additions of soil built up a higher mound, on which the new temple
was built. There is an obvious analogy witt~ the custom among the
Aztecs of Central Mexico, of destroying their houses, furnishings
and potteries at the end of their 52 year cycle and building new
temples on successively higher pyramids. The presence of burial
pits dug through the covered ruins, before building a new structure,
suggests that death of these individuals was responsible for or connected with destruction of Houses 2 and ¢ at Belcher.
Conclu~ons

1. Historical evidence indicates that grass lodges and lodges
with wattle-daub walls and grass thatched roofs were the prevailing
types of structures among the southern Caddoan tribes.
2. House remains from a mound site within the historic Caddo
area indicate several types of houses, with the custom of burning
the houses when deserting them or before building new structures.

A SURVEY OF THE HISTORIC EARTHENWARE OF THE LOWER ARKANSAS
VALLEY*
By S. D. DICKINSON and S. C. DELLINGER
Pottery typical of the Lower Arkansas River Valley was described
and illustrated in 1908 by C. B. Moore, who had investigated sites
from the mouth of that stream to Natural Steps, in Pulaski County,
20 miles above Little Rock.1

He made no attempt to ascertain

the origin of the wares, other than indicating that some of them
apparently belonged to the historic horizon,z

Later Moore called

attention to the fact that Arkansas River pottery possessed certain
traits common to both the Middle and Lower Mississippi provinces,3
as defined by Holmes.4
In 1924 M. R. Harrington was sent by the Heye Foundation to
investigate a large aboriginal cemetery which was being destroyed
by pot-hunters in Carden Bottoms, Yell County, Arkansas.

Here

the diggers were finding elaborately decorated ware, much of which
was similar to what Moore had found farther downstream.

After

having observed the Carden Bottoms specimens, Harrington divided
them into six groups: plain, culinary ware consisting of bowls, pots,
and bottles; vessels having designs painted in red and white, or red,
white, black or brown; incised ware; engraved pottery; red painted
vessels, the surface of which had been scraped after firing leaving
designs in relief; and effigy forms,s

Harrington wrote concerning the origin of the wares:

"It is certain, however, that a considerable part of the pottery is
typically Caddp, especially the ware engraved after firing and much
of that with patterns incised before heat was applied. Another large
element dark, and not so well made, with occasional animal effigies,
resembles the typical pottery of eastern Arkansas, which may be
Quapaw; the painted ware may belong to this group, and it may
not--the exact connection has not yet been satisfactorily worked out.
Certainly, the impression produced by the Carden Bottoms collection as a whole is that it was made by at least two or perhaps three
separate peoples."
"Careful work would have proved or disproved the possibility of
this, and very simply. If some graves contained only Caddo pottery, others only painted ware, and still others only ware of the eastern Arkansas type, we might hope to show occupancy by three different peoples; but if all classes of pottery are usually found together in the same grave, there would be ground for assuming that
one people of mixed culture had lived in Carden Bottoms.’’6
Attempting to solve this problem, the University of Arkansas Museum excavated an aboriginal cemetery at the Mainard Place near
Natural Steps. The ceramic material obtained here was similar to
what had previously been found throughout the Lower Arkansas.
Engraved ware quite like Caddoan pottery, and incised pieces occured in the same graves with painted vessels, some of which were
effigies. The wares, therefore, appear to have been contemporaneous; and the variation in paste composition, form and decoration
may be attributed to a fusion of cultures.
Though pottery resembling the Caddo is distributed all along the
Lower Arkansas River, it is not the dominant ware. Sites near the
Fourche La Fave and Peiit Jean, tributaries of the Arkansas which
flow through Logan, Perry, and Yell counties in the central part
of the state, have yielded the greatest number of Caddo-like vessels.
This earthenware, which decreases as one proceeds downstream, most
closely resembles pieces from the Upper Ouachita River.

Composition of the paste is very similar to that of pottery from
the latter stream.

Blackish Brown, Iron Gray and Mouse Gray are

common colors7 of the paste core, which has either a lumpy or
compact texture.

Shell and grit aplastics were both used.

Exterior

surfaces were smudged and polished, sometimes to a relatively high
degree.
There is also a marked similarity between shapes of vessels from
the two valleys.

Cazuelas, bowls with flaring sides, and those with

curving~ walls and everted rim (Plate 1¢, a and d) are equally represented in both areas.

Bottles, likewise, are closely related as

evidenced by bulbous and straight necks, pedestals, and tripods (P1.
14, b and c).

On the other hand, platters (P1. 15, a) are more

abundant along the Arkansas than in the Ouachita region, whereas
the urn is less frequently found.

The Arkansas Valley Caddoan

manifestation, however, does exhibit certain shapes not found elsewhere in the state: a cylindrical jar with convex sides (P1. 15, b) ;
a globular vessel with equidistant openings (P1. 15, c) ; and a bowl
with rounded body and straight rim somewhat like a cazuela but
deeper.

With the exception of the last, these forms are rare.

Moreover, the decorations are either identica! or else closely related.

Engraved frets, bars, and scrolls with a crosshatched back-

ground interspersed with circles are the principal motifs on this
ware. Tripod bottles of both groups frequently have a series o~ horizontal lines encircling the neck and scrolls or triangular motifs extending across the body to the legs.
The dominant ware of ~dae Lower Arkansas can be distinguished
from the Caddoan by a characteristic paste, the core of which may
be Buff-Pink, Light Vinaceous Cinnamon, Light Pinkish Cinnamon
or sometimes Smoke Gray or Clear Payne’s Gray in color.

Shell

temper was used most frequently, though volcanic tuff is occasionally noted.

Hardness varies from

From the standpoint of form, two divisions are recognizable: the
functional, including vessels which had a pure utilitarian origin;
and the zoomorphic and eccentric which express an additional
esthetic impulse. Slipped and unslipped vessels occur in both
groups. Likewise, there are common decorative techniques and
motifs, such as incised designs, monochrome and polychrome painting, and cameo work which has relief designs resulting from the
removal of areas in the slip. Ochre Red or Etruscan Red pigment
was employed as a wash for the monochrome and cameo. In combination with white kaolin alone, or with white and a carbonaceous
substance, these reds were used in polychrome decoration. The
colors are quite reminiscent of those on Middle Mississippi pottery,
although painted earthenware is far more abundant along the Arkansas. In both areas black was the least common pigment.
Functional forms are limited to bowls and bottles. The typical
bowl has rounded sides and everted rim, althougl~ there is considerable variation in size, curvature, and decoration. Culinary vessels
are large, some of them being 8 inches high and 15 inches wide.
in general, the height is about one-half of the maximum width.
They are rarely decorated. When ornamentation has been added,
it is usually a band of simple rectilinear motifs incised on the exterior surface below the rim lip (P1. 16, b).
Cameo decoration occurs chiefly on those functional bowl forms
which are more shallow than the culinary ones (P1. 17, a). Bowls
decorated in this fashion have a solid band of red covering or~ both
sides of the rim and a more complicated design, composed of several
elements, arranged on the interior walls of the body. Designs on
interior surfaces are indeed unusual elsewhere in this state.
The chief motifs forming the decoration of cameo bowls are: the
circle; a plain semi-circle; semi-circle with triangnlar projections;
a hollow quadrate; a terraced figure; the swastika; scrolls with
projecting triangles; and a figure suggestive of antlers. With the
exception of the last two elements, all are commonly found on Middie Mississippian painted ware, and are likewise arranged in groups
of 3 and 4. The scroll with triangular projections (P1. 17, b),

84

moreover, is analogous to an engraved motif with crosshatched triangles on occasional bottles from northeast Arkansas and Moundsville, Alabama.~ It is thought that the latter design is symbolic of
the plumed serpent. Likewise, Moore has suggested that the antler
figure (P1. 17, c) was emblematic of Quetzalcoat.9 Concerning
this, it is noteworthy that the Quapaw, according to La Harpe in
1722, were worshipping only the snake deity;lo and Bossu saw an
idol of a horned serpent among theso people in 1771.11 The other
motifs, like their Middle Mississippian counterparts, are cosmic
symbols according to Willoughby’s interpretation,Iz which was
based on Ashe’s account of a Quapaw dance.~ 3
As painting of vessels was most common in the Middle Mississippi
complex, and engraving among the Caddo, it seems that the two
techniques spread to the Lower Arkansas where they fused to form
the cameo style of decoration. Caddoan ware of yellow paste with
red slip and engraved designs sometimes occurs on Red River in
Arkansas, and Moore illustrates several specimens from Glendora,
Louisiana.~4 It is noticeable that on these pieces the slip serves
as the background for the engraved patterns, whereas in the cameo
the reverse is true. The University of Texas Department of Anthropology has obtained from sites on Red River in the northeastern
part of that State some red painted vessels with designs carved
through the slip,15 which seem remotely related to the cameo pottery, but here again the engraved portions constitute the design.

land Plantation, Mississippi,16 the writers know of no typical examples of cameo ware from outside the Arkansas River Valley.
The most common functional bottle form has a spheroid body and
a neck shaped somewhat like an hourglass, which is peculiar to
the Arkansas Valley (PI. 16, a). Possibly, this type is an extreme
modification of the Caddo bulbous neck. Middle Mississippian
influence is suggested by a red wash and interlocked, alternating
red and white scrolls which such bottles generally have as decoration. Another form exhibiting a relationship with pottery from
northeast Arkansas is a bottle having a compressed body and a
wide but short neck (PI. 16, c). This bottle, unlike its plain Middie Mississippian counterpart, frequently has an incised decoration
of swastikas, or scrolls.
Clearly the effigy pottery from Carden Bottoms and other sites
in the same valley is related to that of eastern Arkansas, as Harrington points out, but one does not know to what part of the eastern
~ction of the state he refers. Presumably, it is to the northeast where
so much effigy ware of the Middle Mississippi complex has been
found, since he describes the pottery as "dark, and not so well made."
Arkansas River zoomorphic-eccentric forms, however, are usually
of yellow paste and are painted whereas those from northeast Arkansas are not. One unpainted human effigy water bottle of dark paste
from the Menard Site, though, was illustrated by Moore.17 This
bottle type is very rare in Arkansas River sites; in fact, human
effigy bottles are less frequent here than vessels modeled in the
semblance of a human head, which is in direct contrast to the occurrence of such forms in the Middle Mississippi complex. Excepting Moore’s specimen, only two bottles representing the human form
have been reported from Lower Arkansas Valley (P1. 18, b).
Arkansas River head vessels differ from those in the northeast
section of the state. For example, they are not vases but bottles
having the characteristic hourglass neck (P1. 18, c). Moore described, however, a human head bottle with a wide mouthed, straight

neck from Pecan Point. 18 Furthermore, the modeling of Arkansas
River specimens is less realistic with a tendency toward the grotesque, which is achieved by making the features conform to the
vessel shape instead of vice versa as was done by the Middle Mississippi potters.
The chief zoomorphic form of the Arkansas River is a bowl with
curved sides and the head and tail of a bird or other animal, though
occasionally a grotesque head having a tall coiffure has been
modeled (P1. 18, a and d). Less common are vessels executed in
naturalistic fashion to represent fish and quadrupeds--favorite subjests in the Middle Mississippi complex.
Related to zoomorphic specimens are the teapot-shaped vessels
(P1. 19, b), which presumably were developed through conventionalization of a frog or turtle effigy.19 As Moore pointed out,
the focus for this form seems to have been in the Lower Arkansas
from which it spread northward,z° The Middle Mississippi teapots, however, are rarely painted, whereas those from the Arkansas
River have a red wash, and sometimes polychrome decoration. Moore
also reports his finding two teapots in Louisiana, one at the Glendora Site on the Ouachita,zl and another at the Keno Place on
Bayou Bartholomew.22 He suggests that they were probably carried in trade from the Arkansas River.23 It is noteworthy that the
Keno specimen occurred with glass beads,2z~ and the Glendora cemetery likewise contained European objects,z5 An historic Natchez
site has also yielded a red painted teapot,z6 Other eccentric forms

such as the bottle with a loop handle, the shoe-shaped jar, and the
hourglass shape point toward Middle Mississippi influence (P1. 19,
c, d and a respectively).
Obviously, the wares discussed in this paper belong to the historic horizon, for Moore states that almost every site examined by
him along the Arkansas yielded brass objects and glass beads,z7 In
one instance he found trade objects associated with a painted bottle.z8 Furthermore, the University of Arkansas Museum has a
wide mouthed bottle which occurred with cones of sheet brass in a
grave in Yell County. The presence of the aforementioned cameo
bowl and painted teapot at the historic Fatherland, Mississippi Site,
as well as the known historic position of Caddo pottery, further
established the same time period for Arkansas River earthenware.
Identification of the makers of the pottery, however, can be determined with less exactitude. As is well known, the Quapaw or
Akancas, who were situated during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries in four villages near the confluence of the Arkansas, White,
and Mississippi rivers,29 claimed as their territory an area extending 300 miles westward,so It is also evident that they were potters
for Marquette states that, ’q’hay cook it (maize) in great earthen
jars, which are very well made. They have also plates of baked
earth which they use in various ways.’’31 St. Cosine also wrote of
their, "using large earthen pots instead of kettles, and well made
pitchers.’’3z According to the latter observer, these Indians made
drums by stretching a skin over a pot.33 Such references to the
size of the pieces suggest the large culinary vessels which have already been mentioned ir~ this paper.

the neighborhood of the old Quapaw towns. As these Indians were
the only tribe known to have resided continuously in this neighborhood throughout the historic period, we may conclude that die
pottery from these graves is Quapaw. It must be borne in mind,
however, that these burials were in the field, not in the mound,
which may~ not have been erected by that culture.
Apparently, there was also a minor Natchesan influence here, for
several vessels illustrated by Moore are comparable to some from
the Fatherland Plantation which has been identified as the Grand
Village of the Natchez. These have a flattened body on a pedestal,
and a wide orifice with short, vertical rim. Moore’s specimens,
having incised decorations consisting of continuous scrolls and curvilinear meanders arranged around a circle, correspond to Ford’s
Natchesan types 41; 21; 5 and 43; 21; 5, respectively.3~ Intercourse such as the Quapaw and Natchez maintained during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would easily account for the
presence of this foreign element in the Arkansas Valley.
As previously stated, the Caddo types associated with the painted
wares occur more frequently in those counties which are situated
between the Arkansas River and the headwaters of the Ouachita.
The distance separating these two valleys is not great, consequently
the Caddoes could easily have gone northward, established villages,
and were later absorbed. Naturally, if such an intrusion had taken
place one would expect to find along this route sites having engraved and polished wares and little or no painted pottery. This
was the case at the Bluffton Mounds in the southern part of Yell
County--the only scientifically excavated campsite in that region.
Incidentally, no indications of European contact were noted here.
It is now impossible to determine when the Caddo entered the
Arkansas Valley. They may have preceded the Quapaw, but there
is some circumstantial evidence of at least one late migration. The

1782 revised map of Guillaume de l’Isle locates the Ouatehitas village just south of the Arkansas River in the region in which engraved, burnished ware is most abundant, whereas his map of 1718
does not show this town.
Although a northward movement of people from the Upper Ouachita would seem to hav~ been most responsible for the presence of
Caddo pottery in the Arkansas Valley, it probably was not the only
culture thrust from southwest Arkansas. Throughout the historic
period both Quapaw and Caddo used a trace which ran diagonally
across the state from near the mouth of the Arkansas to the bend of
Red River. Relations between the tribes appear to have been more
than casual, for the Cadodaquious informed Joutel that the Cappa
were one of their allies.36

The heterogeneous character of Arkansas River pottery is consistent with the mixed culture of the historic Quapaw. According
to recent studies, the De Soto expedition did not encounter these
Indians;37 consequently, the latter must have established themselves near the mouth of the Arkansas sometime between 1541 and
1673, when Marquette discovered them. They probably were already familiar with Middle Mississipian pottery when they resided
in the Wabash-Ohio region, and their migration southward afforded
them additional opportunity to observe the effigy and painted wares
of southeast Missouri and northeast Arkansas. It is also possible
that they borrowed certain traits from the Tunican or Natchez people whom they may have replaced on the Lower Arkansas.3s At
a later period the Quapaw were adept at culture assimilation. In
fact, they strengthened their own number by offering refuge to
remnants of various tribes.39
In determining the character and position of the most recent wares
in the Lower Arkansas River Valley attention has been paid chiefly

to the relation of the pottery to other historic ceramic groups. There
is the possibility, however, that certain traits common to all came
from earlier complexes. Painting with red ochre, for example, may
have been a feature borrowed by Arkansas River, Middle Mississippi,
and Caddo potters from the Coles Creek complex. No extensive
stratigraphic studies have been made in the Lower Arkansas River
region, but sufficient specimens of Coles Creek and Deasonville
potsherds have been collected by the University of Arkansas Museum

TUBULAR PIPES AND OTHER TUBES
IN TEXAS~
By A. T. JACKSON
Stone tubes that seem to have been used as pipes are scarce, but
distributed ovee a wide area in Texas.

There are other stone tubes

the use of which is uncertain.

Pottery tubes, some definitely pipes, have been found in restricted
areas. Reed tubes that appear to have been smoked are confined
to certain cave areas. A few antler tubes, suggesting use as pipes,
have been found in burnt-rock middens.
Tubular Stone Pipes
Stone tubes of the pipe type have been found in twenty-one Texas
counties, ranging from Brownsville to Texarkana and from Texarkana to E1 Paso. In all this vast area only fifty-eight specimens are
reported. Their wide distribution suggests a somewhat general
culture trait; but the rarity with which they occur bespeaks a li~nited use, confined to small numbers.
This type of specimen is most abundant in South Texas, along the
coast.

About fourteen per cent of the tubes come from Nueces

County, and thirty-three per cent from Cameron County, with only
five per cent from all Central Texas.

West Texas has less than half

as many specimens as South Texas; East Texas almost doubles Central Texas.

North Texas--exclusive of the Panhandle, where most

of the tubes are made of pottery---has been so scantily worked as
to not give a fair picture for that area.

Terminology Used
The long, large cavity in a tube is here referred to as the bowl;
the short, small portion is called the stem. Where a short bone tube
is present it is referred to as a mouthpiece.
Shapes o] Tubes
The shapes of the tubes are fairly uniform in the various areas.

The prevailing shape has the greatest diameter of the exterior near
the center, tapering gradually from that point to each end. In some
cases the bowl end is only slightly larger than the stem; while in
others the end of the bowl is about twice the diameter of the stem.
The next most common shape of the exterior is with the diameter
gradually increasing from stem to bowl ends, resulting in roughly
conical shape.

In most cases the interior has a double-conical or hourglass-shaped
bore. Some tubes have cylindrical bores for bowl and stem with
a union forming rounded shoulders. A few have a cylindrical bore
for the entire length.
South Texas Specimens
South Texas counties in which stone tubes have been reported
include Aransas, Atascosa, Cameron, Kleberg, Nueces, San Patricio~
Webb and Zapata.
An outstanding specimen was found by L. C. Benedict, March,
1940, in a shell midden within the city limits of Portland, San Patricio County. The tube is quite similar to one reported by Reed (1),
and by Pearce (2, 3, 4), from Kleberg County. It was found on high
land, formerly known as Indian Point, very near the bluffs overlooking Corpus Christi Bay and Nueces Bay. The site is part of
an extensive Indian village.
Benedict (5) reports finding "small triangular projectile points, a
few potsherds in the grass roots and one conch core chisel within
ten feet of the location of the pipe."
Protruding slightly from the stem end was a fragment of the
bone mouthpiece. Inside the stem about an inch was discovered
a hard, cement-like substance holding an unbroken section of the
bone in place. (See Plate 20).
The diameter of the stem hole was 7-8 inch; that of the bone was
only 1-2 inch. The cement held the bone away from the stone wall

at all points. About one inch of the bone mouthpiece was imbedded
in cement. The bone, apparently from the leg of a turkey, originally
may have been three inches long.
From the inner extremity of the bone mouthpiece to the bowl end
of the tube, the cavity gradually increases to a maximum diameter of
1 1-4 inches. The interior--like many specimens of this type--has
striations, with small ridges between. The lines are not symmetrical,
but appear to have resulted from gouging the comparatively soft
sandstone with a flint or other sharp implement.
The length of the specimen is 7 1-2 inches, and the maximum
diameter 3 1-2 inches.
Another sandstone tube, of the same type, is owned by AIbert
Nowotny of New Braunfets. He reports that two tubes, almost identical, were found about a foot deep in a midden deposit in Nueces
County. The outer surface of the one he secured is smooth, but not
polished; the interior shows parallel gouge marks 3 1-2 to 5 inches
long and about 1-8 inch apart. The dimensions are: length, 7
inches; diameter of bowl, 1 1-4 inches; stem opening, 3-5 inch. No
bone mouthpiece was in the tube.
On the exterior, near the stem end, are traces of asphah.

A longitudinal section, less than half, of a standstone tube was
found by J. L. Johnston at the mouth of Oso Creek, Nueces County.
There is a shallow groove around the exterior near the original center. This is the only specimen with such groove. It may have been
for attachment of a thong. Two other tubes, one complete, came
from this site.
In the collection of J. T. Patterson is a sandstone tube, found by
Arthur Turner in a grave southwest of Campbellton, Atascosa
County.

Turner (6) reports as follows:

"There was no skeleton; the clay was almost white with decayed
bones. The only evidence was some teeth, quite a number of arrowheads, one spearhead or knife--about six inches long--and the pipe.
The pipe, the spearhead and a number of arrowheads were together.
No beads or metal of any kind."

Te~az Archeologi~al and Paleontological Society

The length of the tube is five inches; the diameter at the bowl
end, 2 1-4 inches; at the stem end, 1 1-8 inches.

(See Plate 22,

Fig. 4).
R. W. Aldrich found a stone tube protruding from a caved-off
bank on the Rio Grande, at the mouth of San Lorenzo Creek, Webb
County. The material is a fairly soft ironstone, and the ends have
been ground into shape. One side is smoothed, the other in a rough
state.
The tube is 4 15-16 inches long; diameter at bowl end, 1 1-4
inches; at stem end, 3-4 inch. The hole seems to have been gouged.
There is no mouthpiece. (See Plate 21, Figs. 1 and 2).
Another stone tube, with the cavity not complete, was found by
Roy Kaylor irt the northwest corner of Zapata County. The length
of the tube is three inches. The holes, started from each ~nd, lack
about one-half inch of meeting. The bowl cavity is conical and has
a smooth surface, appearing to have been reamed out. (See Plate 25,
Fig. 1). One side of the exterior is covered with remains of asphalt.
A. E. Anderson (7) of Brownsville has in his collection two tubes
made of pumice stone, found in an eroded bank in Cameron County.
One is four inches long and has a diameter of ! 1-2 inches at the
bowl end. The other is 3 3-8 inches long with a bowl diameter of
1 1-4 inches. One "is nothing more than a roughly excavated natural
waverounded chunk of pumice." The other "is well designed and
nicely finished both inside and out." There was no bone mouthpiece in either specimen. Anderson, who has fragments of eighteen
other stone tubes, states:
"In shape the local pipes are more nearly oval or conical. They
are tubular only in the sense that the stem hole is always in alignment with the bowl cavity. Several specimens show asphalt blackening around stem holes. Most specimens show a burnt darkening
of bowl cavity--not asphaltic."

C~ntral Texas Specimens
The Central Texas specimens are much like some from South
Texas.

The earliest Texas discovery, of which the writer knows, is that
made by J. J. Corm in 1891, when he plowed up in Llano County a
large steatite tube. It was decorated with incised designs and contained a bone mouthpiece.
The site where the specimen was found is an ideal location, very
near a spring and a small rock shelter. There are pictographs on
the shelter wall.
The tube, brought to Austin in 1912, was in the possession of several individuals, finding a permanent resting place in the Texas
State Library. In the course of these changes the bone mouthpiece
was lost.
The following is from a previous description (8) of the specimen:
"The pipe.., has a length of 6 7-8 inches and a maximum diameter of 1 7-8 inches .... An intricate group of carved designs decorate
the entire outer surface .... Carved in the steatite, to an average
depth of about 1-16 inch, are a rayed sun-disc, four possible projectiles, three so-called pole-ladder and several triangular elements.
The projectiles are remarkably like certain designs on painted pebbles from Val Verde County. The sun symbol is almost identical
with some incised designs on pottery in the University of Texas
Anthropology Museum, from Titus, Wood, and other East Texas
Counties." (Plate 22, Figs. 1-2).
The interior of the bowl section shows longitudinal gouge marks
with a width and depth of about 3-16 inch. Deep gouging was
possible in the soft stone.

108

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Albert Nowotny reports the finding of a sandstone tube in the
northern part of Comal County. The specimen was about two feet
deep, in a midden deposit, some twenty feet from the edge of a
small burnt-rock mound.
The exterior of the tube is conical with the interior "jug-shaped."
With a len~h of 4 1-4 inches, the exterior is smooth. The interior
shows longitudinal gouge marks to within one inch of the stem end.
One edge of the bowl shows small breaks; the unshattered edge is
beveled to a thickness of about 1-I6 inch.
A broken limestone tube was found in the Marshall Ford basin,
Travis County, in 1938 by a WPA-University of Texas crew excavating a burnt-rock midden, soon to be inundated. A. M. Woolsey (9), in charge of the excavation, reported:
"About twelve inches from the western edge of the mound was
found a broken pipe or ’cloud-blower.’ It was in two parts, but
the pieces fit perfectly .... It was at a depth of fourteen inches.
"It is made from a hard white limestone,.., and in cross-section
is more oval than round .... It was broken along the longer axis into
two almost equal parts.
"The exterior shows fine striations, probably resulting from abrading with fine-grained sandstone to smooth the surface."

Attention is directed to Plate 23, Fig. 2, showing the hourglass
shape of the cavity and the longitudinal gouge, or chisel, marks on
the interior of the bowl. These features are typical of many specimens from a wide area.
An old break across the bowl end of the tube has been ground or
worn down to a considerable extent; indicating that it occurred
before the lengthwise split, and that the tube continued in use until
the time of the latter break.
A potsherd was found in the same midden and at a greater depth
than the stone tube. The sherd probably belongs ~o the late prehistoric or early historic period, and suggests that the nearby tube
has no great age.
The midden mound had a diameter of fifty feet, a central depth
of five feet, and sloped gradually to a thin edge. Among the angu-

Tubular Pipes and Other Tubes in Texas

109

lar, fire-cracked pieces of limestone was black midden soil, made
up largely of charcoal. The bottom level contained a large ash
content.
The writer knows of no other specimens having been found in
Central Texas. In response to an inquiry, Frank H..Watt (10) of
Waco replied, "All my search of Central Texas has been entirely
and decidedly negative."
West Texas Specimens
West Texas ranks second in the number of specimens reported.
A number of stone tubes have been found in caves along the Rio
Grande in Val Verde County. Several of these have been described
by Martin (1!) and by Davenport (12).
These cave specimens were made of limestone and sandstone, with
the exteriors shaped by scraping and the interiors by gouging. The
sizes, on the average, are smaller than the South Texas tubes.
Through the cooperation of Mrs. Ellen Schulz Quillin and J. Walker Davenport, the tubular specimens in the Witte Museum were
examined. Among those not previously described were the following.
An unfinished specimen of red sandstone, found near Langtry by
a local collector, was abandoned after the bowl hole reached a diameter of one inch and a depth of 3-4 inch. It appears that a drilled
hole about 1-4 inch in diameter was used as a starting point for the
gouged cavity. The other end contains only a small pit. The stone,
4 7-8 inches long with a central diameter of 2 3-4 inches, is roughly
shaped on the exterior.
A small fragment, apparently from the stem end, has a smooth,
reamed-out, conical cavity one inch in diameter.

It came from the

second level from the top in Eagle Cave.

Victor Friedrichs and G. S. Meyer report the finding, in August,
1937, of a limestone tube in a cave of the Pecos Canyon, Val Verde
County. The exterior is decorated with criss-cross incised lines.
Meyer (13) states that in the cave also were found a painted pebble, a bone awl, sandals, fragments of basketry, etc.

110

Texas Arch~ologicctl and Paleontological Society

Ray (14) reports a standstone tube from Jones County and adds:
"The student who showed me one, which he said he found in a grave
in Jones County, is not here now and I cannot give data except
from memory." As he recalls, the tube was about three inches long,
was ground but not polished, and contained no bone mouthpiece.
Coffin (15) reports "two fragments of tubular smoking pipes,
or ’cloud-blowers,’ made of limestone," in a rock shelter in Bee Cave
Canyon, Brewster County. He does not illustrate nor give further
details concerning them.
Victor J. Smith (16) states he has found only one tube pipe in
Brewster County--"a surface specimen from Sunny Glen, and near
a stone hatchet. Both are evidently late. The polished stone artifact was a surface specimen from the same general neighborhood.
No similar article has been found during my observation here. The
hatchet blades associated with cave materials are quite different in
form and materials." The tube is scarcely two inches in length.
Kelley (17) reports as follows concerning the finding of stone
tubes (Plate 23, Fig. 3) in Presidio County:
"Two tubular stone pipes were found by the Peabody MuseumSul Ross College Big Bend expedition, on Alamito Creek some five
miles south of Casa Piedra, Texas, in 1938.
Both are of the fat
conical shape known in the Southwest as the ’cloud-blower’ type.
One measures 2 1-4 inches in length and is 1 3-4 inches in greatest
diameter at the bowl end; the other is 2 7-8 inches by 17-8 inches.
Both are of a red stone, probably of igneous origin. The bowI in
both specimens extends most of the length of the pipe. The orifice
for the attachment of a mouthpiece was bored separately, and from
the opposite end.
"Both specimens were found on the floor of a rectangular pithouse with adobe lined floor and wails. The pipes lay directly on
the house floor, and were covered by the burned roof debris of the
house. One specimen was broken by heat.

"Other specimens from the house, and from the same cultural
layer at the site, included small finely made arrowpoints with long,
carefully worked tangs and barbs; modeled pieces of red pigment
in nipple-like "forms; large tanged knives, barbed and unbarbed;
snub-nose and side scrapers; carefully shaped rectangular manos,
with rounded corners and two slightly convex working faces; olivella
shell beads; E1 Paso Polychrome, Chihuahua Polychrome (type unidentified), and plain brown and grooved brown wares of the Chihuahua ceramic complex.
"’In addition to the architectural complex mentioned, houses were
set in rows, side by side, and apparently were entered from the roof.
Flexed infant burials, beneath the house floors, was another associated trait. This complex of traits classified the site as a component
of the La Junta focus of the Bravo Valley aspect.
"The associated E1 Paso and Chihuahua ceramics date the site,
and the tubular pipes, between 1200 and 1400 A.D. In addition, the
site was included in the Kokernot formation--overlying deeply
buried cultural levels, classified as components of the Pecos River
locus of the Big Bend cave aspect, in the Calamity formation.
"Stone pipes have not been reported from other sites of the focus,
although a fragment of a third specimen was reported from refuse
of the same site.
"The similarity of the specimens to the Southwestern ’cloudblower’ type of tubular pipe, together with the presence of numerous intrusive Southwestern traits at the site, suggests that they represent Southwestern influence, perhaps even trade."
Strain (18) says tubular stone specimens are found in the E1 Paso
region, but that most of them "are from adjoining portions of New
Mexico."
East Texas Specimens
In the East Texas region, only five stone tubes that may be classed
as pipes have been reported. One of these was mentioned in a
former article (19). Most of the tubes are not large, and have an
average length of four inches.
A small tubular stone pipe from the surface of a campsite, Bowie

County, has the remains of red pigment on the exterior.

It is notice-

able around each end for 1-2 to 3-4, inch, and flakes of red are
present elsewhere. (Plate 24, Fig. 3). This calls to mind the practice of applying a red slip to certain earthenware vessels.

Price (20) reports a larger tube from another collection in Cass
County.

It is of sandstone, five inches long, and has a polished

exterior.
H. L. Cro~ has a polished hematite tube from a campsite in Titus
County. It is cone-shaped, with double-conical cavity, and reported
to have "some type of dressing--clay or grease--smeared over the
exterior."

In Nacogdoches County, B. J. Langford found a large pear-shaped
concretion worked into a tubular specimen. This was done by enlarging the natural cavity for the bowl, and by drilling a small stem
hole to connect with the bowl. The maximum diameter of the tube
is four inches. (Plate 24, Fig. 1).
North Texas Specimens
A. H. Witte (21) reports fragments of two "small plain tube
pipes" from a midden in Clay County. One was of local sandstone,
at a depth of eighteen inches; the other of red sandstone, from a
depth of sixteen inches. They "were about one inch in diameter
and resembled the cloud-blower type."

High Percentage o] Breakage
It seems significant that 50 per cent of all the stone tubes are in
a fragmentary or incomplete condition.

Their shape, and the fact

that most of them are of fairly hard stone, would seem to safeguard
their preservation.
What is the explanation of this high percentage of breakage?

A

careful examination of many fragments shed no light on the problem.
Some of the specimens probably were broken in the final process of
reaming, or gouging, to enlarge the cavity.

Others show signs of

battering and rough usage that might account for their breakage.

Three of the four tubes containing bone mouthpieces bear evidence
of battering, as if they occasionally were used for light hammering.
One of the battered specimens, made of steatite, is from Central
Texas; the others, of sandstone, are from the Texas Coast. It is
possible that, in certain cases, the pits resulted from the original
roughing out of the stone to the desired shapes. But this could
hardly account for all the "bruises." An incised design on one
tube was damaged by subsequent battering.
A few tubes may have been broken in recent years by erosion,
agricultural operations, trampling of livestock, etc.
Contents o[ Stone~ Tubes

Most of the stone tubes furnish no clue as to the kind of material
used in the bowl. A notable exception is a specimen found in a
grave in Kleberg County and reported by both Reed (22) and
Pearce (23, 24, 25). From Reed we learn that:
"One of the tools contained about 250 c.c. of coarse bitumen and
ashes. The ashes were in the bottom and fl~e unburned bitumen was
on top, indicating that the fire was fed from the large open end.
The bottom has a hole through it into which was inserted a short
shaft of hollow bone about five centimeters long.

The bone was

highly polished and browned from heat .... "

Another case, related by Albert Nowotny, is d~at of the stone tube
from Comal County. It contained a small amount of carbonized
vegetal material in the bowl. He thinks it was charred tobacco or
other crushed leaves.

116

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

A third instance is cited by Martin (26) who found, in one of
the Shumla caves, Val Verde County, "a lengthwise section with
mouthpiece, the inside of which is sooted, and part of the fire cavity
which is deeply discolored from use."
Regional Similarities
The hourglass-shaped cavity is a feature common to most of the
stone tubes from the various parts of Texas.
The average length of the tubes seems to be fairly constant in
certain regional groups. One group includes South and Central
Texas; the other suggests a relation between the West and East
Texas regions.

~tges of Stone Tubes
In most cases it is difficult to determine the possible age of the
stone tubes.

Cross finds of Southwestern pottery dated the associated tubes in
Presidio County as between 1200 and 1400 A. D.
There are suggestions that some of the other tubes are comparatively recent. In Central Texas a tube was associated with a potsherd that may belong to the Spanish mission period. In South
Texas one seemed to be associated with a polished boatstone; and in
West Texas one was on the surface near a polished stone hatchet of
the celt type.
A number of years ago John B. Dunn uncovered a grave at the
mouth of Oso Creek, Nueces County; and states that with the burial
were a tubular stone pipe and a silver sword hilt.
In discussing these finds Martin (27) expresses the opinion that
the sword is of Mexican manufacture. Dunn states that several
museums in the North have examined the sword hilt and are unable
to determine in what nation the weapon was made.
Subsequent to Dunn’s finds at Oso, the Anthropology Department,
University of Texas, exhumed 93 skeletons from the same cemetery,
found no evidence of historic contacts and no stone tubes.
Most of the stone tubes from caves do not seem to have any great
age, being confined largely to the upper levels of the camp refuse.
These tentative conclusions are at variance with certain statements
of McGuire (28) and West (29), who consider tubular pipes in
general as quite old. West, however, adds: "It is quite certain
that the use of the tube . . . was not abandoned in favor of the
elbow type."
Comparison. With Other States
The stone tubes in Texas are not unlike certain ones from adjacent, and even far-removed, states.
In his chapter on "general pipe areas," West (30) includes Texas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and northern Louisiana--along with Arizona,

120

Texas ArcheoIogicaI and Paleontological Society

New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Nevada, and Utah--in the Southwest area.

Harrington (31) reports a small "bluffdweller pipe" from a rock
shelter near Eureka Springs, Arkansas, that is almost identical to
several found in various parts of Texas.
Lemley (32) and Dickinson (33) also report eighteen comparable
tubular stone pipes from the western one-third of Arkansas.

Lem-

ley’s stone tubes are surface finds.

In the Dallas Historical Society (34) collection is a large tubular
stone pipe, with engraved designs, from Missouri. It is suggestive
of the large decorated tube found in Llano County, Texas.
West (35) pictures a large conical stone tube, with incised
geometric decoration, from southern Missouri. Its shape is similar
to some Texas specimens.
Jones (36) describes a massive tubular pipe from a mound in
Burke County, Georgia. The specimen has an hourglass-shaped
cavity with longitudinal scars, like many of the Texas tubes, showing that the work was done by gouging.
West (37) mentions stone tube pipes from Arizona that have
double conical boring and circular exteriors that taper toward the
mouthpiece. He illustrates a tube from Graham County, Arizona,
that is very much like some from the Texas coast.
West (38) also describes and illustrates tubular stone specimens,
containing bone mouthpieces, from California. Two of these have
the general shape, and comparable size, of certain tubes from South
and Central Texas.
Kidder and Guernsey (39) describe two tubular stone pipes, from
a cave in Utah, that are very similar in shape to certain Texas
specimens.

Martin (40) states that in 1939, he "secured a ~mall specimen
from the Nahuatlan province of Nyarit in Mexico. It is of greenish granite, spherical in shape, deeply drilled from one side, less
deeply from the other. It apparently was used without a bone
mouthpiece, the larger cavity stained by smoke or fire." The hour-

glass-shaped cavity, with the two cones not in perfect alignment,
suggest the interior shapes of certain West Texas tubes.
Anderson states: "Only four of the twenty-seven specimens are
from northern TamauIipas, where most of my archeo!ogical materials were collected. Twenty-three are from Cameron County. This
indicates that such pipes were not so generally used south of the
Rio Grande as north."
Possible Uses o/Stone Tubes
The uses to which the stone tubes were placed often is uncertain.
Tubes of different sizes and shapes may have been used by the same
tribe for different purposes; tubes of the same kind may have been
used by different tribes for other purposes.
There are various ideas as to the use of stone tubes:

It aIso seems likely that certain Texas tubes may have been "cloudblowers," used as stated in the Handbook of American Indians (41") :
’~13ae cloud-blower of the Pueblos is a straight tubular pipe, vary.
ing from a few inches to a foot in length. Those of small size
are usually made of clay in the same manner as pottery. Large
cloud-blowers are usually made of stone and do not differ in form,
decoration or use from those of clay. This form of pipe is used
solely for ceremonial purposes, the smoke being blown to the cardinal directions by~ medicine men."
Medicine Tubes
Possible use of some specimens as "medicine tubes" should receive consideration. This use was suggested by Jones, West and

122

Texans Archeological and Paleontological Society

other writers, based on statements made by Cabeza de Vaca, Jacob
Baegert and Michael Venegas with regard to practices of Indians in
Florida, possibly on the Texas Coast, and in California.

The reference of Cabeza de Vaca (42) to the use of a stone tube
is not specific. He says:
"On the island I have spoken of... an Indian told me that...
he, with a heated stone, placing it on the stomach, could cure and
take away pain .... Their manner of curing is as follows: When one
is ill they call in a medicine man .... All the medicine man does is
to make a few cuts where the pain is located and then suck the skin
around the incisions. They cauterize with fire, thinking it very effective.... Then they breathe on the spot where the pain is and believe that with this the disease goes away."
West (43) states: "Schoolcraft informs us that the Dakota Indians
used a horn tube in the treatment of disease by bleeding. They
placed one end of the tube over the cut and sucked the other end."
Bourke (44), in writing of Apache medicine men, states: "When
a pain has become localized and deep ~ated, the medicine men
resort to suction of the part affected, and raise blisters in that
way .... "

While he does not say that Apache medicine men used a tube for
suction, Bourke refers to the account of Venegas---quoted below-and infers that the practices of the various bands of Apache are
similar.
Bourke adds: "Dr. Fordyce Grinnel, . . . for some years attached
to the Wichita agency as resident physician .... in a monograph
entitled ’The Healing Art as Practiced by the Indians of the Plains,’
¯ .. says:
" ’Wet cupping is resorted to quite frequently. The surface is
scarified by a sharp stone or knife, and a buffalo horn is used as

Cauterizing with red-hot irons is not infrequently

employed.’"
In discussing medical practices of Indians in lower California,
Jacob Baegert (45), a Jesuit missionary, declares:

"In treating a sick person, these jugglers employ a small tube
which they use for sucking or blowing the patient for a while, making also various grimaces and muttering something . . . until, finally, after such hard breathing and panting, they show the patient a
flint, or some other object previously hidden about their persons,
pretending to have at last removed the real cause of the disorder."
Venegas (46) sheds additional light on the subject:
"They applied to the suffering part of the patient’s body . . . a
tube formed out of a very hard black stone; and through this they
sometimes sucked, and other times blew, but both as hard as they
were able, supposing that thus the disease was either exhaled or dispersed.
"Sometimes the tube was filled with ciraarron or wild tobacco
lighted, and here they either sucked in or blew down the smoke,
according to the physician’s direction: and this powerful caustick
sometimes, without any other remedy, has been known entirely to
remove the disorder."
Speaking of the Hidatsa, Dorsey (47) states:

"When any person had a painfu! or diseased place, this.., man
put his pipe upon it and smoked .... He did not swallow the smoke,
but he affirmed he could extract the disease by his smoking; and he
pretended to seize it in his hand and to throw into the fire."
Careal (48) states that in Florida when Indians are sick:

’°Fhey call for.., their priests and physicians. These suck that
part. of the body which causes the patient most pain; and they do it
either with the mouth or with a kind of shepherd’s flute . . . having
first made a small incision near some vein."
Jones (49) sums up the facts in support of the medicine tube:
’°the small hole in the center of the bore facilitated both the

126

Texa~ Archeolog~cal a~! Paleontological Society

blowing and the sucking process. By the circular opening at the
larger end, the seat of pain could have been conveniently covered.
The weight of the instrument enhanced its efficiency and rendered
more facile its preservation in the desired position ....
"Suppose the cavity next to the flattened end filled with punk,
dried tobacco leaves or some combustible material; the other end of
the tube being firmly applied to the part affected, which had been
previously scarified; we will perceive, when the contained substance
was ignited, how readily this tube would have answered the purposes
either of cauterization or cupping.
"In the one case, the particles of burning matter dropping through
the central opening would have blistered and burnt the diseased
spot; while, in the other, the active fire kindled in the upper portion
of the tube--the ashes by a simple contrivance being prevented
from falling through the narrow portion of the bore below--would
have created and maintained during its existence a vacuum in the
lower part of the tube, thus causing the blood to flow freely from
the incision mad~ in the flesh."

Fire Carriers
So far as determined, the first published reference to the possible
use of a stone tube as a fire carrier was by Pearce (50) in 1932.
At that time ther~ were six known specimens in Texas; but the one
found in 1927 by Reed (51) and his coworkers, in a grave in
Kleberg County, was the type specimen on which the classification
was based, Martin (52) states, "I think I originally suggested to
Dr. Pearce the use of the ’cloud-blowers’ as fire-carriers."
In discussing the Kleberg County find, Reed states:
"The ashes were in the bottom and the unburned bitumen was on
top, indicating that the fire was fed from the large open end ....
These ’furnace’ torches were apparently means of transporting an
effective source of intense heat.

They were not connected in any

way with ceremonials; but rather with the very practical business
of keeping the fire of the tribal colony burning."
Pearce comments thus on the use of the tube:

"The speci~nen when found contained crushed asphalt and vege-

Tubular Pipes and Other Tubes in Texas

table matter which had probably been packed over llve coals.

127

A

smouldering fire could probably be carried in this apparatus for
days."
Pearce (53i was doubtful as to [he general use of the tubes when
he wrote: "They are so rare that I am doubtful of their having served
extensively for fire keeping and fire making."

Anderson declares: "I would think that the fume of hot pitch or
asphalt would not be wanted in a smoking pipe. Dr. Pearce’s idea
that these pipes were used as fire carriers or lighters seems the most
tenable."
Sha]t Stra.~ghteners (?)
A type of stone tube, rare in Texas, sometimes is referred to as a
"shaft straightener." In discussing tubes from the plains area, West
(54) mentions "a curious tube . . . through which a cavity of the
same diameter throughout has been drilled .... It appears to be a
shaft straightener."
Specimens of this type, of highly polished quartz and quartzite,
have been found in several East Texas counties. The cylindrical
holes are comparatively small. It is not known what purpose they
served. Possibly they were atlatl weights.
Enerrm Syringes
As mentioned by Heizer (55), "Nordenskiold has suggested that
the simple enema tube is related to the sucking tube used by the
medicine man who extracts disease from the sick by either sucking or
blowing."

It seems possible that certain of the stone tubes might have been
employed as enema syringes, by attaching a small bladder to the
bowl end and inserting a short bone or reed tube in the stem end.
Tubular Pottery Pipes
Studer (56) describes clay tubular pipes from a ruin "located
thirty-eight miles north of Amarillo, Potter County, Texas.... on
the south side of a tributary to the Canadian River.
"Several fired clay tubular pipes or cloud-blowers were found.
An unusually fine specimen came from Room T. It measures 2 1-2

128

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

inches in length and one inch in diameter at the mouth of the bowl.
The bowl has a depth of one inch. The decorations consist of three
groups of dots and a cross. Each group of dots contains six small
holes or indentures.
"Several isolated slab-houses are adjacent to the main communal
house. These circular rooms were slightly subterranean .... The
superstructure was probably brush built up in the shape of a cone.
The debris from these rooms was scarce, although flint knives and
tubular pipes were found in slab house F .... The types of knives
occurring most frequently were the well beveled four-edged knives.
"Out of forty-eight pipes found in our Texas Panhandle Culture
ruins we seem to have only four tubular pipes. Two of them are
of the ’cloud blower’ type. I do not have these pipes before me;
but, as I recall them, two of the tubes are pottery and the other two
stone; and two have flattened stems and two have roun~t stems."
A few pottery tubes from midden deposits in East Texas (57)
b.ave been found, but are very different from the Panhandle tube
pipes. They are more nearly cylindrical than conical.
Anderson (58) reports a conical pottery tube pipe, three inches
long, reconstructed from sherds; and fragments of seven other earthenware tubes from Cameron County, Texas, and Tamaulipas, Mexico. He adds:
"One pottery pipe appears to have been moulded around a core
of sticks or reeds which upon burning left the cavity. Another
pottery pipe appears to have been moulded inside of a wickerwork
form. Pottery pipes, though not crude, are not decorated nor colored, and are of inferior ware as compared to the best local pottery
vessels."
UrdquePot~ryTube

In a badly eroded village site, along the bluff of Corpus Christi
Bay near Portland, San Patricio County, a unique pottery tube was
found partly exposed. The discovery was made by L. C. Benedict
on December 5, 1937. A few days later he, W. Armstrong Price
and the writer visited the site.
The sausage-shape earthenware tube (Plate 25, Fig. 3) was in the

Tubular Pipes and Other Tubes in Texa~

129

Beaumont clay twenty-three inches below the level of the nearby uneroded surface.

Benedict states the tube was broken into two sec-

tions, and there was a small area of soft soll surrounding it. Immediately belo,,~ was a loose spot, six inches in diameter, that contained black midden soil.

Apparently this was the bottom of the

small hole originally dug to receive the specimen.

The tube, cylindrical with closed and rounded ends, has a maximum diameter of 2 7-8 inches and a length of 6 3-4 inches. The
thickness of the ware ranges from 3-8 inch at the two end perfora.tions to 1-8 inch at the thinnest part of the wall. The exterior,
though not well polished, has a red slip or wash, eroded away in
spots. The paste, a dense black from firing, is tempered with sand
and shell. The ware has a hardness of 2.5.
Points of cleavage encircling the tube suggest that it was made
by the coil method, and that the coils were from 1-4 to 1-2 inch in
diameter. The ends appear to have been shaped from lumps of
clay, with the thickest point at the center.
The end holes are slightly off-center, appear to have been punched
through the plastic clay, are 3-8 and 5-16 inch in diameter.
The interior has a striated and crosshatched surface, suggesting
that the soft paste was applied over netting; perhaps over a filled
fiber-cord pouch or bag. In firing the pottery, the bag was consumed. Careful cleaning of the broken tube revealed several
charred fragments of small four-strand fiber cords. Their diameter
agrees with the size of the imprints in the clay.
The material of
the cords has not been identified.
The crosshatch imprints formed small squares, about 1-16 inch
across, indicating a bag with mesh that size. (Plate 25, Fig. 4).
Where the tube begins to taper to the rounded ends, the crosshatch
ceases and the cord imprints converge at the hole. The end cords
may have protruded from the perforations.
For what purpose was this unique pottery object made?
If one end had a large opening, the specimen possibly might be
classed with tubular pipes. But a small hole at each end, and a cord
pouch inside, discredit the pipe theory. Neither does it seem likely
that it was used as a rattle.

130

Texms Archeological and Paleontological Society

Could this have been a "sacred bundle" that was encased in pottery and fired? Was the specimen, after firing, cached in the
ground; and did the present content filter in through the small hole?
Or does this pottery tube represent a small burial vessel, containing the remains of a cremated infant? Might the holcs in the ends
of the tube indicate ceremonial "killing" of the vessel? If a cremated burial, it seems likely that the ashy content would have been
wrapped with a skin, or other covering, before inserted in the pouch.
There was present no evidence of such wrapping. Some ash, a few
flakes of charcoal and a small quantity of clay were intermixed
with the sandy soil. No charred bone was in the tube.
Information concerning comparable finds, or any data shedding
light on the problem, will be appreciated.
Reed Tubes

Reed tubes, some of which appear to have been used as pipes, are
reported from West Texas caves. Coffin (59) refers to some in
Brewster County as follows:
"Pipes were found made from two sections of the stem of a reed.
One end is cut off close to, and the other at a distance from, the
joint; the dividing partition between the sections is punctured. The
short ends served as mouth pieces, while the long ends served as
bowls, these being in many cases badly charred and shortened
through use. A few of the bowls still contained the dottle, one of
which was of cedar sprays."
Martin (60) reports similar reed pipes from Val Verde County.
Cedar foliage also was found in some of the tubes.
In a cave in Culberson County, the writer found a section of reed
tube, with charred end, that seems to have been used for smoking;
or possibly as a medicine tube, such as described by Jones (61) :
"Beverly states that the Virginia Indians sometimes made use of

reeds for cauterizing, which they heated over the fire until they were
on the eve of ignition, and then applied, upon a piece of thin wet
leather~ to the. part affected."
Four reed tubes (Plate 22, Fig. 3), bound with thongs into groups
of two each, were found by A. M. Woolsey in a child’s grave in a
cave in Val Verde County.’ The ends are smooth but show no evidence of fire. These may have been drinking reeds, which often
bad thongs attached.
Antler Tubes

Huskey (62) reports the finding of "two pieces of deer horn
which may have been used as tubular pipes." . . . There was "a
small hole drilled through the end, while the hollow end was
charred .... "
In 1934 the writer found an antler tube at a depth of about four
feet in a burnt-rock midden, Travis County. The specimen, one inch
in diameter, 3 1-4 inches long, and in a decayed condition, appears
to have gouged-out openings at each end, connected by a small hole.
No evidence of fire is present, and it probably was not a pipe.

I~LAK~.D Wt~APON POINTS
By E. B. RENAUD

Weapon points were heads of implements which were employed
in hunting, war and sometimes fishing. They were made of stone
or bone, and, later, of metal. The smaller ones, more frequently
used as arrow-heads, as well as the large points for lance and spear,
were usually made on a flake, more or less skilfully shaped and
finished. The elongated points, often used for darts, javelins or
assagais or lances, were made on a blade, which is a specialized
type of flake with relatively extensive length in regard to the narrow
width. The earlier or simpler types of weapon points may be uniface, but they tended progressively to spread flaking to both sides,
thus they became true biface artifacts in the later cultures or more
advanced types of stone points. The flaking needed for the shaping
and especially for the final sharpening of the edges and tip as well
as the even thinning of the faces often displays remarkably fine work
done by skilful pressure flaking. The purpose of this careful
making and finishing was to produce a better weapon point. The
sharp tip acted like a perforator or borer in puncturing the skin of
the animal or the enemy. The keen edge of the well shaped sides
permitted an efficient penetration into the flesh which enlarged the
wound and rendered it deeper and more effective. The ancient
hunter or warrior was thus rewarded for his skill and his trouble
in producing a more deadly weapon. He also probably took pleasure and pride in manufacturing a beautiful artifact of symmetrical
and elegant shape, perfect edge and face finish, with fine and regular
flaking. To facilitate his task he seems to have selected the best
available material in the region and he even went afar for it. Not
only colors and markings of the stone pleased his eye and gave a
beautiful appearance to the finished artifact, but the fine grain of
the stone and its evenness of nature and quality permitted better
and more regular flaking, nearer shaping, and often a smooth and
g!ossy appearance added to the power of penetration’of the weapon
point as well as to its beauty. This is why these weapon points are
often the most perfect specimens and the most attractive artifacts
of a culture. This alone would justify the fascination which they
still exert on all collectors who, too often, neglect the common ira-

Flaked Weapon Points

139

plements, although more representative of a certain culture, to gather
almost exclusively arrow-heads and the like.
Weapon points made on flakes plunge deep roots into the Early
Palaeolithic. Flakes, at first, were merely Eolithic in origin, that is
to say, utilized by primitive man as found in nature regardless of
the cause of their formation; at most a minimum amount of rough
flaking was the only human contribution to their shaping. Then,
flakes which were the by-product of the manufacturing of corebiface artifacts, such as coups-de-poing or hand-axes, were utilized
as scraping or cutting edges or borers, with or without retouching
to add to their efficiency. The third step consisted in purposely
producing flakes to be used as implements or for the fashioning
of more specialized artifacts such as sidescrapers, knives, etc. These
flakes were made according to two principal techniques, a simpler
and earlier one named Clactonian, which occurred in Chellean
time, the second or Levalloisian was more complex and later came
to be known in Western Europe in Middle Acheulean or somewhat
later. Both types of flakes continued to evolve parallel to the core
industry of Early Palaeolithic and constituted two important factors in the making of the Mousterian culture. In this Middle Palaeolithic period stone implements were predominately of the flake
type. In fact, the two characteristic Mousterian artifacts are the
sidescraper, which does not interest us here, and the point. One
of the sub-types of this point, often fairly well shaped and flaked,
is obtained by the convergence of two scraping edges meeting at the
tip, not usually very pointed. It is a good tool but does not seem
to be in tho line of evolution which was to prepare the appearance
of the weapon point. Different may be the case of the other and
simpler sub-type. It is a sub-triangular artifact with sharp tip and
cutting edges. These characteristics are common to many weapon
points and to the arrow-heads in particular. It should seem to make
of this kind of Mousterian points a sort of proto-type of the ordinary
and numerous spear points and arrow-heads of later date. However, these Neanderthal-made points were often left with hardly any
retouching. Thus, symmetry of form and balance of weight required
for the true course of a missle were rarely achieved. Moreover, they
are thick butted and with an amorphous base. The bulb of percussion, often prominent, was rarely struck off, leaving an artifact that

140

could not have been hafted on a stem or handle in the direction of
its lengthwise axis~ as was the case of weapon points. They, therefore, could not have been so utilized. They must have been held in
hand or halted cross-wise, if at all, and probably were not weapon
points, although foreshadowing in their general shape, acuteness
of tip and sharpness of edges, the arrow-heads and spearpoints of
the future.
Some less common points of Early Mousterian, found associated
with remains of a warm fauna, already displayed an almost symmetrical sub-triangular shape. The lateral edges, although generally
unretouched, are sharp and converge at a tip of medium acuteness.
The dorsal face shows little or no flaking and of course the ventral
side was left untouched. The base interests us for two reasons.
First, it is rather thin and so would easily allow halting on a shaft
and, in view of its size and shape, it would make a good spearhead.
The second point attracting our attention is the unusual line of the
base, which is decidedly convex in the medial part. It would have
assisted in more securely making fast the point on the split end of a
shaft. It was already a strong suggestion of the later stem, which
in spite of other attempted solutions at good halting, was the one
which survived and remained popular the longest because it was
the most practical. However, this early and well directed start in
the right direction was not followed immediately by the develop~nent of the stem common to so many weapon points of various
periods. Man had to wait until the end of the Aurignacian for its
realization and the Solutrean for variations. It may be interesting
to note here that some javelin points of Portuguese Neolithic dis:
play in more symmetrical form and better fin;.sh, with good marginal flaking, a shape strikingly resembling the early Mousterian
flake point with base projection or convex line.
The weapon points of Late PalaeolhMc, whether stemmed or
stemless, were made on blades. As already stated, a blade is a
flake of elongated form, and relatively narrow width. The story of
the blade is not quite as long as that of the flake-itself. In the
Early Palaeolithic there was no blade with any degree of thinness
and regularity of shape. In the Mousterian there were a certain
number of blades used for cutting and scraping, others were notched,
but nono led to the production of weapon points.

Flaked Weapon Points

143

During the Aurignacian period, first phase of the Late Palaeolithle, the still broad and irregularly shaped Audi point evolved
into the classical Chatelperron knife blade.

It is fairly long and

pointed; the cutting edge was left unretouehed whereas the dorsal
edge was partly or wholly blunted. The base had no standard
shape. It was a typical tool of Aurignacian II, and apparently not
a weapon point. Through intermediate stages it evolved into the
Gravette point of Aurignacian V. This artifact tended to be smaller,
narrower and sharp pointed. Mounted at the end of a stem it would
have made a penetrating and deadly weapon. However, we have
no proof that it was so used, and it may have been employed only
as a small knife blade and borer.
One peculiarity of the form of some Gravette points is worthwhile
for us to consider as it seems to have been the first step toward
the development of a stem. The blunted back of a certain number
of Gravette points instead of being fairly straight or slightly convex, as was the case for the Chatelperron knives, shows a kind of
hump or "gibosite." From that higher point to the lower end or
base the line of the back slopes either slowly and over a relatively
long portion of the artifact, thus narrowing the blade, or else it
drops abruptly and ends in a pointed base. In either case it forms,
or at least strongly suggests, a tang; which would facilitate holding
and halting. This is the type called by the French "pointe a’ cran,"
to distinguish it from the "pointe a sole" with a clearly shaped stem
made by incurring both edges of the blade in its inferior part, this
produced at times well marked shoulders, with a fairly long and
narrow stem, or a pedunculate base. The~e Font Robert points,
as they are called, belong to the final Aurignacian, or phase VI.
Their shapes were not yet standardized as is natural for new inventions; they merely were the results of various degrees of modification of the original blade progressively becoming the proto-type of
a great many weapon points to follow for a long time. The Font
Robert points, with sub-triangular bodies, fairly sharp tips and the
cutting edges of the best specimens, can hardly be conceived as
anything but weapon points. How they were mounted and used is
only conjectural. They may have served as heads of javelins or
darts. These may have been thrown by hand or possibly by means
of a propulsor, corresponding to the American "atlatl." As these

144

were likely made of wood, they have disappeared. We actually
know that such an implement was in use during the later Magdalenian phase as we have carved bone and horn handles of such
propulsors showing the rear hook to hold in place the butt of.the
shaft of the dart. There is absolutely no proof that the bow was
known during the Late Palaeolithic period in Western Europe if
we except parts of Spain where different tribes of a culture more
affiliated with Africa than Europe have left their pictographs to
prove it. There, large bows with long arrows, with apparently one
sided barb, are seen in use by hunters and warriors as represented
in color pictures on the walls of rock shelters. These interesting
scenes, not lacking a real sense of action and composition, probably
belong to the last phase of Palaeolithic times. No such irrefutable
proof of the existence of the bow and arrow exists for the rest of
Western Europe, north of the Pyrenees, and for the cultural phases
following the Aurignacian we see only blade points although of a
variety of forms and degrees of perfection, especially in the Solutrean industry.
This Solutrean culture came more or less suddenly in Western
Europe and is considered by the prehistorians as being a sort of
intrusion which came from Central Europe and interrupted the
normal evolution of French Aurignacian. This is clearly seen in
the story of weapon points. The newly developed Font Robert
point with triangular body and long stem, in spite of its practical
form and anticipated evolution toward the arrow-head type not so
far different, was dropped. Entirely new styles came successively
through the three phases of the foreign Solutrean culture.
In Solutrean I, formerly designated as proto-Solutrean, there
were blades with partial or total flaking of the dorsal face, and
flaking of the other side limited to the re, on of the tip, marginal
retouching along one edge, and thinning of the base. These artifacts tended toward an oval shape, round butt, pointed tip, but
broader body than the Aurignacian blades. They progressively
evolved into the laurel leaf type of Solutrean II: These vary
from a small size to a length reaching over a dozen inches. They
are true biface blades, which were very skilfully flaked over both
faces by the pressure method and sometimes finely retouched along
the edges. Some are very thin and usually their shapes are quite

Flaked Weapon Points

145

elegant. They are relatively narrower and more elongated than
their proto-type of Early Solutrean. They are oval, elliptical, sublozengic, or double pointed. In spite of the fragility of the longer
and thinner o~es, prehistorians state that they must have been used
as lance.heads. As for the very small specimens some say that
they were arrow points, although, as already mentioned, we have
absolutely no material proof of the existence of the bow at that
time. However, they could have been utilized as dart points. All
these leaf-shaped blades of Middle Solutrean have a convex base
and generally pointed.
The tradition of the Font Robert points with their useful stem
had been completely obliterated and forgotten. Nevertheless, shouldered points with lateral stem did come, in Solutrean III, from a
new development. The so-called willow-leaf points, often narrower
and smaller than the classical laurel leaf type and contemporaneous
with it, did produce the less common, yet quite typical, shouldered
points or "pointes a cran" of late Solutrean. These new weapon
points are relatively long, narrow, sharp tipped, and were very
carefully shaped and skilfully flaked by pressure. The best specimens display fine, ribbon like parallel flake scars, produced, it is
likely, by means of a pointed bone, fabricator or flaker, pressing
from the edge toward the medial part of the blade; where the flake
scars from both edges meet they form a more or less visible dorsal
ridge lengthwise. This reinforces, somewhat, the slender triangular
point and gives to the cross-section a shape from lenticular to
slightly rhomboidal. Some specimens, probably early, are less
regularly shaped and show only a minimum flaking, whereas the
more typical and finished products of late Solutrean display a dorsal face entirely flaked even if the chipping of the other face is
limited to the tip and edges.
What is most interesting for us to observe is the presence of the
lateral stem by which it was hafted on a shaft. It was obtained by
removing from the original double pointed willow-leaf blade about
one.third of its width on approximately one-half the length of the
piece. This was always done on the right side of the specimen in
dorsal view. Thus, the left edge of the original blade remained
intact from tip to base; even the dorsal ridge was seldom affected.
Only the right edge was notched off about half way down, leaving

146

Texas Arch~ological ~.nd Paleontological Society

a ~houlder, sometimes carefully shaped into a

sort

of barb, then

forming a long side stem and a narrow pointed base to the left of
the body of the blade.

This was obviously invented to assist in

making secure the stone point hafted on a wooden shaft.

Whether

this asymmetry affected the trajectory of the javelin is not known.
If it did it may have been the cause of their scarcity, as in fact they
are not present at all sites, and even of their early abandonment,
as they disappeared with this ending phase of the Solutrean.

They

are found in France, especially in the Southwest region, and in
northern Spain as far as the Solutrean influence was felt.
It is in Spain that we find a greater variety of lance-heads and
javelin-points, and it is also in that country that we witness the
evolution leading to the formation of the unexpected lateral stem on
weapon points. In the Spanish Solutrean we see three types of long
pointed leaf shaped blades. First, the kind with pointed or convex
base, then, a second class with a broader base from nearly straight
t~ concave in outline; finally, the shouldered point, or "pointe a
cran," as just described for France. At the site of Cueto de la Mina,
in the Asturias, the number and variety of the Solutrean points is
fortunately such that one may observe the evolution from the concave based leaf blade to the shouldered point. The concave line
seems always to favor one side, that is to say that one lateral point
of the base is at first slightly longer than the other. Then, by increasing this light asymmetry, a well formed longer and broader
point appeared to grow, while the other remained as a short and
often sharp barb. Another stage shows a lateral stem fully developed, similar to those observed on the French specimens, but rarely
as long in proportion to the total length of the piece. While in
Southwestern France it seems that the lateral stem of the "pointe a
cran" is always on the left side, there are examples in Spain of the
contrary. Another difference is seen in the degree of finishing of
those weapon points. In France the flaking is often.finer, but in
Spain it frequently spreads more extensively on the ventral face.
These shouldered points were likely used as heads for darts or javelins. Some are small and light enough to have served as arrowpoints which could be shot by the large bows represented on the
rock shelters of Eastern Spain. However, these pictographs may

Flaked Weapon Points

147

not be contemporaneous with the weapon points of the Northern
area.

In Northwestern Spain we have the Cantabrian type of pointed
blade with a deep concave base, having a short, rudimentary
peduncle on the left side and a sharp barb-like point on the right,
a type also found in the Pyrenees region of Southern France. In
the Northeastern section of Spain we find the Catalonian shouldered
point type. This kind is interesting because it is different from the
others of Solutrean culture; also for the reason that it seems to
restart the interrupted tradition which the Font Robert points began,
and finally because it will be followed by many varieties of the same
general style in several cultures both of the Old and the New World.
¯
The base of this triangular weapon point is narrower than the body
of the blade, yet it is relatively broad, flat, and flaked in the same
manner as the rest of the artifact, and it gradully narrows to a
roundish point or peduncle. The two shoulders are well shaped,
symmetrical, and sharp. This seems to constitute a very serviceable
type of stone head for lance, spear or dart, without being too bulky
as the average length is about 6 or 7 centimeters.
The Solutrean people, known to be great hunters and warriors,
developed in France and especially in Northern Spain, a remarkable
variety of weapon points of the finest appearance; in fact the best
for the whole Palaeolithic period.
We know that the Magdalenians of France and neighboring districts used the propulsor to throw their javelins and assagais farther,
and several examples of dlese, beautifully carved in animal forms,
are the precious possessions of European museums. But as these
later Palaeolithic people reached a high degree of proficiency at
manufacturing points and harpoons of bone and horn, they rather
neglected their stone industry. We have nearly nothing to show as
flint weapon points of that cultural phase except, strangely enough,
a few small and roughly shaped shouldered points of Aurignacian
type, similar to the Font Robert style, and coming from late Magdalenian deposits. Was it a local revival of an older tradition or
was it due to the survival of remnants of an ancient Aurignacian
tribe?
Since nothing remains of any importance to say about the stone

148

weapon points of the Old Stone Age and not intending to discuss
the bone points of Upper Palaeolithic times, it may be an opportunity to compare our American Yuma-Folsom points with those of
Solutrean culture which they constantly bring to mind.

There is no

need here to arsme of their relative antiquhy, nor mention their ever
extending distribution in North America.

The only points of com-

parison to be taken up here are those of technique and typology.

These beautiful artifacts, both of the New and the Old World,
were made by the pressure method. The typical Yuma points of
our Western Plains are just as skilfully flaked and shaped as the
best Solutrean laurel-leaf and willow-leaf blades of Western
Europe, and nothing is more like the long triangular "pointes a
eran" of Southwestern France than our "type 3" Yuma points, with

their slender blades, sharp tips, fine ribbon like flaking, except for
the style of the base.

Shape, proportions, symmetric outline~ beau-

tiful appearance, are of equal perfection.

In the same manner

could our Yuma blades of "type 2" with concave base be compared
with the best specimens of the Cantabrian type of Northwestern
Spain. The laurel-leaf blades of the classical Solutrean are of the
types of longer and broader Yuma-like points of the Mid-West, such
as some which I haw seen in collections exhibited at St. Louis and
New Orleans, except that the French artifacts have a convex and
even pointed base. Some of the narrower and sharper weapon
points of Northwestern Spain also have a roundish base. The convex base line, our Type D, is rare in the west; my survey shows only
3.44 per cent for the Yuma points examined, and none, of course,
for the Folsom class. The straight base line or Type A, rare for
Folsom, is much more frequent 31.03 per cent, for Yuma points,
especially our types 2 and 3. Some Solutrean points from the As.
turias have a base approximating the straight line. But, by far the
most frequent are those with a base more or less concave and even
deeply notched, such as those of Cantabrian type. This was more
favorable for a secure hafting and so we find 65.5 per cent of our
Yuma points and 86 per cent of the Folsom points examined with
that Type B base. Our Type C, squarish or wavy in contour found
in 11.84 per cent of the Folsom points, is seen neither on Yuma,
nor on European points.
But the principal interest in the comparison of these remarkably
similar weapon points from the two continents rests with the observation of the devices experimented with in an effort to obtain a
better mounting of the stone heads on wooden shafts. Thus the
French and Spanish invention of a lateral stem or peduncle, either
rudimentary as in the Cantabrian type, or longer as seen on the
small points from Cueto de la Mina, in the Asturias, or fully developed to one-half the total length of the artifact, as in the French
type, is entirely without equivalent in America. The second kind
of stem, a narrower base in the same axis as the blade, was known
to the Solutrean of Northeastern Spain, in the form of the Catalonian
point. In Nevada caves have been discovered points approximating
this type but with a much less developed projection of the base, a
mere embryonic stem.

152

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

The Yuma points evolved two types of stemmed blades which
may be considered as variants of the Catalonian style. The first
kind was produced on a blade of type 1 or more often of type 2 by
r~lucing the width of the lower fifth or so of the point by one, two,
or three millimeters on each side, straight down to the base line,
which, in this 4-b sub-type, is most frequently straight, exactly 57
per cent, or slightly concave, 22.44 per cent of the time, less often
deeply concave, or convex. The specimens of this kind are generally of fine workmanship and good proportions, which should be
expected in a later and more advanced stage of development. In
fact they are found longer than the simpler and possibly older types.
Another stemmed class, our sub-type 4-a, consists of a lanceotate
point, with rounded shoulders and a narrower and often thicker
stem. This kind of weapon point is nowhere important and its
distribution does not seem general. The differences between the
two stemmed sub-types are in accordance with the kind of blades
which they complete to assist in their halting. The stem of 4-b
is broad and thin to match similar proportions of blades of type
1 and 2; the peduncle of 4-a is narrow and thick to go with a blade
body more of the kind of type 3-a. Such are the stem types of comparable weapon points of Europe and America. The North American stemmed Yuma points are more directly in the line of evolution of the javelin and assagais and lance heads to develop later
both in the New and the Old World, in stone, and to be supplanted
by metal forms in the Eastern hemisphere.
We have seen that concave bases were common to some Solutrean

points and many Yuma-Folsom points. However, an exclusively
American development is witnessed in the formation of the classical
Folsorn points. It seems to have evolved somewhat in the following
fashion. Taking for instance a Yuma point of type 1 or 2, with
concave base, in order to facilitate halting the contour of the base
was made thin by careful marginal retouch. This does not affect
the type yet. Then we observe specimens with one, or several narrow flakes, of irregular, but limited length, taken off from the base
line upward, obviously to help further the setting of the point in a
wooden shaft. This is a development of a new phase of the thinning
of the base over a more extended area, not exceeding one-third of the
total len~h of the piece. This is our sub-type 5-a. Then, and pos-

Flaked Weapon Points

153

sibly later, the ancient stone worker, more daring and more skilful,
produced a broader and longer groove, reaching about half way
the distance be.tween the concave base line and the tip of the point.
It is our sub-type 5-b. In this phase the groove is still often irregular in shape and size, not symmetrical on both faces, and even
sometimes missing on one face. This probably was due to fear of
an accident in thinning out excessively the body of the blade. At
this stage one understands that the grooving was not only helpful
in hafting, but it reduced the weight of the missile, which ma~, be
considered an advantage. With time and practice the groove seems
to have grown in size and in both length and width, now covering
approximately two-thirds of the length of the specimens in our subtype 5-c, the better known type of Folsom points. The groove, in
some cases, is still irregular, but more often it is regularly shaped,
and similar on both faces. It follows the form of the blade, leaving a thicker marginal ridge, while reducing the thickness of the
body of the piece. The cross-section of such a specimen is bi-concave
as a consequence. The base line is either deeply concave, or
squarish, or even wavy, and the lateral points or corners of the base
are frequently sharp and relatively long, aImost like barbs. It is
the now classical and first found Folsom type, apparently the final
phase of a typological evolution from a plain Yuma point, with
thinning of the concave base, progressive lengthening of the basal
flaking into a groove increasingly broad, long and regular, as evidenced by the many intermediate steps seen on a large number of
specimens. Sometimes the workman shot beyond his mark and the
groove, at least on one side, goes the full length of the blade, and
covers the larger part of the surface obliterating most of the original
flaking as seen on the Yuma specimens. There is no doubt that it
reduced greatly the thickness and weight of the point. Supposing
that it was a real advantage for a weapon point, it seems to have
gone too far, for the excess of the thinning of the body of the piece
caused its weakness. This is proved by the large number of Folsom
points found in fragmentary condition. In the impact, the tip of
the point was broken or even more frequently the ba~ part which
held in the shaft, is found, while the rest of the blade went another
way, remaining in the body of the animal shot, or lost later. This
weakness may be the reason that so many of the true Folsom points
are much shorter than all the other types, in fact 10 to 20 millimeters

154

Texas AreheologicaI and Paleontological Society

less than the mean length of the other types, as the shortening
reduced its fragility. It may also have contributed to its final abandonment.
Such are the American weapon points comparable to the Solutrean
types of Western Europe, their common flatness and their special
characteristics.

The fine pressure flaking seen on those Old and

New World points appears only sporadically in time and space.
These are a few of the best examples that may be quoted.

The

stemless lance points of Neolithic times in France, are often long,
narrow, uniface blades, showing very little retouching and their
cross-section is either triangular or trapezoidal.

Except for their

slenderness, 20 to 25 centimeters in length by 3 or 4 in width, they
are of little interest.

But one kind, found in Northern France, is

piano-convex in section, and beautifully flaked by the pressure
method. The whole dorsal face is covered with narrow, parallel
flake channels, extending obliquely from edge to edge.

This recalls

closely many of our Yuma points, except that the American specimens are bi-face blades. There are also shorter stemmed lance heads,
uniface and with triangular body and well formed peduncle. But
the ribbon-like flaking is nowhere found finer or more extensively
used than on the numerous Danish daggers.

These remarkable

biface flint weapons are sharp pointed, symmetrical in shape and
with well retouched edges.

The earlier ones consist simply of a

blade progressively narrowing toward the base.

Others have a dis-

tinct stem, fairly long, and sometimes less carefully flaked than the
body of the blade.

Still others of a later pha~ and they usually

are the best finished, have a leaf-shaped blade with a well fashioned
handle of quadrangular cross section owing to a median ridge.

The

base line is straight and the corners of the base are often sharp.
They look more like metal daggers than one piece stone weapons.
Other Danish artifacts of the same Robenhausian period display the
same characteristic and perfect flaking.

Some elegant dagger and

knife blades from prehistoric Egypt show the same flaking technique
and perfection of execution.

All these remarkable examples represent the highest skill in flint
work during late Palaeolithic and Neolithic times; the incoming
metals prevented their repetition. Fine pressure flaking after that

a while. The consideration of these smaller projectile points will
bring us back to the Mesolithie period when they started in Western
and Northern Europe.
The Mesollt~ic or middle stone age is thus called because it is a
period of transition between the Old and the New Stone Age. It
comprises survivals of the preceding cultures under the name of
Epi-palaeolithic, and as Proto-neolithie it also contains some new
industries foreshadowing the fully characterized New Stone Age.
A very curious point is that, as far as arrowheads are concerned,
it presented us with two entirely different types, foreign to each
other, as well as a new and composite kind of bone and flint point.
Several of the Mesolithie industries were wholly or partly composed of mieroliths or pigmy flints.

One of these is trapezoidal in

form and often called "petit tranchet" after the ax-like tranehet of
larger dimensions, one of the typical tools of the Campignan Culture. This "petit tranchet," as the British and French authors call
it, was mounted at the end of a light shaft and used as a projectile
point.

It is then properly designated as a "transverse arrow.head,"

a most unexpected form.

Th~ Font Robert points, whether "pointe

a cran" or "pointe a sole," had been the proto-type of what was to
become the universal type of arrow-heads, that is to say, essentially,
a triangular point with sharp tip.

Here, on the contrary and with-

out root in any known typologic tradition, we have a weapon point
with a cutting straight-end, and a single bevel, somewhat like a fragment of a safety-razor blade.

The body is more or less elongated,

narrower than the working edge, sometimes constricted, and ending
in an indifferently shaped base line, straight, oblique or irregular.
This extremity is thin to fit into the notch or groove of the wooden
shaft, to which it is made secure by means of animal sinew or bast
fibre according to places. Only the lateral edges show small flaking
retouches. This type of transverse arrowhead is found in fair number in the shell-heaps or kitchen-middens of the Ertebolle culture of
Denmark and Northern Germany, during the Period III of MesolithiC, that is to say around 4,000 B. C.

But they are not special

to that section, and their distribution is very extensive.

They have

been found in European countries as far east as Poland, north as
Jutland, west as Belgium and Southeastern England, south as Portugal and in the Capsian middens of Algeria as well as in Egypt.

156

Texa~ ArcheologicaI and Paleontological Society

Microlithic trapezoid flints are known in some phases of French
and Belgian Tardenoisian as well as other geometric forms, some
of them used in making certain specialized weapons.

They consist

in a bone point, of round or flattish cross-section, about 18 centimeters in length and provided with a bilateral armature of pigmy
flints set in a longitudinal groove. The cutting edges of the microllths a few millimeters out in a discontinued line forming short
oblique barbs on both sides. This, together with the sharp tip of
the bone shaft, makes it look like an efficient weapon. Five types
of these "slotted points with ]lint insets," as they are sometimes
designated, were in use in the Maglemose culture, which flourished
during the Period II of the Mesolithic, about 6000 B. C., in Northern
Europe.
We are coming back now to the ancestral form of the more recent
arrowhead, and it is because of this typological relation that we’ll
consider it last although it led us to follow a reversed chronological
order. During the Period I of the Mesolithic, when the temperature
of the pre~boreal climatic phase was rising gradually but rapidly,
several cultures appeared in the Northern Plains of Germany and
extended from Belgium to Poland. Only recently have they been
better known and coordinated under the general label of "tangedpoint cultures." This suggests what is one of their leading characteristics and the weapon point common to them all. They present
various forms even within the limit of a single culture, besides local
variations. They do not seem standardized nor falling into easily
classifiable sub-types. In general appearance they have a roughly
triangular body with a fairly sharp tip, some sort of a tang or
peduncle of length and shape often different with each specimen.
These points range from 2.5 to 5 centimeters in length and in Jutland
rare pieces reach 7 centimeters. The stem is produced by secondary
flaking along both edges of the lower part of the flake and usually
showing on the dorsal face. The body of the point either remains
untouched or, more frequently, one edge is blunted obliquely along
a part or all of one side, indifferently right or left. These tang
points recall immediately the older Font Robert points of Aurignacian VI. What is exactly the relation existing between the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic projectile points is not clear. Is it a
coincidence, a case of convergence or a survival?

Flaked Weapon Points

We have already noticed that points much like the original Aurignacian Font Robert type reappeared in late Magdalenian, a phase
immediately preceding the Mesolithic stage, and possibly linking
the Palaeolithic tradition with the tanged point cultures of Early
Mesolithic. On the other hand, to the south of their area of distribution the presence of a similar stemmed point is known in
Moravian loess stations, or at least at Predmont, site of the special
facies of Central Europe Aurignacian. This, however, seems to be
a less likely place of origin.
It is interesting to note that the tanged point survived in Norway
through the Periods II and III of the Mesolithic. The later axe cultures coming from the South influenced the more primitive aboriginal people but in retura they borrowed from them the tanged point
which in their hands became the triangular flake arrowhead, practically in the forms known ever since.
The Neolithic period comprises a variety of cultures even if we
only consider Europe. As expected, the typology and quality of
workmanship of the weapon points of that time are equally varied.
It may suffice for our purpose to mention three main classes. First,
the class of the largest artifacts is that of the lance heads. They
are generally of the elongated blade type, without distinct stem, only,
in many cases, the progressive "narrowing the lower parts formed
a pointed or roundish base. A few have a slightly concave base line.
Some recall, in the more sl~nder shape, the classical Solutrean blade,
others are closer to certain Yuma types. They usually are biface
artifacts. However, the fine, rlbbon-like, pressure flaking does not
always cover entirely the two faces of the blade. In many instances
this is reserved for marginal retouch while the rest of the surface
is either more roughly flaked or even left as struck off from the
prepared nucleus. They are all of the blade type, with nearly
straight or slightly convex sides; a few have serrated edges.
The second group is that of the javelin class. These points are
often smaller or at least lighter than those made to head the stouter
shafts of lances. They are not essentially different from them in
shape and in type and quality of flaking, but a few are uniface and
others have a stem and even lateral notches to fasten them more
securely to the shaft. Some are very narrow and of elegant shape,

158

especially certain specimens from iNorway, and made of siliceous
schist or slaty material, and others from Russia were made of bone.
Those two kinds, of course, are not flaked. They display a longitudinal dorsal and ventral ridge giving them a lozengic cross-section.
The sharpness of the tip and slenderness of the body must hive
endowed them with a great quality of penetration.
The arrow-heazls constitute the third group of weapon points.
There are an enormous variety of shapes, some showing exaggerations of form which could not survive long nor come into general
use. They are frequently skilfully shaped and flaked by the pressure method, sometimes, however, leaving a fraction of the original
flake surface unretouched. It is useless to go into a description
of their endless varieties. Some prehistorians merely classify them
into three main classes which might be named after their positive
or negative characteristics. Thus, the simplest kind is stemless and
barbless; the second, is stemmed but still barbless; the last one
has both stem and barbs. To the first group belong arrowheads of
triangular, lozengic, ovoid forms or leaf shaped. Their base lines
may be straight, or more or less convex or concave. The second
group comprises arrowheads with a stem either narrow or broad;

in the latter case it often is notched on both sides to help in halting.
The edges of those stemmed points are straight, rarely concave, more
often slightly convex which gives them an oval contour. The barbs
of the last kind’vary greatly in shape and size. Some are the results
of the triangular arrowhead being notched at the base to form a
short stem. Other barbs are turned down and square at the end.
Still others are long, slender, and sharp. Some of this kind are
often seen on arrowheads with a deeply concave base. They are
numerous in Egypt but also found in Portugal and Southern France.
It has been noticed that arrowheads are less frequently found in
Northern Europe, that is in Scandinavia and Germany, than in
France, for instance. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish with
certainty between a large arrowhead and a small javelin point, and
also between a strong javelin point and a lance head.
All that which has been said here for the Neolithic weapon points
could be stated with equal truth of the American artifacts of the
same or corresponding kinds. The grouping into lance, javelin or
dart, and arrow heads could also be employed since those weapons
were also in use in prehistoric, and even in historic, times in the
New World. The atlatl or propulsor was common in the Western
Hemisphere before the use of the bow, the same as it is known to
have existed in the late Palaeolithie of Western Europe.
The classes above reported for the Neolithic arrowheads could
also be accepted for the Indian projectile points, unless one would
prefer the classification which I proposed elsewhere, some time ago.
It is about as simple and refers only to the base type since the
pointed form of the body of the arrowhead is essentially functional
and not a source of differences. My classification, which has been
used speedily to sort out thousands of arrowheads, is practical and
easy to learn. It allows any number of subdivisions able to answer
all possibilities. It comprises only three main types: 1. Stemless,
the same as for Neolithic points; 2. Stemmed, again similar to Neolithic.classification, but regardless of the presence of barbs; 3. Based
points, this being different and necessary to take care of its relatively
large class of generally fine arrowheads found in America. The
reason why I dropped the barbs as an element of classification is
because otherwise it would be found in two classes, as in the case
for the Neolithic system. Besides, I do not consider it as a primary

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

162

characteristic; it can be indicated as a supplementary descriptive
element, if desired, in either the first or the second class. Third, it
introduces another factor as a criterion of classification, whereas I
use exclusively the type of base.
Thus the first type covers all arrowheads without any stem.

The

base can be straight, convex or concave; the form may be triangular,
lozengic, ovoid or leaf shape; all exactly the same for Indian arrowheads as for Old World projectile points.

The second type com-

prises all arrowheads with a stem, that is to say a basal projection
narrower than the width of the body of the point proper.

This stem

may be short or long, narrow or large, and of any shape.

The

sides of these first two types may be straight, convex, or concave;
the edges may be serrated; barbs of any kind may be present or not.
All this is secondary.
The third and last type is called based points, because the base
is broader than the maximum width of the body of the arrowheads.
It is its main feature, always accompanied by notches. They are
either lateral notches, usually round, and seen on the edges of the
point, to keep in place the fastening holding the stone head on the
shaft.

A sub-type displays both lateral and basal notches for the

same purpose.

Here again the shape of the side and the base of

the point, straight, concave, convex, serrated or not, does not affect
the type.
This simple classification, admitting of endless sub-types based
on secondary features, has easily taken care of all forms found in a
dozen years of archaeological survey and of classifying of thousands
of arrowheads.
As to the relative antiquity of the various types of arrowheads and
other weapon points, and their sequence, it would require a comprehensive survey of different cultures over vast areas or several
continents, coordinating stratigraphie finds of many sites or the
dating of types by their association with archaeological remains of
known periods.

As far as I know, no such sutwe~, of sufficient

amplitude has ever been attempted to furnish reliahle data concerning the relative chronology of arrowhead types, or the order
of their appearance in various areas, or the respective distribution
of those types at different times.

Typologically it may be suggested

Flaked Weapon Points

163

that the likely sequence, on the basis of the general principle often
illustrated in the evolution of stone artifacts that the development
proceeds from.simple and undifferentiated towards more complex
and specialized forms, may have been the following; first, a roughly
triangular type, without stem or barb, would appear, that is to
say a flake with a pointed tip and more or less sharp edges, the base
line being somewhat indifferent provided it could be attached to
the slotted end of a stick or shaft. The refinement of better finish
would come later with experience proving its advantage. This might
comprise a thinner and more regularly flaked body, more symmetrical shape, sharper tip and edges. The base line could be modified
into two directions. By making it concave it might help in hafting,
and by extending the corners of the bass thus set in relief, the idea
of barbs would naturally evolve. Some Egyptian arrowheads display the extreme development of this line of evolution. On the
other hand, the base could be made convex thus leading towards the
oval or leaf-shaped points numerous in some cultures. A variety of
this change would produce a sort of projection in the median section
of the base line thus creating the sub-lozengic pointed blades of the
Solutrean and other cultures, or else the points with a broad, flat
and roundish or pointed stem or peduncle such as the Catalonian
variety and others. In another manner a double notch on the base
line would form a small and narrow stem in the median axis of the
point. Once the usefulness of this stem had been recognized in
facilitating hafting, this stem would easily be lengthened and develop
a variety of shapes. The corners of the base could either be left
straight, or made oblique and pointed, long and sharp, and again
the barbs would thus result. If, instead of an arrowhead evolving
from a flake, the evolution took place on a blade, as seen in the
Aurignacian, then one edge was flaked obliquely towards the other
and the lower part of the original blade came to form a tang.
If both edges were flaked to reduce the width of the lower section of
the blade, a stem or peduncle would have resulted. The shoulders
thus formed could have been rounded as in the lanceolate points, or
else cut square as in certain Yuma points, or made sharp and pointed
as seen in many cases. The early steps of this evolution were witnessed in the final phase of the Aurignacian, giving us the Font
Robert points. The other and more advanced stages were also actual
occurrences seen in several cultures. The lateral base stem, as

164

Texas Archeologica. I and Paleontological Society

exemplified by the French and Cantabrian points of Solutrean times,
not being very practical was soon abandoned. The middle base stem,
giving better balance to the weapon point, being found much more
satisfactory su~’ived and multiplied. In fact it became the most
common for lance heads, dart and javelin points, as well as arrowheads on both hemispheres. The Folsom solution, reducing excessively the strength of the point, was also given up.
But there is still a possibility. Restarting with our original triangular flake the problem of hafting securely the stone head on the
wooden shaft tip, and avoiding the weakness of a narrow and fragile
stem, two small notches were flaked off the lateral edges of the
point, leaving the base line, whether straight or concave, the widest
part of the specimen. Probably satisfied with the result, another
notch was added, this time on the base line. These two sub-types,
being apparently more complex and specialized, may well have been
the last to evolve. They usually are less numerous than the others
in most collections, especially of earlier cultures, and, besides, they
often are among the best shaped and flaked. All this, in the measure
that it proves true, clearly suggests a later appearance.
Such may have been, roughly speaking, the general line of evolution of the weapon points and especially of the arrowheads, and
the possible chronological order of their development. But this
logical supposition is merely based on typological grounds and
some other observations. The scientific and objective demonstration
remains to be done; however, it may serve as a guiding thought.
A question arises. Were the various types of weapon points
selected for di]]~rent purposes? This is difficult, if not impossible,
to answer satisfactorily. We choose different kinds of guns and projectiles according to the game which we intend to hunt and a hunting gun is different in some respects from a military rifle. To
what extent, primitive peoples in the Stone Age selected their types
of weapon points to suit their purposes, is hard to t.e.lh Obviously
small arrowheads would have been chosen to kill birds and small
game, whereas stout points would have been! used to arm lance and
javelin for hunting big game. But for the minor peculiarities of
shape of the point and of the base type nobody can answer. Some
call the triangular arrowheads, war points; it may be correct.

Flaked Weapon Points

165

It is often asked whether the di]]erent kinds of arrowheads were
made by dif]erent tribes and so whether we can name the tribes
having produced this or that type of points. Personally I cannot
tell although it can be admitted that certain tribes had a preference
for special forms of arrowheads. This happens for other artifacts
and therefore it is perfectly admi~ible for weapon points. A survey
of the types of points found in collections, private and public, with
the knowledge of the origin of the specimens, and conducted over a
vast territory, has led to conclusive observations based on several
thousand pieces. It showed the evident preference of a certain type
of arrowhead over the others in a whole region, whereas the selection was very different in a neighboring district. A quotation from
another study will illustrate this point. "The stemless points were
used almost in equal proportions in Wyoming, 6.78 per cent, in
New Mexico, 8.22 per cent, in Colorado, 9.46 per cent, or a range
of less than 3 per cent, while in Western Nebraska it reaches the
very high percentage of 30.79. The stemmed points show a similar
difference between the other three states and Nebraska. This is
clearly revealed by the following figures: New Mexico, 72.14 per
cent, Wyoming, 75.31 per cent, and Colorado 78.45 per cent. This
shows that this second type of arrowhead was greatly preferred to
all others by the Indians of the High West Plains, whereas in Nebraska it drops to the relatively low level of 22.91 per cent. This
is only some 6 per cent between minimum and maximum use of the
three Western States, while a gap of about 50 points separates Nebraska from the others."
"The first sub-type of based points, that with lateral notches,
shows the same grouping: Colorado, 10.01 per cent, Wyoming, 14.66
per cent, and New Mexico, 16.44 per cent, or slightly less than 6.5
per cent difference between them. On the other hand this class of
arrowheads was the one preferred in Nebraska where it reaches the
percentage of 34.85, a third wide divergency."
"The last is the second sub-type of base points, with both lateral
and basal notches. We see the following low ratios. In Colorado
there are 2.06 per cent, in New Mexico, 3.18 per cent, and in Wyoming 3.35 per cent; only a 1.50 per cent difference. Although low,
Western Nebraska, with 11.38 per cent, is far above these figures."
Now, these differences consistently grouping Wyoming, Colorado,

166

Texa~ Archeological and P~eon~ologicaI Society

and’ New Mexico together and placing Western Nebraska apart, are
real and objective. They have also been tested on other grounds
such as the proportions of side-scrapers, end-scrapers, etc., in the
same state. Are they cultural differences, or do they represent tribal
typologic traditions, which, in part, is also cultural? At any rate
they, at least, indicate a choice in the use of types of arrowheads
and it is as far as I can answer the question of relation of culture,
or tribes, to weapon point types.
I have heard it said that the Indians, so often considered inferior
to the Europeans, were ahead of them in the matter of arrowheads.
Ii this means a greater variety of forms or better skill in shaping,
it is to be doubted. Such a judgment reflects the experience of the
enthusiastic collectors of Indian arrowheads who are often ill informed as to Old World archeology. If it means, as I understand
from some reading, that the prehistoric Americans have evolved
weapon points before the peoples of Europe, not to speak of Asia
and Africa, this also does not seem correct. For such an unexpected
assertion seems only based on recent studies of Texas cultures, the
ages of which are not yet clearly and absolutely established and,
therefore, no safe comparison of typology and antiquity can yet
have been made leading to conclusion of priority for the New World.
It may suffice to recall that the usual type of triangular body and
stem of most weapon points, and arrowheads in particular, was
already known in the Font Robert points of final Aurignacian. The
beautiful Solutrean points followed with a variety of forms, paralleled by our Yuma-Folsom points, as to typology and technique,
but not of equal age. The tanged points of Mesolithic although of
poor shape were apparently satisfactory as their range is considerable. The arrowheads, lance points, and javelin points of Neolithic
time are quite numerous and varied, as well as skilfully made. Th.ey
can stand comparison with those of the New World.
Moreover, it must not be forgotten that during late Palaeolithic
and Mesolithic. there were two different traditions in Europe. Side
by side with the weapon points made of flint, and at times submerging that kind, there was a strong tradition of bone points. These.
began earIy in Aurignacian and developed several successive types
showing different improvements in regard to hafting, the constant
problem already seen elsewhere. Eclipsed by the perfection of flake

Flaked Weapon Points

167

work during Solutrean, they came back in full force with the Magdalenian. Halfway through that period they evolved into several types
of harpoons, reindeer antlers, being often substituted for bone. The
harpoon degefferated with the Azilian due in part at least to poor
material. But it reappeared with Maglemosian together with a large
variety of types of bone points. We have seen that in the Ertebolle
culture, which followed, the union of microlithic flint Trapezes and
of the slotted bone point produced a new and efficient weapon.
Thus, if there is any comparison made as to the greater antiquity
and variety of the weapon points, the Old World, on both counts,
seems to have the advantage over America. This is no reflection on
the intelligence and inventivity of the prehistoric Indians. They
were entirely isolated, as well as handicapped by other conditions.
They had to be autochthonous in most of their inventions. The
Europeans, on the contrary, were in contact with centers of cultures
both in Asia and in Africa. Migrations from other continents
brought new men, new ideas, new artifacts. Ethnic movements and
cultural currents account for many of the apparent advantages of
prehistoric Europeans ai~d the more rapid developme~nt of their
cultures and civilizations. Yet Early Aurignacian, not to speak of
Mousterian, is much earlier than the time of the first American
weapon points so far known.

Triangular Points of Red River County

169

TRIANGULAR POINTS OF RED RIVER
COUNTY
BY

GEORGE T. W~HT

In the 1935 issue of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological
Society’s Bulletin, an article by Walter R. Goldschmidt entitled
"A Report on the Archeo!ogy of Titus County in East Texas," says
in part:
"In East Texas, in Titus, Camp, Morris, Upshur and Harrison
Counties, there is found in graves a peculiar type of arrow
point, which is seldom if ever found on the surface. They are
finely chipped chert points of triangular form with keen edges,
smooth surfaces and no tang."
Although this article is five years old, it is probable that many
collectors are unacquainted with these little artifacts in all their
various forms. Their occurrence as surface finds in the northern
part of East Texas, adjacent to Titus County, as well as a full description of them, should prove of interest.
While, occasionally, beautiful specimens of triangular arrowheads are found in graves in Red River County, others just as fine
occur as surface finds. These surface finds are by no means rare
in this County, although their occurrence in any numbers seems to be
confined to a very few localities along Red River. There, particularly in the campsites that lie along the terrace, that divides the
first bottom from the second, they may be found more or less frequently from one side of the County to the other. The creeks and
bayous of the interior, as well as Sulphur River on the south, contribute a small share which do not show such great variety in form
as those found along Red River.
One campsite in particular, situated between two Indian mounds
about 300 yards apart, has yielded almost nothing else in the way
of arrowheads but small points; and, of these, some 75 per cent were
of the triangular form. Other surface finds in this campsite show
n6 marked difference from those found elsewhere along Red River.
Here also have been found four graves, at the depth of a spade
blade, one of which had five perfectly made triangular points

170

Texas Archeological and Pa!.eontological Society

buried with the skeleton; also two isolated clay pots with which so
far as could be determined, were no skeletal remains.
Various kinds of rock were used, the only essential seems to have
been that such stone flaked well. However, a slight preference
seems to have been shown a shiny-looking, dark gray, imported
flint which may be either translucent or opaque. When finished,
these small projectile points were well made, quite thin, and usually
had sharp points and edges and often decided barbs. Sometimes, as
in all small points, one face was perfectly finished and the reverse
chipped but slightly; but, as a rule, both faces were equally well
worked. As one goes south from Red River he finds little rock that
would work well into artifacts. Here the Indians used dark, coarsegrained pebbles, which they found on the hillsides, for much of their
lithic needs. From these they fashioned a few triangular arrowheads, but in these the flaking technique sometimes differed from
that in general use in that the chips removed were often broad and
flat and few in number. This left the edges of the finished piece
scalloped or jagged and the face with low, wide ridges on it. This
form of chipping occurs all over the County but not to a marked
degree except in the central and southern parts.
At a glance, all these points would seem to have been chipped
from the same pattern; but on closer examination, many different
forms, or types, were found. Their only similarity is the triangular
shape.

The base is usually concave and very thin, which gives the

point a good seat for shafting.

Ninety per cent of all points ex-

amined have this ineurving base, which may lack little of being a
straight line or may be nearly a semi-circle.

Rarely one is found

with the "fish-tail" form of base. The ideal form was that of an
isosceles triangle, in which the base or the edges may have been made
either square or curved.

It is in the edges where the greatest differences occur. By far
the most common form is convex, although these lines may be
straight, concave or a combination of the convex:concave ideas,
thereby giving them a wavy, or reverse-curve shape in which the
expanded base makes definite barbs. Usually, the edge is sharp

and an unbroken line; but it may have fine or coarse serrations, few
in number or as many as the side will hold.
Symmetry was not always preserved. This makes for a mixing
of the types; in fact, true types are scarce. From a detailed study
of over 600 specimens, all from this county, the small triangular
points may be classified into thirteen distinct kinds, as follows:
Type 1. Square base, square edges. (Plate 29, Fig. 1). (Editor’s
Note: All other plate numbers given in this article refer to those in
Plate 29).
Type 2. Square base, convex edges. The edge may be shaped
like a lens, widest at the base (Fig. 2), or widest above the base line
(Figs. 3 and 4), or a straight line which bends abruptly as it nears
the tip (Fig. 5).
Type 3.

Square base, concave edges.

(Fig. 6).

Type 4.

Square base, wavy edges.

Type 5.

Concave base, square edges.

(Fig. 7).
(Figs. 8, 9, 10).

Type 6. Concave base, convex edges. The common type. The
edge may be like one face of a lens, widest at the base (Fig. 11), or
widest above the line of the base (Fig. 13), or square, or nearly so,
drawn in as it approaches the blunt tip (Fig. 12), or drawn in as it
approaches the base (Fig. 14).
Sub-type: One edge longer than the other. It may terminate in
a protruding barb (Figs. 15 and 16), or not (Fig. 17).
Type 7. Concave base, concave edges. (Figs. 18, 19 and 20).
Some of these have bIunt points which gives the piece somewhat the
appearance of having wavy edges.
Type 8. Concave base, wavy edges. (Figs. 21, 22 and 23). These
are the finest and most delicately made of all types. The reverse
curve is very noticeable in the illustrations.
Type 9.
Type 10.

Convex base, square edges.

(Fig. 27).

174

Type 13. This type embraces all symmetrical points whose edges
do not match. (Figs. 33 and 34).
It is doubtful if Types 9, 10, 13[ and 12 should be considered as
these may not have been made primarily for arrowheads. But’they
are included on account of their similarity to the others. All four
types are very rare.
One noticeable fact about these little artifacts is the high percentage of whole points found. While some broken points were dropped
when found, all those that had enough left to show their original
shape were kept. Sixty-five per cent were in the same condition as
when first made. This is considerably above the average for other
unbroken artifacts found and is remarkable considering how fragile
they are.
Some of the types range up to several inches in length but since
some of these were unquestionably knives, scrapers and even spearheads, we consider only those that are light and thin and whose
sizes are most common to all types. Size varies with the type, but
these points may be said to range from 3-8 inch to 1 3-4 inches in
length; and in width usually around a half-inch.
Certain specimens have points and edges deeply worn and perfectly smooth, showing use as drills for hard materials. Others
show all or part of the base worn smooth from use as a scraper.
It may be that in securing these points to the shaft the.y wcre held
in place simply by gum hardened and dried. For better securin~
them, a small number (slightly less than 2 per cent) were carefully
notched in the edges, perpendicular to the long axis o.f the piece.
These notches may be near the base or as much as half way up the
.~ides, and occur only in the square and convex.edged types. They
are found most frequently in the interior. These notches are generally deep and well worked but, in some cases, a slight nick in the
edges suffices; some are quite narrow, others broad. Those with
coarsely serrated edges may also have side notches.
Triangular bird points with a notched base are not found in Red
River County.

CORDAGE OF THE CAVES IN THE GREATER
BIG BEND
BY

VICTOR

There has been much conjecture and some careful investigation
with respect to the place of the Big Bend Cave Culture in the
archaeological setting of the Southwest.

We have believed that "all

Ihe evidence is not yet in" and that detailed studies covering many
angles of the Cave Culture should be made available before satisfactory general conclusions could be reached.
To this end, a part of the program of the Museum at Alpine has
been to publish such contributions from time to time as will make
available to research students materials of value with respect to the
distinguishing characteristics of the ancient peoples.

It is welt also

to make possible certain comparisons with peripheral areas, or
groups at greater distance, which seem to share similar culture traits.
In this article we have turned to a consideration of the cordage
found in the dry caves of the Greater Big Bend in which territory we
include roughly the area from E1 Paso East to Del Rio and from
the Rio Grande Valley North to include the Davis Mountains.

It is

true that bits of string and small rope have, by virtue of their humble
status among more showy specimens, been tossed aside by many
souvenir hunters and sometimes given but scant attention by the
more learned expeditions.

The bibliography following, however,

will indicate an increasing interest in details of information to be
gained by careful observation of the cordage associated with other
materials, as they round out the culture picture in which the real
investigator is most interested.

In this report 3,721 knots and pieces of cordage were studied,
with observations made as to diameter, length, number of strands,
direction of twist, type of fiber, presence of dye, kinds of knots, and
probable use where evidence justified conclusions as to the type of
artifact represented. Throughout this paper it should be kept in
mind that, unless specifically stated, the cordage referred to is
stranded fiber materials, though rough grass used for tying is referred to specifically, especially under the discussion on knots.
A glance at the rather imposing list of uses to which the Cave

176

Texa~ Archeologic~l a~wl Paleontological Society

Dweller put cordage, gives us an increased knowledge as to its
standing as an article of domestic use. It should be remembered,
in looking through this list, that tyro forms of cordage are included:
(1) a rough grass or leaf requiring but scant time or skill in preparation for use, and (2) a carefully prepared material which has been
spun in strands and the strands in turn, t,visted skillfully into serviceable, and neatly assembled cord of considerable strength and uniform diameter.
The use of cordage in basketry (one of its most important uses)
is referred to but not enlarged upon since the subject of cordage in
basketry is the topic of another paper in preparation.
Uses to Which Cordage Was Put
A.

Common throughout the Greater Big Bend:

Used in the assembly of basketry, netting, and cradles.
Binding around sticks, canes, or otherwise for reinforcing strength
of utensils likely to split in use.
Used in th’e assembly and along selvage edge of matting or fiber
mats.

For ties in bundling, carrying, or storing household supplies such
as sage, grasses, sticks, etc.
Thread for sewing gourds, cacti, leaves, and leather.
Sandal ties.
As a base for fur cloth manufacture.
B. Occasionally observed but not universally common in the entire area.
Cord wrapping about shaft (reinforcement).
Cordage assembly of pierced grass sometimes associated with child
burial.
Cord network bag, mesh 3-4 inch to 2 1-2 inches.
Snares.

Repairing baskets.

C.

Rare or.observed in peripheral areas only:

Tied or wrapped stones, charms, weights, muller, points, and
figurines.
Binding leather to wood.
Pouch edged with stitching or tied with cord.
Fiber brush wrapping.
Dyed cordage twined with basket assembly to produce a decorative
woven ring.
Raw Materials Used

While the use of sinew, gut, and rawhide for binding, deserve
mention; such use was comparatively infrequent, and this report
deals only with the cordage manufactured from desert plant fiber.
Throughout the entire Big Bend the leaves of the Agave Lechuguilla
formed the most noticeable source of supply. Many other grasses
and larger plants were utilized, such as the yucca (both fiber and
coarse split leaves), sotol leaves, bear grass, and the finer apocynum.
The writer has believed, however, that the apocynum has been one
of the most over-worked words in general use in reports covering
cordage description in the Southwest. The plant is now rare in
parts of West Texas and some of the softer materials once labeled
by this name have been proved to be dried algae which bleaches out
to a dirty white when exposed to the sun and produces a rather
downy material. Nearly every author reporting has noted that,
while the bulk of cordage is made up of rather coarse fiber, there
is always a small per cent of similar product which has a finer,
softer, more compact fiber but which seems to be subject to more
rapid wear. In this observation we concur entirely, and the proportion of this softer cordage will be noted in our tables. Closely associated with the cordage materials are cactus spine pins and the point

180

Texas Archeological tr.nd Paleonto!ogical Society

from the spanish dagger leaf which makes a satisfactory needle for
use since with the sharp point is an attached frayed fiber which may
be twisted into the sewing thread.
From the following tabulation it will be observed that the size
range of twisted cordage in the Big Bend is from .05 (3-(>4") to .325
(21-64") with a diameter of .075" (5-64") predominating. It
should be said, however, that the unusual number of this diameter
may be misleading in that a large number of short fragments were
measured and that it is altogether probable that rodents have chewed
net bags or other artifacts made from longer pieces of this size, resulting in a strong slant in actual count which may, in the original
number of artifacts, represent a misleading size trend.
The following table represents the tabulated diameter measurements of all twisted cordage actually examined in the museum in
Alpine. It is to be noted that no new or arbitrary size designation
has been set up but that the standard basketry reed nomenclature
has been used as indicated in the following:

Depth Range
A check on the tabulated specimen records for a number of dry
rock shelters indicates a depth range for both twisted string and
coarse knotted cordage of from surface to 2’ 9" deep. This depth
does not intend to imply that others have not" discovered cordage
evidence at much greater depth. The plotted depth distribution,
however, reveals a fairly uniform number of specimens from one to
fifteen inches. After fifteen inches, the number drops off sharply
with few specimens found, so that one might argue their number
could be accounted for by cist, burial, pack rat or other burrowing
animal transfer. Jackson (7) reports that he located most of the
cordage from "upper levels" in Val Verde County.
Process oi Manu]acture

While no such conclusive evidence related to the manufacture of
cordage has been available as has been excavated with Basket_maker
artifacts, the Big Bend materials suggest that desert fibres were
gathered in quantities, soaked or boiled in water, and shredded into
a mass of unworked fiber. From this stock, spinning materials were
selected, cleaned, and spun by rolling or hand manipulation. The
quality and uniformity of this product, considering the crude equipments available, is truly astonishing.
Knots, Bends, and Hitches
In all reports studied the square or reef knot is mentioned most
frequently. For West Texas, this type not only occurs in every one
of the twenty-four sites from which specimens were available for
examination, but it far outnumbers other kinds of knots found. The
following tabulation will indicate the results of the examination of
1240 ends, or hitches. Since Mr. A. T. Jackson has included in his
report some interesting and closely related work with respect to his
excavations in Val Verde County, we are, with the permission of Mr.

Big Bend Cordage Compared with Southwest Basketmaker
In any careful comparison between Southwestern Basketmaker
types of basketry and sandals, the trend of discoveries seems to be
in the direction of a closer relationship than earlier observations
have justified. The same seems to be true with respect to cordage
though the writer has always been more interested in the exact differences between the two cultures than in some of the more evident
similarities such as the use of the atlatl, rabbit stick, and the extensive production of fur cloth. It seems worth while here to note
similarities or differences in the field of cordage study as follows:
Both groups made extensive use of cordage.
Both used cordage in a similar manner for:

187

Fiber string necklaces, sandal ties, aprons, as a base for fur cloth,
in the manufacture of nets and bags, for thread in sewing other
materials, in cradle assembly, in making brushes, in binding and
reinforcing, in fiasketry and mat production, for mending, for making snares, in making basket rests, for wrapping materials to be
stored or carried, for plume and feather binding, and for human
hair cordage. Both of the last two are rare in Texas.
The bulk of the cordage for each is similar in size, twist, and
materials.
It seems evident that similar methods and materials have resulted
in an almost identical product wherever cordage was used in the
Southwest, from the ancient Basketmaker down to the use of desert
materials for various purposes in northern Mexico today.
In both the San Juan and Texas areas cotton is exceedingly rare
or absent and neither of these cultures used any form of spindle
whorl or loom. In both groups the two-strand counter-clockwise
cordage predominates in a size about 3-32" in diameter. Both areas
have produced evidence indicating the use of three, four, five, and
six-strand cords as well as the more common two-strand variety.
The Big Bend cordage is predominantly counter-clockwise in twist.
A small per cent is clockwise. It is interesting to note that Kidder
and Guernsey (5) report the same counter-clockwise twist in their
Basketmaker studies as well as a small amount of clockwise assembly. Nusbaum’s (6) work in Utah was reported as counter-clockwise. While no fiber neck band work similar to typical Basketmaker has, to my knowledge, been found in Texas, in all other respects, such as sizes has been indicated above, the cordage and its
use is almost identical with those described by the authors named
above. In both areas braiding is found but is not common.
In connection with the identification of direction of twist, it should
be noted that some confusion still exists with respect to the descriptive terms "clockwise" and "counter-clockwise." This, no doubt,
is due to the fact that authority by usual method is difficult of interpretation and dictionary illustrations are somewhat incomplete as
they apply to the question at hand. I have here accepted the identification of Dr. A. V. Kidder with respect to the present paper.
Dr. Kidder has kindly identified the Big Bend cordage as pre-

dominantly anti-clockwise.

In this connection it is interesting to

note the reports of other writers:

Jones but which is indicated as a "left handed twist."
Clockwise is defined by Webster as a "right hand circular motion."
Jackson is in agreement with this but all others, including this report, have held to the opposite view.

examination of two bundles of perhaps 50 pieces, of skin wrapped
cordage show~ that practically all of it is spiralled upward to the
left, which you identify as clockwise. In this instance both the skin
wrapping and inner cord is spiralled in the same direction.

I agree with you that Apocynum identifications on Western specimens are to be viewed with suspicion. If the fiber bundles of the

The writer is greatly indebted to Miss Sybil Poteet, West Texas
Museum, Lubbock, for the opportunity to examine her manuscript
report, "A Study of the Cordage and Fibers of Murrah Cave." In
this paper Miss Poteet indicates the results of her study with respect
to cordage found by their field expedition to the Langtry district of
the Big Bend. In order of numbers, Miss Poteet indicates the following knots recovered: square, overhand, half carrick, granny, halfgranny, larkshead, clove hitch, figure of eight, bow, and double
half-hitch.
The master chart upon which all diameters, lengths, knot types,
etc., were recorded, indicates other items of general interest in completing this discussion.
1. The 36 pieces of rawhide fur cloth fragments are 80 per cent
clockwise in twist. In some areas, notably in the Pecos River neighborhood, the inner cord is twisted in the opposite direction from
the rawhide cover. In the Brewster County area, the inner cord and
hide are usually twisted in the same clockwise direction.
2. Forty-nine pieces, at first glance, are four-strand braided assembly. On close examination, however, only six are found to be
true braiding. The others have been called "false plait" because of
the fact that they so closely resemble true plaited cordage. An experiment has developed an explanation as to how this false plait
effect was obtained. If two strands of two-strand cordage are twisted
together tightly and permitted to "spring back," they form a cord
which is not easily detected from true braiding without untwisting
at the end.

West of Alpine.

In conclusion, we observe from a considerable number of typical
specimens that the Big Bend Cave Dwellers over the entire area were
skillful in the manufacture of cordage in a variety of sizes and ingenius in the application of this material to daily use, both in mainraining and repairing implements and in the manufacture of new
ones. In this achievement they bear striking resemblance to Basketmaker cultures as well as other Southwestern groups of more recent
origin but with similar necessities and desert plant supplies.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE
EXCAVATION OF THE
HODGES SITE~
BY JOE BEN

WI~EAT

On January 8, 1940, the Texas Technological College sponsored
W. P. A. Archeological project began excavation in Jones County,
Texas. For a number of years this region has been of growing interest to the archeologist, professional and amateur alike. This interest
has arisen chiefly due to the researches of Dr. Cyrus N. Ray of
Abilene, Texas. In the Bulletins of the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society and in other scientific publications a number of articles (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) concerning the
deeply buried sites of the region have been published. Other contributors to the archeological literature of the area include Dr. J.
Alden Mason (23, 24) of the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Kirk
Bryan (1, 2, 19) of Harvard University, and Mr. E. B. Sayles (21,
22) and Harold S. Gladwin (4) of Gila Pueblo.
From this bulk of material has arisen the problem now confronting us. Dr. Ray first found and described the deeply buried Abilene
region archeological sites as early as 1929 (9, 10, 11). In the years
of 1929 and 1930, Dr. Ray did some excavating but since that time,
his researches have mainly consisted of periodical examination of the
edges of the midden strata for any embedded artifacts which might
be exposed in place by natural erosion of the banks. A number of
such artifacts have been found in sites and have been described by
him from time to time (15, 18, 19). Owing largely to the lack of time
and funds for extensive excavation there existed a need for more
complete examination of these buried sites. As Dr. Ray has said, "The
solution of many of the archeological problems of the Abilene district await the attention of some individual or institution having
sufficient funds and interest in pure science to excavate camp sites
buried from eight to twenty-four to twenty-seven feet deep (!3)."
Regional excavation on a large scale offers the solution to the
problems confronting us. The two main objectives are:

First, since the researches of several persons and institutions have
established the existence of numerous cultures in. the region it becomes necessary to know their sequence and their cultural content.
Second, once the cultural complexes and their sequence have been
established it is necessary to fit them into the frame of other cultures and to define their relationship to such cultures both spatially
and temporally.
With these ideas in mind, after consultation with Drs. Holden
and Ray and others it was decided to begin excavation on a deeply
buried site on the ranch of Mr. S. L. Hodges in the east central
portion of Jones County, Texas. This site was discovered by Dr.
Ray in 1936 (17), and offers one of the best sites in the region insofar as stratigraphic archeology is concerned.
II.
The Hodges site lies on the east bank of the Clear Fork of the
Brazos River about midway between the village of Nugent,
County, Texas, and the confluence of Elm Creek with the Clear
Fork. The site itself consists of five superimposed archeological
horizons at depths varying from five and one-half feet to a maximum of twenty-two feet. The river flows in from a general southwesterly direction, makes a sharp meander to the west and then
~’esumes its gentle northeasterly course. The east bank of the river
rises here thirty feet above the normal river level and in the region
of the meander curve is an abrupt, almost vertical escarpment. Just
beyond the site down stream is a natural shelf of low lying ground
covered with a fine grove of native pecan trees. Immediately across
the river from the site is a low flood plain, covered with grass,
scattered willow and cottonwood trees, which is subject to inundation by occasional rises of the river. Behind this to the west lie the
sand dunes which are covered with post oak and other vegetation.
This area is locally termed the "sbSnnery."
To the east of the site, running in a northerly direction, is an old
slough channel which occasionally holds a pond of rain water.
Beyond this the ground rises to the east where the valley floor

merges with a ridge of low, limestone capped hills which form the
boundary of the valley of the Clear Fork.

At various points along

this ridge of.~hills Dr. Ray has found skeletal remains, which on a
morphological basis have been ascribed to one of the earlier strata of
oecupatlon by Dr. E. A. Hooten of Harvard University (5).
The site, then, lies on and in the highest ground between the "shinnery" on the west and the limestone hills to the east. This situation
should have been ideal from the native point of view, because of the
abundance of water, wood, and food. Both river and land fauna
were probably abundant. The stream must have wandered between
the valley confines, building up the valley floor by slack water
flooding. Aeolian deposition also contributed its part to the valley
filling.
The area chosen for excavation lies in this high ground immediately adjacent to the river which parallels the site to the west. Our
primary operation was to establish a field camp and to map and
dear off the scattered mesquite trees and grass which formed the
vegetal cover.
A primary datum was established (Datum A) and base lines running east and west and north and south through this datum were
staked out. A pit twenty-five feet square (Pit A) was blocked off,
the northwest corner being Datum A. This pit was later lengthened
to the west to open out on the river.
Pit B was established as a stratigraphic pit primarily to ascertain
whether the strata revealed in Pit A were constant.
Pit C was begun for the excavation of a large hearth but enlarged
an order to excavate as much as possible of the lower levels without
the tremendous task of removing all the over-burden of the top
series of soil strata.
Supplementary data points were established for each of the pits
and all measurements, both vertical and horizontal were made from
these points.
All material where possible was screened. Where this was not
possible, the excavated earth was turned over several times to get
ail possible cultural content.

Because of the nature of these deeply buried sites stratigraphical
relationships and analysis assume a very large part of the interpretation of the cultures found in excavation.
At the Hodges site a twenty-six foot deep Pit A. revealed five
definite archeological levels and several different types of soil.
Sterile top soil forms the first five and one-half feet of deposit.
This soil is loose, friable, slightly sandy, and represents the fina!
deposition before the present time. Erosion is going on now though
very slowly. In color the soil is brownish with considerable humic
discoloration. The surface is held by grasses, mesquite trees and
several species of cacti, mostly of the prickly-pear type.
Level No. I (Archaeological) is a sparse midden deposit 1.6 inches
thick showing loose sandy soil with a heavy admixture of charcoal
and other organic material of a habitational nature.
Underlying level No. 1 is 14 inches of soil, sterile of cultural
remains, which is undergoing cementation by the infiltration of silt
from below.
Level No. 2 is a level approximately 8 inches thick composed of
silty soil which has been discolored by both humate and habitational
concentration.
Below level No. 2 lie light red silts, laminated and well compacted to a depth of 22 feet 4 inches. These silts are indurated and
must have been deposited in slack water floods. They must have remained in a static condition at various time intervals as there are
two archaeological levels (No. 3 and No. 4) embedded in the silts.
These levels have the nature of surface camps rather than that of
sites of long habitational duration.
Level No. 3 is at a depth of 15 feet in this silt profile and is a
buried surface camp.
Level No. ¢ is a level in the silt series but occupation must have
been for a somewhat longer period than in level No. 3.

More camp

debris as well as artifacts are evidence leading one to this belief.
Level No. 5 lies on the contact line between the silts above described and the heavier, dark red silts below.

There is no apparent

is in the nature of a surface camp.

203

This level

There are three feet eight inches of the heavy red silts interposed
between level No. 5 and the gravel immediately on the bedrock of
permian limestone.
Dr. Leighton of the Illinois State Geological Survey has in his
work on the region (7), assigned the upper series of silts to the "Elm
Creek," which he places at the end of the Pleistocene. The lower
dark red silts he tentatively concludes to be the Durst belonging to
the Sangamon Interglacial of some 70,000 years ago. These identifications are interesting in the implication of antiquity but should
not be accepted as absolute until much more work has been done.
,On a localized area on top of the gravel were the scattered traces
of a bed of charcoal. That this indicates occupation is conjectural
because no artifacts or other camp debris were found.

IV.
The yield of artifacts per cubic foot of soil removed was extremely low. Too few were found for the isolation of culture complexe.s although two levels yielded enough for a tentative placement.
Of the five levels uncovered three~ yielded specimens other than
hearths.
The paucity of artifacts seems to be characteristic of the area so
far as the buried camp sites are concerned. On the other hand the
artifactual yield of the late surface sites is good though not abundant. This discrepancy between the respective yields of buried and
surface camp sites may be best explained by a consideration of the
fact that in excavation of a buried site one is restricted to search the
area exposed by digging while the collector from a surface site suffers from no such restriction.
Level 1: The artifacts of this level are generally well worked
and represent typical specimens of a hunting-food gathering complex. Included are grinding implements as well as projectile points
and other hunting paraphernalia.
Projectile points: Two projectile points were found at this level.

The second specimen (No. 4, PI. 37a) is a small roughly made
triangular point of medium proportions. The cutting edge~ are
irregular and it is probable that the piece was not finished. The
color is light tan. It is 3 mm long, 26 mm wide and 4 mm thick.
Perforator: This is a small beautifully made specimen of gray
flint showing slight patination on one side and a white incrustation
on the opposite side. Its length is 49 ram, width across the shoulder
14 mm and thickness 4 ram. (No. 2, P1. 37a).

second specimen (No. 2, PI. 37b) is a dark red quartzite pebble
slightly abraded on one face. It has been used also as a hammer
stone. It is 87x72x56 mm. The third piece (No. 3, PI. 37b) is a
fragment of a thick well made highly polished mano of white
quartzite.
Hearths: Three hearths were found in this level. -The average
size is 25 inches in diameter. The hearths are slightly basin shaped
and are composed of more or less flat stones about four to six inches
in diameter.
Level 2:

In this level no artifacts have been found.

few scattered pieces of flint, burnt rocks, et cetera show, however,
that habitation was present. In Pit B a hearth was uncovered at this
level. It was 23 inches in diameter and composed of angular fragments of burn~ stones averaging 2 to 3 inches square.
Level 3: No artifacts mark this level although flint chips, scattered hearth stones and similar debris show habitation.
Level 4: This level, one of the most interesting of the five, has
yielded several artifacts.
Projectile point: The one specimen (No. 1, P1. 37c) is a well
made piece of blue-gray flint which is patinated. The point is
stemmed with a bifurcated base and has asymmetrical edges. One
edge is convex; the other is straight for one-third its length and
concave the rest. It could very well have been used for a small
halted knife rather than a projectile point. Its length is 45 ram,
width 18 ram, thickness 7 ram.
Graver: This is a small specimen (No. 2, P1. 37c) of white flint.
It differs from the Folsom graver (20) type in being larger, but falls
instead into the smaller ones listed by Dr. Ray for the Clear Fork
Culture Complex. The specimen is 25x15x8 mm. The graver projection or beak is 4 mm wide at the base and is 3 mm long from
base to tip.
Side Scraper: This specimen (No. 3, P1. 37c) is of coarse grained
white flint with light tan specks. It is not patinated and its lengah
is 53 ram.
Mise: A fragmentary knife (No. 4, P1. 37c) roughly worked
from a large flake is of blue gray flint with a light tan patination.
Hearth: One of the most important finds of the level was the
very large hearth. This feature was about 15 feet in diameter and
was 11 inches thick at the thickest point. ~: was composed of small
(2 to 3 inch) angular burnt rock fragments which formed nearly
50 per cent of the bulk; charcoal, mussel shells, and burnt earth
comprised the remainder.
Level 5: The lowest definite level occurred at a depth of 22 feet,
four inches. Two artifacts only have come from this level. Neither
are diagnostic and could have been made and used by men of any
culture.

208

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Scraper: This specimen (No. 1, P1. 37d) is a large turtle-back
scraper made of one large flake struck from a flint river boulder.
It is retouched only on one edge although the opposite edge could
have been used without retouching. Its length is 88 ram, width
57 mm and thickness 28 ram. The length of scraping edge is 98 ram.
The second specimen (No. 2, P1. 37d) is a small flake and
scraper made from a single flake struck off a core. The retouching
is extremely fine (22 flakes to a cm) and extends completely across
the end of the specimen. The artifact is of gray flint with light tan
patination. Its length is 44 ram, width 32 ram, and thickness 8 ram.
The length of the scraping edge is 38 ram.
At a depth of 26 feet, lying directly on the gravel, was a concentration of charcoal which might have been the remnants of a hearth.
However, the evidence is not conclusive, so this is disregarded for
the present.

It would be premature to attempt any broad and general conclusions from the data presented by the excavation of the Hodges
Site at the present time. To do so would be to ascribe too much
importance to the site and to the information derived therefrom.
There are, however, some interesting conjectures that may be inferred.
The aspect presented by the artifacts from the top level of occupation is certainly that of a hunting-gathering economy. The stone
work shows a decidedly local tendency in the beveling of the projectile point and the beveled edges of the astrangulated blade. Beveling appears to be a local emphasis applied to numerous objects
and as such is similar to the emphasis placed on beveling in the
Kentucky-Tennessee area although no influence is inferred. These
artifacts are found locally in a number of surface camps and unPLATE 37

doubtedly are pre.white and pre-Comanche in this area. The ground
stone again evidences the localization of this culture.

The manos

are all typical of the surface camp sites and therefore, have comparatively little diagnostic value.
Since level 2 presents only one hearth and no artifacts nothing
can be deduced as to its provenience or relationship to the other
regional cultures.
Level 3 likewise does not yet yield data, and more work must be
done before this gap can be filled in.
The material from the fourth level gives us one of our most
interesting clues as to the migration of culture. This Complex has
a South Central Texas appearance. The projectile point might well
fit into the series of points from the region around Austin. The
large burnt rock hearth seems to be an embryonic burnt rock midden typical of those of the Austin area. The graver falls into the
Clear Fork Complex. A second component of this culture, the
Clear Fork gouge of Dr. Ray (core scraper, Sayles) has been found
in some of the deep mounds of the South Central Texas area. The
number of similarities exhibited by this 4th level culture to the cultures of South Central Texas is str0ngly suggestive of the southern
provenience of the culture (6, 8), though the evidence cannot be accepted as conclusive. (Editorial Note’).
The position of level 5 is a most interesting feature of this site,
lying as it does on the contact surface between the dark red silts
below and the lighter red silts above gives it a position datable
geologically. If the darker silts are the Durst as suggested by
Dr. Leighton occupying the contact zone, then the culture of the Elm
Creek and Durst silts is subject to the lowest date applicable to the
Elm Creek Silts. However, this dating is only tentative and must
await further work before any definite results may be given.

(*Editsorial Note) : The Editor does no/5 believe that Mr. Wheat is
justified in identifying the artifacts from this level as of Clear Fork
Culture because of the finding of one graver. There is much to indicate that gravers were components of several later cultures in the

212

Te~a~ Archeologica~ and Paleontological Society

Abilene region. Neither does the Editor agree with the implication
involved in the above statement that because Clear Fork gouges have
been found by Texas University archeologists in the deeper levels of
the Burnt Rock Mounds that therefore the Culture originated there.
It is true that Clear Fork gouges have been found by the Editor
also in some of the very old, thin, Burnt Rock Mounds of the Abilene
Region. Never~hele~ the great majority of Clear Fork Culture sites
here are totally devoid of signs of Burnt Rock Mounds. The most
characteristic hearth in the older Clear Fork sites is relatively quite
small, usually about three feet in diameter. These hearths are usually
embedded either in hard dark red silt, or in gravel upon the eroded
high terrace levels along small creek branches or gullies which are
now usually dry. Where found along the Brazos they are high up on
the old terraces. If a typical Clear Fo~k gouge has ever been found
at any level in the alluvial deposits in which Mr. Wheat is digging,
the writer never has heard of it.
The artifacts of the older small hearth phase of the Clear Fork
Culture have an early European paleolithic aspect and were definitely
made by a crude percussion technique.
It is this older technically crude phase of the Clear Fork Culture
which is found on old eroded terrace gully surfaces with Folsom and
Yuma points.
The fact that the Burnt Rock Mounds are thin and
not common in the Abilene region, and thick and common in the south
indicates that they lasted longer there. But if the Clear Fork Culture
arose in the south and spread north, it evidently arose in a far older
time period than that represented by the lower Burnt Rock Mound’s
levels. If the culture originated in the south, then the gouge type artifacts probably Would be more abundant there and be found in older
levels, whel~as their place of greatest abundance is located in a region
in and surrounding the mountain mass centering in Taylor, Coke,
Nolan and Mitchell Counties. Here also this culture is often found in
sites unmixed with any other.
While the Editor has previously found one hand axe similar to
the Clear Fork type embedded at a depth of 19 1-2 feet in the Hodges
Site, the fac~ that he has searched the exposed strata of all of the
local deeply buried Brazos river bank stratified sites of this type for
the past twelve years without finding any Clear Fork gouges, planergouges or any projectile points distinctive of this Culture embedded
in them, and that in Mr. Wheat’s extensive excavations none have
been found would indicate that they probably do not belong in that
series of sites.
Definite Clear Fork gouges have been found sparingly in the region
in which Mr. Wheat’s work has been done, but these were either found
on terraces high above the river terraces in which Mr. Wheat is excavating, or on the clay below the sands, in the Sand Dune regions of
Jones County.

EVIDENCE OF THE FOLSOM CULTURE IN
THE SAND DUNES OF WESTERN TEXAS
BY W. C.

FmTzl

AND BERNICE FRITZ2

The writers have been collecting artifacts in this area for about
ten years, mostly from surface camp sites in the sand dune belts.
Some observations have been made in this time that suggest that
these sand dune belts are the remnants of an old drainage system.
This may have a pertinent connection with the finding from time to
time of Folsom artifacts in these sand dune sites.
The point shown in Plate 39, Fig. 1, represents the most perfect
type found to date. This point was found in a shallow sand dune
blowout in northwestern Gaines County and almost on the GainesYoakum County line. Very little evidence was found to indicate a
permanent or even a semi-permanent camp, either in this blowout,
or in the adjacent area. A few pieces of burnt caliche were found
in this site as well as in some of the adjacent blowouts, but were of
such slight concentration, that it would not appear that this site was
in use for any length of time. Also a very few flint chips were
observed in the area. In the site in which this point was found was
one small point which is considered to belong to a much later
culture. It would appear from this association that the point probably was one which had been utilized by a later culture, and had
been transported to the place where found by men using this culture,
rather than by the original owner.
The point shown in Plate 39, Fig. ! is slightly less than 2 1-2
inches in length, and slightly over 1-2 inch in width. The material
from which this point was made is a dark grey flint which appears
to be of a kind suitable for very fine flaking. The long characteristic
central flake extends from the base three-fourths of the length toward the point. This central flake is slightly off center and is not
so well balanced as those in some other points. On the reverse side
the central flake extends approximately one-third the length toward
the point. The flaking on the edges is of typically fine workmanship.

The point shown in Plate 39, Fig. 2 was found in a deep sand duneblow-out in the large sand dunes of eastern Winkler County. The~
dunes have a distinct south to north trend. This had the appearance
of being a permanent camp site with an abundance of burnt caliche,
flint chips, and numerous artifacts, including various types of points
of a presumed much later culture. It is to be considered that Plate
39, Fig. 2 was also utilized by a later culture and was not found in
its exact original area. Plate 39, Fig. 2 is just under 2 inches in
length and slightly over 1-2 inch in width. The material of this
point is a slightly mottled white flint that does not appear as suitable
to fine flaking as the one shown in Plate 39, Fig. 1. The central
flake on Plate 39, Fig. 2 is well balanced on both sides and extends
from the ba~ one-half the distance to the point on one side while
on the reverse side it extends from the base one-fourth the distance
to the point. The flaking on the edges is fine, although not so good
as that of the workmanship of the one shown on Plate 39, Fig. 1.
The re-worked point, Plate 39, Fig. 3, was found by Mrs. Fritz
nine years ago in a deep sand dune blowout camp site in the large
sand dunes of eastern Winkler County, and about four miles south
of where Plate 39, Fig. 2 was found, but in the same trend of dunes.
As with Plate 39, Fig. 2, the point represented by Plate 39, Fig. 3
had associated with it an abundance of evidence of a permanent camp
site. Piles of burnt caliche, numerous artifacts including points of
a presumed later culture, and sherds of Black on White Chupadero
Pueblo pottery were found in this area and site. Plate 39, Fig. 3
has been reworked into a drill, and it is difficult to estimate the
original length of this point. However, the present width is 1 inch,
and it was probably at least 3 1-2 inches long in the original form.
The material of the point shown on Plate 39, Fig. 3 is a light grey
flint which appears to be well suited to fine flaking. The central
flake is the same len~h from the base on both sides, and extends
well toward the point, although the flake is slightly deeper on one
side.
Plate 39, Fig. 4 represents a fragment of a point which was found
in a very large sand dune blowout which had a surface exposure af

caliche, which formed the bottom. The blowout is located in southern Andrews County. The trend of the dunes in this area is eastwest as contrasted to the north-south trending dunes of Winkler
County and’vicinity. This is an unusually large blow-out or series
of blow-outs more or less connected, and shows numerous large and
smaller piles of burnt caliche. An average amount of flint chips
and a very few points of a presumed later culture have been found
here, but not in the quantity to be expected from a camp site of this
size. Also, because of the absence of pottery sherds usually associated with later points in a site of this size, and because of the
presence of several different fragments of points of shape and size
similar to Folsom points, but without the central flake, which are
sometimes referred to as Yuma culture points, together with the
presence of three other Folsom type point fragments would indicate
that this may have been an original Folsom site. Plate 39, Fig. 4
represents the fragment of a point just under 1 inch in width, and
with an estimated length of 3 1-2 inches. While this fragment consists of 1 1-2 inches of the point portion, it does show the central
Jlake to be extremely well balanced, and to extend to within onefourth inch of the point on one side and to within 1-2 inch of the
point on the reverse side, where the perfection of the central flake
is interrupted by a natural flaw in the flint. The material of this
point is a light tan flint of even texture and appears well suited to
fine flaking. The edges show the typica! fine workmanship.
The fragment represented by Plate 39, Fig. 5 was also found in
the same site as Plate 39, Fig. 4, and consists of the base part. This
fragment of the base is 1 1-4 inches long and slightly less than 1 inch
in width. The central flake extends the full length of the fragment
on one side, while the reverse side has only 1-4 inch of central flaking. The central flaking on both sides is well balanced. The
material of this fragment in a dark brown translucent flint, with
slight mottling.
.Plate 39, Fig. 6 represents the fragment of a point also found in
the same site as Plate 39, Figs. 4 and 5. This fragment of the point
portion is 1 inch in length and almost I inch in width, and could be
the point portion of Plate 39, Fig. 5, as it is unquestionably of the
same slightly mottled dark brown translucent flint as Plate 39, Fig.
5, and was from the same site. However, since this fragment shows

222

Texas Archeologieal and P~Ieon$ologieal Society

the central flake on both sides to within one-fourth inch of the point,
while Plate 39, Fig. 5 appeared not to have the central flake that
long on one side, I believe that this is the fragment of a distinctly
different point. The central flake of this specimen is well balanced,
but does not show very fine workmanship along the edges.
Plate 39, Fig. 7 represents a fragment of a point also found in
the same site with Figs. 4, 5 and 6 of the same plate.

This fragment

is slightly less than 1 inch in length and less than 1 inch wide of the
base portion of the point.

This base more closely resembles the base

of those similarly shaped points which were referred to as Yuma
points, both in outline and in thickness at the base, than it does to
the typical Folsom point. However, it definitely has the central
flake on both sides of the fragment throughout its entire length.
The central flake is well balanced, but because of the thiekamss of
the base portion the flaking along the edges does not exhibit the
usual fine workmanship. The material of this fragment is a dense
white flint that does not appear as well suited to flaking as most of
the other fragments.

It is suggested that due to the association of

223

TI-I~. DI~.PLY BURIED GIBSON SITE
B~ C~aus N. P~
The first deeply buried Abilene region sites were discovered by
the writer in January, 1929, in Shackelford County, Texas, at depths
of 6-8 feet below the sell surface, (1), (2).

During the fall of that

year several other exposures at the same depth, and one at 14 feet,
were found in Jones County (3). At the latter place, the Myatt
Site, enough excavation was done in the eight feet stratum to expose
a mineralized recent fauna consisting of beaver, bison, deer, and
antelope and several species of mussels (4). With these were flint
chips and several flint blades.

On an extremely cold Sunday, early in January, 1930, the writer
became restless at confinement indoors and decided to explore some
canyon for evidence despite the weather. In looking about for such
a site he saw what seemed to be a favorable location in the distance.
It proved to be an almost vertical bank thirty feet high, above a
creek which was then dry at that place.
Hearth Over Twenty-]our Feet Deep

As the writer walked down the dry bed and examined the upper
bank levels he saw no midden strata exposed at the usual eight
feet level. On glancing down in front of his feet however he saw
the middle of a large flint blade lying amongst some charcoal and
red silt fragments, which evidently had just fallen from the bank.
Examination of the bank at about four feet from the bottom, showed
the exposed edge of a hearth 40 inches in diameter, which was filled
with charcoal and burnt stones. Soon several other portions of flint
blades, a mane, and a hammerstone were found in the loose gravel
below the bank in position as though they had just fallen out of it.
Three rather distinct levels of charcoal which contained small
hearths were found. The first level at approximately 24 1-2 feet
lay in hard red silt immediately below a stratum of very hard compact gravel (5). During 1930 the writer found embedded in the
charcoal stratum two thick leaf-shaped percussion fractured blades
which had been thinned at the broader end by taking out a flake up
the center of that face. Plate 42, Nos. 16 and 17. These were later

224

Texas Archeologic.al. and Paleontological Society

made the type points of those named by the writer from this Site
in 1934 (6).
Below this level were streaks of charcoal at various places in the
extremely hard red joint clay or silt, and at a depth of about 27
feet below the top soil surface there were more signs of an ancient
occupied level such as hearth rock groupings which were set in
charcoal and a definite thickening in the thin flint flake exposures.
Midden Strata Below Water Line at Thirty Feet
Some outcrops of flint flakes, charcoal and hearths, were found
down to and below the present creek water level at this site, or
approximately 30 feet below the soil surface. The creek is shallow
there, and water does not remain long after rains, so there were
periods when dry weather would permit digging below the creek bed.
The writer has an idea that the charcoal and artifact bearing levels
may extend even farther below the surface than is at present known.
The writer has systematically examined this site after rains for the
intervening period of more than ten years. During most of that
period the results have been disappointing. It is true that hundreds
of flint flakes have been found embedded, numerous hearths have
been exposed, and the charcoal seams have been found to extend
back through the bank at the various levels. The stream is slowly
undercutting the bank, and it is caving off, but the structure is very
dense and hard. Only an estimate can be made, but there perhaps
has been a recession due to cave-offs of as much as five or six feet in
the vertical bank during the past ten years time.
Originally the charcoal seams were exposed over a distance of
125 feet, but for the past six or seven years there has been no erosion
on the southern third of the site. The hard gravel stratum and the
midden levels below it, the "Durst Silts," have been covered by
materials which caved off from the softer later silt levels above,
which now prevents examination of the lower levels.

However the stream has continued to undercut the north portion,
and during the past three years more artifacts have been found em[~dded than at any period since 1930.

Proboscidian Bone Found Embedded
During the summer of 1938 Dr. Kirk Bryan and his assistant
Samuel Vaughan visited this Site and helped the writer excavate a
proboscidian’s leg bone from the gravel stratum near the bottom of
the same creek bank at a measured distance up-stream of 967 feet,
from the main artifact bearing portion (7).*
While there have been no hearths exposed at that particular place,
one was found in the gravel at the same level at an estimated distance of three hundred feet farther up the creek. On September
17th the writer found a well battered flint hammerstone embedded
47 feet upstream from, and at the same level in the gravel stratum
as, the proboscidian bone.
In the loose gravel of the creek bed, opposite to where the proboscidian’s leg bone lay embedded in the gravel stratum, the writer has
found several complete artifacts and numerous man-made flint flakes.
The blade shown in Plate 42, No. 8, was found there in the loose
gravel about a month before the bone was exposed by erosion in the
gravel stratum a few feet distant.
For some reason the site conditions seem to have been generally
unfavorable for the preservation of bone, and the proboscidian’s leg
bone is the only one which has been found.
New Type Point Found by President Jones
Until during the past year no embedded artifacts had been found
which differed from the original thick leaf-shaped paleolithic type
Abilene points, although several other types had been found in the
loose creek bed gravel immediately below where the Gibson Site
strata cave off. See Plate 42, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
The first knowledge that all of the deeper hearth levels might not
contain the same types of artifacts came during the Fall of 1939
when the writer conducted President Clifford Jones and Dr. W. C.
~The estimated distance in the re~vrt in Science, Feb. 24, 1940, of 1500 feet, was
too great.

228

Texas ArcheologicaI awcl Paleontological Society

Holden of Texas Technological College t~> the Site; and while inspecting it, President Jones found a crude projectile point embedded
down near the water level at an approximate depth of thirty feet
trom the soil surface. This point was roughly percussion fractured and had a rounded knob on the end as a haft.

Mano Found Embedded Thirty Feet Deep
At about the same level, 30 feet, and a few months earlier in 1939.
the writer saw about two inches of what resembled the rounded edge
of a mano exposed down near the water’s edge. It was firmly embedded in the hard dark red "Durst Silt" found in the deeper levels
of this site. On excavation, it was found to be a quartzite mano 4 3-4
inches long, 3 7-16 inches wide and 1 6-16 inches thick. See Plate
z].3, Panel A, No. 3 (8). Another paleolithic type leaf-shaped Abilene
point was found immediately below the Gibson hearth strata in
caved-off debris just after a rain in 1939. It is of the same type as
those previously found embedded at a depth of about 24 1-2 feet.
It is 3 1-16 inches long, 1 5-8 inches broad, and eleven-sixteenths of
an inch thick. See Plate 42, No. 1.
ztnother DiHerent New Type o] Point Found
One Sunday morning in July, 1940, the writer found a point of a
type different from any heretofore described from this Site and it
will hereafter be designated as a Gibson point. When found, nearly
an inch of the base projected from the hard red silt at a depth below
the soil surface of twenty-five feet, which is a foot beneath the compact gravel stratum that seems to separate the "Elm Creek Silts"
above from the "Durst Silts" below. Without touching the artifact,
the writer returned to Abilene and informed Dr. Otto O. Watts of
Hardin-Simmons University, and Mr. E. J. Gardiner of the University of Texas, the latter is foreman of a paleontological excavation
project for the Geological Department of Texas University. The two
above mentioned gentlemen came to the site as witnesses of the
discovery, and both Dr. Watts and the writer photographed the point

231

This Gibson point has a re-

cessed base and one round base projection on each side quite similar
to those of the Folsom points. The small flaking up the center of
the recess on one face is only one-fourth of an inch wide and sevensixteenths of an inch on the other. The point is 2 3-16 inches long,
and one inch wide at the widest place, which is eleven-sixteenths of
an inch from the end of the base projections, and from this widest
portion on to the end is a distance of 1 1-2 inches. The point is
bevelled to the right and this bevelling is narrow, being only threeeighths of an inch wide.

From the widest part near the ba~, the

bevelled edges run straight to a point.

The Gibson point is five-

sixteenths of an inch thick. There is a thick gray patina similar to
that on many other Gibson Site flints. See Plate 40, Nos. 1, 2;
Plate 41, Nos. 2 and 3; Plate 42, No. 15.

The workmanship is not near so crude as that of the Abilene
blades found at a depth of 24 1-2 feet in this Site, but it lacks very
much of being considered fine or comparable with either the typical
Yuma, or the Folsom blades. However something similar in workmanship and shape was found on the surface of the eroded McLean
Site in 1938 where typical Folsom and Yuma and generalized crude
channelled points have also been found (9).
Anottver Crude Abilene Blade Found
On August 20th the writer visited the Gibson Site after another
rain and found the edge of an artifact projecting slightly from the
hard silt about three inches below the bottom of the gravel stratum
which lies at about 24 feet below the soil surface. On removing
the flint blade it was found to be another one of the crude Abilene
type, but also different from some others. It was made by percussion and is thick, with wavy edges. The blade is 3 7-16 inches
long, 1 13-16 inches wide, and thirteen-sixteenths of an inch thick.
The widest and thickest portion is about the center of the point.
Both ends are brought down to crude chisel-like edges which turn
slightly from the long axis of the blade near the ends. The ends
~em to be the working edges, since they have been retouched enough
to take the sinuous edge out of them, but this has been left on the
sides. This artifact also has a gray patina. See Plate ,I~, No. 3;
Plate 41, No. 1; Plate 42, No. 18. No end scrapers have ever been
found embedded in this Site. Two small side scrapers have been

232

Teza~ Archeologic¢l c~nd Paleontologicc~l Society

found embedded in place, and several other crude worked and used
pieces of flint which probably were used as scraping tools. See
Plate 42, Nos. 11, !2, 13, and 14.
.4 Crudely Channelled Pre-Folsom,
On August 31 another visit was made to the Site and a channelled point was found in the loose gravel below it. See Plate 42,
No. 7. This point is made of agate and is so nearly clear that objects may be seen through it when held to a light. The point is
2 1-8 inches lon~, 1 3-16 inches wide and five-sixteenths of an inch
thick near the point which is beyond the end of both center flakes..
A large central flake and two smaller ones have been taken up from
the base on one face, the central larger one is 1 3-8 inches long. On
the other face one large central flake has been taken from the base
up for a distance of one inch, and this covers most of the surface,
although a small area is left on the edge which has a little retouch
and the edge shows evidence of having been ground off like a
Folsom point, although not so efficiently. The base is roughly
square, with no recess, and there is a slight retouch of the bottom
edge on one face. In the face which has the inch long flake up the
center there is a deep wide flake which goes diagonally across the
point from the right edge to the left, which apparently was done to
extend the thinning farther up the blade. The blade exhibits crude
workmanship and is in no wise comparable in quality with the fine
Folsom technique, although the basic ideas are there, and it seems
as though the primitive workmen had begun to experiment with the
ideas so elaborated elsewhere, and perhaps later.
Of course there is no certainty that the point originally came out
of the deep strata but only a strong probability. In this category
belong several other types which include two shouldered and tanged
points, see Plate 42, Nos. 2 and 8, and one type of the Clear Fork
gouge. This was found in 1930 and is a long, relatively slender
well worked blade with the gouge type of working edge. What
makes it more probable that the latter came out of the strata is that
it is of the same sort of flint as those found embeddSd, and has

gravel below strata. Two bottom rows show artifacts found embedded

similar patination and coloring. See Plate 42, No. 10. However as
stated elsewhere in the 1940 Bulletin, no Clear Fork gouges have
yet been found embedded in any of the deeply buried stratified
sites near ASilene. However, it is the well considered opinion of
the writer that if such artifacts are ever found embedded in the lower
river or creek bank strata of this region it will be in the Gibson
Site. The evidence there seems to be of greater age than is shown in
the Hodges Site, and in most other local lower river bank terraces.
Several Ancient Culture Types Revealed
So long as only percussion fractured crude Abilene points were
found embedded in the Gibson Site at just below the 24 feet deep
gravel stratum the problem seemed simple, but now that a better
type of point of crude Folsom shape, but without the channel, has
been found deeper at 25 feet, and again and deeper yet at 30 feet,
another type of projectile with a round ball-shaped tang has been
found, this complicates the problem. The evidence now seems to be
shaping up to show that during the long period when the four feet
of dark red hard silt which lies beneath the 24 feet gravel stratum
was formed, that various flint culture types were used and covered
up at different levels. We may have in this Site an undisturbed
superimposed record of the early phases of the inhabitation of
America.
Very little excavating has yet been done at the site beyond that
which nature has done by erosion and cave-offs. In 1930 the
writer did some excavation assisted by Dr. Otto O. Watts and E. B.
Sayles, and pictures were then taken of the Site by Sayles which were
printed first in Volume 2, 1930, of this Society’s Bulletin in an
article by the writer entitled "Report on Some Recent Archeological
Researches in the Abilene Section," Plates 11, 14 and 15.
Later E. B. Sayles republished some of the same pictures in his
survey of Texas in 1935. In 1934 the writer consented to Gila
Pueblo doing some excavation of the Gibson Site and Mr. Sayles
and two workmen dug there for a time, but if any illustrated report
on the excavated flint materials has ever been published, this writer
is not aware of it. During the time Mr. Sayles was there he had
Drs. E. B. Howard, Ernst Antevs, and M. M. Leighton inspect the
site. Some of the latter also issued reports on the Site under

Texa~ Archeological trnd Paleontological Society

236

numeral designations (10).

In their published reports several of

the above named persons designated the lower silts as of Pleistocene age.
Drs. A. E. Jenks, E. H. Sellards, Kirk Bryan, and J. E. Pearce
and many other scientists have inspected the site with the writer,
and he wishes to state that the site is open to the inspection of
accredited scientific workers of standing, but it would be highly
inadvisable, at the present or at any time soon, to make the location known to the general public.
Excavation of the Gibson Site on any large scale would be very
expensive, and there is some doubt in the writer’s mind that it
would be as productive of artifacts as has the long time observation of the results of erosion. The material has a dense hard clayey
composition which would make the labor of screening it difficult.
However there is the possibility that excavation by a careful competently trained party might reveal many things not now known.

REPORTS AND EDITORIALS
(1) Unusual Skull
The small skull found by Mr. W. C. Fritz of Midland, Texas, has
several unusual features. The skull in general size and shape and
shortness of face resembles the Horace Heffaner skull found by the
writer in 1927. The length of the skull is 6 7-8 inches and the width
5 inches. There are no discernable supraorbital ridges. The skull
is low browed and extremely narrow in the frontal region. Thc
occipital region has the backward or bun-shaped extension of the
posterior portion so often observed in Texas skulls, and has in
addition a feature not previously observed by the writer in Texas
skulls. This is the occurrence of two small extra bones at the juncture of the parietal bones and the occipital bone. The upper middle
one is I 1-8 inches across from side to side and 3-4 of an inch from
top to bottom. The other bone adjoins the first one, below and to
the left, and its measurements are from side to side, 7-8 of an inch,
and from top to bottom 7-8 of an inch. The face of this skull is
uncommonly short. The sockets for the upper second molars are
extremely large. Both of the upper molar 1 teeth are in place, as
are also the two of premolar 2. The molar I teeth measurements
are, tongue to cheek 15-32 of an inch, and slightly over 14-16 of an
inch in antero-postero diameter. The empty sockets for the upper
molar 2 teeth are the largest the writer has ever seen and must have
held enormous teeth. The extraordinary size of the upper first
molars would be a notable feature in a large skull, and are especially noticeable in this small skull, which probably is that of a
female. The left upper premolar 1 is gone. The right premolar 1
was just erupting as also were the canines. Sockets show for three
incisors and one large incisor is’in place. The upper second premolars are considerably worn, and the first molars less so. There
seem to be five cusps in the upper molar 1 teeth.
The mandible is extremely short in antero-postero measureluent.

The canines are very large. The two right premolars are worn down
to the roots. Left premolar 2 is worn down to the roots but left
premolar 1 was still beneath the gum. The second molars were
unworn. There were no lower third molars nor any space for them.
There is a slight mental depression just above two very small
pinhead sized surfaces which are mere suggestions of mental spines.
(2) Four Sand Dune Culture Burials
Several Sand Dune Culture burials have been found previously
but owing either to cremation of the bones1 or to greater decay
which takes place in bones buried in sand, no complete skulls had
been found until recently. During 1939 a Burial A. M. (4) was
excavated2 but the skull was in poor condition and no artifacts were
found. On another visit to the site which is located on a high hil!
which overlooks the Brazos River, the writer noticed a large stone
which erosion had exposed eighteen inches north of that one grave
structure. On digging it was found that this stone was part of a
large buried stone structure which was 100 1-2 inches from east to
west and 75 inches from north to south. See Plate 44, No. 1. Under
the first layer was a second layer 72 by 60 inches across, and going
down into the earth was a third structure, and under that were buried
either four Sand Dune Culture Men, or men who were their contemporaries.
In the northeast end of the pit one large skull lay on top of a
much smaller skull, and two long thin serrated arrow points lay
beside them on the south. The long bones of the skeletons were
mixed below them. A third skull lay in the southeast end of the
pit, which extended down into the caliche.
In the west end another skeleton lay, and two more serrated
points were found with it. See Plate 44, No. 2. In the bottom
another serrated point lay amongst the long bones.
The points were like those illustrated in Plate 51, Vol. 11, 1939,
Bulletin of this Society. The pit was cut down into the hard caliche
for about a foot. The total depth of the bottom of the burials was
58 inches below the soil surface. The top of this large stone structure was buried beneath the hard soil about six inches, and no sign
of it was visible on the original flat surface. Eighteen inches of

Texas Archeological and Pcdeontologlzal Society

242

soil lay between the two burial pits, and only the excavation of the
first one caused the one described above to be found. This burial
is on the same ridge where the writer has excavated several others
during the past ten years and where Mr. Joe Ben Wheat has been
excavating some burials for Texas Technological College during
the past six months.
The skulls are long headed, but no study of them has yet been
made. This excavation was done on funds provided by the HanleyBridwell Excavation Fund.
(3) Texas Technological College Digs Near zlbilene
Since January, 1940, Texas Technological College has been excavating in sites near Abilene, Texas, which were discovered by the
Editor during the past twelve years. During the winter a crew of
W. P. A. laborers under direction of Mr. Joe Ben Wheat has worked
on the Hodges Site, where several superimposed midden strata have
been studied by the writer for several years. Later excavation was
carried on at the Myatt Site in which the writer did some excavation
in 1929. See Plate 44, No. 3.
Since finishing the Myatt excavation, Mr. Wheat has been engaged in some extensive excavation of burials along a high ridge on
the Brazos River where the writer has also removed a number of
burials at intervals since 1930.
(4) New Type o/Painted Pebbles Found Near ,4bilene
During the past fourteen months the writer has found several
painted stones in open campsites which he believes to be of a new
or previously undeseribed type.
The first one of these was found during July, 1939, in Shackelford
County, about twenty-five miles north of Albany, Texas, on the surface of a thin burnt rock mound. This is a brown quartzite mano
stone which had first been polished by use on both sides, and then

painted on one slick face with a brown paint. The painting some~
what resembles writing, and runs across the stone like some strange
script. The.lines wave along for a space, and then go suddenly
into either a long down or a long up stroke, and these run far
below or above the main line. This stone is 4 3-4 inches long,
3 1-2 inches broad, and 2 3-16 inches thick, and the painting covers
a polished surface which measures 2 1-2 by 3 1-2 inches. The ends
of this mano are also heavily battered from use as a hammerstone.
Only one side is painted. The other side is smooth except for a
number of peck marks made to sharpen it for use as a mano. The
stone had been used very little since this sharpening was done. See
Flate 43, Panel B, No. 1.
The second painted pebble was found in December, 1939, in a site
south of and near Abilene in Taylor County. At this place were
two circles of thin burnt rock remains and a very thin accumulation
of camp debris near a small temporary water hole. As the writer
crossed one of these burnt rock piles he noticed an oval waterpolished light colored quartz pebble that had a peculiar brown
wavy banding on it. Or~ close examination what appeared to be
stone banding at a distance proved to be something painted on
the outside with brown paint. This pebble is painted on both sides,
and both the style and the brown paint are the same .as that used
on the mano described above. This pebble is much smaller, being
3 3-16 inches long, 2 1-4 inches wide and 1 1-4 inches thick. This
stone shows no evidence of any use other than as a painted pebble
and is too small for a mano. The painted bands are 1-8 inch wide.
See Plate 43, Panel B., No. 2.
The writer found a third one of these painted stones in the collection of Mr. Lawrence Weatherman, who found it on the Green
Ranch in thin burnt rock debris in Fisher County. This stone is
also of quartzite, and had been first used as a mano and then painted
on the polished surface. This stone is 3 7-16 by 3 9-16 inches in
diameter by 1 13-16 inches thick and has signs of painting on both
polished surfaces, but these are dim. See Plate 43, Panel B, No. 3.
The fourth stone was brought to the writer by Mr. Lacy Beckham.
It was Iound by a tenant who plowed it up near a spring in Taylor
County a few miles from Abilene, Texas. The ~Titer has not seen

246

Texa~ ArcheologicaI and Paleontological Society

the exact location where this stone was found and does not know
whether it als~ is connected with one of the burnt rock mound cultures. This is a quartzite stone which is 16 3-4 inches long, 7 3-4
inches wide and 1 3-4 inches thick. This stone is oval and at the
broad end has been sharpened to an edge. The broad end has been
sharpened from both sides to make an edge which is striated and
polished as though it may have been used either to dig or possibly
as a pestle. However there are n~ known oval mortar holes near
where it was found, ahhough a similar type of pestle must have
been used in such holes. This stone has brown painted lines all
around the edges and across the face. These painted lines are of
the same type and paint as those used on the other stones.
The paint possibly may have been made of asphalt, as it resembles
that substance in color and there was some of that material available
in the region. The stone has the shape and thickness and general
appearance of one of the smaller metates of the region except for
the polished sharpened and striated edge at the end.
These painted stones probably are more common in open sites
than the fact of the finding of only four would indicate. The writer
believes that he has overlooked some in the past, thinking that they
were metal marks made by plows in scraping across hard smooth
quartz, and some of them do have that appearance until examinerl
closely. The writer would be interested to learn if others have also
found these script-like pebble paintings.
After the above was written the writer decided to examine some
quartzite mano and rubbing stones which were collected in Jones
and Taylor Counties years ago and had been in a dark store room
since. On examining some of these with a poor light nineteen more
good specimens of the Abilene region painted pebbles were found.
The writer had long noticed what he thought were metal marks of
plow points which had scraped across these stones, but he never
had examined them with a glass until recently. The paint on some
of these stones is raised on the surface to a degree which makes it
improbable that the work could have been done in any manner except by the use of liquid paint. In all cases however the paint
seems to have gone into the stone somewhat.
Of the nineteen additional stones all are of quartzite except one

flint polishing stone. Thirteen are definitely quartzite manos. One
is a quartzite abrading stone. Five are fine textured polishing
stones, and two of the latter and the abrading stone have also been
~sed as hammerstones on the ends. One mano has a pecked pit
surrounded by the markings. Ten of the stones are marked on both
flat surfaces. When the time is available the writer intends to go
over his collection carefully and prepare a more complete report for
next year. There are undoubtedly many more in the stored collections.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
SOCIETY
Texas Archeological Socie~r~¯ (TAS)
The Texas Archeological Society (TAS) offers a wide range of opportunities for
those interested in Texas heritage. The mission of the Society is to promote study,
preservation and awareness of Texas archeology. A recent strategic plan calls for the
Society to create training opportunities for students, enhance and expand programs,
increase and diversify membership, inform the community of their archeological heritage
and cultivate and preserve resources. The membership generally numbers around 1400.
The Society calendar begins in October with the Annua~ Meeting, an event that
has taken place since 1929, Archeologists, professiona~ and avocational, get together to
share information in research sessions and to hear from nationally renowned luncheon and
banquet speakers. Friday is a popular evening for the public forum with high profile
speakers and artifact identification. Meetings will be held in Lubbock (08) and Del Rio (09).
Each spring TAS offers sessions of the Texas Archeology Academy. Topics in
this series of workshops include Archeology !01 (including a field day), Ceramics: The
Stories Pottery Tells, Lithics: Reading Stone Tools, Historic Archeology and Rock Art of
Texas. Each Academy features power point presentations, a manual and hands-on
activities to reinforce concepts presented. In 2009 sessions will be held in Georgetown,
Study Butte, and Lake Jackson. Surveys at the close of sessions revea~ that participants
greatly value the information imparted during the workshop and the camaraderie of fellow
students.
The summer brings a field school that offers an oppartunity for folks to
contribute to research about Texas archeology. The principal investigator is supported
by staff and experienced volunteers. Usually around 300 people participate. Newcomers
appreciate an orientation session before joining crews in the field.

Survey and lab

sessions provide other venues for people who want to learn more about the archeo~ogical
process.

The field school in 2009 will be in the Panhandle near Perryton.

We offer

scholarships to college students and Native Americans. A youth program instructs around
60 students each year.
Publications of the Society include a journal, the Bulletin of the TAS, a quarterly
newsletter and two web sites, wwvJ.t~_~__~i~h~or~.g is the organizationa~ web site that relates
..Nstor____~ne___~, a

current programs and opportunities. The other web site is ~j~o
venue that offers information in the form of multi-teve~ exhibits.

TAS has been a

supporting partner of Texas Beyond History since its inception.
