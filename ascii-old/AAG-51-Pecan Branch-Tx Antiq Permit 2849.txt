ABSTRACT
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) conducted archaeological testing for the City
of Georgetown along outflow and inflow lines of the Pecan Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant
between April and July 2002. The objectives of testing were to identify the horizontal and
vertical distribution of cultural deposits located during a previous investigation by another
contractor and to obtain cultural-chronological data appropriate to evaluate further the
significance of the deposits. Eight backhoe trenches and two test units were excavated in the
outflow right-of-way, and one long backhoe trench (~ 30 meters) was excavated along the route
of the inflow line. The testing documented six prehistoric hearth features on the outflow line and
two prehistoric hearth features on the inflow line. The features on the inflow line are considered
here to fall within the boundaries of previously registered site 41WM828. AAG recorded the
features along the outflow line as 41WM1063. Both sites are considered worthy of designation
as State Archaeological Landmarks. All materials recovered in the excavations will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

INTRODUCTION
Between April and July 2002, American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) conducted
archaeological test excavations along proposed inflow and outflow pipeline routes at the Pecan
Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant in central Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1). The
testing was conducted for the City of Georgetown under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit
2849.
AAGâs investigation followed three prior archaeological surveys conducted between
1995 and 2001 in anticipation of the construction of the plant (Feit and Griffith 2000; Karbula et
al. 2004). 1 The surveys identified prehistoric cultural remains throughout the 47-acre project
area and recorded two prehistoric archaeological sites with intact, buried cultural deposits,
primarily rock hearth features (Karbula et al. 2004). The two sites are 41WM828, also known as
the Maxine Harris Site, and 41WM965 (Karbula et al. 2004, RCRI 2008).
Site 41WM828 was identified during a 1995 survey by Lone Star Archaeological
Services (Karbula et al. 2004:1, 19). The site was originally recorded based on remains
recovered on a Late Pleistocene terrace overlain with shallow Holocene sediments in the central
portion of the project area (RCRI 2008). A 2001 survey by Hicks and Company yielded
evidence suggesting that the site extends into the Berry Creek floodplain, encompassing site
41WM965, and beyond the boundaries of the project area (Karbula et al. 2004:1,19). Site
41WM828 contains Archaic and Late Prehistoric components.
Site 41WM965 was recorded on the basis of two buried hearth features on the west bank
of Berry Creek in a 2000 Hicks and Company survey (Karbula et al. 2004; RCRI 2008). No
temporally diagnostic remains were recovered during the 2000 investigation and no additional
research was conducted at the site in the 2001 Hicks and Company survey.
In a draft report on the 2001 Hicks and Company, Karbula et al. (2004:2) made the
following recommendations to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) with regard to the
planned wastewater plant project: 1) absolute avoidance of the Berry Creek floodplain, 2)
additional testing of intact buried archaeological components under both the inflow and outflow
lines, 3) regulatory clearance for the plant site, and 4) regulatory clearance for an historic
farmstead in the northwest corner of the project area. Additionally, Karbula et al. (2004:2)
proposed that archaeological components in the Berry Creek floodplain were eligible for State
Archaeological Landmark (SAL) status and that archaeological components on the terrace were
ineligible for SAL status.
The THC granted clearance for construction of the wastewater plant, concurred that the
Berry Creek floodplain was SAL eligible and should be avoided, and requested additional
excavations along the outflow line and two alternative inflow line routes designated as Plan B
and Plan C (Karbula et al. 2004:2-3). Hicks and Company proceeded with testing along the two

1

One additional survey not related to the construction of the wastewater plant was conducted in 1986 by the
Environmental Protection Agency. That survey, which overlapped the current project area, yielded negative results
(Karbula et al. 2004:18).
1

alternative inflow line routes and recommended regulatory clearance for Plan C in a draft report
for the project (Karbula et al. 2004:4).

Figure 1: Map showing general location of the project area.
Upon review of Hicks and Companyâs draft report for the 2001 survey, the THC
expressed concern over two key issues: 1) that archaeological components on the terrace might
be worthy of SAL designation (in contrast to the recommendation by Hicks and Company) and
2) that results of testing on the Plan C inflow line did not warrant regulatory clearance. The
THC recommended additional sampling of cultural remains along the Plan C inflow line for
radiocarbon dating and floatation analysis (Karbula et al. 2004:4).
After the THC issued its findings, the City of Georgetown opted to discontinue the
services of Hicks and Company. The City then contracted with AAG to conduct additional
archaeological fieldwork to identify the horizontal and vertical distribution of cultural deposits
located along the outflow and inflow lines and to obtain cultural-chronological data appropriate

2

to evaluate the significance of the deposits (Figure 2). The fieldwork included backhoe
trenching, the excavation of test units and geoarchaeological analysis.
On the inflow line, one long backhoe trench (BHT), approximately 30 meters in length,
was excavated along a section of the proposed inflow line route where cultural remains had been
documented in previous surveys. Two prehistoric hearth features (outflow features 1 and 2)
were encountered during the excavation of the trench. These features were hand-excavated. No
temporally-diagnostic artifacts were recovered. The features are considered here to fall within
the boundaries of previously registered Site 41WM828.

Figure 2: Map showing project area and centroids of sites 41WM828 and 41WM1063 (USGS
1982.)
Fieldwork on the outflow line involved the excavation of eight backhoe trenches. Six
prehistoric hearth features (outflow features 1-6) were encountered during the excavation of the
trenches. These features were subsequently hand-excavated. Additionally, three test units were
excavated in trench walls to determine if certain features extended into the walls. One

3

temporally diagnostic artifact, a Late Prehistoric arrow point fragment, was recovered in Feature
2 at BHT-109. The feature extended from 8-24 centimeters below ground surface. An
accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon assay run on a sample of bone from the
feature yielded a conventional radiocarbon date of 440 Â± 40 B.P (Beta-245519). Based on the
findings on the outflow line, AAG registered the outflow line as site 41WM1063.
This report was submitted in partial completion of Texas Antiquities Permit 2849. It
includes the results of archaeological testing by AAG at the Pecan Branch Wastewater Treatment
Facility and recommendations pertaining to planned construction. Additionally, this report
contains a geoarchaeological study of the project area which correlates AAGâs stratigraphic
sequence with the sequence presented in the report for the 2001 Hicks and Company survey
(Karbula et al. 2004).

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
The project area lies between Pecan Branch and Berry Creek in central Williamson
County, Texas (see Figure 2). Both Pecan Branch and Berry Creek drain into the San Gabriel
River approximately 560 feet (170 meters) south of the southeast corner of the project area. The
topographic position of the project area fluctuates from 650 to 700 feet (198 to 213 meters) in
elevation above mean sea level.
The project area is located within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:110102). This province includes the broad ecotone between the forests of the Austroriparian and
Carolinian provinces of eastern Texas and Oklahoma and the grasslands of the western parts of
these states (Dice 1943). According to Blair (1950:100), the southwestern boundary is arbitrarily
defined by soil type at the line separating pedalfers from pedocals. The Balcones escarpment forms
an abrupt western boundary for the central part of this province in Texas, and the western boundary
in north Texas corresponds to the western boundary of the Western Cross Timbers. Rainfall in the
Texan province barely exceeds water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a
moist subhumid climate with a moisture surplus index of from zero to 20 percent.
Soils
The project area is depicted on sheet number 37 in the soils book for Williamson County
(Werchan and Coker 1983). The soil types are: Oakalla silty clay loam, occasionally flooded
(Oa), Oakalla soils, frequently flooded (Of), and Krum silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (KsB).
Oakalla silty clay loam, occasionally flooded (Oa) are nearly level soils (slope 0 to 1
percent) on smooth bottomlands in long and narrow areas lying parallel to streams. The upper
layer typically is silty clay loam about 32 inches thick, dark grayish brown in the upper part and
dark brown in the lower part. The subsoil generally is a light yellowish brown silty clay loam
extending to about 60 inches. The soil throughout is calcareous (Werchan and Coker 1983:44).
Oakalla soils, frequently flooded (Of) are nearly level soils on long and narrow
bottomlands that can be flooded several times annually. The upper layer typically is 34 inches of
silty clay loam. The subsoil generally is a grayish brown silty clay extending approximately 60
inches below the surface. In general, soil removal is balanced by soil deposition, thus creating a
constant cutting and filling of soil deposits (Werchan and Coker 1983:45).
Krum silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (KsB) is a gently sloping soil located on ancient
high stream terraces. The surface layer generally is dark grayish brown silty clay loam
approximately 22 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil generally is a dark brown silty clay
extending to a depth of approximately 48 inches below the surface. The lower part of the subsoil
is generally a mottled, reddish yellow and dark brown silty clay with many fine and medium
hard concretions and some soft masses of calcium carbonate, extending to a depth of
approximately 60 inches (Werchan and Coker 1983:44).

Vegetation
The vegetation of this area has been described in detail by Tharp (1926). The Texan
province has been defined as being located near the borderline between moisture surplus and
moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support an oak-hickory forest in which the principal dominants are
post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and hickory (Carya buckleyi).
Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil type has been put into
cultivation. The reader is referred to Blair (1950) for an in-depth description of the Texan Biotic
province.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Williamson County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most
archaeologists and is rich archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Williamson County and vicinity have prepared
by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at the Fort Hood Military Installation
(Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson et al.
1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981,
1985) have published summaries of the region. Additional work by Prewitt (1974) at the LoeveFox site has also provided additional data on local inhabitants in Williamson County, Texas.
Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of
the Bulletin of the Texas Archaeological Society. These works, entitled âForty Years of
Archaeology in Central Texas,â by Michael B. Collins (1995) and âImplications of
Environmental Diversity in the central Texas Archaeological Regionâ by Linda Wootan Ellis, G.
Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of
collected data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily from the works cited
above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term âPaleoindian;â
nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature, often to refer to
prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary means of subsistence.
Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times, Paleoindians exploited a diverse
range of fauna that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but
also included smaller animals such as turtles, land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and
raccoons. The results of excavation of a cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that
the Paleoindian inhabitants of the site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy, in contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who
only pursued big game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants
(Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have been
excavated. For example, as of 1985, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell
County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of Paleoindian cultures consists primarily of surfacecollected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, distinctive Paleoindian
projectile points were found in multi-component surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al.
1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000
B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart points of the Angostura, Clovis, Folsom,
Golondrina, and Plainview types as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985).

7

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and are typically
more distant from major streams than more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some
rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a
considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a Paleoindian occupation site in
Central Texas adjacent to a major drainage is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County
(Redder 1985). Collins (1999) recently reported on archaeological work at the Gault Site, a
major Clovis site in Bell County that was still being studied at this writing.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is a comparatively lengthy cultural period, which persisted in Central Texas
from approximately 8500-1250 years Before Present (B.P.). According to Prewitt (1981:71),
âThe Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.â Prewitt (1981) has
subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the
phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic.
Carlson et al. (1986:15) grouped these into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a âstrong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of
low density.â These characteristics apparently were predominant during the Circleville, San
Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering
apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock
middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle Archaic into the Oakalla,
Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600 B.P.). It appears that
considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the Late Archaic than in the earlier
Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that bison were important in the diet of prehistoric
peoples, but were not necessarily the principal food source during this time (Prewitt 1981:80-81).
The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750 B.P.). The
terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the Twin
Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering and
an apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during Prewittâs (1981:82) Driftwood
phase. A majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which, according to
Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is reflected in Collinsâ
(1995:383) assertion that âtwo-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is âArchaicâ in
character.â
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the Neo-American
Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and
Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin (1250-650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the primary distinguishing
characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates that during this period, the bow
and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and warfare, and that the use of ceramics
and the practice of horticulture first appeared in Central Texas and the surrounding regions.

8

According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the bow
and arrow was the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by pottery, and
finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the onset of these Late
Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice hunting and gathering as their
principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian
periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence for a different subsistence adaptation appears in
the archaeological record and this cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late
Archaic and the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious of the changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period was the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably quite similar to those in the
earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model of bison presence
and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah
phase but not during the preceding Austin phase (Dillehay 1974).
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three sub-periods:
early, middle, and late. The archaeological record of the first two of these sub-periods contains
vestiges of occupations by both indigenous and European peoples; however, evidence of
indigenous culture is almost completely absent for the third sub-period. The early historic subperiod in Central Texas began in the late seventeenth century with the arrival of the first
Europeans to that area. Williamson County is situated within the historic range of the indigenous
Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the sixteenth century (Newcomb 1986). By the
nineteenth century, they had broken ties with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated
with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). The Apache have been described as typical southern
Plains Indians who were hunters and gathers and who lived along the streams and rivers of
Central Texas. Remains of this group have not been found in an historic context in Williamson
County.
During this period, several aboriginal groups, including the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa,
Comanche, and Lipan Apache occupied Texas (Newcomb 1986), and trade existed between the
Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches, and subsequently the Comanches, entered the
region from the Southern High Plains while following migrating game herds. Contact-period
occupations are often identified by the presence at local archaeological sites of glass beads, gun
parts, gunflints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. Archival research
by AAG did not discover the existence of any Historic Indian sites in Williamson County. In
nearby Coryell County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group
burial along the Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an
isolated find on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN WILLIAMSON COUNTY
Williamson County has been the scene of numerous archaeological investigations at various
levels from small projects by private contractors, universities, and state agencies to large area
surveys such as Granger and North Fork Reservoirs. Very little systematic work was carried out in
Williamson County before the initial survey of the proposed North Fork, South Fork and Laneport
(now referred to as Granger) reservoirs in 1963 (Shafer and Corbin 1965) as part of the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project (TASP). Prior to this effort, two published articles documenting
archaeological work in the county were published by T.N. Campbell (1948) and Mardith K. Schuetz
(1957).
In 1963, TASP surveyed the sites of the proposed reservoirs. At North Fork, 44 sites were
recorded, over half of which are burned rock middens or sites buried in alluvial deposits (ceramics
were only found at one site [41WM71]); at South Fork, 30 sites were identified, almost half of
which were burned rock middens; and at Laneport 10 sites were recorded. At this reservoir, both
burned rock middens and alluvial terrace sites were found, but it was concluded that only the latter
type of site can be said to be typical of the Laneport area (Shafer and Corbin 1965:47). At
approximately 10 miles north of Taylor, Laneport Reservoir is the site of the closest major
archaeological survey to the project area except for Brushy Creek about five miles to the southeast.
Additional work in the area was conducted by Frank W. Eddy (1973) at Laneport, William S.
Sorrow (Jackson 1974) at North Fork and Prewitt (1974, 1981) at Granger.
These early studies were not conducted using intensive or systematic sampling procedures.
Therefore, in May 1976, the Anthropology Laboratory at Texas A&M University (TAMU) began
an intensive archaeological site survey and assessment program of all government owned lands in
the North Fork and Granger reservoir boundaries (Patterson and Moore 1976). Work by TAMU
consisted of a preliminary assessment (Patterson and Moore 1976), an archeological survey of
Granger (Moore et al. 1978) and North Fork (Patterson and Shafer 1980).
Several sites were tested prior to the inundation of Granger Reservoir. Site 41WM21 was
tested by TAMU. In 1976, Gary L. Moore (1976, 1977, 1978) tested sites 41WM21, 41WM124,
and 41WM133. Clell L. Bond (1978) tested 41WM30, 41WM284, and 41WM294 in 1977. Site
41WM21 was determined to represent an intermittent occupation during the Early, Middle, and Late
Archaic periods of Texas prehistory.
The work at sites 41WM30, 41WM284, and 41WM294 was designed to determine possible
similarities in lithic procurement and reduction at the three sites and to explain behavior patterns
manifested in the archaeological deposits at 41WM130. This study established that 41WM130 had
been periodically occupied from the Twin Sisters through Toyah phases. It was determined that the
subsistence pattern of the site's inhabitants remained nearly constant through time and included the
wide ranging exploitation of resources found in the San Gabriel Valley. It was postulated that the
availability of lithic resources was one of the principal reasons that this site was reused as during
such a lengthy interval.
The next large-scale survey near the project area was along Brushy Creek in 1974 by
TAMU (Shafer 1974). Six sites (41WM273 - 41WM278) were recorded as a result of this project.

10

All are on the Taylor topographic quadrangle. The four prehistoric sites are thin lithic scatters.
None of the sites were recommended for additional work.
A single site (41WM283) is located about three miles northwest of the center of Taylor on
the east bank of the north fork of Mustang Creek at the former Wilson Springs community. This
site was recorded by Dan Prikryl and others in 1976 (TARL site files). It is described as an Archaic
occupation and quarry site.
Recent surveys by Espey, Huston & Associates (Foster 1994) revisited 41WM432,
41WM546, and 41WM547. They also recorded one new site, 41WM808. Bradle et al. (1998)
surveyed along the North Fork San Gabriel River in Georgetown, Texas and recorded
41WM432, 41WM930, 41WM931, 41WM932, and 41WM933.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PECAN BRANCH PROJECT AREA
Four prior investigations were undertaken in the Pecan Branch Wastewater Treatment
Plant project area. The first, a survey by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1986, covered
only a portion of the present study area. The survey detected no cultural remains (Karbula et al.
2004:18).
In 1995 Lone Star Archaeological Services conducted a brief pedestrian survey with
limited subsurface testing across the 47-acre project area (Figure 3). The survey recorded the
Maxine Harris Site (41WM828) based on a scatter of burned rock and lithics â presumably
prehistoric â on a terrace between the Berry and Pecan Branch creeks. Lone Star investigators
recommended follow up research including additional subsurface testing (Karbula et al. 2004:18,
23).

Figure 3: Map showing location of project area and the Maxine Harris Site (41WM828; after
Karbula et al. 2004:Figure 2-1).
In May 2000, Hicks and Company undertook the third investigation in the project area
under Texas Antiquities Code Permit 2373 (Feit and Griffith 2000; Karbula et al. 2004:18, 21).
Prior to beginning fieldwork, Hicks and Company divided the project area into five âzonesâ
delimited by topographical and man-made features (Figure 4). The Berry Creek floodplain,
characterized by deep Holocene fluvial sediments overlying Pleistocene fill, comprised zones 1,
2 and 4. The highest feature of the project area, a Late Pleistocene terrace overlain with
relatively shallow Holocene sediments, was designated as Zone 3. The southwest corner of the
project area, the Pecan Branch Creek floodplain, was assigned to Zone 5.

12

Figure 4: Aerial photo of project area showing the five âzonesâ of the 2000 Hicks and Company
survey (after Karbula et al. 2004:Figure 4-1).
As recommended by Lone Star Archaeological Services, the 2000 investigation focused
on subsurface testing. Twenty-three shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches were excavated across
the project area. Surface finds were also collected and/or recorded.
The test excavations provided varying degrees of coverage within each of the five zones.
Testing was most intensive on the terrace (Zone 3), where the primary infrastructure of the
wastewater plant now stands. Considerable testing was also undertaken across the Berry Creek
floodplain (zones 1, 2 and 4), though the tests were more dispersed than those on the terrace due
to the large size of the floodplain relative to the project area. Zone 5 was only shovel tested
(Karbula et al. 2004:18, 23, Figure 4-1).
The survey detected surficial and buried prehistoric cultural remains in zones 1 and 4 on
the Berry Creek floodplain and in Zone 3, the terrace summit. An historic home in Zone 4â
reportedly constructed between 1920 and 1935âwas also recorded (Karbula et al. 2004:21-26).
In the following paragraphs, key survey findings are discussed by zone. 2

The key survey findings of the 2000 Hicks and Company Survey are extracted from a review of Feit and Griffith
(2000) presented by Karbula et al. (2004:24) in a report on the 2001 Hicks and Company survey. Karbula et al.
discuss only ââ¦archeological recovery from three of the zones that are most relevant to the testing data [from the
2001 Hicks and Company survey].â Other findings from the 2000 survey, such as the results of testing in zones 2
and 5, were not included.
13

In Zone 3 the investigators excavated four trenches and nine shovel tests. All of these
excavations except one shovel test yielded prehistoric materials in Holocene sediments at depths
of up to 100 centimeters below surface (hereafter b.s.). Pleistocene sediments were generally
encountered from 120-140 centimeters b.s. but were found to be more deeply buried on the
western edge of the zone where the terrace grades into the Pecan Branch floodplain.
Three hearth features were detected in trenches 2 and 3 overlooking the Berry Creek
floodplain (Figure 5). The stratigraphic separation of the features led Feit and Griffith (2000) to
suggest the possibility of at least two periods of occupation on the terrace. They surmised that
features 1 and 2 are probably âmore or less temporally equivalentâ and that Feature 3 likely
represents âa rather poorly preserved older occupationâ (Karbula et al. 2004:28-29).

Figure 5: Prehistoric features encountered in Zone 3 of the 2000 survey (data from Karbula et al.
2004).
Cultural remains encountered outside the features in Zone 3 frequently occurred as
isolated finds or in small groups (see Karbula et al. 2004:25, Table 4-2). Feit and Griffith (2000)
observed from shovel test results that these materials clustered in two broad stratigraphic
contexts, 0-30 centimeters b.s. and 40-80 centimeters b.s.
Among the materials from Zone 3 were two diagnostic artifacts, the sole diagnostics
recovered during the survey. They are an unidentified Late Prehistoric arrow point found on the
surface near Feature 1 and a Late Archaic Frio dart point recovered in the 40-50 centimeters
level of Shovel Test 16, located in the central portion of the terrace (Karbula et al. 2004:25, 29).
Feit and Griffith (2000) cross-dated the Frio point to 2400-1500 BP (Karbula et al. 2004:29).
In Zone 1 on the Berry Creek floodplain, the investigators excavated two trenches and
five shovel tests in the Holocene sediments. The deepest excavations (the trenches) were closed
at approximately 300 centimeters b.s. before Pleistocene deposits were encountered. Four of the
shovel tests produced cultural remains, but these were limited to one limestone cobble, one fire
cracked rock, several pieces of charcoal and baked clay. Both trenches in Zone 1 exposed
features (Figure 6). Feature 4 in Trench 9 was not identified in the survey report. Feature 5 in
Trench 10 was described as a hearth. Trench 10 also yielded numerous unspecified artifacts
from approximately 85-200 centimeters b.s. Feit and Griffith (2000) registered the area of
trenches 9 and 10 as Site 41WM965 (see Figure 4).

2004).
Zone 4, which covers the Berry Creek floodplain as well as a portion of the terrace,
yielded little evidence of prehistoric settlement in tested areas. Of two shovel tests and two
trenches, only one trench (Trench 6) contained cultural remains. The remains recovered from
Trench 6 comprise chert, one biface fragment, burned rocks and charcoal flakes from the A
horizon, 60-100 centimeters b.s. (Karbula et al. 2004:28).
Summarizing the survey data, Feit and Griffith (2000) observed that prehistoric cultural
remains were ââ¦widespread across the entire project area, but concentrated in Zones 1 and 3â
(Karbula et al. 2004:28). Additionally, they emphasized distinctions between the nature and
distribution of remains on the terrace and Berry Creek floodplain. They stated that on the
floodplain, where Holocene sediments extend to a depth of at least 300 centimeters b.s., features
are well separated stratigraphically and organic cultural remains (particularly bone) exhibit
relatively good preservation. In contrast, on the terrace where Holocene deposits average only
140 centimeters, the investigators suggested that there is less stratigraphic separation of cultural
deposits and that the preservation of organic remains is poor compared to the floodplain,
especially at depths below 100 centimeters (Feit and Griffith 2000; Karbula et al. 2004:21).
Feit and Griffith (2000) asserted that buried remains in the terrace sediments represented
at least two archaeological components. They assigned features 1 and 2 in Trench 2 to the Late
Archaic based on the find of a Frio point in a nearby shovel test at roughly the same depth as
Feature 2. Since Feature 3 in Trench 3 was stratified below features 1 and 2, they assumed it
represented an earlier component. No estimate of the age of cultural deposits on the floodplain
was provided.
Noting the wide distribution of cultural remains across the project area and the presence
of intact and presumably multicomponent sites on the terrace and Berry Creek floodplain, the
investigators concluded that the archaeological resources at Pecan Branch were significant and
that additional testing would be warranted in impact areas to evaluate the eligibility of the
resources for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and/or designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (Feit and Griffith 2000).

15

In 2001 Hicks and Company returned to Pecan Branch and initiated a fourth investigation
in the project area under Texas Antiquities Code Permit 2521. 3 The purpose of the investigation
was twofold: 1) to determine the relative numbers, ages and importance of the archaeological
components within the proposed impact areas of the Maxine Harris Site (41WM828) and 2) to
establish whether any or all of the components are eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places and/or designation as State Archeological Landmarks (Karbula et al. 2004:1,
30).
Fieldwork was conducted in two phases. The first phase entailed the excavation of 85
trenches and 12 test units across the impact area (Karbula et al. 2004:12). As this work
progressed, substantial deposits of prehistoric cultural remains were discovered in and around the
proposed track of an inflow pipeline in the north central sector of the project area (Figure 7).
These remains were subsequently determined to be archaeologically significant, and a second
phase of fieldwork was implemented to determine a suitable alternate location for the pipeline.
Phase two operations involved the excavation of an 23 additional backhoe trenches and two test
pits along two alternate alignments (designated as Plan B and Plan C) in the previously untested
northwest corner of the project area (see Figure 7; Karbula et al. 2004:1-3, 13, 74). In the final
project report, data from both phases are presented together.

Figure 7: Aerial photo of project area showing the three âzonesâ of the second Hicks and
Company survey (after Karbula et al. 2004:Figure 6-1).
3

During the second Hicks and Company survey, investigators made the decision to consider the entire project area
part of one laterally extensive site whose boundaries were undetermined (Karbula et al. 2004:1). The designation
selected by the investigators was the Maxine Harris Site (41WM828).
16

For the 2001 investigation, the proposed impact area was subdivided into three
topographic zones: 1) the north central sector of the project area, largely in the Berry Creek
floodplain; 2) the terrace and its southeastern flank; and 3) the terminal end of the outflow line
(see Figure 7). Trenches were excavated in each zone and records were made of natural strata
(âstratigraphic unitsâ or âStratsâ). Key findings from the three zones are summarized in the
following paragraphs.
In Zone 1, testing operations involved the excavation of nine trenches and five test pits
(Karbula et al. 2004:40). The excavations were limited to the Holocene sediments overlying the
floodplain. Four stratigraphic units (Strats 4-7) were identified (Figure 8). Cultural remains
were reported in six of the trenches; data are missing for two trenches (Karbula et al. 2004:Table
6-2). Two features were encountered in Trench 32, located at the southern end of Zone 1 on the
north slope of the terrace (Figure 9). Test units 7 and 8 were opened to define the features
(Karbula et al. 2004:tables 7-3, 7-4).

The investigators described the prehistoric cultural remains from Zone 1 as abundant and
well preserved. Types of remains recovered include stone tools, debitage, groundstone, bone,
shell and charcoal. Cultural strata were found to extend at least 4 meters below surface, the
maximum depth reached by the backhoe used in the project. Diagnostic artifacts included six
Archaic projectile points and point fragments (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Diagnostic projectile points recovered in Zone 1 (data from Karbula et al. 2004:97100, tables 7-2, 7-6).
In Zone 2, 97 trenches and eight test units were excavated (Karbula et al. 2004:63).
Three stratigraphic units (Strats 1-3) were defined (Figure 11). The upper two strata consist of
Holocene fluvial deposits. The lowest stratum extends into the Pleistocene sediments of the
terrace formation. Cultural remains were found in strats 1 and 2 in 49 of the trenches. Fourteen
of the trenches exposed a total of 15 cultural features (Figure 12). In addition, a âsnail
middenâ(Rabdotus shell) â presumably related to a prehistoric occupation â was observed in
Trench 78 at a depth of 285 centimeters b.s. (Karbula et al. 2004:89, Table 6-3). As in Zone 1,
the features were explored by the excavation of test units.

Cultural remains were detected throughout Zone 2 and were particularly abundant on the
highest portion of the terrace immediately to the south of Zone 1 and along alternate alignments
of the inflow pipeline (plans B and C; see Figure 5). All remains detected during testing in Zone
2 were recovered between 0 and 95 centimeters b.s. in strats 1 and 2. Remains in Strat 2 were
ââ¦typically located in a consistent lens at approximately 40-50 cm below the ground surfaceâ
(Karbula et al. 2004: 106). Scattered, low-density remains also occurred in Strat 2 from
approximately 75-95 cm b.s. The types of remains found in Zone 2 were consistent those from
Zone 1 with the exception of organic material, which was rarely preserved. 4 Diagnostic artifacts
included one unidentified Late Prehistoric arrow point fragment and eight Archaic projectile
points and point fragments (Figure 13).

Figure 13: Diagnostic projectile points recovered in Zone 2 (data from Karbula et al. 2004:97100, tables 7-12, 7-18, 9-4).
In Zone 3 two trenches were excavated (Karbula et al. 2004:41). Two stratigraphic units
(strats 8 and 9) were identified. No cultural remains were detected.
Data obtained in the 2001 testing operation were interpreted in the context of five
âAnalytical Units.â Karbula et al. (2004) provide several contrasting definitions of an AU, the
most comprehensive of which is ââ¦observed lenses of archaeological material based on density,
distribution, depth below surface, degree of stratification, feature morphology, presence and type
of diagnostic artifacts, geomorphological analysis and reconstruction of the sequence of
deposition, and positioning/topography of the landscapeâ (Karbula et al. 2004:125). 6 The
chronological sequence for the AUs is based on cross-dated projectile points (Figures 10 and 13)
and five radiocarbon dates (Figure 14). Figure 15 summarizes information pertinent to the five
AUs.

4

Karbula et al. (2004:131) note that: âA total of 99% of all bone finds at the site come from the floodplain, despite
some 85 trenches on the ridge. The same percentage also holds roughly for the recovery of charcoal.â
5
Karbula et al. (2004) describe point 57a as a Pedernales point on pp. 99-100 and 115-116 but list it as
âunidentifiableâ on p. 66 and in Table 9-4.
6
Other definitions for AU provided by Karbula et al. (2004) include: 1) a âcultural zoneâ characterized by
ââ¦significant differences in organic preservation and in topographic setting (p. 12) and 2) an âoccupation zoneâ
characterized by regular ââ¦depth below surface and consistent sets of cultural materials, especially diagnostic
projectile point types, but also on observed types of archeological features and high densities of artifactsâ (p. 106).
The term AU is also used interchangeably with âcomponentâ (e.g., Karbula et al. 2004:1).

Karbula et al. (2004:131) state that âAU 1 [is] essentially intact and yet may represent occupational mixing that
occurred over approximately 1000 years of periodic encampmentsâ Presumably, such mixing would explain the
presence of the Late Prehistoric point in AU 1.
8
It should be noted that the cross-dates provided by Karbula et al. (2004: 108) for Pedernales points are inconsistent
with other published dates. For example, Turner and Hester (1985:139) suggest a range of ca. 2000 B.C.â1200
B.C.
9
Turner and Hester (1985:73) assign Bulverde point to the Early Archaic and provide a date range of ca. 3000 B.C.
â 2500 B.C. Aware of the fact that the presence of Bulverde and Pedernales points is inconsistent with the date
range assigned to in AU4, Karbula et al. (2004:12) suggest that the points may have been ârecycled.â

Based on the findings of the 2001 testing operation, Hicks and Company recommended
the Berry Creek floodplain in Maxine Harris Site for State Archaeological Landmark status. The
recommendation was approved by the Texas Historic Commission, and provisions were made by
the City of Georgetown (COG) to relocate the inflow pipeline to the alignment referred to as
Plan C. Additionally, the COG agreed to minimize impacts in other areas of the floodplain
(Karbula et al. 2004:2).

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
Background Research
Before entering the field, site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for previously recorded sites in the project area and
vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the region were examined for information
concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to the project area.
Field Survey
AAGâs field investigation at the Pecan Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant was
conducted between April and July of 2002. Michael R. Bradle was the Principal Investigator,
and Gilbert T. Bernhardt served as the Geoarchaeologist. 10 The field survey was conducted by
the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist with assistance from James S. Belew and
Ron Ralph. Prior to beginning fieldwork, the project was discussed with a representative of the
City of Georgetown to ensure that the field crew was aware of the correct location of the project
area.
Fieldwork was conducted along the inflow and outflow lines to identify the horizontal
and vertical distribution of cultural deposits located during a previous investigation by Hicks &
Company (Karbula et al. 2004) and to obtain cultural-chronological data appropriate to evaluate
the significance of the deposits. Geoarchaeological data was collected in both testing locales.
Fieldwork on the inflow line was limited to the excavation of a single trench, 30 meters in
length, along the route of the planned inflow pipeline. This route was selected based on previous
archaeological testing by Hicks and Company in 2001 and falls within the testing area designated
as âPlan Câ in the Hicks and Company report (Karbula et al. 2004). Fieldwork on the outflow
line involved the excavation of eight backhoe trenches (BHTs) as well as the excavation of test
units adjacent to some features encountered during trenching. 11,12 Samples of soil for floatation
were collected from all features. All matrix excavated from the features was sifted through Â¼â
screen.

10

James Belew served as the Principal Investigator during the field investigation. He was subsequently replaced by
Michael R. Bradle.
11
Prior to the initiation of trenching operations, the centerline of the outflow line was surveyed and staked by a
professional surveyor. This action was taken at the request of the THC after reconnaissance of the project area by
AAG revealed that trenches excavated in 2001 by Hicks & Company were inadvertently placed outside of the
outflow right-of-way.
12
The single trench excavated along the inflow line was designated BHT-1. Trenches on the outflow line were
numbered relative to staked survey points (BHTs 106-109 and 111-114). There is no BHT-110.

GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE
PECAN BRANCH INFLOW AND OUTFLOW LINES
Introduction
The study area is located in a Quaternary alluvial setting of the San Gabriel River about
6.7 kilometers northeast of Georgetown, Texas and 2.4 kilometers west of Weir, Texas (see
figures 1 and 2). The area is bounded on the east by Berry Creek, on the south by the MKT RR
line, on the west by Pecan Branch and on the north by Highway 971 (Figure 16). Two geologic
formations are found in the subsurface in the study area, the upper Cretaceous Del Rio Clay and
the Buda Limestone. Both formations are exposed in the San Gabriel River and the Buda
Limestone is exposed in Berry Creek. The 1:24000 geologic map of the area shows Qt,
Quaternary terrace deposits, and Qal, Holocene alluvial deposits on the surface. However, a
thin veneer of Qal deposits were found blanketing the study area (Figure 17).
The younger alluvial sediments were derived mainly from the Berry Creek and Pecan
Branch watersheds. Both of the creek basins drain mainly Cretaceous limestone, clays, and
marls from the Fredericksburg Group and from the Del Rio Clay, the Georgetown formation, the
Buda Limestone and Austin Chalk formation. The aforementioned geologic units have
contributed mostly gravels, clays and silt to the alluvial valley of the study area since Late
Pleistocene to present. The older alluvial sediments are confined to the subsurface and were
derived chiefly from the San Gabriel River Basin. The San Gabriel River basin including the
North and South San Gabriel Rivers drains mainly Cretaceous limestone, clays, and marls from
the Fredericksburg Group, the Del Rio Clay, and from the Georgetown formation. The
aforementioned geologic units have contributed mostly gravels, clays and silt to the alluvial
valley of the study area since Late Pleistocene to present. Our study area is along Pecan Branch,
a first order stream to the San Gabriel River.
The objectives of the geoarchaeological investigation were twofold: 1) to spatially and
chronologically delineate alluvial environments of deposition, and 2) to assess the influences of
these environments on the spatial and temporal distribution of the archaeological record.
Methods
The late Quaternary alluvial record of Pecan Branch within the study area was
constructed from backhoe trenches (BHT), the Weir 7.5 minute quadrangle topographic map
(USGS 1982), the Georgetown 7.5 minute quadrangle topographic map (USGS 1981), the
Geologic Atlas Of Texas, Austin Sheet (Barnes 1974), a previous archaeological survey by Hicks
& Company (Karbula et al. 2004), radiocarbon dates, and the Soil Survey of Williamson County,
Texas (Werchan and Coker 1983). Trenches on the outflow line were generally 1 to 2 meters
deep and 3 meters long. BHT-1, the sole trench on the inflow line, was 30 meters long, 2.5
meters wide, and 3.2 meters deep. The selected study localities are shown in Figure 16.
The alluvial stratigraphic chronology was based on the degree of soil development,
topographic location, radiocarbon dating and correlation to other central Texas alluvial stream
histories.

Alluvial Stratigraphy
Two late Quaternary landforms are mapped on the north side of the San Gabriel River in
the project area: one high terrace (T1) and channel deposits with associated floodplain (T0)
(Figure 17). The study area is situated on a large meander bend of the San Gabriel River.
Associated with these landforms are alluvial lithologic facies that have been divided into three
general phases: a fine-grained flood basin phase (fgf), a coarse-grained channel fill phase (cgc) ,
and a fine grained channel fill phase (fgc).
The nomenclature used here differs from that in the report of Hicks and Companyâs 2001
survey of the project area (Karbula et al. 2004). Hicksâ Strat 1 is equivalent to T0 fgf of this
report, Hicksâ Strat 2 is equivalent to T1 fgf of this report, and Hicksâ Strat 3 is equivalent to T1
cgc of this report, as shown in figures 6-3 to 6-5 of the Hicks report (Karbula et al. 2004) and
Figure 17 of this report.
Terrace 1
Lithology
Terrace 1 (T1) is situated about 10.5 meters above the modern low-water channel of the
San Gabriel River, 3.5 meters above Pecan Branch, and 10.0 meters above Berry Creek (Figure
16). There are two distinctly defined facies and four phases found in Terrace 1 at BHT-1:
T0(fgf) and T0(cgc) at the surface and down to 0.48 meters deposited from Pecan Branch,
T1(fgf) deposited from the ancestral Berry Creek and or the ancestral San Gabriel River from
0.48 meters to 2.69 meters, and T1(cgc) imbricated gravel bar deposits predominantly from the
ancestral San Gabriel River from 2.69 to 3.20 meters (Figure 17). Also, Terrace 1 deposits were
found about 1 meter below the surface at BHT-107, BHT-111, and Hicks BHT-15 (figures 16
and 17). The T1 terrace is associated with Krum Series soils. The classification of the soil is a
fine, montmorillinitic, thermic Vertic Haplustolls (Werchan and Coker 1983). At BHT-1, a
disturbed, 0.15 meter thick, (Ap) surface horizon consists of a very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2), clay loam with moderate fine subangular blocky and moderate medium granular structure
and an clear, smooth, lower boundary (Figure 17). The Ap horizon contains few CaCO 3
concretions and filaments. The Ap horizon overlies a 0.33 meter thick, very dark brown (10YR
2/2), silty clay, Ak, horizon with a moderate fine subangular blocky structure and an abrupt,
wavy, unconformable, boundary. The Ak horizon contains about 1 to 2 % CaCO 3 concretions
and filaments and a few scattered small rounded limestone gravels. The Ak horizon overlies
0.35 meter thick, sand and gravel horizon (S&G1). The horizon contains poorly sorted sand and
Â¼ inch to 2 Â½ inch subangular to subrounded limestone gravels in a brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay
matrix. The Bk horizon is a 0.23 meter thick dark brown (7.5 4/4) silty clay with moderate,
medium, subangular, blocky structure and a gradual wavy lower boundary. The horizon contains
1 to 3% CaCO 3 concretions and filaments. The C1 horizon is a 0.46 meter thick, strong brown
(7.5 YR 5/4) silty clay, with massive structure and diffuse, wavy , lower boundary. The horizon
has about 5% CaCO 3 concretions and filaments. The Ck2 horizon is a 1.01 meter thick, strong
brown, (7.5 YR 5/4) silty clay with massive structure and an abrupt, wavy, unconformable lower
boundary. The horizon contains 3 to 5% CaCO 3 concretions and filaments. The Ck2 horizon
overlies a 0.66 meter thick (to bottom of trench) sand and gravel horizon (S&G2). The horizon

27

contains moderately sorted sand and Â¼ inch to 2 Â½ inch, subangular to subrounded, moderately
imbricated, moderately cemented, silicious and limestone gravels in a brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty
clay matrix.
Chronology
Temperatures were slightly warmer and drier than present with grasslands prevailing in
Texas from about 8,000 years B.P. to about 5,000 years B.P. (Adams 2003). The last major
incision of the San Gabriel River began from 5,000 to 4,600 years BP with the gradient base
change of Texas streams caused by another sea level regression to about 20 m below present sea
level (Rice 1988). This was followed by another period of net channel aggradation and
floodplain construction from middle Holocene to late Holocene, 5,000-2,500 years BP (Blum
and Valastro 1994). Short grass steppe and warm temperatures existed in Texas during this time
(Adams 2003).
Although the exact age of the T1 terrace is not known, three conventional radiocarbon
dates were obtained by AAG 2 to 4 kilometers upstream at SG3A from the subsurface of a
similar terrace as this studyâs T1 terrace (Bradle and Bernhardt 2008). Data from that study are
shown in Figure 18.

Figure 18: Data from geoarchaeological study of SG3A (Bradle and Bernhardt 2008).
The surface of the T0 terrace at SG3A was located about 5 to 10 meters above the San
Gabriel River. AAG obtained two radiocarbon dates for the terrace. One date, run on a sample
obtained at a depth of 0.6 meters, is 5,800 Â± 40 years BP. The second date, run on a sample
obtained at a depth of 1.74 meters, is 6,540 Â± 50 years BP. Taking into account the 1.0 meter of
T0 deposits for this study, corollary depths for the two samples would be at depths of 1.6 and
2.74 meters, which are at the bottom of sand and gravel 1 and top of sand and gravel 2,
respectively. The SG3A modeling indicates the age of Terrace 1 ranges from 8,200 years BP to
4,100 years BP at 5 to10 meters above the San Gabriel stream channel. This is equivalent to in
age to the beginning age of Blum and Valastroâs (1994) Columbus Bend Alloformation 2 (CBA
2) deposition that occurred at West Point on the Colorado River from latest Pleistocene through
early Holocene (10,940 years BP to 3,330 years BP). In addition, Terrace 1 maybe correlative in
age to the lower member of the West Range alluvium of Cow House Creek (Nordt 1992).

28

Terrace 0
Lithology
Terrace 0 (T0) is situated about 5 meters above the modern low-water channel of the San
Gabriel River and Berry Creek (Figure 16). To characterize the T0 terrace, four sites were
sampled for soil analysis and geology for this study (BHTs 1, 107, 109, and 111); data from two
locations sampled in a previous study (Hicks BHT-15 and BHT-76) was also included (Karbula
et al. 2004). The T0 alluvial soils at the aforementioned trenches developed in fine-grained
overbank deposits (T0fgf) from either Pecan Branch, Berry Creek, or the San Gabriel River
(Figure 16). At BHT-1 a 0.33 meter coarse-grained alluvial deposit (T0cgc) lay under T0fgf
alluvial soils and over T1fgf alluvial soils (see Lithology Terrace 1 above). At all locations
sampled for this report, about 1 meter of T0 deposits overlay the T1 deposits. Karbula et al.
(2004) report a thinning of T0 alluvial deposits on the mid to upper T0 terrace. The T0 deposits
are generally Oakalla Series soils overlaying T1 Krum Series soils.
The classification of Oakalla Series is a fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Cumulic
Haplustolls (Werchan and Coker 1983). At BHT-107 a disturbed 23 centimeter (Ap) horizon
consists of a very dark brown (10YR 2/2), silty clay loam with moderate fine subangular blocky
and medium granular structure and a clear smooth lower boundary. The Ap horizon contains
less than 1% CaCO 3 concretions, filaments and masses. The Ap horizon overlies a 30
centimeter, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), silty clay, Ak horizon, with moderate fine to
very fine subangular blocky structure and a gradual wavy lower boundary. The Ak horizon
contains about 1 to 2% CaCO 3 filaments. The Ak horizon overlies a 64 centimeter thick brown
(7.5YR 4/3), silty clay, Btk horizon, with moderate medium subangular blocky structure and a
gradual wavy lower boundary. The horizon contains 2 to 3% CaCO 3 filaments, masses and
nodules. The Btk horizon overlies a 58 centimeter thick C1 horizon, with small to medium
rounded limestone gravels in a brown (7.5YR 4/3), silty clay loam matrix. The C1 horizon has
an abrupt wavy lower boundary. The horizon contains about 5% CaCO 3 filaments, masses, and
nodules. The C1 horizon overlays a 76 centimeter thick small to medium rounded limestone
gravels coarsening downward to large flat imbricated gravels in a brown (7.5 YR 5/3) sandy clay
loam matrix. The horizon contains about 2% CaCO 3 filaments, masses, and nodules.
At BHT-109 a disturbed, 15 centimeter Ap horizon consists of a very dark brown, (10YR
3/2) silty clay loam, with moderate fine subangular blocky and moderate medium granular
structure and a clear smooth lower boundary. The horizon has less than 1% CaCO 3 masses,
filaments, and nodules and a few scattered rounded pebbles. The Ap horizon is underlain by a
30 centimeter, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), silty clay loam, Ak horizon, with moderate
fine blocky structure and a gradual wavy lower boundary. The Ak horizon contains about 1 to
2% CaCO 3 filaments. The Ak horizon overlies a 51 centimeter thick dark brown (10YR 3/3),
silty clay loam, Btk horizon, with moderate medium angular blocky structure and a gradual wavy
lower boundary. The horizon has darker clays in cracks and few scattered CaCO 3 masses,
filaments, and nodules.
At BHT-111 a disturbed 23 centimeter (Ap) horizon consists of a very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2), silty clay loam with strong fine granular structure and a clear abrupt lower

29

boundary. The Ap horizon contains less than 1% CaCO 3 concretions, filaments and masses and
a few small rounded, limestone pebbles. The Ap horizon overlies a 53 centimeter, dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2), silty clay loam, Ak1 horizon, with weak, fine, granular, structure and a clear,
smooth, lower boundary. The Ak horizon contains few CaCO 3 filaments, masses, and nodules.
The Ak1 horizon overlies a 41 centimeter thick, dark brown (10YR 4/3), silty clay loam, Ak2
horizon, with weak, fine, granular, structure and a clear, smooth, lower boundary. The horizon
contains 2 to 3% CaCO 3 filaments, masses and nodules. The Ak2 horizon overlies a 36
centimeter thick dark brown (10YR 3/3), silty clay loam, Bk1 horizon, with weak, fine granular
structure and an abrupt, smooth, lower boundary. The horizon has 3 to 5% CaCO 3 masses,
filaments, and nodules and abundant whole and disseminated snail shells. The Bk1 horizon
overlies a 61 centimeter thick brown (10YR 4/3), sandy clay loam Bk2 horizon, with weak, fine
granular structure. The horizon has 1 to 2% CaCO 3 masses, filaments, and nodules and few
whole and disseminated snail shells.
At Hicks BHT-15, the profile was described as stratigraphic zones (Karbula et al. 2004).
Strat 1, was a dark brown sandy silty clay (AP horizon), Strat 2 was identified as a brown very
silty sandy clay which changes to a silty sandy gravelly clay 10YR 4/3 to 10YR 4/4, and Strat 3
was characterized as a CB horizon, very clayey, very silty sand with pebbles to a dense gravelly
clay, 10YR 4/4.
Chronology
A burned rock hearth (outflow line Feature 2) was found between 8 and 24 centimeters
below ground surface at BHT-109. The hearth was located beneath historic debris. A bone
sample was obtained from the burned rock hearth. An AMS radiocarbon date was obtained from
the sample by Beta Analytic. The conventional radiocarbon age provided by the lab for the
sample was 440 +/- 40 years B.P. Modeled dating suggested that the age of the hearth ranged in
age from 287 years B.P. at a depth of 8 centimeters to 863 years B.P. at a depth of 24 centimeters
with a medium age of 575 years at a depth of 16 centimeters. Karbula et al. (2004) reported two
radiocarbon dates from slightly greater depths on T0. One, taken from a sample at about 0.5
meters below the surface in Trench 92, is 2520 Â± 50 B.P. The second, taken from a sample
about 0.6 meters below the surface in Trench 76, is 2420 Â± 40 B.P. Although the numerical age
of Terrace 0 is not known (beginning and ending dates), T0âs elevation, stratigraphic position,
radiocarbon dating, and degree of soil development (very slight accumulation of pedogenic
CaCO 3 filaments, nodules, and masses) suggest that the terrace is probably late Holocene to
Modern in age. After 4,000 years BP and until about 2,600 years BP, Central Texas was covered
in grasslands and temperatures were cooler and moister than conditions were during the
formation of the T1 terrace (Adams 2003). Modeling indicates that the initiation of the T0
Terrace began about 4,100 yr. BP. This is equivalent to in age to Blum and Valastroâs (1994)
estimate for the lower portion of Columbus Bend Alloformation 2 and all of Columbus Bend
Alloformation 3 on the Colorado River at West Point.

Geoarchaeology
Terrace 1
Terrace 1 contains two stratigraphic facies, a fine-grained overbank deposits and coarsegrained channel deposits. Terrace 1 dated by radiocarbon dating (Bradle and Bernhardt 2008),
modeling, elevation, and soil development as middle Holocene to late Holocene. Terrace 1 may
contain portions of the Early Archaic and Middle Archaic records in a primary context in the
fine-grained alluvial flood deposits. The surface of T1 terrace has been disturbed by farming and
construction. However, where undisturbed and not blanketed by T0 deposits, the surface of
Terrace 1 may contain assemblages of sites spanning Early Archaic to present.
Terrace 0
Terrace 0 contains two stratigraphic facies, fine-grained overbank floodplain deposits and
coarse-grained channel deposits. The fine-grained floodplain deposits and coarse-grained
deposits were observed in both the channels of Pecan Branch and Berry Creek and along their
banks.. Terrace 0 fine-grained floodplain sediments were observed overlaying Terrace 1
sediments. Terrace 0 has been tentatively dated radiometrically (this report and Karbula et al.
2004) and through modeling, elevation, and soil development to between late Holocene and
Modern in age. Terrace 0 may contain portions of the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic records in a primary context in the fine-grained alluvial flood deposits.
Where undisturbed, the surface of Terrace 0 may contain assemblages of sites spanning Middle
Archaic to present. However, much of the surface of T0 terrace blanketing the T1 and T2
terraces has been disturbed by farming, and construction.
Conclusions
Two alluvial terraces are located within the study locale: Early Holocene to Late Holocene
T1 terrace, and Late Holocene to present T0 terrace. Associated with these landforms are two
general lithologic phases: a fine-grained floodplain facies, and coarse-grained channel facies.
Two soil series are also associated with the geomorphic locations: Krum silty clays are nearly
level to gently sloping soils developed on alluvium of late Pleistocene stream terraces and,
Oakalla silty clay loams (Of) are nearly level soils that formed on late Holocene to recent
alluvium on bottom lands within stream channels and adjacent to streams on low floodplains.
The stratigraphic record conditions the spatial and temporal distribution of the
archaeological record, whereas environments of deposition influence site forming processes and
preservation potentials. Accordingly, where not disturbed, Terrace 1 may contain portions of the
Early Archaic and Middle Archaic records in a primary context in the fine-grained alluvial flood
deposits and Terrace 0 may contain portions of the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic records in a primary context in the fine-grained alluvial flood deposits.
The degree of surface disturbance from brush removal, construction and erosion in the
study area and the absence of exposures limit geoarchaeological interpretations. However, in
areas not disturbed and not overlain by T0 deposits, the surface of Terrace 1 may contain

31

assemblages of sites spanning Early Archaic to present. Where undisturbed, Terrace 0 may
contain intact assemblages of sites spanning Middle Archaic to present.
Dating soil stratigraphy based on the degree of soil development, topographic location,
and correlation to other central Texas alluvial stream histories are problematic. Future studies
should incorporate more computer modeling, additional radiocarbon dating, and more detailed
soil-stratigraphic descriptions from soil borings within the geographical region to help elucidate
and expand upon archaeological research and geoarchaeological theories.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
Previous investigations recorded two sites in the project area, 41WM828, known as the
Maxine Harris Site, and 41WM965 (see Figure 4). The latter site was documented and tested in
a 2000 survey by Hicks and Company (Feit and Griffith 2000). It is located on a terrace above
the west bank of Berry Creek and is described as two hearth features detected at stratigraphically
different levels (RCRI 2008). No temporally diagnostic remains were recovered at the site.
Site 41WM828 was discovered and tested in a 1995 survey by Lone Star Archaeological
Services (RCRI 2008). Additional testing was conducted at the site by Hicks and Company in
2000 and 2001 (Karbula et al. 2004). These surveys documented isolated subsurface hearth
features with associated charcoal, lithics and bone. An historic house, presumably built between
1920 and 1935, was also documented at the site (Karbula et al. 2004:11). Reporting on the 2001
survey, Karbula et al. (2004:18) described 41WM828 as ââ¦a stratified multi-component site
representing at least the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic II periods of central Texas
prehistory.â Additionally, Karbula et al. (2004:1) proposed that 41WM828 and 41WM965
ââ¦are in reality part of one laterally extensive larger site that is spread well beyond the project
boundaries.â During the 2001 survey, Hicks and Company archaeologists recommended to the
THC that the Berry Creek floodplain portions of 41WM828 were SAL eligible. The THC
reportedly concurred with this recommendation (Karbula et al. 2004:2).
Only one other site has been documented within a one-kilometer radius of the project
area. This site, 41WM421, is located on a terrace overlooking the north bank of the San Gabriel
River, approximately 550 meters southwest of the Pecan Branch wastewater inflow line. The
site reportedly covers more than one acre and is manifest by scatters of burned rock, bifaces,
expended cores, flakes and debitage (RCRI 2008).
Fieldwork
AAG conducted archaeological testing at two locations within the project area, the plant
inflow line and the plant outflow line. A total of eight isolated prehistoric hearth features were
encountered. The features were hand-excavated. All matrix from features was passed through
Â¼â-mesh screen and samples of soil were taken from each feature for floatation analysis. No
remains were recovered from any of the floatation samples. Numerous carbon samples collected
from the features were sent to the Stafford radiocarbon lab for radiocarbon dating. These
samples were lost by the lab. Subsequently, a sample of bone associated with outflow line
Feature 2 was sent to Beta Analytic for analysis. This sample was successfully dated and is
reported in the following discussion of the results of testing.
Inflow Line
Two prehistoric hearth features were encountered during the excavation of the inflow line
trench (BHT-1). The inflow line is considered here to fall within the boundary of previously
identified site 41WM828, which is characterized by the remains of isolated prehistoric burned

33

rock hearths with associated lithics, bone and shells. A log of the inflow line features and
descriptions of all artifacts collected from the features are presented in Appendix I and Appendix
II, respectively.
Inflow Feature 1
This feature was a small prehistoric hearth measuring 1 meter x 60 centimeters (Figure 19). It
was encountered at 40 centimeters below ground surface (b.g.s.) in the Ak soil horizon (black
clay) and rested on an underlying gravel stratum. The feature contained burned rock, 10 chert
and quartzite flakes, one chert core and Rabdotus shells. One of the flakes, a large secondary
chert flake, exhibited use wear on a lateral edge. The shells were submitted for radiocarbon
dating but were lost by the radiocarbon lab.

Figure 19: Inflow line Feature 1.
Inflow Line Feature 2
This feature, a prehistoric hearth, comprised a 1 x 1 meter scatter of approximately 20
small burned rocks (approx. â¤ 10 centimeters in diameter), 24 chert and quartzite flakes, and
Rabdotus and fresh water mussel shells (Figure 20). Two of the chert flakes, both tertiary flakes,
exhibit use wear on a lateral edge. The feature was located 30-40 centimeters b.g.s in the Ak soil
horizon (loamy clay). The Rabdotus shells in the feature were not collected. The mussel shells
were submitted for radiocarbon dating but were lost by the radiocarbon lab.

34

Figure 20: Inflow line Feature 2.
Outflow Line
Six prehistoric hearth features were discovered during backhoe trenching along the route
of the outflow line. Based on these findings, the area of investigation on the outflow line was
designated as Site 41WM1063. The features which characterize the site are similar in
composition, function, stratigraphic range and antiquity to those documented throughout the
project area and may also be considered to fall within Site 41WM828. A log of the outflow line
features and descriptions of all artifacts collected from the features are presented in Appendix III
and Appendix IV, respectively.
Outflow Line Feature 1
This small, 20 x 20 centimeter prehistoric hearth consisted of three burned rocks, one
flake and a fleck of carbon (Figure 21). The feature was located in the AK2 soil horizon of
BHT-111 at a depth of 100-109 centimeters b.g.s. The flake observed in the feature was
inadvertently not collected. The carbon fleck was submitted for radiocarbon dating but was lost
by the radiocarbon lab.

35

Figure 21: Outflow line Feature 1.
Outflow Line Feature 2
This feature consisted of a shallow burned rock hearth in BHT-109 measuring
approximately 1.1 x 1.5 meters (Figure 22). It was located at a depth of 8-24 centimeters b.g.s.
in the AP and Ak soil horizons. Two test units were excavated in the north and east walls of the
trench to expose the entire feature. A total of 66 limestone and sandstone cobbles and pebbles
were recovered from the feature. The rocks were scattered but formed a concentric pattern in the
middle section of the feature. Many of the rocks exhibited discoloration from exposure to fire.
Artifacts recovered from the feature include a high density of lithic debris and flakes (n=30), as
well as the tip of an arrow point, three unifacially-retouched flake tools, one core and a broken
mano (Figure 23). The arrow point fragment could not be typed (Figure 23b). The unifacial
tools include two spokeshaves, a small scraper with fine, steep retouch and a thin flake tool with
retouch along the lateral edges of the ventral surface (Figure 23a). Potlids on two flakes suggest
that these flakes were exposed to fire. Faunal remains from the feature include three long bone
fragments (unidentified mammal), a freshwater mussel shell fragment and several Rabdotus and
Helicina shells. One bone fragment appears to have been burned. Four small samples of
charcoal were also recovered from the feature. These samples were submitted for radiocarbon
dating but were lost by the radiocarbon lab. A sample of bone was subsequently sent to a
different laboratory and was successfully dated.
The arrow point tip recovered in the feature cross-dates to either the Late Prehistoric or
Historic periods (see Figure 23b.; Turner and Hester 1985). However, an AMS radiocarbon date
obtained from a sample of bone places the feature firmly in the Late Prehistoric period. The
sample yielded a conventional radiocarbon date of 440 Â± 40 B.P (Beta-245519). The 2 sigma
calibrated range of the date (with intercept) is cal A.D. 1420 [1440] 1490.

drill base (showing ventral face of flake); b. arrow point tip.
Several historic artifacts were dispersed throughout the feature. They comprise four
fragments of glazed whiteware pottery, two small fragments of metal, and five glass shards
(Figure 24). These artifacts are presumably unassociated with the feature culturally and
chronologically. While they could not be precisely dated, certain characteristics of the artifacts
relating to fabrication methods suggest a relatively recent origin, probably 19th or 20th century.
The ceramic sherds, which are likely from a single vessel (a plate or saucer with a ring base and
embossed curvilinear design), recall mass-produced dinnerware (see Figure 24a-d). The metal
artifacts have been tentatively identified as fragments of containers made of tinplate steel. One
metal artifact is a section of a folded rim (see Figure 24e), and the other is a piece of a ribbed

37

side wall (see Figure 24f.). Traces of what may be tin plate covering the sheet steel are visible
on the rim. The glass shards appear to be molded rather than hand-blown (see Figure 24g-k).

Outflow Line Feature 3
This prehistoric hearth feature was encountered in BHT-107 at 93-110 centimeters b.g.s.
(Figure 25). It was situated near the base of the Bkt horizon. The feature measured
approximately 160 x 50 centimeters and contained burned rock, three chert flakes, two mussel
shell fragments and Rabdotus and Helicina snail shells. The shells were submitted for
radiocarbon dating but were lost by the radiocarbon lab. No charcoal was recovered. A 1 x 1
meter test unit excavated adjacent to the feature in the north trench wall north yielded no
additional remains.

38

Figure 25: Outflow line Feature 3.
Outflow Line Feature 4
Feature 4, a prehistoric hearth, was encountered in the Bkt and C1 soil horizons in BHT107. The bulk of the feature was situated between 105 and 120 centimeters b.g.s., but a large
mussel shell and a few cobbles were recovered at depths ranging from 120-140 centimeters b.g.s.
The feature consisted of a scatter of burned rocks and 11 chert flakes surrounded a more dense
concentration of rocks. Most of the rocks were limestone stream cobbles, possibly taken from
nearby Berry Creek, and were fist-sized or smaller. Rabdotus and Helicina snail shells and
fragments of freshwater mussel shells were also recovered from the feature. The shells were
submitted for radiocarbon dating but were lost by the radiocarbon lab. No substantial deposits of
charcoal were encountered, though flecks of charcoal were noted throughout the hearth and on
the bottom of most stones.
The feature was leveled off and cleaned at 110 centimeters b.g.s. (Figure 26). All burned
rock, a chert flake, and a mussel shell were pedestaled and mapped in place. At this depth the
feature spanned the entire width of the trench (approximately 1 meter) from north to south and
from an unexcavated bulk on the west to the continued trench to the eastâa distance of about 2
meters. Assuming the hearth was round to oval, the feature probably extends another meter into
the trench walls.

39

Figure 26: Outflow line Feature 4.
A 10-centimeter level was then removed using a shovel and trowel, again leaving
hearthstones and artifacts on pedestals. At this level the western part of the hearth was evidently
higher than the east and contained substantially less burned rock. A second drawing was made at
a depth of 120 centimeters b.g.s. to show a concentration of hearthstones in the east and north
sides of the feature. All artifacts were then removed, and matrix samples were taken in the
northeast corner of the feature for floatation analysis. The subsurface was probed but no
additional remains were observed. Trenching then continued, with careful monitoring, to a depth
of 220 centimeters b.g.s. One large mussel shell and several cobbles were encountered from
120-140 centimeters b.g.s. in the area under the heaviest concentration of remains in the
northeast part of the feature.
Outflow Line Feature 5
This prehistoric hearth feature was found in the C1 soil horizon at the bottom of BHT108 and extended from 120-130 centimeters b.g.s. (Figure 27). The dimensions of the feature
were approximately 2 meters east/west and 20-30 centimeters north/south. The feature contained
several burned rocks, 22 chert flakes, a chert core and a small, unidentified bone fragment.
Potlids were present on two of the flakes, suggesting that these flakes were exposed to fire. No
charcoal was recovered. After the feature was recorded, the excavation of the trench continued.
No further remains were encountered below the feature.

40

Figure 27: Outflow line Feature 5.
Outflow Line Feature 6
This small prehistoric hearth feature was located in the Bk1 soil horizon in BHT-111 at a
depth of 145-153 centimeters b.g.s. (Figure 28). The feature measured 20 x 22 centimeters and
consisted of three burned rocks. No artifacts or charcoal were recovered. The burned rocks were
not collected.
Discussion
Three archaeological surveys associated with the Pecan Branch Wastewater Treatment
Plant were conducted in the project area prior to AAGâs investigation (Feit and Griffith 2000;
Karbula et al. 2004; RCRI 2008). These surveys recorded two archaeological sitesâ41WM828
on the terrace between Berry Creek and Pecan Branch and 41WM965 on the Berry Creek
floodplain. Based on the results of the surveys, the THC authorized construction of the treatment
plant but requested additional testing along planned inflow and outflow lines. AAGâs
investigation was designed to identify the horizontal and vertical distribution of cultural deposits
located along the outflow and inflow lines and to obtain cultural-chronological data appropriate
to evaluate the significance of the deposits. While AAGâs investigation was considerably
smaller in scope than the preceding 2001 Hicks and Company survey, it provided substantial
new information concerning the nature, distribution and antiquity of cultural remains in the
project area. Backhoe trenching along the routes of the proposed lines exposed eight prehistoric
hearth featuresâtwo on the inflow line and six on the outflow line. AAG recorded Site
41WM1063 on the outflow line.

41

The inflow line is located near the top of the terrace between Berry Creek and Pecan
Branch and is considered here to fall within the previously recorded Site 41WM828. The two
features encountered by AAG on the inflow line (Features 1 and 2) were both located in the Ak
soil horizon. This soil horizon falls within what Karbula et al. (2004:Figure 6-3) refer to as Strat
2 in their report of the 2001 Hicks and Company survey of the project area. Inflow line Feature
1 was recorded at 40 centimeters b.g.s. and was dated by geoarchaeological modeling to 2589
B.P. (see Figure 17). Inflow line Feature 2 extended from 30-40 centimeters b.g.s. and was dated
by geoarchaeological modeling to 2188 B.P (see Figure 17). Neither of the features yielded
temporally-diagnostic artifacts, bone, charcoal or macrobotanical plant remains.

Figure 28: Outflow line Feature 6.
The results of AAGâs archaeological testing on the inflow line are generally consistent
with the results of testing on the upper terrace by Hicks and Company in 2001 (Karbula et al.
2004). Both investigations recorded:
â¢ Isolated Middle and Late Archaic burned rock hearth features;
â¢ A concentration of features at a depth of around 40 centimeters b.g.s.;
â¢ Lithic assemblages reflecting the production and maintenance of unifacial and bifacial
stone tools;
â¢ Shells of land snails and freshwater mussels associated with hearth features;
â¢ A near absence of preserved bone, charcoal and macrobotanical plant remains.
Karbula et al. (2004:115, Table 9-4) observed scattered, low-density remains on the
terrace at depths of 75-95 centimeters b.g.s. during the 2001 Hicks and Company survey.
However, remains at these depths were only encountered in trenches located over 150 meters to
the southeast of the inflow line. Trenches excavated by Hicks and Company in the area of the

42

inflow line (Hicks BHTs 97, 98, 105 and 106) did not expose any cultural remains below 68
centimeters b.g.s. (Karbula et al. 2004:Table 7-19).
The outflow line lies in the southeast corner of the project area approximately 200 meters
north of the confluence Berry Creek, Pecan Branch and the San Gabriel River. AAG excavated
six prehistoric hearth features on the outflow line and recorded them as Site 41WM1063. The
features were generally situated at significantly greater depths than the features encountered on
the inflow line. The one exception was outflow line Feature 2, which extended from 8-24
centimeters b.g.s. in the AP/Ak soil horizons of BHT-109. This feature has been placed
chronologically in the Late Prehistoric period based on a cross-dated arrow point fragment and a
radiocarbon date run on bone whose 2 sigma calibrated range is cal A.D. 1420-1490 (Beta245519). The remaining five features were encountered at depths ranging from 93-153 cm b.g.s.
in several different soil horizons in BHTs 107, 108 and 111 (see Appendix III). All of these
features fall within what Karbula et al. (2004) refer to as Strat 2 in their report of the 2001 Hicks
and Company survey of the project area. No radiocarbon dates were obtained from the deeply
buried features on the outflow line, but two of the features were dated by geoarchaeological
modeling. Outflow line Feature 1, located in BHT-111 at a depth of 100-109 centimeters below
surface, was dated to 1683 B.P. (see Figure 17). Outflow line Feature 6, located in BHT-111 at a
depth of 145-153 centimeters below surface, was dated to 4636 B.P. (see Figure 17). In contrast
to the features on the inflow line, features on the outflow line yielded charcoal and bone
fragments. No macrobotanical remains were recovered in floatation samples from the features.
As was the case on the inflow line, the results of AAGâs archaeological testing on the
outflow line are generally consistent with those reported by Karbula et al. (2004) in the report on
the 2001 Hicks and Company survey. In the area of the outflow line, both investigations
recorded:
â¢ Isolated burned rock hearth features;
â¢ Features located at depths greater than those located at higher elevations on the terrace;
â¢ Lithic assemblages reflecting the production and maintenance of unifacial and bifacial
stone tools;
â¢ Shells of land snails and freshwater mussels associated with hearth features;
â¢ Preserved bone and charcoal.
No cultural features or other cultural remains were encountered in BHTs 112, 113 or 114
at the eastern end of the outflow line near Berry Creek. Two backhoe trenches excavated by
Hicks and Company in the same area (Hicks BHT 65 and 77) also yielded negative results
(Karbula et al. 2004:41). There are several possible reasons for the apparent absence of cultural
remains in this area. At the eastern end of the outflow line, approximately Â½ meter of fine
alluvial deposits overlie gravel deposits. Between the gravel and fine-grained alluvium is an
erosional surface. This unconformity represents a hiatus of unknown duration. The Â½ meter or
so of fine-grained alluvium above the gravels was probably deposited within the last 4000 years
and has been subject to processes of erosion and redeposition. Additionally, the impact of
relatively recent activities such as clearing, plowing, and contouring would be deeper at the
eastern end of the outflow line than in other parts of the project area because of the steeper slope.
The construction of the elevated railroad embankment to the south of the outflow line may have
further impacted the soil.

43

The chronological sequence of the deeply buried cultural deposits further to the west on
the outflow line remains poorly understood due to a lack of temporally-diagnostic artifacts and
radiocarbon dates. AAGâs geoarchaeological modeling suggests that the deeply buried outflow
features 1 and 6 date to the Archaic period (see Figure 17). These two features have a combined
depth range of 100-153 centimeters b.g.s. The other deeply buried outflow line features (features
3-5) have a similar combined depth range (93-130 centimeters b.g.s.). This suggests that all of
the deeply buried outflow features fall roughly within the chronological range defined by
outflow features 1 and 6. Assuming that all the outflow line features except Feature 2 are
Archaic, the fact that they are deeper than known Archaic features at higher elevations on the
terrace is likely attributable to differential depositional rates in the two areas (more rapid
deposition near Berry Creek).
In sum, AAGâs investigation confirmed the presence of intact deposits of prehistoric
cultural remains along both the inflow and outflow lines. Data from AAGâs investigation and
previous surveys conducted in anticipation of the construction of the Pecan Branch Wastewater
Treatment Plant suggest that small, isolated Archaic and Late Prehistoric features are present
throughout most of the project area with the possible exception of the extreme eastern end of the
outflow line. In areas not disturbed and not overlain by T0 deposits, the surface of Terrace 1
may contain assemblages of sites spanning Early Archaic to present. Where undisturbed,
Terrace 0 may contain assemblages of sites spanning Middle Archaic to present. Accordingly,
the majority of the project areaâincluding sites 41WM828, 41WM965 and 41WM1063âis
considered worthy of designation as a SAL. Sections of the project area along the Berry Creek
floodplain appear to have the greatest archaeological potential due to both better preservation of
carbon and organic material (primarily bone) and greater stratigraphic separation between
features.

44

RECOMMENDATIONS
Archaeological testing along the proposed Pecan Branch Wastewater inflow and outflow
lines in Williamson County, Texas performed for the City of Georgetown identified two
archaeological sites in the project area, 41WM828 and 41WM1063. Both sites are considered
potentially eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and worthy
of designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL).
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) excavated all features encountered along the
routes of the proposed inflow and outflow lines. Based on the clearance of the features, the THC
concurred that the City of Georgetown could proceed with construction. It is important to note,
however, that the results of this and previous investigations suggest that intact deposits of
cultural remains are located in adjacent areas. Additional testing and/or mitigation may be
necessary in these areas to further evaluate these potential deposits. Should any sites be located
during the planned construction, all work within the site should cease until the situation can be
evaluated by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, in consultation with
AAG and the City of Georgetown.
