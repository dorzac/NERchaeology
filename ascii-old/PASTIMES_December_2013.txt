Archeological Investigations at the Colonel John I. Gregg Battle Site (41RD77),
Randall County, Texas: Part 1

Alvin Lynn and Rolla H. Shaller
From the spring of 2000 through the winter of 2002, we periodically conducted a systematic search
along Palo Duro Creek in central Randall County. Equipped with metal detectors and hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units, we located, mapped, and recorded the site of an Indian attack made on Colonel
John I. Gregg’s Eighth U.S. Cavalry in 1872. The subsequent discovery of approximately 200 military- and
Indian-associated artifacts of the 1870 time period indicates that this battle was fought approximately 2 mi
northeast of the present-day city of Canyon, Texas. In addition to the standard description of our site investigation and the recorded artifacts, this report includes excerpts from a diary kept by one of the soldiers under
Colonel Gregg’s command when the battle took place.
Late in the summer of 1872, Colonel John Irvin Gregg departed from Fort Bascom, New Mexico, and
headed for Texas in command of the Eighth U.S. Cavalry. The purpose of this 40-day expedition onto the
Staked Plains of West Texas was to locate and report the locations of hostile Indians who had reportedly attacked settlers in the area. Kiowa Indians attacked Gregg’s command during the early morning hours of August 16, 1872, while they were encamped along Palo Duro Creek in what is now Randall County, Texas.
Though brief, the skirmish was recorded in the personal diary of Private Eddie Matthews and in several later
military reports.
Background
Colonel John Irvin Gregg’s 1872 campaign into the Texas Panhandle from New Mexico was one of
many undertaken during the 1860s and early 1870s (Gregg 1872). Most of these expeditions originated at Fort
Union, located near present-day Las Vegas, but Fort Bascom, 9 mi from Tucumcari, New Mexico, was the actual jumping-off place for the troops as they headed eastward into the Texas Panhandle or into the Indian Territory of Oklahoma. Information about the expeditions has come primarily from military records, but occasionally an enlisted man kept a diary. Eddie Matthews, a private who served under Colonel Gregg, kept “a
small ‘journal’ of events” (Koster 1980) documenting his experience as a soldier during the Indian Wars of
Texas and New Mexico. The animated descriptions Matthews sent “To the loved ones at Home” (Koster
1980: 100) impart an insight into these events that is usually lacking in most official reports.

During the summer of 1872, the Eighth Cavalry
was camped along the Canadian River near Fort Bascom.
Although Fort Bascom was officially closed in 1870, it
remained a point of departure for campaigns to the east.
On August 7, Colonel Gregg left Fort Bascom for Texas
with a regiment of 229 soldiers divided into Troops B, D,
L, and M; 2 citizen guides; and 14 citizen employees.
Thirty-three 6-mule wagons, two 4-mule wagons, and
three 4-mule ambulances were used to haul supplies and
rations. Several head of cattle were also driven along as a
source of food for the troops.
Colonel Gregg’s command marched southeast to a site near Tucumcari Mountain, where they spent the
night near a small lake. Then they continued southeast for two days until they came to the Fort Smith-Santa Fe
Road. At this camp Eddie Matthews commented in his diary on the abilities of the military cooks:
Our cooks (kind hearted fellows) thought they would treat us to some soft bread. So last night
they baked. At breakfast this morning I was handed something which from its color and weight I presumed must be part of a brick, but was told by the cook that it was my ration of bread. Now I believe
my digestive organs are about as strong as the majority of the white race and I would no more attempt
their powers on that piece of bread, than I would on a 12 lb. solid shot. I politely thanked our gentlemanly cook, but declined eating any of his fresh bread, preferring “hard tack” which had been baked in
some mechanical bakery in the first year of the late Rebellion (Koster 1980: 100).
The command traveled eastward along the Fort Smith Road for approximately 10 mi. Near Salidito
Springs in present Quay County, New Mexico, they turned southeast, onto a road that would take them up a
gradual slope onto the High Plains. They marched southeast to Ojo Garcia (present Garcia Lake in Deaf Smith
County, Texas), which was a large, nearly dry lake with springs located in creeks along the west edge. There
was enough water in the springs for the command and the livestock, so Colonel Gregg chose to make camp
there. Eddie Matthews described his impression of the High Plains in this journal entry:
We ascended a high hill then found ourselves on the “famous staked Plains” of Texas. Famous
for wild game of all kinds including Kiowa and Comanche Indians . . . What a pity some poor man could
not own about forty miles of this land in some Eastern City. It would then be worth something, but as it
is, it is not worth one cent an acre at the present time. And it never will be worth any more (Koster
1980: 101).

After leaving Ojo Garcia, the command marched southeast until they reached Punta de Agua on Tierra
Blanca Creek in present Deaf Smith County.

They followed this creek for a day and a half before turning

northeast to Palo Duro Creek. After continuing along the Palo Duro for 3 mi, they made camp on the flood
plain near the confluence of the Tierra Blanca and the Palo Duro approximately 2 mi northeast of the presentday city of Canyon. With a more plentiful source of water than the rest of the area, this camp was probably
more appealing than other options in that arid location. However, Eddie Matthews apparently was not favorably impressed with this site: “Yesterday’s march brought us to the commencement of a very rough looking
country, and our camp was located in a splendid place for a surprise, and night attack by Indians” (Koster
1980: 101). Matthews most likely did not anticipate that his prediction would come to pass within hours of
that journal entry:
About 1 o’clock A.M., I awoke from a sound sleep by the report of several carbines, connected
with the most unearthly yelling it has ever been my misfortune to listen to. It sounded to me like all the
Devils incarnate, and all the Demons of Hell had issued forth in that one lonely spot to make the night
hideous with their orgies. No pen is capable of describing my feelings at that moment. I of course knew
that we were “jumped,” (attacked) by Indians, and from those blood-chilling yells, I imagined we had
been totally surprised and that the Indians were right in our midst, dealing death on all sides.
I was only a moment getting a cartridge in my carbine, and with revolver in one hand and carbine
in the other with only my shirt and pants on, I ran to the right of our troop and on a line with “B” Troop
where the firing and yelling was the loudest. I could see the Indians by the light of the moon riding in a
circle near our lines, firing at us as they charged by. I discharged my carbine at the first Indians I saw,
and never taking time to notice with what effect I reloaded and fired as fast as I possibly could. By this
time our whole Command was up and the firing became more general. The Indians seeing that there was
no hope for them, commenced to withdraw. At this state of the fight a detail of 10 picked men was made
from each troop to form a line and advance about one hundred yards from camp and take station as pickets. I was one of the numbers from our troop. We advanced at a double quick step, firing at the retreating Indians as we ran. When we reached the prescribed distance from camp, we came to a halt, and kept
up a fire from our carbines, as long as we could hear a yell from an Indian. Finally all became quiet,
when we deployed as pickets. And there remained until daylight relieved us from our unpleasant watch
(Koster 1980: 101).
Gregg (1872) recorded that an estimated 40 mounted Indians attacked the troops, with some of the Indians keeping up a scathing, armed attack from the surrounding bluffs. The reported casualties for the command were 1 enlisted man wounded, 2 mules killed, 1 horse wounded, and 8 head of beef cattle lost. Among
the Indians, 4 were killed and 8 wounded.

After this fight the command spent almost a month reconnoitering the country along the north side of
the Red River and south of the present town of Clarendon. The scouts had mistaken a large hill south of present-day Clarendon in Donley County for the Quitaque Peaks in Motley County, so the command never
reached the intended destination. They retraced their route back to their camp near Fort Bascom, arriving on
September 14, 1872.
Setting
The Colonel John I. Gregg 1872 battle site (41RD77) is located along an alluvial-colluvial bench on the
north side of Palo Duro Creek and the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River in central Randall County
(Figure 1). Randall County is situated near the center of the Texas Panhandle. The county seat, Canyon, is
located in what was once a Pleistocene lake basin. The township is situated to the west of the confluence of
Tierra Blanca and Palo Duro creeks. Just northeast of Canyon, the Tierra Blanca flows into the Palo Duro.
Several area maps indicate that this is the beginning of the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River, while
other maps continue to refer to the Palo Duro Creek until after it reaches the confluence of South Cita Creek.
The headwaters of Tierra Blanca Creek begin in central eastern New Mexico and the creek meanders eastsoutheast into the Texas Panhandle. The headwaters of Palo Duro Creek, which eventually becomes the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River, begin in western Deaf Smith County. The creek meanders eastward
across Deaf Smith and Randall counties cutting through the Llano Estacado and flowing through the Palo Duro
Canyon lands. Through time, the forces of Palo Duro Creek have formed numerous deep canyons as well as
wide flood plains on either side of the creek as it crossed the county. The Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red
River eventually joins with the Salt and North Forks of the Red River to form the boundary between Texas and
Oklahoma.
Both commercial and noncommercial development has had a significant impact on an area within a 2
mi radius of the battle site. East of the site, development of a restricted cooperative village began in the early
1900s, and this cooperative continues to operate in 2008. To the north, above the escarpment, construction of
another large home site development began in the early 1970’s. The areas to the west and southwest have
been compromised by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad since the early 1900s, and by a section of
Interstate 27 that was constructed in the mid-1980s. This section of highway is within a half mile of the site.
Perhaps the greatest impact to the Gregg battle site was caused by a major flood in 1978 that had a devastating effect on the whole area.

On May 27, heavy rain in the watersheds of the Tierra Blanco and Palo Duro creeks resulted in torrents of water rushing over the creek banks and across their flood plains. The powerful force of the flood washed several
houses from their foundations just east of and below the battle site.
The Gregg battle site is located along the eastern portion of a 10-acre field. The field and the lower
surrounding areas have been under almost constant cultivation since the mid-1900s and possibly earlier. The
site is bordered on the north by a steep caliche escarpment, to the west and south by a broad flood basin of the
Palo Duro Creek, and to the east by the beginning narrows of Palo Duro Canyon (Figure 2). At the present
time, native grasses have returned to the area containing the largest portion of the site. A north-south property
line fence bisects the eastern portion of the site; few artifacts related to the site have been located east of the
fence. Another east-west wire fence bisects the southern portion of the site.
The present landowner has constructed a residence, a horse barn, corrals, and a roping arena to the immediate north and northwest of the site. He recently built a small pond along the southern edge of the site and
a pipeline that crosses a portion of the site from the stock pond to a windmill located near the corrals.
Methodology
Our methods for locating the Colonel John I. Gregg 1872 battle site were similar to those the Texas
Historical Commission used during the 1998-1999 Red River War Battle Sites Project (Cruse et al. 2000,
2001). The metal detector types used during this investigation included a Whites Spectrum XLT and Garrett
Models 750 and 1000. One of the Garrett models was equipped with a deep scan coil for maximum soil penetration. Random metal detector searches were made at several possible locations for the site.
Upon finding a series of associated artifacts, we began using a more systematic search method that included a sweeping grid pattern in which a series of parallel passes with metal detectors was made in one direction across the site. A second series of parallel sweeps was made at right angles to the first. The width of each
sweep of a metal detector varies among individual users and is based on height, arm length, and length of
stride, but some sweeps can be as much as 1 meter. As an artifact was recovered, its location was flagged, and
a GPS reading was later recorded for each artifact before it was collected. These GPS readings were later used
in the production of the artifact distribution map (Figure 3). Each artifact was placed in a separate collection
bag and recorded numerically as it was collected. Once all the artifacts were collected, they were cleaned,
catalogued, and photographed. To search for isolated Indian artifacts, we used similar procedures to investigate areas beyond the military site proper, which included the windmill/stock pond pipeline trench and back
dirt that remained after the excavation.

2013 Fannin Middle School History Festival
By Beryl Hughes
Participation in the Fannin History Fair (October 19) has been an ongoing project for PAS. Naturally our contribution has been more prehistory
than history, and this year we again presented spear throwing using atlatls and corn grinding. Dick Carter, Beryl Hughes and Paul Katz presided at
the grinding site.
The flat slab type of grinding stones are generally called by the Spanish term “metate” and the accompanying smaller stone held in the hand is
called a “mano”. Elsewhere they may be called “Querns”. Small round grinding bowls used in conjunction with hand-held tool have been used
mainly by pharmacists and are called a “Mortar” and “Pestle.” These are also used by artists to grind pigments.
We had several metates set around the edges of a tarp to
catch flying debris and save the surface of the gym floor. Each
had its accompanying mano. One small round mortar with its
pestle was also included. Children were excited to participate
and we did our best to teach them, admittedly with limited success, the rocking motion needed for efficient grinding. The
metates and manos were fairly small, so it was hard to use both
hands at once. There are several sites in the Panhandle where
grinding stones were made on exposures of bedrock. The act of
grinding produced deep round holes in the rock.
The only grain we had was corn, so we talked about the production of flour (masa) for corn bread or corn-meal mush and
tamales. In actual use of course, the grinding stones would have
also been used to crack nuts, soften fruits and berries, and prepare meat for jerky. Try to imagine cracking acorns with your
teeth and the utility of the grinding stone becomes apparent.
Grinding stones have been used in all times and places, with
little difference in appearance. Colin Renfrew in Prehistory:
The Making of the Human Mind calls “The use of querns and
Students Line Up for Spear Throwing Lessons
grindstones, and of other tools suitable for the processing of
such plants” one of those “features associated with the neolithic revolution in western Asia and subsequently in Europe.” (2013:76).
Participants in the History Fair paraded by our spot
all through the day. There were Indians and pioneers,
Union and Confederate soldiers (the gray outnumbered
the blue; this is Texas after all!) and even Crusader
knights, some dressed as Templars. At the opposite end
of the gym, fencers sliced and jabbed with their epee’s,
and an occasional youngster took a hesitant turn. Many
groups were set up outside, including Rolla, Alvin, and
Joe showing visitors how to throw the spears using
atlatls. Craftsmen offered their handiwork for sale.
The event was a day-long affair, and a lunch of chili
dogs and soft drinks was provided, along with a booth
for candy and gum, to keep us all from fainting from
hunger and exhaustion. These things are harder than they
look!
As the old-time newspapers used to say, “A good
time was had by all.”.
