FOREWORD
This document represents the finalization of a draft report submitted to the Railroad
Commission of Texas, Surface Mining and Reclamation Division, in 1989. The finalization of this
document is based upon a comment review letter from the Texas Historical Commission dated
November 2, 1989 to the Railroad Commission.
Because a number of years have passed since the original document was written and
submitted for agency review, some of the recommendations may be outdated, superseded, or
completed as a part of continuing work in the mine. No effort has been made to alter any of the
original recommendations or to amend the text in any manner except in response to the
November 2, 1989 letter from the Commission which was principally concerned with
geomorphology.
Since the original draft document was reviewed, cultural resource management within
Monticello B-2 has continued. Some of the decisions and agreements reached since the report was
first written are listed below:

10723/880206

(1)

a final Environmental Impact Statement dated September, 1991 has been
completed;

(2)

a Programmatic Agreement regarding the Monticello B-2 Lignite Mine Project
has been signed and is presented as Appendix E in the above referenced
document;

(3)

a Treatment Plan for the Monticello B-2 Surface Lignite Mine was developed
in 1992 and was accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the
same year;

(4)

a Plan for the Survey of Unsurveyed Areas of the Monticello B-2 Surface
Lignite Mine was also developed in 1992 and was accepted by the EPA the
same year;

(5)

both survey of previously surveyed areas and National Register eligibility testing
of six sites was completed in 1992 for the Monticello B-2 First Five-Year
Disturbance Area (sites 41 TT154, 370, 372, 373, 550, and 555);

(6)

testing of ten sites (41TT392, 396, 398, 399, 400, 406, 409, 413, 600, and 601)
to be affected by dewatering impacts in the Monticello B-2 Surface Mine was
begun in late 1992;

(7)

data recovery of Site 41TT372 was initiated during the summer of 1993; and

(8)

data recovery of Site 41 TT550 is scheduled to be conducted in late 1993 and
early 1994.

ABSTRACT
A cultural resources survey of lands within the Monticello B-2 study area was
conducted from October 1987 through May 1989 by personnel from Espey, Huston & Associates,
Inc. A total of 237 archaeolo_gical sites, including four historic cemeteries and 131 sites with
prehistoric components, was recorded. In the opinion of the consulting cultural resource
personnel, six sites represent the locations of structures which may be eligible for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places. Avoidance of these sites and all cemeteries is
recommended. Archival and/or oral histories are recommended on six sites and limited
archaeological testing is recommended on 32 prehistoric and nine historic sites if the sites are to
be impacted by mine-related activity. Out of 530 hectares of land not surveyed, 140 hectares are
recommended for survey if the area is to be impacted. Testing for deeply buried sites is
recommended in the Tankersley Creek drainage which is a part of the First Five Year Mine Plan.
Prehistoric sites dated from the Early Archaic to the Late Caddoan. Historic sites dated from the
1870s, with the majority dating from the first quarter of the twentieth century. A predictive model
for prehistoric site locations utilized for the Monticello-Winfield Tract H mine and the proposed
Monticello-Leesburg mine was only partially validated, with more sites recorded than predicted.

I: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the findings of cultural resource investigations conducted by
Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EH&A) within the Monticello B-2 (B-2) study area for Texas
Utilities Mining Company (TUMCO). The investigation study area encompassed approximately
5,524 hectares (ha) of land, of which about 4,994 ha were subjected to intensive pedestrian survey.
A total of 237 archaeological sites were identified within the study area, including 4 historic
cemeteries and 131 sites with prehistoric components. Table 1 documents each of the sites
recorded within the study area and addresses each site's significance relative to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), in the opinion of the consulting personnel from EH&A.
Prehistoric sites ranging from the Early Archaic through the Late Caddoan were
recorded within the study area. Results of EH&A's ongoing prehistoric settlement modeling effort
in the Monticello area were compared with previous efforts in Tract H of the Monticello-Winfield
mine complex, and with the results of the proposed Monticello-Leesburg mine. The trend for site
densities to be larger on higher Strahler drainage order streams noted in Tract H and MonticelloLeesburg by EH&A continues for B-2, with the distance to the nearest Strahler third-order or
larger stream showing to be a statistically significant variable. The biotic zone variables of slope
and bottomland also show to be important in terms of overall site density.
Unlike Monticello-Leesburg, the predicted number of prehistoric sites expected to be
found in the B-2 study area fell way below the actual survey totals. An error of over 200 percent
was, in fact, incurred; i.e., over 200 percent more sites were found in the study area than expected.
This increase in sites is thought to reflect a high-density stream network in the study area and,
perhaps more importantly, the proximity of the nearby trunk stream, White Oak Creek, north of
the study area.
Historic settlement patterns in the study area, not unexpectedly, are typical of the
northeast Texas region and follow traditions closely associated with the Upland South. Most of
these pioneers came in large groups from their native states and settled in close proximity to one
another. Since the slave-plantation system never fully developed in the study area, as it did in
other parts of the state, farms have always been relatively small, and tracts of land in many cases
have been partitioned and passed down to descendants of the original pioneers. The resulting
settlement pattern is characterized by small pockets of closely related families, although this trend
has been disrupted in the highly mobile, post-World War II era. Black ownership and settlement
of lands has been relegated to less desirable and less productive areas. Transportation lines have
greatly influenced both historic and contemporary settlement patterns. Early roads, to a great
extent, followed property lines of pioneers' farmsteads and became the basis for the present county
road network. The vast majority of dwellings documented in field investigations were located in
close proximity to these thoroughfares.
Recommendations for a program of cultural resources management are summarized
below.

II: INTRODUCTION

TUMCO contracted with EH&A to conduct a cultural resources survey of all lands
not previously surveyed for cultural resources within the proposed B-2 surface coal mine study area
(Figure 1). The total study area encompasses approximately 5,524 ha, of which about 90 percent,
or 4,994 ha, were subjected to intensive pedestrian survey, defined herein as 100 percent coverage
of all areas walked by survey crews.
The B-2 study area is a part of the larger Monticello-Winfield mine complex operated
by TUMCO in Titus and Franklin counties, Texas. In Titus County, immediately southwest of the
study area, TUMCO is presently operating in the Winfield-North and the Winfield-South mines.
Both areas have been subjected to previous investigations by EH&A (Bond et al. 1984; Glander
et al. 1986a) and others (see Chapter IV of this report). A portion of the present study area
shown in Figure 2 (about 140 ha) was previously surveyed by EH&A in 1985 during survey of the
Winfield-North mine (Glander et al. 1986a).
The Monticello-Winfield mine complex also includes the Monticello Tract H mine and
the proposed Monticello-Leesburg mine (Figure 2). Both areas have been investigated for cultural
resources by EH&A (Brown et al. 1986; Glander et al. 1987). Tract His located in both Titus and
Franklin counties, and the proposed Monticello-Leesburg mine is in Camp County south of Big
Cypress Creek (Lake Bob Sandlin).
The B-2 study area is located in Titus County and lies between Winfield, Texas, to the
west, Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to the south, Stinking Creek to the east, and White Oak Creek to the
north (Figure 1). Approximately the northern two-thirds of the study area drain northward and
fall within the White Oak Creek/Sulphur River drainage basin; the rest of the study area drains
southward into the Cypress Creek drainage basin (Figure 1).
This study was performed in compliance with the Procedures of the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation (36 CFR 800); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665),
as amended in 1974, 1976, and 1980; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190,
83 Sta. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the Office of Surface Mining Regulations, as superceded by the
Coal Mining Regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission, January 1, 1981; and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the
Council of Texas Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service (NPS) criteria (36 CFR, Part 60.6, the Department of the Interior) which present the
guidelines for determining eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the NRHP. These
regulations state:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture
is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of State and local
importance that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling and association and:

The following objectives formed the basis of the site definition program adopted for the
investigation:
1.

Determination of the prehistoric/historic components present;

2.

Determination of the horizontal and vertical extent of each component;

3.

Evaluation of each site's potential for further problem-oriented research; and

4.

Determination of site integrity.

The EH&A staff member directly responsible for the report content is Principal
Investigator Wayne P. Glander. Field work was conducted under the direction of Laura K. Jones.
Laura Jones wrote the floral and fauna} sections of Chapter III, portions of Chapter V, most of
Chapter VI (excluding some historic site descriptions), the ceramic and lithic analyses sections of
Chapter VIII, and Chapter IX. Laura Jones also contributed throughout the remainder of the
report, especially in the settlement discussion sections of Chapter VIII. David Moore, EH&A
historian, authored the Historic Perspective section in Chapter III and contributed to chapters VI,
VIII, and IX. Historian Karen Yancy, hired by EH&A late in the study, contributed to
Chapter VI. David Brown contributed to chapters V and VIII. Charles Frederick wrote the
geology/geomorphological/soils/hydrology sections of Chapter III and contributed to Chapter V and
Chapter VIII. Robert Rogers (EH&A's geoarchaeologist) authored the geoarchaeological
investigations chapter (VII) and contributed to Chapter VIII. Dr. Mary Parker, Statistician with
Austin Community College, contributed to the statistical data set presented in Chapter VIII.
Wayne Glander wrote the remaining sections and compiled the complete report.
Field work was conducted during a span of approximately 20 months, from October
1987 through May 1989. Work was conducted in five separate phases because the study area
boundaries were expanded twice by TUMCO. The first phase, conducted from October 1987
through November 1987, covered the study area west of Highway 2152 and north of Highway 1734
(Figure 1). The second phase covered most of the study area east of Highway 2152 and was
conducted in March and April 1988. The third phase was conducted in June and July of 1988 and
included areas east of Tankersley Lake and north of New City Lake (Figure 1). During these three
phases, access could not be obtained for approximately 2,000 ha. The fourth phase was conducted

10723/880206

15

in January and February of 1989 when much of this area was available for survey. Backhoe
trenching for geomorphology and site location analysis was conducted in May of 1989 as the fifth
phase of work.
Approximately 10 percent of the study area was not surveyed for cultural resources.
The principal reasons for this were absentee landowners who could not be contacted for access
permission, or owners who simply refused access. Figure A-1 documents these unsurveyed areas.
Analysis and report preparation were conducted concurrently and were completed
about 23 months after the initiation of field work. Records and artifacts are, if accepted, to be
curated at Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, Texas. In this report, measurements
of depth, surface area, etc. are typically presented in the metric system for greater accuracy. The
English system of measurement is occasionally used, however, when referencing historic resources,
since the English system was used in building construction.
This report is divided into ten chapters. Chapter I presents the management
summary, which details the results of the survey and presents specific recommendations.
Chapter II provides the introduction. The third and fourth chapters describe the environmental
setting and give a brief summary of the regional prehistory and history. These chapters are
included so that the survey results can be placed within a framework describing the natural and
cultural resources of the study area. The research design is presented in Chapter V, while
Chapter VI documents the historic and prehistoric field techniques and describes all sites recorded
during the survey. Chapter VII details the geoarchaeological investigations that were carried out
in the field. Interpretations of the results of the survey data, including data on our settlement
modeling efforts, are presented in Chapter VIII. Chapter IX contains recommendations and
Chapter X, the last chapter, contains the list of references cited.
A separate appendage, submitted to TUMCO separate from the main body of this
report, contains copies of the site forms for the cultural resources recorded during the survey, and
Figure A-1, which shows the site locations. This appendage is not for public disclosure.
The main draft text of this report and the separate appendage will be made available
only to TUMCO for cultural resources management planning, and to appropriate governmental
agencies, as determined by TUMCO.

III: NATURAL SETTING

CLIMATE
The study area is currently characterized by a humid subtropical climate with mild
winters and hot summers. During the spring, summer and fall seasons, air masses off of the Gulf
of Mexico dominate, while during the winter, the climate is significantly affected by cold arctic air
masses. Mean maximum temperatures vary from a high of 95.1Â°F in August to a low of 55.2Â°F in
January (U.S. Department of Commerce 1967). Precipitation averages about 114 centimeters (cm)
per year, less than 5 cm of which is normally composed of snow or sleet. Annual maximum
precipitation occurs in April and May, with October being the driest month. Although monthly
mean precipitation data reflect a fairly even distribution of rainfall throughout the year, both
monthly and seasonal totals may be quite variable. The moderate temperature regime and high
rainfall of the area are conducive to lush vegetational growth, and relatively infrequent periods of
freezing (63 days per year on the average) consistently permit the viable production of fruits and
grains.
With respect to prehistoric cultures, the climate of the region must be considered
conducive to both agricultural development and the maintenance of floral and faunal associations
suitable for stable exploitation as sources of food and raw materials. Drastic climatic changes have
probably not occurred in the area during the last 5,000 years, although the world climate has
generally become cooler and wetter (MIT 1971). In the last 3,000 years, short periods of
worldwide cooling have occurred from 950-400 B.C., AD. 1300-1650, and around AD. 1740, 1820
and 1850 (MIT 1971). A general warming trend occurred during the period AD. 800-1200 and
from 1850 to the present; these worldwide trends, however, have probably resulted in greater
significant impact to the flora and fauna of higher latitude and marginal climatic environments than
to the study area.
GEOLOGY
The study area lies on the drainage divide between Big Cypress Creek to the south
and White Oak Creek to the north. Located northwest of the East Texas Embayment and the
Sabine uplift, and south of the Mexia-Talco fault zone, the study area lies within a region relatively
undisturbed by the tectonic events associated with these features.
Two major lithostratigraphic units have been identified in the study area by the
Bureau of Economic Geology (Barnes 1979; Henry and Basciano 1979), the Tertiary Wilcox Group
and Quaternary Alluvium. These two substrate units are fundamentally different in both
distribution and composition. The Wilcox Group is composed of sand and mud deposited by
ancient river systems during the Eocene. Between the Colorado and Trinity rivers, the Wilcox
Group has been divided into three formations (oldest to youngest, Hooper, Simsboro, and Calvert
Bluff), although in east Texas, the Wilcox remains undivided (Barnes 1970, 1974, 1979; Henry and
Basciano 1979:2). Henry and Basciano (1979:4) note that the Wilcox northeast of the Trinity River
is similar to the Calvert Bluff Formation which has been studied in detail by Kaiser et al. (1978).

10723/880206

17

As in the Calvert Bluff, two principal sedimentary facies are present within the Wilcox,
termed by Dutton (1982:41) as interdistributary muds and distributary sands (also referred to as
sandy muds and sand hills by Henry and Basciano (1979)). These two facies are lithologically
distinct, an attribute which appears to have profoundly influenced the landscape in the study area
and throughout much of the east Texas outcrop of the Wilcox. Of the two facies, the
interdistributary muds cover the greatest portion of the study area. This facies contains finely
laminated, interbedded silt and clay, carbonaceous plastic clay, muddy very fine sands, and lignite
(EH&A 1980:3-10; Lentz 1975). Also present are numerous detrital inclusions of silicified wood,
iron-manganese concretions, ironstone and ferruginous sandstone. The distributary sands are fine
to coarse sand with few detrital inclusions.

Quaternary alluvium is present within the study area as a thin surficial deposit of
sediment which unconformably overlies the Wilcox. Primarily concentrated along stream valleys,
these deposits are usually fine grained (loam to clay) and often stratified. Near the floodplain
margin, these sediments interfinger with colluvial sands derived from upland slopes and are usually
massive rather than stratified. Massive colluvial and aeolian deposits of sand weathered from the
Eocene units are common within the solum of most upland soils in the study area, but it is
impractical and quite difficult to differentiate these deposits. Identification of aeolian and colluvial
components of this sediment is inhibited by the absence of primary sedimentary structures and
their textural similarities. It is upon, within or below this extensive veneer of Quaternary alluvium
which blankets the study area that most archaeological sites are located. Figure 3 illustrates the
distribution of the three substrate units within the study area.
GEOMORPHOLOGY
The study area has been identified as part of West Gulf Coastal Plain Physiographic
Province by Fenneman (1938:100), and as the Sandy Hills by Raisz (1939). Gently rolling hills are
dissected and bounded by the relatively flat but small floodplains of upland streams which feed into
perennial, obsequent, east-flowing drainages such as White Oak and Big Cypress creeks. Elevations
in the study area range between about 113 and 156 meters (m) above mean sea level (msl). Slopes
are commonly less than five percent and local relief varies by up to 43 m. Stream networks
typically exhibit a dendritic pattern and stream gradients are usually low.
The physiographic features of this area are primarily the result of fluvial erosion of
weakly indurated sediments (Baumgardner 1987:4), although where prominent indurated units are
present, inland-facing cuestas may be formed. Much of the present relief is thought to be the
result of differential erosion of the dominant Wilcox facies, distributary sands and interdistributary
muds, although this assertion is difficult to validate. Numerous publications by the Bureau of
Economic Geology note that the multistory and multilateral distributary sands which have been
defined in the subsurface are most often expressed at the surface as topographic high spots, in part
due to their sandy texture which favors infiltration over runoff (Henry 1976:12; Kaiser et al. 1980;
Kaiser et al. 1978). This textural characteristic of the distributary sand facies is also reflected in
a drainage density lower than commonly formed upon distributary muds. The latter are generally
of finer texture, less conducive to infiltration and more conducive to runoff and erosion by
overland flow (Henry and Basciano 1979:4).

Figure 3-A depicts a generalized view of the landforms in the study area. The uplands
are subdivided into slope components according to their position on the landscape and include
(from highest to lowest) summit, backslope and toeslope. Undifferentiated floodplain deposits are
also shown. The delineation of these slope components is based on models developed by Ruhe
and Walker (1968), and have proven useful in geomorphological investigations elsewhere in east
Texas (Fields et al. 1988).
When the landscape is in a natural state, surficial geomorphic processes in this region
are greatly inhibited by the presence of vegetation. However, upon deforestation and exposure of
the bare soil or Eocene sediment, interdistributary muds are much more susceptible to erosion by
overland flow and gullying than are distributary sands. Bank exposures of recent sediment
observed along Piney Creek in the northern portion of the study area indicate that substantial
erosion of both A and B horizons has occurred in the study area during the historic period. It is
likely that this upland erosion and subsequent deposition of sediment upon the floodplain was due
to deforestation of portions of the Piney Creek basin, especially the area just south of County
Road NW-24 (Figure 1). In this area, the A horizon is thinner than in other places within the
study area, and considerably thinner than in forested areas immediately to the north. It is likely
that any archaeological sites discovered in this area have been disturbed by either human activities
associated with deforestation or accelerated colluvial processes resulting from the removal of the
protective vegetative cover.
Various agents of bioturbation (both faunal and floral) have been mentioned in the
regional literature, most of which appear to be proisotropic, that is to say that they "disrupt, blend,
destroy, or prevent the formation of horizons, subhorizons or genetic layers, such that simplified
profiles evolve from more ordered ones" (Johnson et al. 1986:278). Many of these processes are
also capable of enhancing colluvial and aeolian processes by delivering sediment to the surface
above low vegetation where surficial geomorphic processes may act upon it.
One of the most important forms of faunalturbation (important in terms of volumetric
displacement of sediment over time) which has been observed in this region are the burrowing
activities of the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius). Bocek (1986) reports that rodent
burrowing primarily disturbs vertical distribution of material rather than horizontal, although both
may occur. Under optimal circumstances, variations in soil color and texture facilitate
identification of such features in the subsurface. However, where the parent material is
homogeneous, as in many parts of the Eocene outcrop belt, diagnostic fabrics and structures are
not necessarily visible. Recent studies by Johnson et al. (1986), Johnson (n.d.), and Erlandson
(1984) suggest that fossorial rodents may also cause considerable proisotropic disturbance of mixed
aggregates such as those which are commonly found at most archaeological sites, suggesting that
this form of disturbance is complex and dependent primarily upon the nature of the sediments and
the burrowing habits of the animal.
Studies which have examined the earth-moving abilities of fossorial rodents native to
North America indicate that they are capable of considerable disturbance in a relatively short
period of time (Table 2). However, it should be noted that these figures underestimate the total
volume of sediment moved by gophers because they do not include soil movement by pocket
gophers below the surface. Repacking of burrows with sediment by gophers in the subsurface may
involve considerably greater volumes of material than mentioned in Table 2, but no information

is available on this aspect of fossorial rodent habits. Thurmond (1981:12) suspects that this animal
is responsible for much of the subsurface disturbance of artifacts throughout east Texas. Other
forms of proisotropic pedoturbation such as tree falls may also contribute to the long-term mixing
of the solum. This process, however, is less frequent and probably less important from both a
geomorphic and a site-disturbance-processes standpoint.
SOILS
Soils within the study area are easily classified into two categories: upland and
floodplain. Upland soils are of one order (alfisols) and all exhibit well-defined argillic horizons
suggesting considerable landscape stability in the recent past (i.e., 10,000 years). The strong argillic
B horizon developed in these soils may result in a perched water table after prolonged periods of
precipitation. Some of this water is then very slowly discharged into -local drainages by
throughflow. Eleven phases of ten soil series have been mapped in the uplands of this area by the
Soil Conservation Service (SCS), most of which show little or no correlation with the substrate
variations mapped by the Bureau of Economic Geology (Henry and Basciano 1979). The one
notable exception is the Pickton series, which usually occurs upon distributary sands. Although few
positive correlations exist between these upland substrates and soils, a fairly strong negative
correlation may be observed between two of the upland soils and the channel sands of the Wilcox.
Both Woodtell and Freestone series soils rarely occur upon channel sands. A map depicting the
distribution of soils within the study area may be found on Figure 4.
The Pickton series is well drained, moderately permeable, and identified by the SCS
as a Grossarenic Paleudalf. The Woodtell series consists of moderately well-drained, but very
slowly permeable, soils on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands. Three of the phases
mapped by the SCS include or identify the Woodtell; two of these are simply phases of the
Woodtell separated on the basis of slope, whereas the other is a low slope complex consisting of
Woodtell and Raina series soils. The steep phase of the Woodtell (WoE) commonly occurs on
the moderately steep slopes immediately above the floodplains of upland tributaries and adjacent
to Nahatche series soils. The Woodtell is classified by the SCS as a Vertie Hapludalf. The
Bernaldo series, classified as a Glossic Paleudalf, consists of well-drained, moderately permeable
soils on gently sloping erosional uplands. The Freestone series contains moderately well-drained,
slowly permeable soils on broad, gently sloping upland surfaces, often adjacent Woodtell series
soils. The Freestone is classified as a Glossaquic Paleudalf. The Wolfpen series, classified as an
Arenic Paleudalf, is commonly found on gently to moderately sloping upland ridges. It is
moderately permeable and well drained and runoff is generally slow. Sacul and Briley series soils
constitute a minor portion of the upland soils and are of moderately slow permeability and
moderately well to well drained. Both occur as isolated patches upon broad upland surfaces and
are usually associated with Freestone and Wolfpen series soils.
Floodplain soils all belong to the Nahatche series. This series is classified as a Aerie
Fluvaquent, and is moderately permeable but poorly drained. There is a strong correlation between
the mapped distribution of the Nahatche series soils and the Quaternary Alluvium identified by
Henry and Basciano (1979), as can be seen by comparing figures 3 and 4.

HYDROLOGY
Throughout east and east-central Texas, geologic units which may act as aquifers are
thought to recharge along zones of higher permeability, which often correspond with upland
divides. Major aquifers in this region, such as the Wilcox and Carrizo, are distinct geologic units,
but are hydraulically interconnected horizontally and/or vertically; the Queen City, which outcrops
to the southeast of the study area, is both geologically and hydraulically distinct from the Wilcox
and the Carrizo (Henry and Basciano 1979:4). Both surface and subsurface aquifer recharges have
been proposed for the Carrizo by Jones (1986:54). In the surface, recharge occurs along drainage
divides where the aquifer outcrops; the water is then directed towards major drainages. In the
subsurface, recharge may occur by leakage through overlying strata beneath topographic divides
even when the aquifer is not outcropping. In east-central Texas, Fogg and Kaiser (1986:58) found
Wilcox channel-fill sand bodies to be 10-100 times more permeable than surrounding strata, leading
them to conclude ihat the channel sands were the dominant aquifer in this region. Recharge and
rate of flow in these systems are principally controlled by the saturation of the aquifer. Recharge
cannot exceed discharge once the aquifer is saturated, which necessitates runoff, probably in the
form of throughflow, during periods of high precipitation.
Of the 43 definite springs Thurmond (1981) identified in the Big Cypress drainage
basin from toponyms and hydrology records, 34.8 percent occurred within the Wilcox outcrop and
68 percent of those were not within the Sabine Uplift outcrop of that unit. Thurmond (1981:33)
also noted that many (46.5 percent) of the springs in the Big Cypress basin were near upland
divides at the heads of finger tributaries. Springs discharging within Wilcox outcrop areas were
equally divided between Thurmond's finger tributary and minor watercourse classifications, with
only one occurrence of a spring linked to a major watercourse. This suggests that the source of
the water may be positively linked to an upland ground-water source such as the Wilcox channel
sands or to delayed runoff associated with throughflow. The small basin size associated with these
springs favors the ground-water discharge hypothesis, although this remains to be substantiated.
FLORA
The study area lies wholly within the pine-oak forest region of Texas as defined by
Tharp (1939:37-390), and within the oak-hickory-pine forest vegetation type as defined by Kuchler
(1964). Gould (1975:10-11) places the study area within the Post Oak Savannah vegetation region,
approximately equidistant between the Pineywoods vegetation region to the east-southeast in
adjacent Morris and Camp counties and the Blackland Prairies vegetation region in Franklin
County adjacent Titus County to the west. Because of the converging vegetation zones in Titus
County, as defined by Gould (1975), the county might be best identified as an area of ecological
transition between the Pineywoods to the east and the Blackland Prairies to the west. MorrisonKnudson Company, Inc. (M-K) places this area within the Oak Woods and Prairies vegetation
region of Texas (1988).
The climax vegetation of the Oak Woods and Prairies region is an open oak woodland
association often interdigitating with a tallgrass prairie community (M-K 1988). Within the study
area, however, there is little true climax vegetation to be found since much of the area has been
overgrazed or cleared for cropland or pastureland. Improved pastures are seeded mostly to
bermudagrass and various other grasses and clovers.

A detailed vegetational survey of Lake Monticello in Titus County southwest of the
study area was conducted by McCormick (1973:19-65), who described 14 vegetational communities
and dominant overstory and understory species associated with each. These communities include
ridgetops, huckleberry mounds, slopes, terraces, drains and bogs, upland openings, open
sandylands, floodplains, natural levees, sloughs, stream banks, bottomland openings, aquatics, and
palmetto flats. The diverse mosaic of vegetational communities and large number of plant species
found there reflect an extremely high-quality habitat for exploitation by aboriginal man. McCormick
(1973:19-65) listed 146 plant taxa collected in the region which have been reported in the
ethnographic literature as having been exploited by aboriginal populations, and the relatively stable
climatic regime suggests that a considerable variety of plant species were probably available for
utilization throughout all or most of the year. A partial list of edible plant species of potential
aboriginal use in the study area has been included on Table 3.
The study area has been divided into four distinct floral community types: Upland
Forest, Pine Forest, Bottomland Forest, and Grassland (M-K 1988). A brief discussion of each of
these types is presented in the following sections. The data is extracted from a report entitled
Vegetation Survey of the Monticello B-2 Study Area (M-K 1988).
Upland Forest Community
Vegetation sampling conducted by M-K in the study area revealed the dominant tree
species of this community to be post oak (Quercus stellata) and southern red oak (Q. falcata), with
black hickory (Carya texana) and sweetgum (LiÂ£fuiÂ£lambar styraciflua) also commonly represented.
Other overstory components of lesser importance included blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda).
Saplings of post oak and black hickory were abundant in the understory, as were those
of winged elm (Ulmus alata) and eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). Important understory
shrubs included American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum),
flowering dogwood (Camus florida), and hawthorn (Cretaegus spathulata). Woody vines, such as
muscadine (Vztis rotundifolia) and greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox) were also common.
The herbaceous layer of the Upland Forest community was dominated by grasses and
graminoids, such as bromegrass (Bromus sp. ), spikegrass (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum ),
dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spaerocarpon), and caric sedge (Care:r sp.).
Pine Forest Community
Survey data compiled by M-K within this community type documented loblolly pine
to be the dominant arborescent species, with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata ), winged elm, southern
red oak, sweetgum and blackjack oak of secondary importance. Saplings of blackjack oak were
abundant, and young hackberry (Celtis laevigata ), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana ), post oak, red
maple (Acer rubrum ), sweetgum and winged elm trees were common.

Bottomland Forest Community
Generally limited to the floodplains of drainages, the hardwood bottomlands are made
up of large native hardwoods with a subcanopy comprised of saplings of these species and other
more recently introduced species. These hardwood bottomlands are characterized by a dense
overstory canopy and a well-developed understory and shrub layer.
Within the community type sweetgum was found to be the dominant overstory
member, with lesser numbers of American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry, water oak, green
ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and river birch (Betula nigra). Loblolly pine was also recorded as a
dominant arborescent member of this community type.
Common understory components included saplings of hackberry, sweetgum, red maple,
winged elm, black hickory, and eastern red cedar. American beautyberry was the dominant shrub
species in the understory, while greenbrier and rattan vine (Berchemia scandens) were the most
abundant woody vines. Spikegrass and giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea) accounted for most of the
herbaceous layer.
Grassland Community
As is true of the entire Oak Woods and Prairies region in general, most grasslands
in the study area have been seeded to a variety of native or introduced forage grasses. The most
commonly planted species is bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon ), although dallisgrass (Paspalum
dilatatum ), brownseed paspalum (P. plicatulum ), and bahiagrass (P. notatum) are also common.
During the spring sampling period conducted by M-K, bromegrasses (Bromus spp.) were abundant
in several sites, while legumes such as bur clover (Medicago lupulina) and white clover (Trifolium
repens) were common. In addition to the introduced grasses and legumes, all of the improved
pastures contain a diversity of forbs.
EXISTING FAUNA
The study area lies on a transition between the Austroriparian Biotic Province to the
east and the Texan Biotic Province to the west (Dice 1943:19, 23-24; Blair 1950:98). The mosaic
of forests and grasslands in the study area results in a mixture of vertebrate species typical of the
two general habitats. This is a situation typical of a transitional area, especially since the advent
of agriculture in the area. The major habitat divisions are either wooded or non-wooded areas.
However, much of the area is of an ecotonal or transitional nature between these two habitat
divisions. This results in an intermixing of forest-adapted species and prairie or grassland species.
This is especially true of birds and the larger, more mobile mammals. Forested areas contain some
species that are existing on the western limits of their range, while open, non-forested areas
contain some species not found farther to the east.
The distribution of habitats in the study area and the activity patterns of many wildlife
species result in some overlapping of fauna} communities. Forest-dwelling species may occasionally
occur in open areas around forest stands, and species particular to non-forested habitats may
occasionally be found in forested areas. Edges or ecotones between major habitats are preferred
by many wildlife species. This is true to some extent for recreationally important species, such as

10723/880206

31

the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and
northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), as well as many songbirds. These transition areas are
preferred not only for the diversity of food materials available, but also for the usually dense cover
provided through the characteristic overlap of vegetative communities.
Characteristic mammal species which may occur in the study area are the opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), fox squirrel (Sciwus niger), plains pocket gopher
(Geomys bursarius ), northern pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail, white-tailed deer, and ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus).
Common amphibians are the southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala ), bullfrog
(Rana catesbeiana), bronze frog (Rana clamitans), cricket frog (Acris crepitans), and Woodhouse's
toad (Bufo woodhousei). Common reptiles include the ground skink (Scincella lateralis), five-lined
skink (Eumeces fasciatus ), red-eared slider (Chrysemys scripta ), common snapping turtle (Chelydra
serpentina ), broad-banded water snake (Nerodia fasciata ), eastern coachwhip (Masticophis flagellus ),
Texas rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), and southern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix).
Bird species which may breed in the study area include the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis),
turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura ), red-bellied woodpecker
(Melanerpes erythrocephalus ), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Muscivora forficata ), common crow (Cmvus
brachyrhynchos), tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor), mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), brown-headed
cowbird (Molothrus ater), cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), painted bun ting (Passerina ciris), dickcissel
(Spiza americana), and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus).

IV: CULTURAL SETIING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS - NORTHEAST TEXAS AND TITUS COUNTY
Early archaeological work in North America was basically centered around the early
religious myths concerning mound sites in the eastern United States, and a desire to obtain objects
frequently associated with these mound sites. The Mississippi and Ohio river valleys were the scene
of much of this early activity (Attwater 1820; Squier and Davis 1848). Northeast Texas remained
at the periphery of this activity until the first decades of the twentieth century. Spurred by
exploration of archaeological sites by steamboat along the Red River in Louisiana (Moore 1912),
J. E. Pearce, in 1919 and 1920, set out to record sites in Cherokee, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins,
and Hunt counties (Barnard 1939). Working for the University of Texas, Pearce laid the first
ground work for studies which were to follow.
From 1927 to 1936, Pearce arranged for additional archaeological work in Texas, much
of which centered in east Texas. In Titus County in the early 1930s, at least eight sites were tested
(Thurmond 1981:330-383), including the Hale Mound (41Tf12) and the Keith Mound (41TT11)
(Jackson 1934a; Goldschmidt 1934). In Camp County, work in the early 1930s saw testing
conducted on sites 41CP2 (Jackson 1931a; Thurmond 1981:254-258) and 41CP4 (Jackson n.d.;
Thurmond 1981:260-261). Also during the 1930s in Franklin County, sites 41FK5 (Reese 1931;
Thurmond 1981:294-295), 41FK4 (Jackson 1934b; Thurmond 1981:289-294), 41FK3 (Jackson
1930a; Goldschmidt 1935; Thurmond 1981:287-289), 41FK7 (Jackson 1934c; Thurmond 1981:295298), and 41FK2 (Jackson 1931b; Thurmond 1981:282-286) were tested. In Upshur County,
Site 41UR1 was also tested in the same time period (Jackson 1931c; Thurmond 1981:383), as were
sites in Morris County, 41MX1 (Jackson 1930b), 41MX2 (Jackson 1930c), and 41MX6 (Jackson
1930d).
The sites referenced above were generally well known to the local public because they
were the locations of good artifact (pot) hunting. For example, Site 41FK4 revealed 11 graves
containing about 90 ceramic vessels (Jackson 1934b). The site was later shown to reflect a Titus
phase (Caddo) cemetery occupation (Turner 1978:93; Thurmond 1981:289-294). In Camp County,
Site 41CP2 contained a similar Titus phase cemetery occupation (Jackson 1931a; Turner 1978:93;
Thurmond 1981:254-258), and possibly an earlier Whelan phase (Caddo) occupation (Thurmond
1981:258). In Morris County Site 41MX1 is thought by Thurmond (1981:324) to reflect an Early
Archaic occupation, as well as Late Archaic and Titus phase components. A Middle Archaic
occupation is suggested for 41MX2, along with a Titus phase component (Thurmond 1981:326).
An Early Caddoan occupation is also suggested for 41MX6 (Thurmond 1981:328).
During the 1930s, a change in emphasis began to occur with attention increasingly
directed toward the understanding of chronological sequences between and within sites. In 1935,
Goldschmidt prepared a synthesis of archaeological sites in Titus County and their relationship to
sites in east Texas. Basically a trait list comparison, an early cultural chronology was established
for the area. This early work is important in that it was one of the first attempts at defining a
chronological framework for the area. This work would later serve as a basis for the regional
syntheses of Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al. (1954).

During the 1950s, another alteration of emphasis in data recording occurred which is
still seen today. Man-land relationships, settlement patterns, and intra-site activity areas have
become the focus of many researchers. The timing of this emphasis is more than coincidental.
It is reasonable to assume that this orientation could not proceed without first having established
a cultural chronology on which to rely. Chronologies are, of course, not ignored; considerable
refinement is always necessary within the broad chronological framework. Such chronological
problems are now more limited to phase definition (as defined by Thurmond 1981:421) than the
broad period problems tackled by Suhm and others earlier this century.
This period is also characterized by tremendous growth in archaeological surveys. This
was made possible by numerous recent federal laws governing cultural resource management.
Coupled with the establishment of the Inter-Agency Archaeological Salvage Program in 1946, and
the initiation of the River Basin Surveys Program in the late 1940s, numerous surveys have been
completed in northeast Te;xas, specifically in the Cypress Creek drainage basin within which much
of the study area is located.
One of the earliest surveys conducted in the Cypress Basin was for Lake O' the Pines
located southeast of the study area. Originally referred to as Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir, the lake
was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s. Although a detailed inventory of
all sites in the reservoir was never undertaken, the limited survey recorded 34 sites (Miller et al.
1951), and subsequent testing provided a data base for the Caddoan Whelan Complex (Davis
1958). The following year, the University of Texas excavated mound site 41UR10 in Upshur
County, which also contained a Whelan occupation (Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Thurmond 1981:389394).
During the decade of the 1960s, various projects were carried out at Lake O' the Pines
by the University of Texas. A Titus phase site (41MR12) containing burials was excavated in the
early 1960s (Davis and Golden 1960). A Whelan component mound site was excavated
(Site 41UR11) (Davis and Gibson 1960), and an Archaic site (41UR12) was also excavated (Davis
and Davis 1960). More recently, a study was reported which attempted a statistical examination
of Caddo vessel design and shape using materials recovered from Site 41MR12 (Turpin et al.
1976).
Southern Methodist University (SMU) has been responsible for much of the
archaeology in the Cypress Creek basin area since Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir. Generally, project
goals for the SMU surveys seemed to be to obtain information on socioeconomic patterns of
prehistoric occupants. Discovery and analysis of settlement patterns was a prime method utilized
to achieve a set of hypotheses to interpret socioeconomic patterns.
In 1968, a cultural resources survey was conducted at Caddo Lake. Sites were
recorded from the Archaic to historic times (Gibson 1969). In 1970, work on Site 41CP14 was
documented in manuscript form (Stearns 1970), and Sullivan (1977) later tested the site which
contained Archaic and Caddo components.
A survey of Lake Cypress Springs (also known as Franklin or Big Cypress Reservoir)
in Franklin County provides an early example of SMU activity in the general area. Unhappy with
surveys which were allegedly limited in scope and "produce a plethora of museum catalogue

,ue

descriptions which clog the literature" (Hsu et al. 1969:4), the investigators recommended that a
survey should be conducted in such a manner as to pose "a series of relational models which can
be tested by further investigation".
Hsu et al. (1969) constructed a model of prehistoric site location based upon
environmental/landform zones within the Lake Cypress Springs survey area. Not surprisingly, the
occupations were determined to be based largely on a hunting and gathering economy. A single
band was hypothesized to utilize the reservoir area, operating from three or four base camps.
Hsu (1969) conducted the initial survey of Titus County Reservoir. A total of 16 sites
were recorded, including Titus County sites 41TT16, and 41TT21 through 41TT29. Using Lake
Cypress Springs as a model, a number of base camps and specific activity sites were identified.
Several distinct social units were hypothesized to occupy the reservoir area contemporaneously,
as opposed to a single band in Lake Cypress Springs.
Surveys in Titus County since the late 1960s were largely the result of development
by the Titus County Fresh Water Supply District No. 1 and a consortium of electric power
companies represented by Texas Utilities Services, Inc. Titus County Reservoir was originally
proposed by the water district to flood Big Cypress, Blundell and Brushy creeks to provide water
for the City of Mount Pleasant. In 1970, after agreement with the electric power consortium, the
reservoir was divided into two impoundments: Lake Monticello and Lake Bob Sandlin. The
former was built as a cooling lake by the power consortium; the latter was built for the original
intended purpose by the water district.
McCormick (1973) reported on investigations carried out at Blundell Creek prior to
the construction of Lake Monticello. Seventy-one archaeological sites were recorded, including
54 in Titus County (41 TT112-41 TT166, 41 TT168-41 TT183). The survey was followed by limited
testing on six sites: 41TT16, 41TT28, 41TT128, 41TT129, 41TT132, and 41TT151 (McCormick
1974). The Hale Mound (41TT12), an Early Caddoan site recommended for limited excavation
by Hsu (1969), was subsequently leased to SMU for 99 years. Eventually, about 3 ha were donated
to SMU by TUMCO.
McCormick (1973:10-15) hypothesizes a seasonal settlement model of summer-winter
dispersal along Blundell Creek. His model proposed that major villages were occupied during the
late fall and winter on flood-free elevations near a permanent water source such as Big Cypress
Creek. During the spring and summer, family groups of these villages would disperse into small
seasonal extraction camps or hamlets to exploit riverine resources. Fall sites are hypothesized to
be located in uplands, while sites attributed only to hunting are expected to be located throughout
all environmental zones and not necessarily restricted to seasonality. McCormick (1974:114) notes
that the 1973 model may not be substantiated.
Four sites (41 TT154-41 TT157) recorded by McCormick (1973) are located within the
study area along Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). All are prehistoric and sites 41TT154 and
41TT157 are thought by McCormick (1973:89) to represent seasonal camps. Site 41TT157 was
said to cover about 2 ha and contained lithic debitage, ceramics, and burned rock. Food
preparation/cooking was thought by McCormick to be conducted on sites 41 TT154 and 41 TT157,
and tool manufacturing was thought to be conducted on sites 41 TT154-41TT156 (1973:81-82).

10723/880206

35

Thurmond (1981:190-191) assessed the sites, noting that the sites had been exploited by collectors
(this was also noted by McCormick) and generally disturbed. Site forms from the SMU project
on file at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas recommend no
further work on all four sites due to extensive site exploitation over several years and the eroded
nature of the sites. No vertical depth for artifacts was noted on 41TT156, a site on which only a
single lithic flake was found. Site 41 TT154 was noted to be 20 cm or less in depth, while no depth
was estimated for sites 41 TT155 or 41 TT157.
Cliff et al. (1974) conducted a survey along Swanano Creek in Titus County for a
cooling lake for the Welsh power plant. Thirty-four sites were located (41TT223-41TT256).
Permanent occupation of dispersed hamlets was hypothesized to be located in the uplands near
areas suitable for agriculture (Cliff et al. 1974:59).
Sullivan (1977:134-135) hypothesizes a Caddoan settlement model for Lake Bob
Sandlin in which hamlets were located on minor active stream tributaries of Big Cypress Creek,
and that occupation within the major stream drainage was limited. A total of 40 sites was recorded
for Titus County, 42 for Camp County, and 21 for Franklin County. Five other types of sites are
proposed by Sullivan: 1) seasonal camps about one hectare or less in size representing a seasonal
occupation; 2) specific activity sites about 0.25 ha or less in size; 3) quarry sites of undetermined
size; 4) fishing stations; and 5) hunting stations, the latter two of which are also of undetermined
size (Sullivan 1977:20-26).
Non-SMU field work in Titus County has revolved around assessing site conditions
or testing sites. Site 41TT13 has been tested by the Texas Department of Highways and Public
Transportation, as has Site 41 TT108 (Young 1981). An assessment of three pottery kiln sites was
conducted in 1975 by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (41TT104, 41TT105, 41TT222)
(Thurmond 1981:68-69). In 1978, Site 41 TTllO was tested by the University of Texas Field School,
and additional survey in the Lake Bob Sandlin area was conducted (Thurmond 1981:69-70).
Eleven new sites were recorded. None of the above referenced sites are within the study area.
Other work conducted in the early 1970s in the Hart Creek drainage east of Mount
Pleasant recorded twenty-five sites (Thurmond 1981:72), including Site 41 TT36, an Early Caddoan
burial site (Brown 1975). Only one of these sites (41TT94) is located within the study area
(Figure A-1). On the site form at TARL, ceramics, lithic debitage, bifaces, and dart point
fragments are listed as being found on the site, prompting Milton Bell, recorder of the site in 1974,
to identify 41 TT94 as the location of a large camp or village. Unfortunately, neither horizontal
area nor vertical stratigraphy was delineated on the site form by Bell.
On the northern edge of the study area in the upper East Piney Creek drainage, Bell,
in 1974, recorded sites 41TT77 and 41TT78 (site forms on file at TARL) (Figure A-1).
Site 41 TT77 is actually located outside the northern perimeter of the study area and was said to
cover about two hectares of land. Shovel testing south of the highway in the study area by EH&A
personnel found no evidence for the site, and the site is not considered to be within the study area.
Bell identified the location as a multicomponent (Archaic-Caddo) village. Site 41 TT78 was
documented as a small lithic scatter on both sides of a county road. The site was said to have been
virtually destroyed by the construction of the county highway. Because of its location on both sides
of the county highway, 41 TT78 is considered to be within the study area.

Milton Bell is also responsible for recording sites along White Oak Creek and its
tributaries, some of which are located north (not within) of the study area (41TT31, 41TT5741TT61, 41TT63, 41TT64, 41TT66, 41TT67, 41TT72-41TT76, 41TT81, 41TT83, 41TT86, and
41TT91). According to site form data, most sites represent Archaic or Caddoan occupations, or
both. Sites 41TT57 and 41TT60 are also suggested by Bell to contain possible Paleo-Indian
components. The reason for the identification of this early component is not made clear for
41 TT57; however, on Site 41 TT60, Bell documents the recovery of a Folsom point base (site form
on file at TARL).
Mrs. Horace Thompson, wife of a land owner within the study area, recorded
Site 41TT56 in 1973 (site form on file at TARL) (Figure A-1). Prehistoric ceramics were reported
to have come from a 3-square meter area, with the vertical depth of artifacts being about 20 cm
or less below ground surface. She also reported an undefined point and a polished stone axe as
having been collect~d from her property.
In 1981, Environment Consultants, Inc. (ECI) conducted an overview study of the
then-proposed Black Cypress Reservoir in Cass and Marion counties, and also the then-proposed
Marshall Reservoir in Harrison and Upshur counties (Northern and Skiles 1981). The study, which
was conducted principally to determine the need for cultural resource surveys in the proposed
reservoirs, revealed both areas to be rich in cultural history, spanning from the Paleo-Indian
occupation to the present. Prehistoric site density projections were made for both reservoirs and
recommendations for survey of each reservoir were made. For the Marshall Reservoir, one site
per 73 acres was projected (Northern and Skiles 1981:46).
In 1985, cultural resource investigations were carried out in Wood and Upshur
counties by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. for the proposed reservoir on Big Sandy Creek (Perttula et
al. 1986). A total of 105 sites was recorded, including 63 prehistoric, 56 historic, and 12
multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites. Caddoan sites were noted to be common throughout
the valley and it was suggested that, due to the frequency of Caddoan sites, Caddoan settlement
models may best be addressed at the regional level (Perttula et al. 1986:233).
EH&A has conducted surveys and testing in Titus, Franklin, and Camp counties for
proposed and ongoing mining operations. Reports were prepared describing the testing of
41 TT309 (Bond 1982a), and the assessment of the Hale Mound site boundaries (Bond 1982b).
Both sites are located within or adjacent the Winfield-South portion of the Monticello-Winfield
mine complex southwest of the study area (Figure 2). Site 41 TT309 was reported to have
components relating to the Late Archaic Period and the Early Caddoan Stage, Period l. The site
was thought to fit in with McCormick's (1973) model of settlement because it was hypothesized
that both occupations represented an ephemeral seasonal occupation of a single family (Bond
1982a). Boundaries of the Hale Mound site (41 TT12) were recommended for expansion beyond
that shown on the sketch map provided with the nomination form to the NRHP in 1977, which was
rejected for lack of boundary definition. In September 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) resubmitted the site to the National Park Service for determination of eligibility to the
NRHP. The site, including an area larger than the revised EH&A boundaries, was determined
eligible for the NRHP in October 1984. In 1988, part of the Hale Mound site not previously
donated to SMU was donated by Texas Utilities Electric Company (TUE) to the non-profit private
organization The Archaeological Conservancy, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. SMU and the

10723/880206

Conservancy are to jointly establish a management committee, which will develop a 100-year
management plan for the site. The Conservancy will provide a position for a representative of
TUE on the management committee. The Cooperative Preservation Agreement between the
Conservancy and TUE was approved on August 9, 19SS with the 16-acre site formally deeded on
December 19, 1988.
In 1983, investigations were conducted by EH&A on 3S previously recorded sites
within TUMCO's operational Winfield-North and Winfield-South mines southwest of the study
area, and within TUMCO's proposed Tract H mine southwest of the Winfield-South mine
(Figure 2) (Bond et al. 1984). Most sites were determined to contain Middle Archaic to Late
Archaic occupations. Site 41 TT135, located in the Winfield-South permit area, was found to
contain an Early Caddoan occupation associated with a human burial. Preservation of the site was
recommended, and the site has been determined eligible to the NRHP. The site will not be
impacted by TUMCO.
In 1985, EH&A conducted additional surveys within the operational Winfield-North
and Winfield-South mines in Titus County, recording 62 archaeological sites (Glander et al. 19S6a).
Sites dating from the Early Archaic to the Late Caddo were recorded. Most of the surveyed mine
complex lies adjacent the western boundary of the B-2 study area, except for about 120 ha, which
are now included within the present study area (Figure 2). As a result, three of the 62 recorded
sites (41 TT347-41 TT349) and an Isolated Find (IFS) are located within the B-2 study area
(Figure A-1). All three sites were composed of undiagnostic lithic debitage, and the vertical depth
of artifacts was 10 cm or less on all three sites. Modern refuse also occurred on Site 41 TT349.
In the opinion of the THC, stated in a letter dated February 12, 19S6 to TUM CO from the THC
(THC 19S6), all three sites were thought not to be eligible for the NRHP. IFS was a single chert
flake and was not recorded as an official site.
Survey and testing of selected sites in Tract H of the Monticello-Winfield mine
complex in Titus and Franklin counties was also conducted by EH&A for TUMCO (Brown et al.
1986). Including a reassessment of six previously recorded sites (see Bond et al. 19S4), 14 sites
were recorded, and three sites were archaeologically tested. One of the tested sites (41FK66) was
thought, in the opinion of EH&A archaeologists, to be eligible to the NRHP. The Tract H survey,
which was conducted as a part of a continuing series of settlement modeling efforts in northeast
Texas by EH&A (Glander et al. 19S6a; Glander et al. 19S6b ), recorded a series of
statistically significant relationships which followed patterns of prehistoric use predicted for the
area (Brown et al. 1986:260-303).
Most recently, a cultural resources survey of lands within the Monticello-Leesburg
study area in Camp County (Figure 2) was conducted by personnel from EH&A (Glander et al.
1987). A total of 146 archaeological sites was recorded, 113 of which contained prehistoric
artifacts. Prehistoric occupation was determined to range from the Middle Archaic to the Late
Caddoan, and historic components dated from the 1S70s. The predictive model for prehistoric site
locations developed by EH&A personnel for the Monticello-Winfield H Tract was validated by the
Leesburg study.

PREHISTORIC PERSPECTIVE
Because much of the study area is located in the same drainage basin (Cypress Creek)
as the Monticello-Winfield mine complex located across Tankersley Creek, some of the following
section is reproduced from a former report documenting the results of EH&A's survey of the
Winfield-North and Winfield-South mines (Glander et al. 1986a:14-30). Modifications in the text
have been made where pertinent to the present study area.
The prehistoric cultural sequence for the general area is outlined in Figure 5.
Generally, the sequence reveals a pattern of cultural development from small migratory hunting
and gathering bands to complex agricultural tribal societies.
A number of schemes are utilized by archaeologists to divide the continuum of cultural
change. Many people utilize the modified midwestern Taxonomic System classification defined by
Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al. (1954), which classified the culture sequence into stages, aspects,
and foci, in decreasing order of scale. Thurmond's study of the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin
deviates slightly from the standard presentation (Thurmond 1981). Thurmond alters the traditional
approach because, in his view, Early Caddoan and Late Caddoan geographic specializations are
both classified by the term "focus". Thurmond states that:
It is highly likely that two entirely different sociocultural phenomena are so grouped,
and it is perhaps only in Late Caddoan times that one may plausibly speak of "local
cultures". The regional variations which Krieger was able to identify among the Early
Caddoan components, such as the Alto and Sanders Foci, in many cases cover much
larger geographic areas than their Late Caddoan counterparts, and probably are the
result of entirely different socio-political mechanisms (Thurmond 1981:421).

The authors tend to agree with Thurmond's assessment. Based upon Thurmond's
work in the Cypress Creek Basin, Figure 5 presents a slight revision of the standard chronological
presentation. This presentation is in line with the standard chronological scheme utilized
throughout most of the southeastern United States. Stages, shown to the left in the chronological
chart (Figure 5), are named blocks of time which obviate the necessity of using actual dates when
the latter are insufficiently well known. Periods represent modes of cultural adaptation or lifeways
which summarize a number of characteristics. Among these is the increasing organizational
complexity believed to have existed in later, versus earlier, stages. Cultures, as used here,
represent more specific patterns of cultural behavior and are represented in styles and types of
artifacts with bcoad areal distributions. For example, based upon work done by Story and Creel
(1982:53-60), Thurmond (1981:422) defines the Cypress Cluster which serves to spatially define
Late Caddoan social groups. In theory, periods and cultures are distinct; in practice, they often
coincide. Phases are constellations of artifact traits with a limited and defined distribution in space
and time, thus incorporating variables of both time and cultural relationships between groups of
people.

Paleo-Indian
Paleo-Indian sites are not well known in the eastern area of Texas in which the study
area is located. Although the presence of Plainview, Clovis andAngostura points suggest a PaleoIndian presence, virtually all of the finds are out of context, limited generally to surface finds or
to sites where Paleo-Indian materials are associated with Archaic materials (Jones 1957; Davis and
Davis 1960; Johnson 1962; Duffield 1963; Northern and Skiles 1981:28). Recently, however, two
sites in Upshur County and one site in Wood County have identified a Paleo-Indian component
in stratigraphic context (Perttula et al. 1986:49). Although virtually nothing is known of PaleoIndian settlement patterns, a settlement pattern confined basically to major drainage basins is
suggested by some (Thurmond 1981:11; Perttula et al. 1986:49). Figure 6 documents known or
suspected Paleo-Indian component sites within and in the vicinity of the study area.
Archaic
The Archaic stage is characterized by the development of increasingly varied tool kits,
which apparently reflect increased use of plants and smaller mammals. Terraces and floodplain
projections are also noted by Thurmond (1981:11) to be the locations of many Archaic sites.
Hunting and gathering provided a subsistence of deer and small mammals, along with seasonally
available vegetal foods. Seasonal rounds within a restricted territory are projected as typifying the
settlement pattern during this stage (Hsu 1969; Hsu et al.1969:32; McCormick 1973:11-15, 1974:6).
This pattern fits well with the pattern suggested for similar Archaic occupations in Arkansas.
Morse (1973) notes that these occupations are far more widespread than Paleo-Indian sites,
occurring in inter-riverine areas. Morse's settlement pattern is hypothesized to contain numerous
specialized extractive camps and a central base camp.
Early descriptions of the Archaic in Texas present the cultural manifestations as
belonging to the East Texas Aspect (Suhm et al. 1954). Webb (1960) rejected the use of the term
East Texas Aspect to avoid implied geographic limitations. Tracing Archaic manifestations to
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, Webb classified Archaic cultural manifestations as belonging
to the Red River Aspect.
A more comprehensive assessment of the cultural background of the Archaic of east
Texas was undertaken by Johnson (1962) when he proposed the name LaHarpe Aspect to replace
the two previously mentioned nomenclatures. Johnson described certain uniformities of prehistoric
culture change which he had ascertained for the entire east Texas area. Johnson (1962:268) stated:
(1) At the beginning or early part of the Archaic Stage there was a marked numerical
prevalence of expanding-stem dart points, [primarily Yarbrough and Ellis] over those
of other stemming traditions. (2) This was followed by a growth in the popularity of
contracting-stem dart points (represented principally by the Gary type), which slightly
preceded (3) the appearance of pottery vessels of various plain [Williams Plain] and
often crude wares.
More recently, Thurmond (1981:90-95) has refined the Archaic for the Cypress Creek
Basin, within which most of the study area falls. Thurmond accepts the standard straight- to
expanding-stem/contracting-stem dart points as reflective of cultural manifestations of Early to Late

Archaic stages. The expanding-stem Ensor dart points, however, are placed in the Late Archaic
on the basis of their vertical distribution at the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963) and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Sorrow et al. 1967).
Data provided by Thurmond (1981:213-218) suggests that there is an increase of the
frequency of Early Archaic sites from the Paleo-Indian stage, and that this increase in site
frequency or density continues at least until the Early Ceramic Stage. Along Big Sandy Creek in
Upshur County, Early Archaic sites appear to be distributed on terrace and upland projections
within major drainage basins (Perttula et al. 1986:50). Similar patterns have been found elsewhere
(Jones 1957; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). Figure 7 documents known or suspected Early Archaic
component sites in the vicinity of the study area.
Middle Archaic sites are better represented in the archaeological data than preceding
occupations, at least in terms of excavated components (Johnson 1962; Bruseth and Perttula 1980,
1981; EH&A 1984a). Settlement appears to be little changed from previous occupations (Perttula
et al. 1986:51) although site density appears to be increasing (Thurmond 1981:215). Figure 8
documents known or suspected Middle Archaic component sites in the vicinity of the study area.
For the Late Archaic, there is a continued increase in site density, especially along
tributaries to major drainages (Thurmond 1981:416; Perttula et al. 1986:52). Perttula et al.
(1986:52) suggest that the more widely dispersed settlements in the region are indicative of an
entrenched diffused economy based upon the hunting and gathering of local food resources.
Numerous sites with Late Archaic components have been excavated in the region (Jones 1957;
Duffield 1961; Johnson 1962; EH&A 1984a; Bruseth et al. 1977; Bruseth and Perttula 1980, 1981).
Figure 9 documents known or suspected Late Archaic component sites in the vicinity of the study
area.
Diagnostic dart points are identified by Thurmond for each of the Archaic periods in
the Cypress Creek Basin (1981:91). Bulverde, Calf Creek, Carrollton, Dawson, Morrill and Wells are
shown to be definitive indicators of the Early Archaic. The Middle Archaic is characterized by
Edgewood, Ellis, Evans, Lone Oak, Palmillas, Trinity, Yarbrough and Wesley. For the Late Archaic,
Ensor, Gary and Kent, in the absence of early ceramics, are defined as diagnostic chronological
indicators.
Early Ceramic
The Early Ceramic stage is tenuous, although the concept is not new (Bell 1953:314;
Jelks 1965:22-18; Webb et al. 1969:95; Fields and Thurmond 1980:31). The tentative stage is based
on the absence of early Caddoan ceramics from relatively few sites in the Cypress Creek Basin.
In Titus County, Thurmond (1981:434) identified Marksville ceramics from Site 41TT108, and
sandy paste wares from sites in Marion, Titus, and Upshur counties. Sandy paste ceramics are
common to the south of the Sabine River, and Williams Plain ceramics, similar to Brown's Early
Ceramic component in Oklahoma (Brown 1971:42-57), are common north of the Sabine River
(Thurmond 1981:95). Because the Sabine River is located a short distance to the south in the
southern part of adjacent Upshur County, both types of pottery may be expected in the study area.
Intensive excavation is needed to determine the validity of the Early Ceramic stage and its possible
relationship to the Tchfuncte and Marksville cultures to the east in the Lower Mississippi Valley.

The succeeding stage in northeast Texas is associated with the Caddo development.
Wyckoff (1971) visualizes Caddo culture as an extension of the Mississippian tradition of the Lower
Mississippi Valley. Caddo is recognized by the presence of mound centers and village sites along
the terraces of major streams. Horticultural, and eventually agricultural, activities supplemented
hunting and gathering activities. As defined by ritual burials and trade networks, a stratified society
was probably typical of Caddo culture.
Krieger's (1946) Gibson/Fulton aspect dichotomy was revised to the current five-stage
Caddo sequence by the Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968. Caddo I and II relate to Krieger's
Gibson aspect, and Caddo III, IV and V correspond to the Fulton aspect.
For reasons previously discussed, the division of Caddo development in the Cypress
Creek Basin, depicted in Figure 5, reverts back to the dichotomy proposed by Krieger (Thurmond
1981:96-97). The division of the chronological span into Early and Late stages is similar to that
proposed by Krieger in 1946 in his definition of the Fulton and Gibson aspects. Thurmond's
division of the Early Caddoan stage into periods 1 and 2 is similar to the chronological units
defined by Davis (1970) and Wyckoff (1971) as Caddo 1 and Caddo 2. Thurmond bases this
separation on the presumption that the ceramics of the Alto focus predate ceramics of the Sanders
focus (Thurmond 1981:96). While not distinguished as phases within the Early Caddoan stage,
Thurmond (1981:435) equates the Alto and Sanders foci to periods 1 and 2.
The Alto focus (Period 1) is suggested to be the earliest true Caddo cultural
configuration (Story 1972). The George C. Davis site on the Neches River is the type site for the
focus. Small Alto period sites are generally located on terraces adjacent to water sources. Major
Alto period mound centers are located in major river valleys such as the South Sulphur River. In
the Cypress Creek Basin, the Hale Mound site on Blundell Creek (41 TT12), the Galt site (41FK2)
and the Jaggers site (41FK3) contain substantial Period 1 components. Diagnostic lithic artifacts
include Alba, Bonham, Catahoula and Scallorn arrowpoints. Diagnostic ceramics include Davis
Incised, Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches
Fingernail Impressed and Coles Creek Incised (Thurmond 1981:435).
The Sanders focus (Period 2) was defined for the Sanders site in Lamar County, Texas
(Krieger 1946). Sites are typically on terraces and knolls near water resources. Subsistence was
primarily deer and small mammals supplemented by horticultural activity, which is evidenced from
scapula hoes. Undecorated clay grit-tempered ceramics, principally Sanders Plain, predominate.
Examples of decorated ware include Sanders Engraved, Canton Incised and Hickory Fine Engraved
from Site 41TT11 (Thurmond 1981:436). Other decorated ceramics typical of northeast Texas
during this period are Monkstown Fingernail Impressed, Maxey Noded Redware, East Incised, Haley
Complicated Incised, Haley Engraved, and Handy Engraved. The latter four ceramic types are
typically associated with the Haley focus, which is manifested as a series of sites along the Red
River in Arkansas. Diagnostic lithic points are similar to Period 1.

CERAMIC

COMPONEN T SITES

The Early Caddoan saw the introduction of the bow and arrow (Perttula et al.
1986:54). Maize has been recovered from flotation samples representing an Early Caddoan
occupation, and settlement patterns are thought to reflect a wide population dispersal broken into
sedentary hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula et al. 1986:54-55). Figure 11 documents known or
suspected Early Caddo component sites in the vicinity of the study area.
Thurmond (1981:92) observes that ca. A D. 1400, the elements of Caddo material
culture differentiate along a line drawn roughly north to south through Caddo Lake in Harrison
County, Texas. The observed differences west to east are hypothesized by Thurmond (1981:92)
to represent probable social groups.
In the western Cypress Creek Basin (west of the above mentioned north-south line),
Thurmond (1981:96-97) tentatively defines a transitional Early to Late Caddoan stage. The
transitional stage is defined on the basis of a number of sites which exhibit ceramic assemblages
combining Early Caddoan Period 2 and Late Caddoan, Whelan phase attributes (Thurmond
1981:437-439; 1985:189). This stage is not identified for the eastern Cypress Creek Basin (east of
Caddo Lake) (Thurmond 1981:92). Thurmond identified 13 sites in the western Cypress Creek
Basin which he indicates appear to relate to a transitional Early to Late Caddoan component;
none, however, are within the study area. Sites 41CP10, 41FK32, 41TT52, and 41TT110 are
discussed as best representing this hypothesized transition. Focusing principally on sites 41CP10
and 41FK32, Thurmond argues that, along with characteristic Period 2 ceramics, prototypical
elements of Late Caddoan Ripley Engraved and Wilder Engraved are evident. Taken as a group,
all 13 sites are argued to represent a continuous development of Late Caddoan cultural
manifestations from an Early Caddo Period 2 base (Thurmond 1981:96). Bond et al. (1984:43)
tentatively placed Site 41 TT135 with this component, as did Brown et al. (1986) for sites 41FK66
and 41FK70. Much more detailed information derived from testing is needed to confirm this
tentatively-proposed stage. Figure 12 documents known or suspected Transitional Caddo
component sites in the vicinity of the study area.
The Late Caddoan stage is noted by an increase in regional variants. One such variant
is the proposed Cypress Cluster in the western basin. The Cypress Cluster, as defined by
Thurmond (1981:442-449), is hypothesized to represent a possible third Caddoan Confederacy.
This unnamed confederacy is in addition to the Hasinai and Kadohadacho confederacies (Swanton
1942) and is hypothesized to be centered in the upper Cypress Creek (Big Cypress Creek), White
Oak Creek (Bayou) and Lake Fork Creek basins (Thurmond 1981:449). The study area lies within
the area documented for this hypothesized confederacy.
Thurmond's model of the Cypress Cluster is derived from a sociopolitical settlement
model for the late phases of the Caddo hypothesized by Story and Creel (1982). Story's model is
based upon an interpretation of the archaeological record with ethnographic analogy. Her model
is composed of two major levels: the affiliated group, which she terms the Anderson Cluster, and
constituent groups. Like the hypothesized Cypress Cluster, the Anderson Cluster is analogous to
a Caddo Confederacy in the vicinity of the upper Neches and Angelina rivers. The constituent
groups are equated by Thurmond (1981:422) to individual tribes which are composed of multiple
settlements, cemeteries, and limited-use areas. No archaeological term for these groups is
provided.

COMPONENT SITES

Within the Cypress Cluster, the Whelan and Titus phases are identified. The Whelan
phase is identified as the earliest formation of the Cypress Cluster (Thurmond 1981:422). A few
sites of this phase are noted to be in the upper Cypress Creek Basin (41CP14, 41CP17, 41TT11,
41TT18, 41TT108); however none are noted in the study area (Thurmond 1981:225). The most
common ceramic type identified by Thurmond (1981:439) is Ripley Engraved, with Taylor Engraved
and Wzlder Engraved occurring much less frequently. Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised
are noted to be typical of brushed wares. Alba, Perdiz, and Scallorn projectile points also typify the
Whelan phase. Figure 13 documents known or suspected Whelan component sites in the vicinity
of the study area.
Cypress Cluster components of the Titus phase are hypothesized by Thurmond
(1981:449) not to extend further west than the upper reaches of White Oak Creek and the
confluence of the South and North Sulphur rivers, and no further south than the Sabine River.
Figure 14 documents known or suspected Titus component sites in the vicinity of the study area.
Titus phase sites are not associated with mound building, although previously built
mounds were used. The Titus phase is known mostly from cemetery sites located on terraces,
which may explain the general lack of evidence documenting subsistence patterns. Ceramics are
grit-tempered and include Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Wzlder Engraved, Harleton AppUque,
Kamack Brushed Incised, LaRue Neck Banded and Bullard Brushed. Diagnostic lithics include
Talco, Maud and Bassett arrow points.
Based upon spatial distribution of ceramic and projectile point types, Thurmond
(1981:442-449) identified four "spatial subgroups" which are thought to be analogous to the
constituent groups (tribes?) of Story's model. These groups were later identified as subclusters
(Thurmond 1985:193). The study area is located in the Tankersley Creek subcluster documented
below. A brief discussion of each subcluster, as defined by artifact trait lists, is reproduced below
from Thurmond (1985:193-196).
Three Basins subcluster: Ripley Engraved is by far the dominant engraved ware.
Ripley bowls most frequently exhibit the scroll, scroll and circle, and continuous scroll
motifs, and the pendant triangle motif is entirely absent. Wzlder Engraved is virtually
the only other engraved ware, barring apparent trade vessels of the types Avery
Engraved, Simms Engraved, and, rarely, Womack Engraved. The utility ware is largely
classifiable as McKinney Plain, Maydelle Incised, and HarletonApplique, with very little
brushed ware present (less than 5 percent of the utility ware). Arrow points are of
the types Talco and Maud, with Perdiz occurring infrequently.
Tankersley Creek subcluster: Ripley Engraved is the most common engraved ware.
Ripley bowls most frequently exhibit the scroll, scroll and circle, and continuous scroll
motifs, and the pendant triangle motif does occur rarely. Wzlder Engraved is the only
other common engraved ware, but Taylor Engraved is present at low frequencies. The
greatest part of the utility ware is evenly divided between vessels classifiable as
Harleton Applique, Maydelle Incised, McKinney Plain, and Bullard Brushed. Brushed
ware accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the utility ware. Arrow points are mos
commonly of the type Maud, but Talco, Bassett, and Perdiz also occur.

PHASE COMPONENT SITES

Swauano Creek subcluster: Ripley Engraved remains the most common engraved
ware, but Bailey Engraved and Wilder Engraved also are quite common, and Johns
Engraved and Taylor Engraved occur infrequently. The Ripley bowls most commonly
exhibit the pendant triangle, scroll, scroll and circle, and continuous scroll motifs in
roughly equal frequencies. Bullard Brushed is the most common utility ware, with
Harleton Applique and Maydelle Incised present less frequently than in Tankersley
Creek components. McKinney Plain vessels are quite uncommon. Brushed ware
accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the utility ware. Arrow points are predominantly of
the type Talco, but Maud and Bassett also are common, and Reed occurs infrequently.
Big Cypress Creek subcluster: Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved are the dominant
engraved wares, occurring at roughly equal frequencies. On the Ripley bowls, the
pendant triangle motif is more common than all others combined. Bailey Engraved,
Wilder Engraved, and Johns Engraved are all relatively minor types within the engraved
ware, but Bailey is the more common of the t:\lree. Brushed ware strongly dominates
the engraved ware, with Bullard Brushed and Kamack Brushed-Incised the most
common types. Harleton Applique, Maydelle Incised, and McKinney Plain are present
at lower frequencies than in any other subcluster. Brushed ware accounts for 50 to
60 percent of the utility vessels. Trade vessels of the Belcher phase types, Belcher
Engraved, Belcher Ridged, Cowhide Stamped, Foster Trailed-Incised, Glassel! Engraved,
Hodges Engraved, and Keno Trailed, also are common. (It should be noted that
vessels of the Texarkana phase types Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Cass
Applique are ubiquitous at low frequencies within Titus phase components of the
Cypress cluster.) Arrow points of the type Talco are by far the most frequent, but
Bassett and Maud also are fairly common.

HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE
The following sections present a brief overview of the broad trends and events that
have contributed to the historical development of the study area. The intent of this overview is
to identify significant factors that have shaped the local history and to shed light upon other aspects
that have been largely overlooked or neglected in various county histories that have been published
over the years. Moreover, this narrative is intended to facilitate a more thorough understanding
of the individual sites encountered during field investigations and how they relate to the broader
historic contexts and themes.
Early European Activity
Titus County lies outside those regions where most early Spanish and French
exploration occurred, although at least two European explorers passed near the study area. In the
sixteenth century, Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado led survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition
through parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Details of the exact route are not
known, but they did travel through east Texas (Webb 1952 11:240; Glander et al. 1986a:31).
In 1718, the French, in their desire to gain control over portions of Texas, sent
Bernard de la Harpe to trade with Indian tribes in the region. Some historians have concluded

10723/880206

55

that his expedition passed

Early Settlement and the Establishment of Titus County
Permanent settlement came slowly to the study area. Despite its proximity to the Red
River, where some of Texas' earliest Anglo-American pioneers settled, this and surrounding
regions remained largely unexplored until the middle of the nineteenth century. Previously, AngoAmerican activity was concentrated, for the most part, in south-central Texas where the land was
better suited for settlement. The fertile prairies in that region were relatively easy to convert to
productive farm land, in sharp contrast to the heavily forested areas of northeast Texas which
required a great deal of effort to clear and cultivate.
As these prime lands in south-central Texas were claimed, pressures for new territory
increased with the ever-increasing influx of pioneers; settlement consequently expanded. East
Texas became an attractive area during the second quarter of the nineteenth century primarily
because of its proximity to the already settled regions of Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as its
abundant resources. The many trails extending through east Texas, whether established earlier by
native tribes or newly forged by Anglo-Americans, opened the region for settlement. The
Cherokee Trace, a well-used trail blazed by the Cherokees who inhabited this section of the state
in the early nineteenth century, served as one of the most important conduits for Anglo-American
immigrants (Glander et al. 1987:52-57), and it may have passed about four miles west of the study
area. The initial wave of pioneers tended to congregate along this and other routes, as well as
major rivers and creeks. As early as the 1830s, for example, land patents were issued in the
southwestern section of present-day Titus County, along Big Cypress Creek (Glander et al.
1986a:32). By 1839, the establishment of Fort Sherman on Big Cypress Creek suggests that AngloAmerican population was significant enough to warrant such a post. It also reflects a shared
concern among these early settlers for their safety and security. While the fort is referenced in
various historical publications and accounts of the region, relatively little is known of its operation.
By 1846, it was abandoned and left to ruin (Russell 1965:42-45).
Settlement throughout the 1830s and 1840s was sparse; still, enough people lived in
the area to justify the creation of Titus County in May 1846. The county was named in honor of
Andrew J. Titus who, though never a resident of the county, was a prominent statesman during the
Republic of Texas era and was influential in Texas' admission into the United States. Mt. Pleasant
was selected as the county seat. When first organized, Titus County was significantly larger in size
than it is today. In 1875, both Morris (to the east) and Franklin (to the west) counties were carved
from Titus County (Webb 1952 11:782-83).
Although permanent settlement began in Titus County by the 1830s, almost twenty
years passed before the first pioneers arrived in the study area. The probable reasons are the lack
of major waterways and trails through the area. Table 4 provides a complete listing of all the
original land grants, the recipients and the dates of issuance for all properties within the study area.
These grants are also shown graphically in Figure 15. Thomas C. Forbes was awarded the first
land grant in 1851 and three years passed before another survey was issued within the study area.
Like the majority of these later grant recipients, Forbes applied for and was awarded the title to
the land. Others, such as Hamilton Campbell, sold the land rights to speculators who had no

Barnes F. Lathrop (1949) has completed a most insightful study of the geographic
backgrounds of east Texas' pre-Civil War settlers. Although he did not specifically examine Titus
County in his research, Lathrop scrutinized nearby Hopkins and Upshur counties which, prior to
the establishment of Morris and Franklin counties in 1875, bordered Titus County. According to
Lathrop, Hopkins County was settled mostly by people who immigrated from Tennessee, Missouri
and Arkansas. Upshur County, on the other hand, had families who came primarily from Alabama,
Mississippi and Georgia (Lathrop 1949:37). A comparison of the racial composition of the three
counties (Table 5) suggests that Titus County, like Upshur County, was settled by people from the
Lowland South. Slavery was common but not as widespread as other areas, such as Harrison
County to the east.
Settlement in the study area was dispersed throughout the middle of the nineteenth
century. Research of tax and census records, as well as agricultural schedules, suggests that small
family-run farms prevailed in the study area and that slavery was virtually nonexistent. Despite the
fact that most settlers had come from the Lowland South, archival material reveals that these
people were not members of the upper, slave-holding class but, instead, were yeoman farmers who
came to Texas seeking new opportunities and a better life.
Agriculture
As was typical throughout much of northeast Texas during the mid-nineteenth century,
the vast majority of residents were involved in the cultivation and harvesting of agricultural goods.
Such a trend could only be expected, as most of these individuals, prior to their relocation to
Texas, had been farmers and had moved to this region for the seemingly limitless amounts of
affordable and fertile land. Because they were virtually isolated, these early settlers had to be as
independent and self-sufficient as possible. They consequently grew a variety of crops, such as corn
and potatoes, that were or could easily be transformed into edible goods. Indeed, the harsh
frontier conditions prevented little but subsistence farming, as born out in data presented in
Table 6. In the 1850s, for example, corn, sweet potatoes, oats, wheat, and irish potatoes were the
staple agricultural goods and provided the basis for the pioneer's diet. Cash crops, such as cotton,
were grown in relatively small quantities. In later years, however, cotton became an important
source of income for local growers and was an integral part of Titus County's agricultural-based
economy.

Precious little documentation survives that describes agricultural practices and patterns
within the study area during the mid-nineteenth century. However, a general scenario can be
obtained by comparing historical accounts of nearby regions, as well as analyzing census data.
Glander (et al. 1986a:40) writes that small farms were abundant throughout Titus County, and
population and agricultural tables for the 1850 and 1860 census returns support this claim. Pierce,
in his 1932 Master's thesis, scrutinized the Products of Agriculture Schedule of the 1850 census
and reported that, of the county's population of 3,636, only 293 individuals owned land. Of that
amount, 127 had 20 acres or less in c1!Jtivation (Pierce 1932:38-39).

A number of factors hampered local agricultural production during the mid-nineteenth
century, and a prime contributor, as noted by Rice and Watson (1910:9), was the lack of adequate
"transportation facilities". They reported that early growers had few markets in which to sell their
goods and for the most part produced crops that were consumed at home or sold in the immediate
vicinity. Both the means and modes of transportation made it difficult and expensive to ship excess
goods, and limited profitability discouraged the rapid growth of the local agricultural industry. The
arrival of the railroad and the expansion of a road network in the later years ushered in an era of
greater prosperity and development.
While this scenario obviously applied to all of frontier Texas, other factors more
characteristic of the northeast section of the state should be noted. Perhaps the most obvious
involved the clearing of the timber that prevailed throughout the region. Unlike other areas of
the state where coastal prairies with abundant water supplies were easily transformed into
productive farmland, territory in Titus and adjoining counties was heavily forested. Therefore, a
great deal of labor was needed to clear the land, and the sparsity of settlement limited the scope
of agricultural production. Once cleared, however, the land proved quite fertile and conducive to
farming, which resulted in Titus County's ascension into an important agricultural center in
northeast Texas.
Prior to the Civil War, a plantation-slave system became a dominant feature of the
regional economy, especially in more established areas, such as Harrison County. Table 7 shows
the difference in the average size of farms in 1850 and 1860 for Titus and Harrison counties, which
reveals the contrasting nature of each county's agricultural systems.
Exact figures are not available, but local agricultural production probably decreased
during the Civil War, as many of the men joined Confederate forces and the resulting loss of
manpower made the harvesting of crops a difficult task. Despite the likely drop in annual yields,
agricultural production took on an even greater role in the local economy during the war years.
The growing of foodstuffs for troops and the cultivation of cotton for trading purposes were
primary ways of contributing to the war effort for those who remained behind.
Titus County, like much of Texas, escaped much of the severe hardships that
devastated so much of the Confederacy. Because the plantation-slave system was less entrenched
locally than in other regions of the state, Titus County was less affected by emancipation.
Increased demand for cotton following the war encouraged farmers to plant greater quantities,
although slave labor obviously was not used. Instead, a tenant farming system subsequently
evolved, but because the study area had few slave owners and few blacks, such a system was not
as common as in other parts of northeast Texas.
During the late nineteenth century, Texas emerged as the nation's leading supplier
of cotton, and local farmers contributed to this effort. Cotton had been Titus County's principal
crop since early settlement and early twentieth century production totals generally increased as
seen in Table 8. Still, local farmers grew a variety of other crops. Wheat, which was attempted
by early pioneers, was discontinued because the sandy soils of Titus County were not conducive
to its cultivation. In its place, corn was grown, and it provided an important food source for home
consumption. Rice and Watson noted, however, that the corn is "not what might be expected" and

that "little attention is paid to [its] selection and improvement" (Rice and Watson 1910). Other
agricultural crops included peanuts, cowpeas, ribbon cane and peaches.
While some crop diversification had occurred by 1910, cotton remained the most
harvested agricultural good, and this trend prevailed until the 1930s when the cotton market
collapsed. As a consequence, local farmers were forced to diversify. The opening of the Texas
Milk Products Plant in Mt. Pleasant encouraged many farmers to raise dairy cattle. Although the
plant closed in 1960, dairy farming remains an important element in the local economy (Glander
et al. 1986a:42). The Texas Almanac reports that cattle, dairy products, poultry, corn, watermelons,
sorghum, hay and peanuts form the basis for Titus County's agricultural production (Belo 1987).
Transportation
Because no commercially navigable waterways run through the study area, overland
routes have been the sole means of transporting goods and people. The Cherokee Trace, as
previously discussed, was the earliest trail in the region, and many of the state's earliest AngloAmerican pioneers came to Texas by way of this route. Increased settlement in the study area in
subsequent years resulted in the establishment of new roads, but the relatively dense vegetation
of the region made the blazing of new trails a difficult and time-consuming task. While it is almost
impossible to determine the earliest ones, many of the roads led to the region's important trading
centers. The 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) provides the earliest and most reliable record of
these early roadways. As one might expect, Mt. Pleasant was the primary hub, with roads radiating
outward in all directions. Two of the county's primary arteries extended through the study area
and included the Old Paris Road (now known as County Road NW 4) and the old Clarksville Road
(FM 2152). Secondary roads also ran through the study area and linked these and other primary
roadways. The right angles that many of the secondary roads take indicate that the thoroughfares
frequently ran along property lines of established farms. Such a trend is even more obvious when
examining surface ownership maps on file at the Titus County Tax Assessor-Collector's Office,
which delineate property lines and roadways.
In 1878 the Tyler Tap Railroad (later absorbed into the St. Louis and Southwestern
Railway) reached Mt. Pleasant and provided rail service for county residents for the first time.
Another railroad, the East Line and Red River, skirted through the southeastern section of the
county but for all practical purposes had no impact on the local history and development. The
Tyler Tap Railroad, on the other hand, proved a pivotal event in Titus County's history and
consolidated Mt. Pleasant's position as an important retail, commercial and industrial center in the
region. The railroad extended in an east-west direction and tapped much of the county's rich
resources. This route, however, bypassed the study area, and as agricultural specialists noted in
1910, "the farming and lumbering interests of the northern part of the county [including the study
area] have suffered from a lack of adequate transportation facilities ... " (Rice and Watson 1910).
In 1912-13, the Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad was built through the northern section
of the county and its path bisected the study area (Figure 16). This railroad linked Paris in Lamar
County with the St. Louis and Southwestern Railway in Mt. Pleasant. Known as the "Pa and Ma",
the Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad served local residents for over 50 years (Thompson 1988). No
depots were located in the study area and citizens boarded the train in Mt. Pleasant or Talco, a
few miles northwest of the study area. The railroad was purchased by Texas Power and Light in

1956 and was used to haul fuel for a power station in the Mt. Pleasant area (Jurney 1961:94). The
line has been abandoned for several years and the tracks and crossties removed. The right-of-way
clearing is still evident and provides a strong reminder of this locally significant railway.
Another railroad company pre-dated the Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad by six years.
Unlike the latter, this railroad was used exclusively for the transportation of raw goods and did not
offer passenger service. It was built by the Hoffman Heading and Stave Company, which erected
a plant in Mt. Pleasant in 1906. By 1912, the company exhausted the lumber in the area and
ceased operating the line. The right-of-way was later acquired by the Paris and Mt. Pleasant
Railroad (Titus County Deed Records Volume 29, Page 100).
The establishment of rail service in the region proved an extremely significant
development in the history of Titus County and the study area. The slow and unimproved
transportation lines of the past had hampered economic growth, but the arrival of the railroad
offered many new opportunities and possibilities to local residents. Farmers whose yield increased
dramatically during the late nineteenth century shipped their goods to markets that had previously
been inaccessible or unprofitable. With their increased wealth, many of these farmers patronized
local stores, and merchants carried a greater variety of goods that had been too expensive or
difficult to obtain in the pre-railroad era.
Although the railroad greatly affected long-distant shipping and transportation,
intracounty travel remained heavily dependent upon overland trails. When automobiles became
the primary means of transportation during the early twentieth century, existing roads were used.
Often these roads were unimproved and travel was difficult. Residents of Titus County, like many
of those throughout the state, began a "good roads" campaign which encouraged the upgrading of
existing roads, as well as the construction of new ones. By 1936, as Figure 17 shows, two paved
roads extended through the study area and U.S. Highway 271 was indicated as a graded and
drained road. Most of the roads noted on the 1936 map are still used today, and both the State
Highway Department and county commissioners have been active in upgrading and maintaining
the local network of roads.
Industry and Manufacturing
Since its initial settlement in the 1850s, land within the study area has been used
almost exclusively for agricultural purposes. As a consequence, local industrial and manufacturing
operations have been limited both in size and scope. Cotton was grown in great quantities
throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and its cultivation encouraged the
establishment of cotton gins throughout the region.
Cotton Gins
Gins were (and still are, for that matter) an integral component in the processing of
cotton. Their primary function is to extract seeds from the cotton fiber. Prior to the advent of
large-scale compresses in the 1880s, gins were also used to bale cotton to facilitate its
transportation to textile mills. Compresses, however, were significantly more effective in
completing this task, condensing the cotton into much denser bales and thereby increasing its
profitability. Because compresses were major industrial operations that involved substantial

financial and capital investments, relatively few compresses were built throughout the state. They
were located in urban areas and stood adjacent to railroads. Gins, on the other hand, were much
smaller and simpler to operate. They were built on well-established roads and, therefore, were
accessible to local farmers. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a large
number of gins operated throughout Titus and other cotton-rich counties in Texas.
No gins are presently operating within the study area, as little cotton has been grown
locally since the 1930s. One local informant, aged 89 years, has stated that a Mr. McBride owned
a gin that once stood in the Forest Grove area (Bragg 1987). She does not recall ever seeing the
gin and believes it was dismantled and hauled away before she was born. No other local
informants interviewed during this investigation recall this gin (Thompson 1988; Gingles 1988;
Johnson 1988; Franklin 1987; Hinson 1987; and Deaton 1987). Archival research revealed that an
Aaron McBride owned a 41-acre tract in the Hannah Northcutt Survey, near the site of the old
Forest Grove School (41TT389). In 1891, he conveyed this land to G.A. Johnson for $650, but
the deed makes no reference to a gin on the property (Titus County Deed Records Volume 27,
Page 92). Archaeological investigations on the land identified an historic site on this 41-acre tract,
but an analysis of observed artifacts suggests that the site marks the former location of a domestic
structure. See the site description for 41 TT388 for more information.
Another gin was located in the Green Hill settlement, but stood outside the study
area, across FM 2152 west of the Green Hill Methodist Church (41TT541). Local informants have
stated that this gin was run by the Freeman family and that it closed a few years before World War
II (Johnson 1988).
Hoffman Heading and Stave Company
The heavily forested lands throughout the region contributed to the establishment of
other industrial operations, namely saw mills. The lumber industry has been vital to the economy
of northeast Texas since the middle of the nineteenth century and Titus County was an early
source of lumber in the state. As early as 1860, according to census records, six saw mills were
in operation in Titus County. No archaeological or archival evidence suggests that any saw mills
were located in the study area and none of the local informants recall any such operations.
One industry, which exploited the vast timber supply, came to the area in the early
years of this century and contributed to the development of the region. J.V. Moore, a prominent
businessman in Mt. Pleasant, convinced the owners of Hoffman Heading and Stave Company to
move from Dexter, Stoddard County, Missouri, to Mt. Pleasant. The firm manufactured barrels
and, thus, needed large quantities of lumber which were available in territory north of Mt.
Pleasant. The Hoffman Heading and Stave Company erected a plant in the town and built a
narrow-gauge railroad that extended through the heart of the study area. Known locally as the
"Dinky Link", the railroad hauled timber from the hinterlands to the company plant (Thompson
1988). The railroad appears on the 1910 soils survey map (Figure 16), but is incorrectly identified
as the Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad. The firm quickly became the largest employer in the city
and its principal owner, August Hoffman, became a prominent business leader in the community
(Jurney 1961:157).

Despite the abundance of raw materials throughout the study area, the company soon
exhausted available supplies and abandoned the line by 1912. In that year, they sold the right-ofway to the newly created Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad, which used sections of the old line for
their railroad. Neither railroad survives today (the Paris and Mt. Pleasant Railroad ceased
operation in the 1960s), but the right-of-way for each can still be seen.
Education
Educational efforts in the study area and state during the middle of the nineteenth
century were poor and decentralized, with few schools, instructors and pupils. The earliest
pioneers could not afford the "luxury" of such institutions because the hardships of frontier life
made every family member's contributions a requisite for survival. Children were put to work
clearing, cultivating and harvesting the fields or completing household tasks and chores. As a
result, little or no time could be set aside for attendance at organized schools. Moreover, limited
funds, dispersed settlement patterns, and poor roads and modes of transportation discouraged the
establishment of schools. Still, early settlers recognized the necessity and benefits of education,
and by 1850, six schools were operating in Titus County. The names and locations of these schools
are not known, but Pierce (1932:58) states that there were two academies, two common schools,
one female institute and one seminary, all of which were privately funded. None are believed to
have been within the study area (all of the land grants issued were after 1851), but are thought to
have stood in older, more established sections of the county. Census data for 1850 tallies eight
teachers and 178 students in the county which boasted a population of 3,636.
While the Republic and, later, the State of Texas had long regarded education as an
important priority, funding for public education was severely limited during the third quarter of the
nineteenth century. The government, though short on revenue, retained the rights to vast
territories within Texas and set aside lands for schools, with each county receiving one league of
land (Belo 1976:142). It was hoped that each school system would be able to generate adequate
funding for their programs when the land was sold. Unfortunately, this scheme did not work as
well as had been hoped, and early educators were still left scrambling for reliable sources of
revenues.
Following the Reconstruction, the State took a more active role in public education.
The State Constitution of 1876 established a permanent school fund which provided financial
support for all local schools. A constitutional amendment in 1883 also allowed taxing authority for
local schools, although a two-thirds majority of taxpayers had to approve such designation.
Subsequent legislation established county-wide school systems with locally elected superintendents
(Eby 1954:50-51). Common or community school districts were created with separate facilities for
black and white students.
Old records of the Titus County School Superintendent have been destroyed,
misplaced or filed in permanent storage (and not accessible) and were not examined during this
investigation. Nonetheless, common school districts were organized in the study area as early as
1897 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 4, Page 414), and in time, five districts were organized
within the permit boundaries. These include the Green Hill, Forest Grove, Oak Grove, Gladewater
(also Midway) and Hart's Bluff (also Neville's Chapel) common school districts. Deed records an
surface-ownership maps identify the exact locations of the schools (Figure 18) that served each o

the aforementioned districts and, with one exception, none of the old facilities have survived.
Schools for the Oak Grove and Gladewater districts were situated outside the study area. The only
extant facility within the study area is the Old Green Hill School (41 TT515) which was built about
1944, replacing an older structure that stood on the same location (Thompson 1988). The building
that remains has been converted into a private residence and much of its integrity compromised.
The locations of the other schools within the study area were identified by EH&A archaeologists,
and artifacts were observed at the Forest Grove School (41 TT389) and the Old Hart's Bluff School
(41TT512).
The decision to build a school at a particular site appears to be, from all available
information, less of a conscious choice to be strategically located in the geographic center of a
settlement or school district, and more of a random, haphazard selection. School properties within
the study area were donated or sold at a low price (usually one dollar) by local citizens. The
impetus for their offers is not known; however, all schools were located next to an existing and
well-traveled road, thus ensuring relatively easy access to all children in each district. Despite this
passive and seemingly unplanned process, schools within the study area, indeed throughout much
of rural Titus County, are located about 1.5 miles from one another, creating a somewhat regularly
spaced network of schools in the region.
Schools in the study area were situated on small tracts of land which typically included
about a single acre. Most of the transactions which conveyed the property to the common school
district and its trustees included a provision stating that the land would revert back to the original
owner or his or her heirs if the school was ever abandoned (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 4, Page 414; Volume 25, Page 60; Volume 35, Page 181). Such a practice was common
throughout much of rural Texas. When local schools eventually closed during consolidation efforts
in the post-World War II era, the buildings were either demolished or moved and the grounds
once again used for agricultural purposes.
Although few physical remains have survived to provide a tangible link to their past,
schools represent a vital chapter in the local history. They, along with churches, became focal
points of activities and fostered a sense of community within this sparsely populated region of
north-central Titus County. Children frequently identified themselves according to the school they
attended (Thompson 1988). The schools were also used as election and meeting halls, as well as
community centers.
Schools within the study area thrived throughout most of the twentieth century, but
educational reforms since 1945 have forced the closing of all but one of the school districts in the
region. Most have been absorbed into the Mt. Pleasant Independent School District, which now
encompasses much of Titus County. The Hart's Bluff School District has survived and built new
facilities outside the study area (Figure 18).

Architectural Development

C

The architectural history of the study area follows patterns and trends that are typical
throughout much of rural northeast Texas. The earliest settlers built dwellings that can be
classified as folk or vernacular housing. Such residences display features that can be traced to a
specific geographic area or ethnic group. While vernacular building traditions remained popular

10723/880206

into the twentieth century, these buildings were often embellished with detailing that was popular
at the time. This was particularly true after the arrival of the railroad, which made available
prefabricated materials that could easily be applied to houses. Thus, a residence could present a
more stylish appearance. Despite the application of these details, most houses of the pre-World
War I era are still regarded as examples of vernacular architecture because they retain their basic
form, plan and arrangement of interior spaces. Beginning in the 1910s and continuing through the
1930s, vernacular traditions gave way to popular architectural forms. The most common types
were hip- or gable-roofed bungalows. Little construction took place during World War II, as most
of the nation's energy and resources were directed toward the war effort. After 1945, however,
Titus County and much of the rest of the country entered an era of great prosperity which brought
about a construction boom that completely changed the nature and character of our country's built
environment. Although a large number of historic structures were identified during this
investigation, the majority of extant buildings in the study area were erected in the post-World War
II era.
Vernacular Traditions
No physical remains of structures that date to the early-settlement era (pre-1870) have
survived in the study area, and no contemporaneous written accounts describing them were
uncovered during research efforts. Jordan (1978) has documented common building trends of east
Texas pioneers, and small, one-room, log cabins likely were the first structures built by AngloAmerican settlers in the study area. Such dwellings provided much-needed shelter from the harsh
elements and, thus, fulfilled a fundamental need for the pioneer. The abundance of timber
throughout the newly settled lands provided a good source of building materials and logs could
easily be fashioned, with few tools, into building materials. The construction of log cabins was
relatively straightforward, but was extremely labor-intensive. The first structures were built crudely
and not meant to last very long. They were soon replaced with larger and better-crafted structures.
Prior to the 1850s, most of the buildings were of log construction because sawmills were still
somewhat rare and the difficulty and cost of transporting milled lumber was, for all practical
purposes, prohibitive.

\

Jordan has recorded several log structures in Titus County, including examples of
single- and double-pen dwellings. As its name connotes, a single-pen dwelling is comprised of one
room, while the double-pen house consists of two interior spaces. Among the many variants of
the latter type are the basic double-pen house with two adjoining rooms and the central-hall house
with an enclosed passageway that is flanked on both sides by a single room. The most common
subtype of the double-pen house, however, is the dog-trot, which appears as if two one-room
cabins are joined under a single roof. A large open breezeway separates the two rooms
(Goeldner 1974:10). The dog-trot proved particularly well-suited to the hot, humid climate of east
Texas, and examples can be found throughout the Lowland South (Glassie 1968; Jordan 1978:119).
Log houses were built less frequently during the late 1800s; however, log construction was not
completely abandoned until the mid-twentieth century. Log cribs and barns were often built by
poor rural families that could not afford to use milled lumber.
Jordan concludes that Titus and other counties in northeast Texas were settled
primarily by people from the south who brought with them architectural forms and building
techniques that reflected their geographical background. He notes that:

10723/880206

Here [east Texas] is the Texas stronghold of the dogtrot house and slave
cabin, the square, saddle, and semilunate notches, the cat and brick
chimneys. The pine tree provides the most common wood for log
structures here, and half-log construction is common. Cantilevered
porch and shed-room supports, hooded chimneys, and back porches as
well as front characterize the East Texas log house. Foundations of tall
brick or wooden pilings are the rule, and chinks are often covered by
rived boards instead of being filled. Occasional two-story plantation
houses and Louisiana-style roofs add to the deep southern image. Pens
are larger here than elsewhere in Texas, and the room on the porch is
more often encountered (Jordan 1978:181).
Although common throughout east Texas during the second and third quarters of the
nineteenth century, log structures were not the only types of buildings erected during the
settlement era. In some cases, milled lumber was transported by wagon or oxcart from older, more
established centers such as Jefferson, Texas, but the cost was exorbitantly high and, thus, the
transporting of such was rarely undertaken. The abundance of timber, a critical factor in the
widespread popularity of log structures, also encouraged the development of the sawmill industry
which quickly became and still remains a vital component in the regional economy. By 1860, for
example, Titus County had nine sawmills in operation; however, none was in the study area. As
the sawmill industry increased, both in the number of establishments and in production capacity,
lumber became more available and affordable. As a consequence, larger and more stylish
structures were built. The more affluent people erected houses with the Greek Revival styling
which was popular in east Texas from the 1840s to the 1870s. Such buildings are easily identified
by their use of details derived from Greek architecture and the emphasis placed on symmetry and
balance in the structure's composition (Alexander 1966). No Greek Revival structures stand in the
study area, although the Green Hill Church (41 TT534) displays some architectural elements
suggestive of the style.
Another factor crucial in the architectural history of the study area, as well as Titus
County, was the arrival of the railroad in 1878. Such service enabled milled lumber and other
machine-made materials to be shipped to previously isolated regions (Maxwell 1983:23). Frame
dwellings replaced log structures as the dominant type of construction. Despite the widespread
use of new, more refined materials, vernacular forms prevailed.
The most common milled-lumber house type of east Texas during the nineteenth
century was the center-passage dwelling which remained popular into the early years of this
century. Center-passage houses characteristically have a central hallway with a room on each side.
This configuration, which allows an efficient use of interior space, closely resembles that of a dogtrot house, but the hallway is enclosed and is not as broad. Despite these differences, architectural
historians and cultural geographers generally regard the dog-trot as a variant of the center-passage
house type (Jordan 1978:123). Other distinctive features of these dwellings include side-gabled
roofs and a centrally located door that opens into the hallway.
Several examples of center-passage houses still stand in the study area, unlike the log
dwellings of the settlement, and they range in date of construction from the 1870s to the 1910s.
The most common are dog-trot houses, of which two subtypes are found within the study area.

10723/880206

One type has a side-gabled roof and is constructed of milled lumber. Similarly detailed structures
were built throughout northeast Texas, including several which are documented in a cultural
resources survey in nearby Camp County (Glander et al. 1987:180-83, 200-02). The other subtype
has a hipped roof and, of course, the open breezeway. These houses were built about 1910 and
are indicative of the profound influence and strength of vernacular architecture. The vast majority
of contemporaneous houses had abandoned the dog-trot plan which, despite its ideal adaptation
to the prevailing climate, is generally associated, both then and now, with the settlement era.
Other vernacular forms, including the two-room and L-plan residences, gained
popularity during the late nineteenth century. Two-room dwellings resemble double-pen houses
in plan, but feature wood-frame or box structural systems. Although horizontal wood siding, usually
weatherboard, is sometimes used, board-and-batten sheathing is more typical. The L-plan house,
as its name suggests, presents a configuration that resembles the letter "L". This type of structure
evolved from the center-passage dwelling and can be regarded as a synthesis of popular and
vernacular architectural ideals. This house form became the most common type of plan
throughout Texas during the 1890s and early 1900s and was frequently embellished with elaborate
jigsawn- and turned-wood trim that is most often associated with the eclectic tastes of the Victorian
period. Much of the architectural detailing used in such houses was shipped by rail from large
milling operations in east Texas.
Popular Traditions
By the second decade of this century, vernacular traditions were forsaken in favor of
new and different architectural forms. The foundation for these changes can be traced to the
arrival of the railroad in the 1870s, but its full impact was not truly felt until the 1910s. By that
time, the industrial revolution made available an even greater variety of building materials which
altered consumers' tastes and choices. In addition, the architectural and building professions were
in a state of transition, responding to the rapid changes and modernization that were taking place
at that time. With the advent of mass-circulated pattern books and popular magazines, such as
Good Housekeeping and Ladies Home Journal, new ideas and trends in architecture were quickly
disseminated throughout the country. Firms such as Sears Roebuck and Company published
catalogues offering plans and materials that could be shipped nationwide. And as Americans
entered an era of increased wealth and prosperity, they became, as a whole, more style-conscious.
The rise of the middle class, in particular, brought increased pressures on architects and home
builders to design and construct houses that would be modern, affordable, innovative, and
comfortable.
A variety of new styles and types were introduced, including American Foursquare,
Prairie School and Craftsman bungalows. Despite this diversity, however, residential architecture
became increasingly uniform and homogeneous in both form and plan. Regional adaptations
developed, but, in contrast to vernacular architecture, were much more subtle.
Of all the architectural styles that gained popularity during the early twentieth century,
the Craftsman bungalow was preferred by most residents in the study area, and numerous examples
have survived today. The origins of the Craftsman bungalow can be traced to California, where
architects Charles Summer Greene and Henry Mather Greene designed houses that reflected an
influence from the English Arts and Craft movement and Oriental wooden architecture (McAlester

'

I
and McAlester 1986:454). Craftsman bungalows were soon built throughout the nation, although
few "high-style" examples were ever constructed. Instead, the style was well-suited for local
interpretation and adaptation. Craftsman bungalows were built into the 1930s.
Craftsman bungalows share many features that distinguish them from other
architectural forms. The roofs are generally low-pitched, which emphasizes the structure's
horizontal lines. The rafter ends are exposed and gable ends frequently have triangular or Stickstyle brackets. The porch, an integral element, is elongated and has squared columns with tapered
pedestals or bases.
Four subtypes are identified by McAlester and McAlester (1986:453) and are
distinguished by their roof type and orientation. Examples of each are found in the study area.
The front-gabled subtype has a single gable that covers the main body of the house. Often, a
secondary gable extends from the front and includes a gable that intersect at right angles. This
configuration usually involves a side-gabled porch in juxtaposition with a front-facing gable over
the house's main body. The third subtype, the side-gabled roof, frequently has an inset porch
incorporated within the expansive low-pitched roof. The fourth subtype has a hipped roof.
Craftsman bungalows were built locally from the 1910s until the late 1930s. The first
ones were more elaborately detailed and crafted but, as time progressed, were simplified.

V: RESEARCH DESIGN

INTRODUCTION
During more than five years of previous investigations in the Mt. Pleasant area,
EH&A archaeologists have pursued several research goals with varying degrees of success. One
of these goals has been the attempt to model regional prehistoric settlement patterns. Efforts to
understand variation in historic settlement and land use have also been attempted. Because of the
extreme paucity of prehistoric diagnostic materials, some goals, such as understanding prehistoric
temporal patterning, have not been realized. Although new data gathered in the present survey
will almost certainly bring about a reassessment of the current research goals, the goals outlined
below reflect what the archaeological staff at EH&A considers to be significant problem areas
which can be realistically addressed within the constraints of archaeological survey.
PROBLEM AREA 1 - PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
Prehistoric settlement pattern modeling has long been a goal of the EH&A
archaeological studies within the area. Most of these studies (Brown et al. 1986; Glander et al.
1987) have been highly successful. The primary focus of these studies has been the quantification
of settlement patterns utilizing a combination of hypothetical pre-European settlement biotic zones
(i.e., bottomland hardwood forest, upland oak-pine community, and mixed slope forest) with
distance to water sources classified by Strahler's (1952) stream order. A relatively high degree of
predictive success was achieved on a general level for a survey in Camp County, south of the
present study area. One of the limiting factors, however, was the inability to use stream order, one
of the better explanatory variables, in a truly predictive manner. The following goals then reflect
the utility of the previously developed model by making a detailed comparison between the B-2
area and the previously surveyed areas. More importantly, however, these goals seek to use a
series of stream network measures within mesoscale basins to attempt to improve the predictive
power of the settlement model. The following goals are proposed.
1)

Can the predictive model developed in previous survey efforts successfully
indicate prehistoric site densities within the study area?

2)

Should differences in overall site densities occur, can these possible differences
be attributed to known physiographic and geologic differences between the
study areas?

3)

Will the addition of various stream network parameters measured for the
various small basins within the study area significantly improve the predictive
power of the settlement model?

A preliminary settlement pattern study, utilizing the previously established
environmental parameters, will be conducted in the study area and the results compared to the
previous mine study areas. Because of the proximity of the area and general cultural similarities,
some degree of correspondence is to be expected. The B-2 area, entirely underlain by Wilcox
Group sediments and largely within the White Oak Bayou/Sulfur River drainage basin, is also

10723/880206

77

expected to be slightly different from the Leesburg study area, south of Big Cypress Creek and
underlain by the sandier Queen City and Sparta formations.
A careful examination of the geology of the B-2 study area has suggested that there
are dramatic hydrologic differences in stream network geometry and physiography which may
reflect differences in water availability and in prehistoric vegetation communities. To some degree,
these must reflect differences in the erosion potential and the hydrologic significance between the
Wilcox channel sands, which tend to occupy interbasin divides, and interdistributary sands and
muds which occur in the lower portions of the basins (Figure 3). A series of morphometric
variables, designed to measure stream network density, relief and order as well as information on
the underlying geologic sediments, has been compiled to characterize differences between basins.
These differences will be compared to differences in site density.
PROBLEM AREA 2 - CULTURAL HISTORICAL QUESTIONS
Problem Area 1 deals with the location of all prehistoric sites in relation to
environmental factors and the prediction of site location. Often during previous surveys, it has
been difficult to temporally identify a site based on the survey results alone (Glander et al. 1986a,b;
Brown et al. 1986), so many sites have simply been labeled "undifferentiated prehistoric". Problem
Area 2 focuses on the temporal identification of sites and suggests areas of research best addressed
by archaeological testing. If sites can be found within the study area to address these issues, the
state of knowledge for the region could be greatly enhanced.
Paleo-Indian Occupation
As stated previously in Chapter IV, Paleo-Indian sites are not well represented in the
region of the study area. Can a Paleo-Indian component be documented and isolated in the study
area? Because Paleo-Indian occupations are few in number when compared to later prehistoric
occupations, sites found to contain this component will most likely contribute to the scant data base
for this time period.

Archaic Occupation

t

The Archaic stage is characterized by the development of increasingly varied tool kits.
Thurmond (1981) notes that many Archaic sites are located on terrace and floodplain projections.
Discrete, single component sites located in these areas and in others should help in the study of
the Archaic and in the prediction of Archaic site locations. Discrete sites with hearths can not only
provide the archaeologist with absolute dating, by thermoluminescence, but it can also possibly
provide information about seasonality. Can sites dating from the Archaic be identified for the
study area?

(

n

g

Early Ceramic Occupation
The Early Ceramic stage is tenuous, although the concept is not new (Bell 1953, Jelks
1965, Webb et al. 1969, Fields and Thurmond 1980). Sandy paste ceramics are common on Early
Ceramic sites. Testing of some sites thought to have a potential for this occupation is needed to
determine the validity of the Early Ceramic stage and its possible relationship to the Tchfuncte and

occupation be found in the study area?

Can sites relating to this

Caddo Occupation
Caddo is recognized by the presence of mound centers and village sites along the
terraces of major streams. Multicomponent Caddoan sites are frequently the object of research
interests, which is justified. What is not justified however, is researching multicomponent sites at
the expense of "lesser" single component sites. Information pertaining to a better understanding
of these latter Caddo sites may even be more important since less is known about single
component Caddo sites. Can such sites be identified from survey data?
PROBLEM AREA 3 - BURIED SITES
The paucity of floodplain sites along many larger drainages and the virtual absence
of buried alluvial sites has led some archaeologists to speculate that such sites must exist in as-yetundetermined localities. Buried sites have been found in other parts of east Texas (at Cooper
Lake: Bousman et al. 1988) and eastern central Texas (at Richland-Chambers: McGregor and
Bruseth 1987; at Aquilla Lake: Brown 1987) as well as in Oklahoma and western Louisiana.
There is no clear reason why such sites should be absent in the Mt. Pleasant area. Locating buried
sites involves conducting mechanical excavations in floodplains or other environments which may
have accumulated sediments.
One of the most likely areas to search for buried alluvial sites is within stream basins
which have seen rapid erosion and deposition since the beginning of the historic period.
Preliminary observations within the study area have led to the conclusion that the combination of
steep slopes and deforestation have created extreme erosion on some hillslopes within the study
area, and consequently large floodplains on the main downstream drainages. Such areas have been
identified on both East Piney and Piney creeks by Charles Frederick, EH&A project geomorphologist. Thus, high-probability areas for site burial are found in the upland basins of both of
these small drainages (Figure 3 ). The first goal of the geoarchaeological investigations is therefore
to answer the following question.
1)

Does the necessary environment exist for buried alluvial sites along Piney and
East Piney creeks?

In addition to buried sites in alluvial settings, recent investigations in southeast Texas
(Fields et al. 1988) have demonstrated that a cap of transported sandy sediments can be
responsible for archeological site burial in an upland environment. With this in mind, the second
goal of the current geoarcheological investigations becomes:

2)

10723/880206

Is there a mantle of transported sandy sediments present in the uplands of the
study area, and if so, can it be related to slope position?

79

PROBLEM AREA 4 - HISTORIC SETTLEMENT
Previous studies by EH&A in the region have looked at different patterns of land
acquisition during European settlement of the area, as well as the factors involved in the
settlement of various small communities within the area. These areas will again be touched upon
in the discussion of this section. Other interesting areas of investigation include the role of the
early railroad line within the study area and what effect the nearby market center of Mt. Pleasant
plays on the study area.
1)

Early historic settlement patterns of the area are keyed to early trails, railroads
and navigable waterways. Did these early settlers use these roads solely for
settlement or did they also produce marketable goods that were transported to
regional market centers?

2)

Maps of the area during the nineteenth century are scarce. Since these early
settlement patterns are keyed to transportation routes, can these early routes
be identified by the presence of these early structures?

If subsistence farming was practiced in the study area, one would expect to find
historic sites with a dearth of trade goods. However, if surplus farming was taking place, the
presence of trade items would indicate an exchange of goods.

3)

Can sites be located which, through archaeological data retrieval, can shed light
on subsistence and/or surplus farming of the nineteenth century?

4)

What influence on historic settlement does the nearby market center of Mt.
Pleasant have on settlement within the study area?

The architectural history of the study area follows patterns and trends that are typical
throughout much of rural northeast Texas.

Are extant, pristine examples of early architecture identifiable in the study
area?

These questions and others that might arise as research is undertaken will be
investigated through a combination of archival research with selected interviews of older study area
residents. Census records and particularly agricultural schedules are expected to shed light, not
only on the first research question, but the others as well. Early maps of the area will also aid in
the understanding of study area history. And finally, a number of informants have been identified
who could provide specific details on many of the issues raised above. These informants are
referenced throughout the historic site descriptions.
METHODS OF SURVEY
The survey field crew consisted of three to five people, one of whom was the field
director who was responsible for coordinating daily activities. Approximately 340 person-days were
spent in the field during the present survey.

Ideally, depending on the weather, terrain, manpower, and land accessibility, a
minimum of approximately 20 ha per person per day were surveyed. Individual transects were
spaced approximately 30 m apart, maintained by compass bearings and topographic maps. Special
attention was given to areas such as road cuts, stock trails, animal burrow spoil mounds, stream
bank exposures, and other similar exposed areas. In addition to visual inspection of the ground
surface, screened shovel tests were implemented throughout the study area. The project
geomorphologist also worked in the study area to obtain a geomorphic perspective of the sites and
the surrounding area.
Because bermudagrass and other vegetation generally prohibited good ground surface
exposure, screened shovel testing was conducted as an integral part of the survey. The value of
shovel testing cannot be overstated since many sites (especially prehistoric) were simply not visible
on the ground surface. Other researchers have encountered the same problem and endorse shovel
testing as a means for site discovery (Fields et al. 1988:51).

,,

It is interesting that this proven method of site location is not endorsed by some
contemporary researchers. Schott (1989) questions the effectiveness of shovel testing and attempts
to discredit the technique. Schott, however, does not identify more effective alternatives, and is
soundly rebutted by Nance and Ball (1989) and Lightfoot (1989).

Shovel testing strategy was designed to test the principal topographic features of the
study area: interfluve and ridge summits, backslopes, toeslopes, and floodplain (when/if present).
EH&A's shovel testing efforts were more intense in areas thought to have a high probability for
prehistoric site occurrence. Generally these areas (e.g., stream banks, terraces, ridge projections,
topographic highs in a floodplain setting) were identified on topographic maps the night before
field survey; however, actual field conditions dictated the intensity of shovel testing on specific
landforms. Well-defined topographic features thought to have a high probability for site
occurrence were subjected to multiple tests.
In some areas, where small (e.g., 20-m diameter) landform features were encountered,
two tests on the landform would usually be conducted since the feature was too small to
accommodate additional testing. Broad, upland flat areas of little or no topographic relief were
routinely, but less intensively, shovel tested. Typically these areas were crossed while proceeding
to areas thought to have a higher probability for site occurrence. Shovel testing in these areas was
designed more to locate early historic sites known to have been in the study area. The locations
of these historic sites were derived from studying historic maps pertinent to the study area. Other
shovel tests, however, were placed in other areas away from suspected historic sites to check for
prehistoric materials. Survey over the few flat floodplain areas was conducted similarly to the flat
upland survey.
The survey crew was equipped with screens and shovels for each member. All screens
were constructed of 1/4-inch hardware cloth and fill was screened in 10-cm thick levels from each
test excavated. During the course of survey, no attempt was made to mark or delineate the
location of each excavated shovel test. This was not the intent at the onset of the project.
However, it was quickly realized that plotting many hundreds of shovel tests on appropriate USGS
quadrangle maps or even maps of a larger scale (e.g., 1 inch to 400 ft) was inefficient and
redundant. Because of this problem, it was decided that only one test from a cluster of tests not

I 0723/880206

81

'!

associated with an archaeological site would be placed on an appropriate USGS map and described.
This was done only if a cluster of tests on a given land form were similar. If one test out of three
tests, for example, was clearly different with respect to some variable (e.g., soil color, texture,
depth or other feature noted in the field), all shovel tests for that area were recorded.
For the purpose of this report, a site is defined as the location of a significant event,
a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined,
or vanished, where the location itself maintains an historical or archaeological value regardless of
the value of any existing structures (Derry et al. 1977).
When a site was located, either prehistoric or historic, several field procedures were
enacted. For all sites, an attempt was made to define, both vertically and horizontally, the site
boundaries. The entire crew was brought to a site for scrutiny of the ground surface, later
identified in this report as intensive survey of the site area. At least one screened shovel test was
placed on all sites to determine the depth of the cultural remains, if any, and to determine the
nature of the soil and search for deeply buried cultural remains. Other shovel tests were
conducted as needed to aid in the determination of site size, if horizontal artifact distribution alone
was not sufficient. Each shovel test placed on a site was logged on a shovel test form which
describes soils observed and materials recovered. Shovel tests were not conducted on cemeteries,
nor in the yards of occupied residences.
Site forms for each site were completed, including key vegetation types, topography,
nearby water source, agents of disturbance (e.g., roads, powerlines, etc.), artifacts observed, and
other site data deemed appropriate. Photographs were taken of each site. Six of the seven
prehistoric sites which had been previously recorded in the study area were relocated using site
maps and site descriptions. Shovel tests were implemented to discover the present extent of each
site and site forms were updated. The remaining one site was located on property immediately
outside the study area, for which access could not be obtained for the present survey.
A vehicular historic structure survey of the study area was conducted by the project
historian preceding the actual pedestrian survey. During this structure survey, an evaluation of all
standing structures (mostly residences) in the study area that appeared to have been built before
1945 was made in regards to the age, architecture, condition, and potential eligibility to the NRHP.
This year was used as a cutoff date to allow flexibility in the 50-year age requirement for evaluation
of possible National Register designations, thereby reducing the possibility for additional field work
in later years. As each structure was identified and photographed, its location was plotted on a
quadrangle map, and a brief physical description, an estimated construction date and an assessment
of its architectural merit were recorded. The project historian then completed site forms for each
plotted structure.
Shovel tests were conducted to locate former structures shown on maps; however, they
were not placed in the yards of occupied inhabited residences identified as historic sites. In these
cases tests were usually placed in fields surrounding the occupied residences. In most of these
cases a yard area between 0.2 and 0.4 ha was not shovel tested. While in the field, reference was
made to a 1910 soils map (Figure 16) and a 1936 highway map (Figure 17). Both maps showed
extant structures and were used to locate historic sites by plotting their locations on current

10723/880206

82

10

quadrangle maps. Where evidence of these structures was found, the location was labeled as a site
and a site form was completed.
Concurrent with field investigations, the project historian also undertook archival and
deed research on ca. 1910 or earlier historic sites and on other selected historic sites that, in the
opinion of the investigators, required supplemental information to aid in National Register
eligibility determination. Historic sites located on the 1936 map (Figure 17) but not on the 1910
map (Figure 16) were not routinely subjected to archival research. This is because it was thought
that such data would provide little or no information pertinent to a better understanding of second
to third quarter twentieth-century life.
Deed, probate, and tax records were examined at the Titus County Courthouse. In
addition, oral interviews with local residents proved extremely helpful in documenting a site's (and
area's) history and development. A variety of repositories in Austin were also examined, including
files at the General Land Office; tax, school, and census records at the State library; marker files
at the THC; and historic maps and county histories available at the Barker Texas History Center
and State Archives.
LABORATORY ANALYSIS
All artifacts recovered in shovel tests and temporally diagnostic artifacts observed on
the site surface were collected from sites in the study area during the survey. These were brought
back to the EH&A archaeology lab for analysis. Non-diagnostic artifacts observed on the surface
were identified, tallied, and left at the site. Each artifact is classified by categories: debitage, tools,
and modified debitage; ceramic, floral and faunal material; burned rock; and historic artifacts.
Debitage is residual lithic material resulting from tool manufacturing. Debitage usually
represents the residue from tool manufacture and may be broken down into flakes, chips, and
angular chunks. Flakes are pieces of debitage that exhibit all or portions of the striking platform
and bulb of percussion. Chips are fragments of flakes that exhibit no platform or bulk of
percussion. Angular chunks, as defined by Kotter and Nance, are "miscellaneous blocky debitage
with no recognizable flaking features" (1980:46).
The category of tools and modified debitage includes projectile points, bifaces,
unifaces, preforms, and modified debitage. Modified debitage consists of flakes and chips which
exhibit minute edge-wear patterns and/or polish which may be the result of use as a tool or
deliberate minute thinning of very small flakes along one or more edges.
The ceramic materials encountered during this survey consist of fragments of ceramic
vessels. These may exhibit some decoration or slip on the surface. The clay is usually tempered
with grog, and/or bone and then fired to make it durable.
Floral and faunal materials consist of plant or animal remains that may be found on
a site. Charcoal, seed fragments, bone, and antler all fall under this category.
Burned rock in this region is usually considered as quartzite or chert cobbles or cobble
fragments that exhibit signs of heat stress. This may be manifested in the form of discolorations,

10723/880206

83

cracks or crazed angular breaks, or pot-lidding of the material. Burned rock is often indicative of
a campsite or camp area.

LOCAL INFORMANTS
Landowners in the vicinity of the study area were interviewed for their knowledge of
prehistoric sites. These include Mr. Alvin Hinson, Mr. and Mrs. Horace Thompson, and Mr. Bill
Anderson.
Mr. Hinson provided his collection of approximately 110 projectile points (viewed
through glass) from the Tankersley Lake area for the field crew's inspection. Collected over several
years, specific locations are not known for individual artifacts. These projectile points cover a wide
time range with the predominant point type being Gary, the occurrence of which extended from
the Middle to Late Archaic. Other point types in the Hinson collection include Wells (Early
Archaic), Perdiz and Talco (Late Caddoan). One point of this collection is a possible paleo-point,
somewhat representative of the San Patrice type with a concave fluted base and weak shoulders.
Mr. and Mrs. Horace Thompson were knowledgeable about a Caddo ceramic site
(41 TT56) on their property in the East Piney Creek drainage basin. They displayed their collection
of ceramic sherds from previously recorded Site 41 TT56, which included both plainware and
decorated ceramic, although no piece was large enough to type.
An interview with Mr. Bill Anderson of Argo, Texas provided information about a
large Archaic to Caddo occupation site located north of the study area along East Piney Creek.
He did not provide a site location and did not know of any sites within the study area.
GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL METHODS
The geoarcheological investigations undertaken at the B-2 study area sought to assess
the depositional nature of upland and floodplain sediments in the area, in order to determine the
likelihood of these deposits containing buried cultural resources. The completion of this task
involved mechanical excavation of backhoe trenches as well as examination of exposed strata. The
fieldwork was augmented by data compiled during the on-the-ground cultural resources survey,
existing drilled core data and geomorphological literature pertinent to the area.
The uplands were examined with the intention of determining whether a mantle of
sandy sediments exists in the area which might harbor buried sites. A review of data compiled
from approximately 455 shovel tests during the archeological survey provided a useful tool in
assessing sand thickness in relation to topographic position. The profiles obtained at four
mechanically excavated backhoe trenches provided additional information on the nature of the
upland deposits.
The floodplains of Piney and East Piney creeks were studied with the intention of
determining the effect of deforestation and subsequent erosion, as well as overbank alluviation.
At both these areas backhoe trenches and exposed strata were observed.

For each locale, a profile was constructed utilizing standard soil horizon descriptions.
Representative samples of each horizon or zone were removed for laboratory analysis. This
analysis consisted of granulametric study. Coarser sediments (sands) were separated using a dry
sieve technique while the finer fraction (silt and clay) were analyzed with a hydrometer. The data
was presented graphically through histograms and log probability charts.
SITE ASSESSMENTS
The historic context of the study area has been established in the preceding chapters.
Prehistoric sites are assessed on the basis of their potential to provide significant information
concerning area or regional history under criterion D for eligibility to the NRHP. Previous
investigations in the area indicate that two kinds of sites have a high research potential--singlecomponent sites and multiple-component sites with intact features. The potential of multiplecomponent sites is limited by the displacement of artifacts within unconsolidated sandy soils, which
tends to mix the remains of several occupations. If the context of associated artifactual materials
in a multi-component site has not been completely destroyed; however, features and/or cultural
stratigraphy could be dated and statements made about changes through time. At single
component sites, the remains represent a single occupation regardless of their vertical provenience.
Subsequently, the research potential is little affected by site integrity.
The potential of burned rock and/or rock hearths to date occupations or provide
seasonality/subsistence data provides opportunities for applied research pertinent to National
Register eligibility. A high research potential would also be indicated if multiple components could
be stratigraphically separated and dated by an analysis of burned rock.
Although there are a number of problems that are inherent to lithic scatters, data
from lithic scatters is essential to an understanding of area history. The majority of lithic scatters
contain very sparse remains. The lack of variability in: chipped lithic artifacts from sites severely
limits interpretations except at sites with numerous materials. A high research potential would be
indicated by the identification of abundant or varied features, and/or vertical stratification of
artifactual materials. The recovery of tools, other evidence of flake tool use and/or other kinds
of cultural materials (other than lithic debitage) would also substantially increase research
potential.
Regardless of the number of components at a site, the nature and abundance of
cultural materials is a major factor in the assessment of research potential. At many lithic scatter
sites, tools are too few in number and debitage does not exhibit sufficient variability to provide
significant information except where remains are relatively abundant. As a general rule sites with
a low artifact density, defined as two or less artifacts per positive shovel test, are thought to have
a low research potential, even if only a single occupation is represented. Sites of moderate artifact
density (3 to 5 artifacts per positive shovel test) and high density (6-plus artifacts per positive
shovel test) are more likely to yield information pertinent to research potential. At many lithic
scatter sites, however, regardless of artifact density, tools are few in number(if any) and debitage
does not exhibit variability in terms of manufacture or material to provide potentially significant
information.

10723/880206

85

The thickness of the sand mantle in the uplands may be used as a gauge to test for
buried sites. Based upon shovel testing and other geomorphological data, thick (1 m or more)
sandy surface sediments are rare, and, by virtue of their depth, may have the potential to contain
deeply buried cultural components.
The historic sites are also assessed on the basis of their potential to provide significant
information concerning area or regional history under criteria A-D. It is felt that the research
potential of house sites under these criteria are primarily determined by the ability to provide
detailed data concerning the lives of the inhabitants. Especially at sites dating to the twentieth
century, historic research and/or oral documentation are usually sufficient, together with survey
data, to document more general types of data at domestic sites. Cultural deposits and other
remains associated with house sites are felt to have a high research potential only if they define
the physical organization of the homestead, as well as provide an understanding of the everyday
lives of the occupants. Other kinds of data--span of occupation, socioeconomic or racial groups
represented, changes in land use and settlement, etc.--can be derived more efficiently and
completely from other sources of information.
Site assessments will also take into account the issue of redundancy. If a research
question can be answered by one or more sites, the selection of multiple sites to test for National
Register eligibility against a particular question creates a point of diminishing returns.
Sites may be considered redundant when no new information may be obtained, and
when either the cultural patterns of the study area corroborate with regional studies, or when
cultural patterns have been established within the study area itself. If several sites in the area are
each able to answer the research question(s), then the one(s) with the best potential data will be
chosen to avoid redundancy. The "best potential data" should be qualified in relationship to the
integrity and preservation of the sites. The depth of deposit and the separation of components are
crucial to determining this integrity and preservation.

VI: FIELD SURVEY
FACTORS AFFECTING THE SURVEY
The problems encountered during the course of the survey were minor, such as small
delays due to inclement weather. Approximately 530 ha within the study area were not subjected
to a cultural resources survey because land access could not be obtained. Figure A-1 documents
the areas not surveyed. Approximately 140 ha of other land were not surveyed because the area,
located along Tankersley Creek, was subjected to intensive survey in 1985 by personnel from
EH&A (Glander et al. 1986a) (Figure A-1). As discussed in Chapter N of this report, three sites
and an isolated find were located, and all three sites were determined by the THC as ineligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
SITE DESCRIPTIONS
This section describes the sites recorded during the survey. There are two gaps in the
newly recorded site sequence. Site numbers 41TT546 and 41TT557-570 were given to another
person requesting trinomial numbers.
Site 41TT367
Background Data
Site 41TT367 is a prehistoric site located on the upland interfluve of two intermittent
drainages flowing southeast into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source
is one of the intermittent drainages approximately 150 m west of the site. The site gently slopes
to the west and east towards the drainages with slightly less slope towards the south. Erosion is
evident on the edges of the interfluve, due in part to historic cultivation and ranching practices.
At present, this site lies in open improved pasture with bermudagrass the dominant vegetation
type. Rodent activity is indicated by the presence of burrows on the surface. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of the site is about 123 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
recovered in the first shovel test placed on the site location. An intensive surface survey was
conducted and three additional shovel tests were excavated to assess the integrity of the site and
to determine site boundaries. No other artifacts were observed and no features were visible in the
shovel tests. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a loamy fine sand with clayey sand beginning at
approximately 55 cm below the ground surface. The site size is estimated to be 10 m or less in
diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A tertiary quartzite flake was recovered from
Shovel Test 1, Level 4 (30-40 cm). No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed.

10723/880206

87

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT367, is an isolated prehistoric artifact found in an upland setting. The
closest water source is an intermittent drainage flowing into Tankersley Creek, approximately
150 m from the site. This site is of undetermined temporal affiliation, since no temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed on the surface or in the four shovel tests. Historic cultivation
has heavily disturbed the upper 20 cm of the soil profile. Bioturbation and erosion associated with
historic agricultural practices have also impacted the site location. Little information would be
realized by further investigation on the site because low density lithic scatters with no lithic
variability offer little opportunity to address research concerns discussed in Chapter V. It is the
opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and that it is not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT368
Background Data
Site 41TT368 is a prehistoric site located on the same interfluve as 41TT367
(Figure A-1). This site, however, is located near the distal end of the interfluve, some 300 m
south-southwest of 41 TT367 and overlooks the fairly broad floodplain at the confluence of the two
intermittent drainages. The nearest natural water source is one of the intermittent drainages
approximately 50 m to the west of the site. The site gently slopes to the west and south, and, at
present, lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture, which connotes historic clearing and
cultivation. The ground surface visibility is very poor, less than five percent, with soil visible only
in the rodent burrow tailings. The elevation of this site is 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. An intensive surface survey and
a total of three shovel tests were conducted on the site to aid in site assessment and determine site
boundaries. A total of four artifacts was observed at the site: two pieces of lithic debitage in the
shovel tests and two pieces of lithic debitage from the surface survey. No cultural features were
observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a loamy fine sand changing to a hard clayey sand
at about 60 to 70 cm below the surface. Positive shovel tests (artifact-bearing tests) and surface
artifacts suggest a site size of 30 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of four artifacts was observed on the site. A large secondary quartzite flake
and a tertiary quartzite flake were found in rodent burrow tailings. Shovel Test 1, Level 3 (2030 cm) yielded one possibly burned quartzite rock. Shovel Test 2 yielded one tertiary quartzite
flake in Level 4 (30-40 cm). None of these artifacts are temporally diagnostic.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT368, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on the distal end
of an interfluve overlooking the fairly broad floodplain at the confluence of two drainages. Due

10723/880206

88

1(

to the sparse artifacts, no specific activity can be assigned to the site, although lithic reduction may
be implied by the assemblage prese11t. The lack of diagnostic artifacts precludes a date of
occupation. Historic cultivation has heavily disturbed the upper 20 cm of the soil profile, and
bioturbation has severely impacted the integrity of the complete soil profile. Due to the paucity
of cultural materials and the amount of disturbance observed on the site, it is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeological consultants that this low-density lithic scatter possesses little research
potential, that it has been sufficiently documented, and that it is not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT369
Background Data
Site 41 TT369 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of a probable old alluvial terrace
of Tankersley Creek on the south side of the confluence of Tankersley Creek and a small
intermittent drainage (Figure A-1). Tankersley Creek is the closest natural water source at
present, approximately 50 m to the east of the site. The site lies in open improved pasture with
bermudagrass the dominant vegetation. Ground surface visibility is poor at about 10 percent. The
elevation of the site is approximately 115 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. Two pieces of lithic debitage were
recovered in the first shovel test placed on the site location. An intensive surface survey was
performed and four additional shovel tests were excavated to better assess the site. No features
and no other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a thin layer (less than
25 cm) of loamy sand over a clayey sand layer. The site size, based on the shovel tests and the
local topography, is estimated to be approximately 10 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were observed on the site. One tertiary chert flake and one angular
petrified wood chunk were recovered in Shovel Test 1, Level 1 (0-10 cm). Neither of these is
diagnostic.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT369, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on the edge of a
probable old alluvial terrace on the bank of Tankersley Creek. This site is of undetermined
temporal affiliation since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either on the surface of
the site or in the five shovel tests placed on the site. The artifacts were all observed within the
first 10 cm of the soil profile. The landowner informed the field personnel that the land was
cultivated in cotton for many years before pasture grasses were planted (A Hinson 1987). As a
result, historic cultivation has heavily impacted the site, disturbing much of the A horizon that
frequently bears cultural deposits. Due to the disturbances caused by artificial impacts, it is
unlikely that the artifacts recovered from this low-density lithic scatter are in their original

10723/880206

89

provenience. In the opinion of the EH&A's archaeologists, Site 41TT369 has been sufficiently
documented and it is not considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT370
Background Data
Site 41TT370 is another prehistoric site located just northwest of 41TT369 along the
terrace above Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). Located on the distal end of a ridge overlooking
the floodplain of Tankersley Creek, this site is situated on the west side of the creek, north of the
confluence of Tankersley Creek and a small intermittent drainage flowing west into the creek. At
present, the nearest natural water source is Tankersley Creek, 125 m east of the site. The site lies
in open bermudagrass pasture with a topography that gently slopes to the south, east and north.
The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of this site is approximately
118 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. Shovel Test 1 yielded lithic
debitage in levels 4, 7, and 8. An intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests were
conducted. The second shovel test yielded debitage in levels 5 and 7. No features were observed
in the shovel tests and no artifacts were observed on the surface due to the dense grass growth.
The soil is a sandy loam becoming more silty at about 50 cm below the surface. Clay is found
more than 1 m below the surface. Shovel testing and the topography suggest a site size of 20 x
30m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of five artifacts was recovered from the site in the shovel tests. Shovel Test
1 yielded one corticate angular quartzite chunk in Level 4 (30-40 cm), one decorticate quartzite
chip in Level 7 (60-70 cm), and one corticate quartzite chip in Level 8 (70-80 cm). Shovel Test
2 yielded one decorticate quartzite chip in Level 5 (40-50 cm) and one tertiary chert flake in Level
7 (60-70 cm). None of these artifacts are temporally diagnostic.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT370, is a buried, moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter along the
remnant terrace system of Tankersley Creek. Due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts,
a date of occupation may not be determined at this time. The function of the site is undefined,
although lithic reduction may be implied by the assemblage present. This site is more similar to
41TT369 than previously recorded sites 41TT154 or 41TT155, due to the absence of ceramic
materials. Unlike 41 TT369, however, this site appears to be a deeply buried site with an ephemeral
deposit of artifacts in levels 4 and 5 (30-50 cm) and levels 7 and 8 (60-80 cm). The soil is also very
deep with clayey soil more than 1 m below the surface. It is possible that a more deeply buried,
and therefore older, component below 80 cm exists; however, the field survey could not investigate
to this depth. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, if this site is to be impacted, testing

10723/880206

90

should be implemented to determine the presence of an older, more deeply buried component,
and to possibly shed light on the Archaic way of life.
Site 41TT371
Background Data
Site 41 TT371 is a prehistoric site located on the artificially terraced slope of a
ridgeline overlooking Tankersley Creek to the south and west (Figure A-1). The ridgeline is
dissected by various small, shallow erosional cuts forming a hillocky terrain. The site is located on
one hillock. The nearest natural water source is Tankersley Creek 125 m southwest of the site.
The site gently slopes, predominantly to the southwest, and at present, lies in open improved
bermudagrass pasture. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the site elevation
is approximately 117 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
recovered in the first shovel test placed on the location of the site. An intensive surface survey was
performed and three additional shovel tests were excavated to assess the site and to determine the
site boundaries. No other artifacts were observed either on the site or in the additional shovel
tests. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a shallow sandy clay loam with sandy clay about 15 cm
below ground surface. Conversation with the landowner revealed that this property was cultivated
in cotton for many years (A. Hinson 1987). The high clay content in the shallow soil profile seems
typical of a plow zone soil. Shovel testing showed the site size to be less than 1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Only one artifact was observed in four shovel tests on this site. One tertiary quartzite
flake was recovered from Shovel Test 1, Level 1 (0-10 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT371, is an isolated artifact. It is of undetermined temporal affiliation
since no diagnostic artifacts were observed on the surface or in the four shovel tests. Historic
cultivation has heavily impacted the integrity of the site as evidenced by the mixing of clay and sand
in the shallow soil horizon. This low artifact density site has a low research potential when
addressing concerns of the research design. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site has
been sufficiently documented and is not considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT372
Background Data
Site 41 TT372 is a multi-component prehistoric and historic site located on two ridges
along the west side of Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The creek cuts into the ridges on the west
side of the site, where, according to the owner, there are two springs (Hinson 1987). The springs

10723/880206

91

were not flowing during the survey. At present, this site lies in open improved bermudagrass
pasture, with erosion especially evident on the northern ridge. Oak, sweetgum, and elm are
present along the creek and tributary drainages below the site. The ground surface visibility is
generally very poor at 0 to 10 percent, although there are several eroded areas on the northern
ridge where the visibility is improved. The elevation of the site is 113-122 m msl. No structures
are indicated on either the 1910 soil survey map or the 1936 county highway map in this location.
A two-room, board-and-batten, balloon-frame, shotgun-type house (Figure 19) was also
observed at the northeast edge of the site. It exhibits a low-pitched, front-gable roof with exposed
common rafters and roof beams. The entire structure rests on oak piers. There is an interior
brick chimney that was used for wood stove ventilation. According to the owner, the house was
built in 1926 for the farmhands when the property was cultivated in cotton. Mr. Hinson also said
that the house at one time had a front porch which has since fallen down and been removed
(Hinson 1987). The construction is predominantly of full-dimension lumber and wire nails with
a corrugated-tin roof. At present, the structure is abandoned, although it has most recently been
used for hay storage.
Testing Program
A total of ten shovel tests was excavated on this site, eight of which were culturally
positive. An intensive surface survey was also conducted, which resulted in the observation of lithic
debitage and prehistoric ceramic fragments eroding out of the northern ridge of the site. Two
shovel tests around the structure yielded several historic artifacts in Level 2 (10-20 cm) as well as
prehistoric artifacts including lithic debitage, ceramic, and fire-cracked rock.
Shovel tests showed the soil to be a brown loamy sand of varying depths. In general,
the soil is approximately 40 to 50 cm deep on the lower reaches of the site and becomes steadily
shallower further up the hill. At the top of the hill, east of the house, however, the soil is again
approximately 50 cm deep. This variable soil depth may be attributable to slope wash, intensified
by historic cultivation practices. The site size is estimated to be 100 x 150 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 25 artifacts was recovered from the eight culturally positive shovel tests.
The artifacts and their proveniences are presented in Table 9 and the distribution of artifacts
within the shovel tests is illustrated in Table 10.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT372, is a multi-component site with a prehistoric occupation and an
historic house. The closest water source is Tankersley Creek on the western edge of the site
where two springs are located, although they were not readily visible at the time of the survey.
According to the owner, the house, typical of the decades between the 1910s and the 1930s, was
built in 1926 for the farmhands while the property was being cultivated in cotton (A Hinson 1987).
The high artifact density prehistoric component dates to the Caddoan Stage and
possibly earlier, although no earlier diagnostic artifacts were recovered during the survey. The

quantity of artifacts and the extensive site size suggest that this site may be a multi-component
prehistoric site. It is similar to Site 41 TT154, approximately 500 m downstream, and is likely
affiliated with nearby 41 TT376. Further testing is recommended to determine the number of
components, to possibly shed light on the Caddo inhabitants of the Tankersley Creek area, and to
determine the eligibility of the prehistoric components for potential nomination to the NRHP. The
historic component possibly represents a seasonal habitation site, occupied by field hands while
working the land. Although the structure is over 50 years old, it is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that the architecture is not significant enough to fulfill criterion C of the National
Register, and that it also does not meet criteria A or B of the National Register.
Site 41TT373
Background Data
Site 41 TT373 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of the uplands overlooking the
confluence of Tankersley Creek and an unnamed intermittent drainage west of the site which flows
into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is the intermittent drainage
approximately 100 m from the site. The landform that this site is situated on is composed of two
hillocks, probably formed by the differential erosion of portions of the present landform. The
centers of these two hillocks lie approximately 60 m apart. Site 41 TT373 lies on the southern
hillock and Site 41 TT375 lies on the northern hillock. At present, the site is in open improved
bermudagrass pasture. The ground surface visibility is very poor with less than five percent
exposed. The elevation of the site is 118-119 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. Lithic debitage and fire-cracked
rock were recovered in Shovel Test 1 from levels 2 through 5. Two additional shovel tests and an
intensive surface survey were conducted after the site was found. No artifacts were observed on
the surface. Debitage, however, was recovered from Shovel Test 2, Level 4. Shovel testing showed
the soil to be a brown sandy loam over sandy clay, which was encountered approximately 50-60 cm
below the ground surface. The three shovel tests and the topography indicate a site size of 60 x
30m.
Artifact Analysis
Two of the three shovel tests excavated were culturally positive. The artifact
assemblage is presented in Table 11 and the distribution of artifacts within shovel tests is shown
in Table 12. A total of 12 artifacts was recovered from the site. The presence of fire-cracked rock
may indicate a hearth location.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT373, is a buried prehistoric moderate-density lithic scatter with firecracked rock, indicating a possible campsite, along the Tankersley Creek drainage system. Due
to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, the temporal affiliation of the site cannot be
determined at this time. This site seems to be similar to 41 TT375 except for the presence of a

greater number of artifacts. The two sites do not appear to be contiguous since no cultural
materials were found between them. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site,
coupled with other sites in the area (41TT370 and 41TT372), might yield information pertinent
to the understanding of prehistoric settlement in the upper Tankersley Creek drainage area.
Specific topics to be addressed by this site would include: 1) the relationship, if any, of small sites
to large, nearby campsites and 2) dating of the site to determine whether or not this site can
answer questions about seasonal and short-term settlements. Therefore, if impacted, controlled
test excavations are recommended to determine the eligibility status of this site for inclusion on
the NRHP.
Site 41 TT374
Background Data
Site 41 TT374 is a prehistoric upland site located in a small stand of pine trees on the
edge of a small intermittent drainage flowing southwest into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is Tankersley Creek, 175 m to the southwest of the site, although the
landowner reported a spring approximately 125 m southwest of the site on the small intermittent
drainage (Hinson 1987). This spring was not flowing at the time of the survey. The site slopes
to the south towards the intermittent drainage, and artificial terracing is evident. At present, this
site lies in a small stand of planted pines. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent
due to leaf litter, and the elevation of the site is 120 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
recovered in Shovel Test 1. Despite an intensive surface survey and three additional shovel tests,
no other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a thin layer (5-20 cm) of
sandy loam over clay. The site size was determined, based on the single artifact, to be less than
1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A tertiary quartzite flake was recovered from
Shovel Test 1, Level 2 (10-20 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT374, is an isolated prehistoric artifact. Historic cultivation, as evidenced
by the artificial terraces, has greatly disturbed the integrity of the site area. Due to the paucity
of cultural materials and the site disturbance, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that the
site is sufficiently documented and is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41TT375
Background Data
Site 41TT375 is one of two prehistoric sites (the other is 41TT373) located on the
edge of the uplands overlooking the confluence of Tankersley Creek and an unnamed intermittent
drainage located 75 m west of the site which flows into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The
landform on which this site lies is composed of two erosional hillocks, the center of which are
approximately 60 m apart. Site 41 TT375 lies on the northern hillock while Site 41 TT373 lies on
the southern hillock. At present, this site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture. The ground
surface visibility is less than five percent with the soil visible only in the occasional rodent burrow
tailings. The elevation of the site is 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing the hillock. Shovel Test 2 yielded
cultural materials in levels 3, 5, and 6. Two additional shovel tests and an intensive surface survey
were conducted, but no artifacts were visible in the additional shovel tests or on the surface. The
shovel tests showed the soil to be a sandy loam about 90 cm deep overlying clay. The three shovel
tests and the topography indicate a site size of 20 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts was recovered from the site. Shovel Test 2 yielded one
decorticate chert chip in Level 3 (20-30 cm), one secondary quartzite flake in Level 5 (40-50 cm),
and one quartzite fire-cracked rock in Level 6 (50-60 cm). Table 12 shows the artifact distribution
on the site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT375, is a buried, minimally moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter
with fire-cracked rock, suggesting a possible campsite, along the Tankersley Creek drainage system.
Due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, the temporal affiliation of this site cannot be
determined at this time. The site seems to be similar to 41 TT373, except for the presence of fewer
artifacts at 41 TT375 than 41 TT373. As previously stated, the two sites are not contiguous. The
paucity of cultural materials at this site as well as the lack of any distinct cultural horizon lead to
the conclusion that this site is highly dispersed throughout the soil profile. Bioturbation by rodents
also has contributed to the dispersion. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site possesses
minimal research potential and probable data redundancy when compared against other similar
sites recommended for archaeological testing in the immediate area (41 TT370, 41 TT372, and
41TT373). EH&A does not recommend this site for further investigation or for nomination to the
NRHP.

Site 41TT376
Background Data
Site 41 TT376 is an upland prehistoric site, the west edge of which is located about
200 m east of Tankersley Creek, the nearest observed natural water source (Figure A-1). The site
slopes to the west and lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture. The ground surface visibility
is less than five percent, with the soil visible only in the occasional rodent burrow tailing and in
a dirt field road that is present on the west side of the site. The elevation of the site, which lies
on two property tracts, is greater than 122 m msl.
The site was originally recorded during the 1987 field season. At that time, access was
only available on the western edge of the site. The land owner, Alvin Hinson (1987), indicated
that the site extended some 150 m east of the field road, to the top of the hill. This would place
the eastern edge of the site near previously recorded Site 41TT157. Recorded by SMU in 1971
(McCormick 1973), 41TT157 was reported to be a possible permanent village with little integrity
remaining (site form on file at TARL). During the 1987 investigations, it could not be determined
if these two sites were connected since access to the tracts of land east of Mr. Hinson's property
had been denied.
Testing Program
The site was first observed as several pieces of lithic debitage in the pasture road.
This road runs along the east side of the property belonging to Mr. Hinson. The adjacent property
to the east was not accessible at the time of the original EH&A survey. Conversation with Mr.
Hinson led to the conclusion that the site extends to the top of the hill some 150 m to the east of
the field road (Hinson 1987). The soil is very shallow on the far west side of the site, where
orange clay is visible in the field road.
The site was revisited when access was obtained to the tract adjacent to the west edge
of the site during the 1989 field season. At the same time, 41TT157 was revisited. Alvin Hinson
(1987) had stated that he had recovered cultural materials from the whole hilltop. As a
consequence, the EH&A crew placed a total of 16 shovel tests over the entire area, spanning the
distance between the two sites. All were negative. The soil is a brown sandy soil that extends 4050 cm to an orange clayey soil in most areas. An intensive surface survey was also conducted.
One ceramic sherd was collected from the eastern edge of the hilltop, north of where Site 41 TT157
is indicated on the T ARL topographic maps. Also, one secondary flake, one tertiary flake, and one
fire-cracked rock (all of quartzite) were observed scattered over the west slope of the hilltop.
Artifact Analysis
Only one artifact was collected from Site 41 TT376. A grog-tempered plainware body
sherd was collected from the surface near the upland edge on the east side of the topographic
feature. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were noted, although Mr. Hinson reported
collecting projectile points from the site. These projectile points were destroyed in a fire at a
county fair exhibition when he was a young man (Hinson 1987).

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT376 is a low-density upland prehistoric site located in the Tankersley Creek
drainage area. The temporal affiliation of this site may not be determined at this time due to the
lack of diagnostic artifacts. During the course of the survey, it was originally thought that this site
covered a larger area than was observed. Indeed, historically, this may have been the case (Hinson
1987, McCormick 1973). According to the landowner and previous investigations, the site extended
across the hilltop. Presently, however, cultural material in any abundance was only found on the
western side of the hill slope. No artifacts were found in the vicinity of 41 TT157 and only widely
scattered artifacts were noted on the surface of Site 41 TT376. No indications were observed of
McCormick's (1973) "chipping or workshop area on southeast section of site" or his "domestic or
cooking area on western area".
It is possible that this site and 41 TT157 were at one time a single site. Presently too
few artifacts remain to make a definite determination. The lack of subsurface artifacts and the
sparse surface artifacts negate any research potential the site may have had. It is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and that it should not be
recommended for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41TT377
Background Data
Site 41TT377 is an historic artifact scatter located west of County Road NW-12 on the
edge of the uplands overlooking an intermittent tributary of Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The
site is artificially terraced and the surface is heavily eroded. Subsurface clay is exposed over much
of the area. On top of the hill is a modern house. The nearest natural water source is the
intermittent drainage approximately 250 m west of the site. At present, the site lies in open
bermudagrass pasture with a ground surface visibility of less than 25 percent. The elevation of the
site is 122-126 m msl. A structure is indicated in this location on the 1936 county highway map
(Figure 17), but not on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
Testing Program
This site was first located when historic debris was observed in erosional gullies
present on the site. The surface scatter consists primarily of bricks, although stoneware and glass
were also observed on the surface. A total of two shovel tests was excavated, one of which proved
culturally positive. The top soil, or A horizon, is very shallow (less than 10 cm) and is mixed with
the more clayey B horizon as a result of terracing and cultivation. The surface scatter indicates
a site size of 30 x 40 m. No wells or other features were observed.
Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts were collected from the shovel tests. These included one
ten-penny wire nail, one window-glass fragment, and one red machine-made brick fragment all
found less than 10 cm below ground surface. Other artifacts noted on the surface included
machine-made orange brick, "PALMER" brick, and brick with fire-glazing. At present, these bricks

10723/880206

102

seem to be used for erosion control. Various stoneware and whiteware fragments were observed,
including pieces of Chinese-patterned porcelain transferware.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT377, is a moderate-density historic scatter located on the slope of an
upland hillmass. The artifacts are both domestic (stoneware, etc.) and structural (brick, etc.), but
appear to have been brought into the area for erosion control, possibly bulldozed from the top of
the hill where a modern house stands at present. The 1936 County highway map shows a structure
at the location of the modern house and the apparently displaced artifactual material supports an
occupation time period from the second quarter of this century. This site does not appear to be
of sufficient antiquity to address nineteenth-century settlement research questions raised in the
research design. Because of this and because none of this site remains intact, it is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that the site has been sufficiently documented and that it does not meet
the eligibility requirements for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT378
Background Data
Site 41 TT378 is a multi-component site located on the interfluve between two major
tributaries of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The site is situated in the uplands on the west side of a
blacktop road and on the eastern edge of the head of a minor intermittent drainage. The nearest
natural water source at the time of the survey was this minor tributary with small amounts of water
available approximately 75 m southwest of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved
pasture with bermudagrass and croton. The ground surface visibility is good at 20 to 50 percent,
although no rodent burrowing is evident. The elevation of the site is estimated to be 128 m msl.
An historic structure and the blacktop road are indicated on the 1936 county highway map
(Figure 17) but not on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
Testing Program
The site was located when an ephemeral scatter of window glass and bottle glass was
observed on the surface. Further ground surface survey yielded one projectile point and one
specimen of bifacially worked debitage. A total of six shovel tests were excavated in the site area.
Only one was positive. Shovel Test 1 yielded glass in Level 1 (0-10 cm). The soil is a light brown
sand overlying a reddish brown clayey horizon that begins approximately 20 to 25 cm below the
surface. Shovel tests and surface materials suggest a site size of 60 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of two artifacts were collected from the site. One dart point was recovered
from the surface and one manganese solarized glass fragment was collected from Level 1 (0-10 cm)
of Shovel Test 1.
The dart point is a Gary. Manufactured of a very poor quality rose-brown chert, this
fragment is 4.4 cm long, 3.04 cm wide and 0.78 cm thick. It weighs 8.9 g.

10723/880206

103

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT378, is a multi-component prehistoric and historic scatter. The
prehistoric component is totally surficial and covers the southern portion of the site. Based on the
Gary point recovered from the surface, this component could date from to the Middle to
Transitional Archaic. The historic component is very shallow -- less than 10 cm deep. Based on
the information gathered from the two historic maps (figures 16 and 17), the time period of
construction appears to fall between 1910 and 1936. Virtually nothing remains of either the
historic or the prehistoric component. The ground surface shows evidence of cultivation, which
would have greatly disturbed the integrity of a shallow site like 41 TT378. It is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this site should not be recommended as eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41 TT379
Background Data
Site 41TT379 is a prehistoric site located on a flat area above the confluence of two
intermittent drainages flowing into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water
source is one of the intermittent drainages approximately 30 m east of the site. The site lies on
the edge of an open pasture in a lightly wooded area with sweetgum, elm, oak, and dogwood trees.
Evidence of historic clearing is present on the site. Bermudagrass and other grasses are also
present, reducing the ground surface visibility to less than five percent. The elevation of the site
is 120 m msl.
Testing Program
In addition to a ground surface inspection, five shovel tests were placed on the site.
No artifacts were observed on the surface; however, three of the five shovel tests excavated tested
positive for artifacts. The shovel tests also showed the soil to be a brown loamy sand, about 50 cm
deep, overlying a clayey sand. Based on shovel tests, the site size is estimated to be 40 m in
diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts was recovered from this site. Shovel Test 1, Level 1 (0-10
cm), yielded one corticate chert chip. Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test 3 yielded one corticate
petrified wood chip and from Shovel Test 5, Level 2 (10-20 cm), one decorticate quartzite chip was
collected.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT379, is a shallow, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located at the
confluence of two intermittent drainages. This site is of undetermined temporal affiliation since
no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either on the surface of the site or in the five
shovel tests excavated. The extant woods are second- or third-generation vegetation and historic
clearing has most likely been conducted over the site, impacting the integrity of this shallow site.

10723/880206

104

Although this site could possible be utilized to answer questions about undifferentiated prehistoric
sites, it is unlikely that much information pertaining to the understanding of temporal changes in
prehistoric patterns could be obtained by further investigation. More intact sites such as 41 TT370
and 41TT373 are located in the same drainage areas and information recovered from these sites
is likely to be similar. In the opinion of the EH&A's archaeologists, the site has been sufficiently
documented and is not considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT380
Background Data
Site 41 TT380 is an historic artifact scatter situated on an upland area overlooking a
small intermittent drainage of Tankersley Creek approximately 50 m to the south. This drainage
is the nearest natural water source. At present, the site lies in open improved bermudagrass
pasture. Also present on the site are fig, juniper, crepe myrtle, and irises or daffodils. The ground
surface visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of the site is 127 m msl. Neither the
1910 soil survey map nor the 1936 county highway map depict a structure in this location.
Testing Program
This site was first located when a pile of machine-made red brick was observed on the
surface of the site. The pile is likely a collapsed chimney. Some of the bricks read "CORSICANA
BRICK CO." and it appears that the upper reaches of the chimney toppled to the east of the base.
At present, though, little of this chimney is intact. A total of three shovel tests were excavated,
all of which were culturally positive. Shovel Test 1 was excavated above a presumed septic tank
to a depth of 70 cm, following a vertical sewer pipe through disturbed backfill. The tank was
never reached. The soil everywhere else is a loamy sand over clayey sand encountered at 50-60
cm below the surface. The site size is approximately 40 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
All three shovel tests were culturally positive. Table 13 documents the artifacts
recovered from the site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
No well or intact structural remains were observed on Site 41 TT380, although a
collapsed chimney is present, representing a former house location. Neither the 1936 county
highway map (Figure 17) nor the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) shows a structure in this
location. The artifact assemblage indicates that this house likely dates to post-1936. Because little
of the site remains and the cultural remains are judged by EH&A archaeologists to be barely old
enough to qualify as an archaeological site (50 years or older), EH&A's personnel do not consider
the site to be eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

Background Data
Site 41 TT381 is a prehistoric site located on a small rise on the distal end of a toe
ridge extending into an intermittent drainage of Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). This intermittent
drainage is approximately 75 m to the northeast of the site. The topography of the site gently
slopes to the north, west and south and at present, lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture.
The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent, with the soil visible mainly in the occasional
rodent burrow tailings. The elevation of this site is 118 m msl.
Testing Program
Located by shovel testing, two artifacts were recovered from the first shovel test
placed on the site location. An intensive surface survey and three additional shovel tests were
conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries; however, no other artifacts were
observed. Shovel testing showed the soil profile to be composed of tan sand with clayey sand
beginning at approximately 50 cm below the ground surface. The site size is approximately 5 m
or less in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of two artifacts were recovered from the site. One fire-cracked quartzite rock
was collected from Shovel Test 1, Level 2 (10-20 cm). The same shovel test also yielded one
secondary quartzite flake in Level 3 (20-30 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT381, is a shallow low-density lithic scatter, which, based solely on the
burned rock, may have been a possible campsite. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed
and, due to the paucity of artifacts and the shallow nature of the site in an area that has been
under cultivation for some years, it is felt by consulting personnel that this site does not have
sufficient integrity to yield vital information necessary for better understanding of the prehistoric
sequence in the area. Another site with fire-cracked rock located in this area, 41 TT373, has been
recommended for further work to provide information on undifferentiated campsites. In the
opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site has been sufficiently documented and it does not meet
the requirements of eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT382
Background Data
Site 41 TT382 is a prehistoric site located on a small toe ridge overlooking an
intermittent drainage west of the site which flows south into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). This
landform is one of many such toe ridges formed by erosion along Tankersley Creek. The nearest
natural water source to the site is the intermittent drainage 150 m west of the site. At present,

10723/880206

107

the site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture and the ground surface visibility is less than
five percent. The elevation of the site is 122 m msl.
Testing Program
Located by shovel testing, two pieces of lithic debitage were recovered from the first
shovel test placed on the site. An intensive surface survey and four additional shovel tests were
conducted with no additional cultural materials observed. Shovel testing showed the soil 'of the
site to be a loamy sand with clayey soil beginning about 50 cm below ground surface. In Shovel
Test 1, however, where the artifacts were recovered, the soil is only 30 cm deep. The site size is
estimated to be 5 min diameter, based on shovel tests.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 1. One corticate chert chip was
collected in Level 2 (10-20 cm) and one secondary quartzite flake was collected in Level 3 (20-30
cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41TT382 is a shallow low-density prehistoric lithic scatter, likely representing a
very short-term occupation, based upon the few artifacts found on the site. This site is of
undetermined temporal affiliation since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered either
from the surface or from the five shovel tests excavated on the site. Due to the ephemeral and
shallow nature of the site, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that the site has been
disturbed by historic cultivation practices and that the site would not yield cultural information vital
to the better understanding of the prehistory of the area. Sites like 41 TT370 and 41 TT373 will
likely provide better information. This site should not be considered eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT383
Background Data
Site 41 TT383 is a prehistoric site located on one of the numerous toe ridges along the
Tankersley Creek drainage (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent
drainage which is approximately 120 m west-northwest of the center of the site and flows south
into Tankersley Creek. The site lies on the edge of an open improved bermudagrass pasture on
one of a series of low natural rises or hillocks located on the toe ridge. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of this site is 123 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing a series of hillocks on the toe ridge.
Lithic debitage was recovered from levels 1 and 3 in Shovel Test 1. An intensive surface survey and
an additional four shovel tests were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site
boundaries. No other cultural artifacts were observed. The culturally positive shovel test showed

10723/880206

108

the soil to be a loamy sand with an increasingly high clay content by 70 cm below the surface. The
site size is estimated to be 10 m in diameter, based on the positive shovel tests.
Artifact Analysis
Seven items were recovered from the positive shovel test. Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel
Test 1 yielded one tertiary chert flake and one decorticate chip of petrified wood. Level 3 (20-30
cm) yielded two secondary chert flakes and three charcoal fragments.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT383, is a small, shallow, buried prehistoric lithic scatter located on one
of the numerous toe ridges along the Tankersley Creek drainage. This site is of undetermined
temporal affiliation since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either on the surface or
in the five shovel tests placed on the site. The few cultural materials and the site size indicate an
occupation of short duration, at best, possibly a single component. Because this site is located in
an open field, historic clearing and cultivation have severely impacted the integrity of this shallow
site. Two other sites, 41TT413 and 41 TT505, are considered a better example of a possible singlecomponent site and more likely to yield significant information than 41TT383. In the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists, this small site has been sufficiently documented and cannot yield enough
new information to be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT384
Background Data
Site 41 TT384 is a prehistoric site located on a toe ridge about 70 m east of an
intermittent drainage flowing southwest and south into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). This
intermittent drainage is the nearest natural water source 70 m northwest and west of the site. The
topography gently slopes to the northwest towards the drainage. At present, the site lies in open
improved bermudagrass pasture. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent. The
elevation of the site is approximately 125 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing when one piece of lithic debitage
was recovered in the first shovel test placed on the location of the site. Despite an intensive
surface survey and three additional shovel tests excavated on the site to determine the site
boundaries, no other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil on the site to be a
sandy loam whose clay content sharply increases by 35 cm below the ground surface. The site size
is estimated to be about 1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A decorticate chert chip was recovered from
Shovel Test 1, Level 1 (0-10 cm). No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either on the
surface of the site or in the four shovel tests.

10723/880206

109

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT384, consists of a single shallow isolated prehistoric artifact of
undetermined temporal affiliation. With a depth of less than 10 cm, the site has been disturbed
by clearing and historic cultivation. The research potential for low-density lithic scatters is low,
especially when shallow and disturbed. It is the opinion of EH&A's personnel that this site has
been sufficiently documented and that it should not be considered eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT385
Background Data
Site 41 TT385 is an historic site located on an upland hilltop west of county road NW-4
The nearest natural water source is an unnamed intermittent drainage,
(Figure A-1).
approximately 125 m northwest of the site, which flows into Tankersley Creek. At present, the site
lies in open improved pasture. Mesquite and pokeweed are also present on the site. The ground
surface visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of the site is 132 m msl. No structure
is indicated in the vicinity of this site either on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17) or the
1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
The surface features of the site consist of a barn or large shed (Figure 20) with an
enclosed storage structure on the south end. The shed measures approximately 60 x 24 ft and is
of board-and-batten construction. Modern-dimension milled lumber and wire nails were used. The
roof, which is front gabled, is of corrugated tin. No other structures were noted, although some
cultural debris was observed on the site.
Testing Program
A total of three shovel tests were excavated around the structure, all negative. Shovel
tests showed the soil to be a shallow, sandy soil with clay beginning as shallow as 15 cm below the
ground surface. Based on the negative shovel tests, the extant structure, and the historic debris,
the site size is estimated to be 80 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
No artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. Only a few old tires and some
corrugated tin were noted on the surface.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT385, is an isolated barn on an upland hilltop. Neither house, nor well,
or cistern remains were observed, either in the shovel tests or on the surface. The soil appears
to be very shallow and lacking in cultural horizons. The barn appears neither on the 1910 soil
survey map (Figure 16) nor on the more recent 1936 county highway map (Figure 17). It is felt
that this site dates no earlier than 1936 and has little research potential pertinent to twentieth-

century occupation. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site is not considered eligible
for inclusion in the National Register.
Site 41 TT386
Background Data
Site 41 TT386 is a prehistoric site located on the north side of a small intermittent
drainage in an upland area (Figure A-1). The drainage ultimately flows into Tankersley Creek to
the southwest of the site and is the nearest (30 m) possible natural water source observed for the
site. No water was present in this drainage at the time of the survey, although some water was
observed in a larger intermittent drainage 150 m west of the site. At present, the site lies in open
pasture with little vegetation and a good ground surface visibility of approximately 50 percent.
Various grasses comprise the dominant vegetation type and the elevation of the site is 125 m msl.
A dirt field road runs north-south through the western side of the site.
Testing Program
The site was first located when lithic debitage was noted on the surface. Three shovel
tests were excavated on the site and all were devoid of cultural material. An intensive surface
survey was also conducted. The artifacts observed on the site were all noted in the road or to the
east of it. The soil is a loamy fine sand overlying clay at less than 60 cm below the ground surface.
The distribution of artifacts across the site suggests a site size of 25 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Five artifacts were observed on the surface of the site, but were not collected. These
included two secondary flakes, one tertiary flake, one corticate chip, and one fire-cracked rock, all
of quartzite.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT386, is a surficial lithic scatter near the bank of a small drainage flowing
into Tankersley Creek. This site is highly disturbed due to the road, cultivation, and subsequent
erosion attributable to cultivation, making the exact provenience of any of these artifacts
questionable. Other lithic scatters such as 41TT370 and 41 TT373 are deemed to provide more
valuable knowledge about temporally undifferentiated sites. In the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists, the site has been sufficiently documented and should not be considered eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT387
Background Data
Site 41 TT387 is an upland prehistoric site located on the interfluve above the
confluence of two small intermittent drainages flowing into Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water sources are the intermittent drainages 30 m southeast and southwest of the

10723/880206

112

site. During the survey, the interfluve was covered by 2-m tall weeds everywhere except on a dirt
field road that runs east-west across the site. This area was once in open improved pasture, but
now has been left fallow with the ground only visible in the road. The elevation of this site is
131 m msl.
Testing Program
One piece of lithic debitage was observed on the surface of the field road. Three
shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were conducted to establish the site boundaries. Two
of these shovel tests were placed in the road and the third was excavated to the south of the road
in the high weeds. All three were culturally negative. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a loamy
sand changing to a clayey sand by 70 cm below the surface. Based upon the single artifact, the site
size is estimated to be less than 1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A secondary quartzite flake was observed on the surface in the road. It was not
collected.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT387, is an isolated prehistoric upland site of undetermined temporal
affiliation. Isolated finds offer little research potential and, in the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists, Site 41 TT387 has been sufficiently documented and is not eligible for nomination
to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT388
Background Data
Site 41TT388 is an upland historic site located north of the Forest Grove community
on the east side of County Road NW-4 (FigureA-1). Besides a cistern/well on the site, the nearest
natural water source is an intermittent drainage 100 m north of the site. The site gently slopes to
the northwest towards the drainage, and at present, is located in an open improved bermudagrass
pasture. Hackberry and sycamore are also present on the site. The ground surface visibility is less
than five percent and the site elevation is 131-133 m msl. A structure is indicated on this location
both on the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county highway map.
Initial observation of this site revealed the remains of a well or cistern constructed of
handmade brick (Figure 21). The exterior of this structure is coated with a layer of cement.
Whether this structure is a well or cistern could not be determined because it is filled with
structural debris, such as cement foundation fragments, almost to ground level. Approximately
30 m to the northeast of the well/cistern, a scattered modern historic trash pile is present.
Although Site 41TT388 is situated in the Hannah Northcutt Survey (Abstract 416), it
is a component of a 95-acre parcel that embraces both the Northcutt and Young Evans
(Abstract 196) surveys. Various deed transactions make reference to this land as once being the

10723/880206

114

property of J.H. Tucker, who sold it to LR. Riddle at an unspecified date. The legal instrument
describing the sale could not be found during this research effort and possibly was destroyed in an
1895 courthouse fire. Nonetheless, surviving records reveal that Aaron McBride and his wife
Mary, both of Fisher County, Texas, conveyed land that includes this site to G. A Johnson in 1891
for $650 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 27, page 92). Two years later, R. M. Johnson,
whose relationship, if any, to G. A Johnson is unknown, purchased the property for $700 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 13, page 551). Census records for 1900 and 1910 identify him as
a farmer born in Texas in 1872. His wife Jennie, also a native Texan, had borne two children by
1910. This parcel represented Johnson's only landholdings in the county; however, ad valorem tax
rolls show the property actually dropped in value from $500 in 1895 to $400 in 1905.
R. L. Jenkins purchased the property in December 1910 and sold it to Mrs. M. E.
Leftwich eight months later (Titus County Deed Records Volume 24, page 212; Volume 27,
page 297). Although she was the owner, her son, J. T. Leftwich, paid taxes on the property which
jumped in value to $800 by 1915. The following year, J. T. and his sister, Dora Leftwich, acquired
the land although the deed recording this transaction makes no reference to any structures or
improvements on the property (Titus County Deed Records Volume 272, page 469). Ad valorem
tax rolls note this tract of land, as well as a three-quarter-acre parcel in the R. Moore Survey
(Abstract 390), located out of the study area. Because the latter parcel was significantly smaller
in size yet roughly equal in value, the Leftwich residence is assumed to be on the R. Moore
Survey. As further evidence for this conclusion, Leftwich did not declare a "homestead" on the
Northcutt Survey when tax rolls included such a designation and by 1940, these same tax records
indicate his residence at 118 S. Madison Street in Mt. Pleasant. In 1961, Jewel J. and Evie Smith
acquired the property and later conveyed it to I. C. Gage, the present owners (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 272, page 469; Volume 276, page 216).

Testing Program
A series of three shovel tests was excavated, two of which were culturally positive.
Shovel Test 2, approximately 20 m south of the well/cistern, yielded artifacts in levels 1 through
3. Shovel Test 3, approximately 30 m east of this well/cistern, yielded artifacts in levels 1 through
4. No structural foundations or remains were observed. The shovel tests revealed the soil to be
very sandy with the clay content increasing with depth. The shovel tests were terminated between
50 and 60 cm below the surface. The surface artifacts, well/cistern, and shovel tests suggest a site
size of 60 x 30 m.
Artifact Analysis
Shovel tests 2 and 3 were culturally positive.
recovered from each shovel test level.

Table 14 documents the artifacts

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT388, is an isolated well/cistern with an associated historic artifact scatter
located just north of the Forest Grove community on the east side of County Road NW-4.
Although a structure is indicated at this location on the 1910 soil survey map, and again on the
1936 county highway map, no above-surface structural features remain, except the well/cistern.

While an estimated date of construction cannot be determined from existing data, the
site is believed to date to the early 1900s. Figure 16 indicates that a house stood at approximately
this location and possibly was the R. M. Johnson residence. By the 1930s, tax rolls reveal that a
house did not stand on the property.
At present, this site is located in open improved pasture, which connotes probable
historic cultivation. The soil is 50-60 cm deep with artifacts to a depth of 40 cm. Although the
1910 soil survey map dates this site to the first decade of the 1900s, the artifact assemblage does
not indicate any diagnostic turn-of-the-century artifacts. Archival research revealed no historically
significant information. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been
sufficiently documented and should not be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT389 (Forest Grove School)
Background Data
Site 41 TT389 is the location of a former school in Forest Grove on the north corner
of the intersection of County Roads NW-4 and NW-33 (Figure A-1). This site is indicated on the
1936 county highway map (Figure 17), but not on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16). The
nearest natural water source is the headwaters of an intermittent drainage that flows south into
Tankersley Creek approximately 150 m southwest of the site. At present, the site is situated in an
open improved bermudagrass pasture, although walnut and elm are also present. The ground
surface visibility is less than 10 percent and the site elevation is 134 m msl.
The site marks the location of the former Old Forest Grove School. Deed records
reveal that the land on which the school was built was conveyed by G. W. Barber to the trustees
of the School on August 29, 1911 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 25, page 60). The school
remained active, serving the local community until the 1960s when it was closed and eventually
razed. The land then reverted to I. C. Gage on April 6, 1967 (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 330, page 483).
Testing Program
The site was discovered in archival research of the Forest Grove Community and on
the 1936 County highway map. During the surface survey of the location, a concrete culvert well
and a modern concrete trailer pad were observed, as well as a concrete culvert-lined depression
located north-northwest of the trailer pad. A total of three shovel tests were excavated on the site,
all of which were culturally positive. The soil is a sandy loam. On the north side of the site the
sand extends to a depth varying between 40 and 60 cm below the surface, while a shovel test on
the south side only extended to 20 cm to clay. The surface features and shovel tests suggest a site
size of 40 x 30 m.

10723/880206

117

Artifact Analysis
A total of 60 artifacts was recovered for analysis at this site. Table 15 lists the artifacts
and their provenience.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT389, is an historic school site located in the community of Forest
Grove. Historic research indicates that the school was built in or after 1911 when the land was
conveyed to the school trustees. However, the structure was razed after the closing of the school
in the 1960s. No evident structural remains of the school were observed during the survey. None
of the artifacts likely date to the pre-1920s or 1930s. It is likely that the occupation associated with
the recent cement pad has obliterated much of the earlier occupation. Archaeological testing is
unlikely to provide additional information pertinent to the former school. In the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists, the site has been sufficiently documented and is not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP.
Site 41TT390
Background Data
Site 41 TT390 is an historic site located northwest of Forest Grove and immediately
east of County Road NW-4 (Figure A-1). This site is located in the uplands with the closest
natural water source being an intermittent drainage 300 m southwest of the site, across NW-4. At
present, the site lies in an overgrown pasture on the edge of a wooded area with walnut and
sycamore present. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and site elevation is 134 m
msl. A structure is indicated at this location on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17), but not
on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
This site was initially discovered by observation of a barn and a concrete culvert well
approximately 40 m east of the road. The barn, measuring approximately 10 x 10 m (Figure 22),
is east-southeast of the well and is constructed of modern-dimension milled lumber and wire nails.
It is a square barn with a front-gable roof and a breezeway running east-west through the middle
from front to back. On each side of the breezeway, the area may be divided into five areas with
70 percent of the total area functioning for vehicle storage and the remaining 30 percent as
partitioned shed areas. A portion of the structure appears to be partially burned.
Testing Program
The surface survey revealed a concrete culvert well which is likely adjacent a house
site, as defined by construction and household artifacts recovered in two shovel tests placed in the
area of the well. No intact structural remains of a residence were present. A third shovel test was
placed northeast of the extant barn and was culturally negative. The shovel tests showed the soil
to be a sandy loam becoming very hard packed at 60 cm below the surface. The surface features
and shovel tests suggest a site size of 70 x 30 m.

Artifact Analysis
Of the three shovel tests excavated on the site, shovel tests 1 and 2, placed in the
probable house location, were culturally positive. Table 16 documents the artifact inventory.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT390, is presently an extant historic barn and well located adjacent to
NW-4 and northwest of Forest Grove. This site appears on the 1936 county highway map
(Figure 17), but not on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16). The architecture present on this site
is not unique to the area, and based on map and artifact analysis, the site post-dates 1910 and likely
dates from the 1920s or 1930s. The site offers little research potential for addressing twentiethcentury occupation. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site is sufficiently
documented and that it is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT391
Background Data
Site 41TT391 is a prehistoric site located on a low erosional remnant knoll on the east
side of an intermittent drainage (the nearest natural water source) that ultimately flows northeast
into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). Water was present in this drainage at the time of the survey,
although it had rained only a few days previous. At present, the site lies in open improved
bermudagrass pasture which has been cleared and cultivated. The site location has a moderate
slope toward the drainage, which provides a good basis for erosional forces operating on the site.
The ground surface visibility varies from 10 to 20 percent and site elevation is 129 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. An intensive surface survey and four additional
shovel tests were conducted once the site was located. Shovel tests 1, 2, and 3 were culturally
positive, with a combined total of four artifacts recovered. The shovel tests showed the soil to be
a loamy sand becoming a silty fine sand and continuing deeper than 70 cm below the surface in
most of the shovel tests. Positive shovel tests and topography indicate a site size of 30 x 10 m. The
knoll is only slightly larger.
Artifact Analysis
Four artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. Shovel Test 1, Level 6 (5060 cm), yielded one tertiary chert flake. One tertiary quartzite flake and one corticate chip, also
of quartzite, were recovered in Level 4 (30-40 cm) of Shovel Test 2. Shovel Test 3 yielded one
tertiary quartzite flake in Level 2 (10-20 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT391, is a prehistoric low-density lithic scatter on a low erosional
remnant knoll. This site is of undetermined temporal affiliation since no temporally diagnostic

artifacts were observed either on the surface or in the four shovel tests. Due to the paucity of
cultural materials, the lack of a defined cultural horizon, historic clearing and cultivation, and
erosion, EH&A's archaeologists do not recommend further investigation and do not consider this
site eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Other sites such as 41TT392 and 41TT398 will likely
yield more information pertaining to lithic scatters.
Site 41TT392
Background Data
Site 41 TT392 is a prehistoric site located on a toe ridge on the east side of Piney
Creek (Figure A-1). This area is one of high relief and the creek, only 50 m west of the site, is
approximately 7-8 m below the site. At present, the site lies in woods with sweetgum, pine,
juniper, sassafras, and French mulberry present. The ground surface visibility is less than five
percent due to leaf litter, and the site elevation is 116-117 m msl.
Testing Program
An intensive surface survey and a total of five shovel tests were conducted on the site.
Artifacts were recovered in shovel tests 1through3 from levels 2, 4, 5, and 9; however, no artifacts
were observed on the surface of the site. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a fine sand
developing into a sandy loam, extending greater than 1 m in depth. Subsurface clay was not
reached. The positive shovel tests and the topography suggest a site size of 70 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of five artifacts was found and collected from the site. A thick triangular chert
biface was recovered from Level 4 (30-40 cm) of Shovel Test 1. Also in Shovel Test 1, one
corticate quartzite chip was recovered from Level 9 (80-90 cm). Shovel Test 2, Level 5 (40-50 cm),
yielded one tertiary quartzite flake and one quartzite corticate chip. One secondary quartzite flake
was recovered from Shovel Test 3, Level 2 (10-20 cm).
The biface is triangular in shape and is worked on three edges and exhibits cortex on
one side. It is 4.56 cm long, 3.49 cm wide at the base, and 1.85 cm thick. It weighs 23.1 grams (g).
No edge wear is apparent on the specimen.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT392, is a buried, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on a toe
ridge along Piney Creek. The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts precludes a specific dating of
this site. This site lies in a wooded area that has possibly been cleared, although not in recent
years. Bioturbation in the form of root disturbance is presently the main disturbing agent of the
site. No sign of active rodent activity was observed during the survey. The preponderance of
materials is located in levels 4 and 5 from 30-50 cm below the surface. Since subsurface clay was
not reached during shovel testing, there exists the possibility of a deeply buried cultural horizon.
Due to the discrete cultural horizon in levels 4 and 5 and the possibility of deeply buried materials,

archaeological testing is recommended to determine the potential eligibility of this site for NRHP
nomination.
Site 41 TT393
Background Data
Site 41 TT393 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of the south end of a broad toe
ridge along the east side of Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is Piney
Creek approximately 30 m west of the site. The site slopes gently to the west and, at present, lies
in a wooded area with pine, French mulberry, sweetgum, hickory, and oak. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent due to leaf litter, and the site elevation is 116 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing, which yielded two pieces of lithic
debitage in the first shovel test placed on the site location. An intensive surface survey was
performed and three additional shovel tests were excavated to assess the site and determine the
site boundaries. No other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a loamy
fine sand overlying clayey sand approximately 70 cm below the surface. The site size is estimated
to be 10 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were observed on the site, both in Shovel Test 1. One decorticate
quartzite ship was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm) and one tertiary chert flake was recovered in
Level 4 (30-40 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT393, is an ephemeral buried, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined temporal affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either
on the surface or in the four shovel tests. Bioturbation caused by tree roots is the leading
disturbing agent on the site. Due to the paucity of cultural materials and the lack of a distinct
buried cultural horizon, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that the superior cultural
stratigraphy of sites 41TT392 and 41TT398 will provide better information pertinent to the
research design. In EH&A's opinion, this site has been sufficiently documented and it should not
be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT394
Background Data
Site 41 TT394 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of the north end of a broad toe
ridge along the east side of Piney Creek (Figure A-1). Site 41TT393, a small buried ephemeral
lithic scatter, is located on the south end of this same landform. The nearest natural water source
is Piney Creek, approximately 70 m to the west of the site. The topography of the site slopes

10723/880206

124

gently to the west and the north and, at present, the site lies in a wooded area, which includes
pine, oak sweetgum, French mulberry, and hickory. The ground surface is not visible due to leaf
litter. The elevation of the site is 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage and
two pieces of charcoal/burned wood were recovered in the first shovel test placed on the site. An
intensive surface survey and three additional shovel tests were conducted to assess the site and to
determine the site boundary. No other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to
be a loamy fine sand to a depth greater than 80 cm below the surface. The site size is estimated
to be 5 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One piece of lithic debitage and two small pieces of charcoal/burned wood were
recovered from Shovel Test 1, Level 5 (40-50 cm). The piece of debitage is a quartzite corticate
chip. Of the two pieces of charcoal, one is actually a fragment of burned wood with some of the
specimen left unburned and is likely modern.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT394, is a buried, prehistoric low-density lithic scatter for which no
temporal affiliation may be assigned due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Bioturbation
by root activity appears to be the leading disturbing agent on the site at present. The extent of
disturbance may be illustrated by the presence of probable modern burned wood in the same
horizon as the lithic debitage. Due to the paucity of cultural materials at this site, it is the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists that this site should not be considered eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41 TT395
Background Data
Site 41 TT395 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of an upland lobe overlooking
an intermittent drainage that flows west-northwest into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is the intermittent drainage approximately 40 m north of the site. The site
gently slopes to the north, although closer to the drainage the slope increases dramatically. At
present, the site lies in a wooded area with oak, sweetgum, pine, French mulberry and some briars.
The ground surface is not visible due to leaf litter. The elevation of this site is 117 m msl.

This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
recovered in the first shovel test placed on the location of the site. An intensive surface survey and
two additional shovel tests were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries.
No other artifacts were observed. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a sandy loam overlying a

10123/880206

horizon of ironstone beginning at approximately 50 cm below the ground surface. The site size
is estimated to be 5 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A secondary quartzite flake was collected from
Shovel Test 1, Level 4 (30-40 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT395, is an isolated buried artifact of undetermined temporal affiliation.
Due to the paucity of cultural material observed on the site, 41 TT395 is not considered eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT396
Background Data
Site 41TT396 is a prehistoric site located on the western extent of a toe ridge above
the confluence of an intermittent drainage and Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural
water source is Piney Creek, 80 m to the west of the site. The site slopes gently to the west, north,
and northwest, while closer to the drainages, the slope becomes drastically greater. At present,
the site lies in a wooded area with pine, oak, French mulberry, ash, and elm. Because the study
area is located only on the periphery of the pine belt, it is likely that these pines, which are in a
fairly tight stand, are a remnant of an old planted pine stand that has since been cut and had time
for secondary regrowth. The ground surface is not visible due to leaf litter. The elevation of the
site is 117 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One prehistoric ceramic fragment
was recovered in Shovel Test 1, the first shovel test placed on this site. An intensive surface survey
and three additional shovel tests were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site
boundaries. Four additional sherds were recovered from shovel tests 3 and 4. The soil is a fine
sand extending to clayey sand at about 60 cm below ground surface. Shovel testing indicates a site
size of 30 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of five artifacts, all prehistoric ceramic, were recovered from this site. Shovel
Test 1, Level 5 (40-50 cm) yielded one bone-tempered plainware body sherd. One brushed grogtempered body sherd was recovered from Level 5 (40-50 cm) of Shovel Test 3. Shovel Test 4
yielded three sherds in Level 2 (20-30 cm). These included one grog-tempered incised body sherd
and two grog/bone-tempered body sherds, one of which is incised. No lithic debitage was noted
on the site.

10723/880206

126

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT396, is a buried, moderate-density prehistoric ceramic site located at
the confluence of Piney Creek and an unnamed intermittent drainage. The brushed ceramic
materials may date the site to the Late Caddo. The presence of planted pine indicates that at least
some of this area was at one time cleared. Bioturbation by tree roots appears to be the leading
disturbing agent of the site at present. No rodent activity was observed during the survey. The
site integrity appears to be of good condition and may possibly represent two occupations, one in
Level 2 and one in Level 5. Of interest is the lack of debitage observed on this site in both of
these horizons. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, if impacted, archaeological testing
should be implemented to further assess the site and to determine the significance of the lack of
lithic debitage. Determination of NRHP eligibility should wait until further assessment is
completed.
Site 41 TT397
Background Data
Site 41 TT397 is an historic site located in an upland area immediately north of County
Road NW-24 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is Piney Creek 225 m west of the
site. A structure is located in this area on Figure 17, but not on Figure 16. The site gently slopes
to the west and is situated in an overgrown pasture with bermudagrass, Chinaberry, persimmon,
oak, and pokeweed present. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the site
elevation is 121 m msl.
This site was initially discovered by observation of a shed/corral complex (Figure 23)
and a well (Figure 24) approximately 50 m east-northeast of this complex. A surface survey yielded
an old stove and washing machine (pre-1960s) between the well and the shed complex. Of the two
extant features, the shed/corral complex consists of a barbed-wire fenced area with two sheds (one
of wood, one of corrugated tin) and a lean-to on the north side of the complex, all in an "L" shape.
These structures are of corrugated tin, modern-dimension milled lumber, and wire-nail
construction. Collectively, these structures measure approximately 12 x 6 m. The well is of
concrete culvert produced by the "BELL CONCRETE PRODUCTS CO., SULPHUR SPRINGS,
TEX.". No date was present on the well.
Testing Program
A total of four shovel tests was excavated: one south of the shed complex, one
between the well and the shed complex, one east-southeast of the well, and one north of the well.
Of these, only Shovel Test 2, between the well and the sheds, and Shovel Test 4, north of the well,
were positive. Cultural material was recovered down through Level 3. A house location could not
be determined. The soil is a loamy sand becoming harder and sandier with depth. Most of the
shovel tests were excavated to at least 50 cm below the ground surface. The extant structures and
the positive shovel tests indicate a site size of 70 x 80 m.

Artifact Analysis
Five artifacts were recovered in the shovel tests. Shovel Test 2, Level 1 (0-10 cm),
yielded one whiteware rim fragment. From Level 3 (20-30 cm) of the same shovel test, one
unbleached window-pane fragment, one metal staple, and one wire nail were recovered. One wire
fragment was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 4.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT397, is an historic shed/corral complex with a concrete culvert well.
No house remains were observed at the time of the survey. Due to the lack of significant standing
structures, the absence of early twentieth-century or pre-1900 materials, and the paucity of the
cultural deposits, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently
documented and does not meet the requirements of eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT398
Background Data
Site 41TT398 is a prehistoric site located on the crest of a high broad ridge between
two drainages (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an unnamed intermittent tributary
of Piney Creek 250 m northeast of the site. Water was present in this drainage at the time of the
survey. Four chicken houses lie on the western portion of the site, which is in open improved
bermudagrass pasture. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the elevation is
122-123 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was recovered in
the first shovel test placed on the site. No other artifacts were recovered in the additional three
shovel tests excavated or during the intensive surface survey conducted on the site. The soil, as
seen in the shovel tests, is a loamy sand becoming very hard and somewhat clayey by 75 cm below
the surface. The field crew was unable to survey and shovel test near the chicken coops because
the coops were occupied. The landowner, however, displayed his collection of artifacts that were
collected from this portion of the site during earth-moving activities related to the construction of
the coops (Roberts 1987). The site size is estimated to be approximately 100 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was recovered in the shovel tests. A tertiary quartzite flake was collected
in Level 3 (20-30 cm) of Shovel Test 1. The collection of 17 projectile points displayed by the
landowner from the site included three diagnostic artifact types: Gary, Wells, and Ellis. Eleven of
the points, all dart points, were not typed because they were either broken or not easily typed by
a brief inspection.

10723/880206

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT398, is an upland low-density prehistoric lithic scatter probably dating
from the Early Archaic, as seen by the tool assemblage collected by the landowner. Much of the
site has been impacted by clearing, cultivation, and especially the construction of the chicken coops
on the west side of the site. East of the coops, however, a portion of the site is less impacted and
potentially intact. It is possible the site may yield significant information about the Early/Middle
Archaic. If the site is to be impacted, archaeological testing is recommended to determine NRHP
eligibility.
Site 41TT399
Background Data
Site 41TT399 is a prehistoric site located on an erosional remnant, or high area, on
the edge of the uplands overlooking an intermittent tributary of Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This
tributary is approximately 120 m north of the site, with water present at the time of the survey.
This site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture with a few scattered pine trees present. The
ground surface visibility is less than five percent, and the site elevation is 117 m msl.
Testing Program
Five shovel tests were excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted on the
site. Shovel tests 1 and 3 were positive. The deepest shovel test, Shovel Test 1, revealed sandy
loam overlying clay at 70 cm below ground surface, whereas the shallowest shovel test, Shovel
Test 5, excavated uphill from Shovel Test 1, was only excavated to 20 cm due to clay. The site size,
as indicated by the positive shovel tests, measures approximately 35 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
Four artifacts were recovered from 41TT399. Shovel Test 1, Level 6 (50-60 cm),
yielded one decorticate chip. Shovel Test 3 yielded three prehistoric sherds. A grog-tempered
plainware body sherd was recovered from Level 3 (20-30 cm), while Level 4 (30-40 cm) yielded two
sandy paste plainware body sherds.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT399, iS a buried, moderate-density prehistoric lithic and ceramic scatter.
The presence of ceramic on this site indicates a post-Archaic occupation. The presence of sandy
paste ware indicates a possible Early Ceramic occupation. The buried horizon, as exemplified in
Shovel Test 3, is present in levels 3 and 4 (20-40 cm). Historic clearing and possible cultivation
have probably heavily disturbed the upper 20 cm of the soil profile, but likely have not penetrated
to the level of the deeper artifacts. Testing of this site may help define the Early Ceramic Stage.
In conjunction with testing of 41TT398, testing may also give a good picture of settlement and
other problems within the region. If the site is to be impacted, archaeological testing is
recommended to determine the eligibility of the site for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41TT400
Background Data
Site 41 TT400 is an upland prehistoric site on the interfluve between two intermittent
drainages flowing northwest into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is
either drainage approximately 500 m to the north or south of the site. The site slopes to the
northwest at about 1 to 2 percent and, at present, lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture.
The ground surface visibility is less than five percent, except in the rodent burrow tailings. The
elevation of the site, which lies on three property tracts, is 128-131 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first found when a prehistoric ceramic sherd was observed in a rodent
burrow tailing. A total of 14 shovel tests was excavated. Five of the 14 shovel tests were culturally
positive. The soil profile consists of a sandy soil to approximately 60 cm, becoming a loamy sand
with increasing ferruginous sandstone and decreasing sand with depth. Based upon the positive
shovel tests, the site size is estimated to be 90 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Of the 14 shovel tests excavated, five were culturally positive, yielding a total of 22
artifacts. Of these artifacts, 19 are ceramic and the remaining are bone or burned clay. No lithic
material was recovered. Tables 17 and 18 document the artifacts found on the site and their
distribution. None of the sherds recovered are type-diagnostic.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT400, is a buried, high-density prehistoric ceramic site. The lack oflithic
materials is possibly significant and may represent a specialty use area. If this is the case, this is
one of only a few ceramic-only sites. Sites 41 TT396 and 41 TT410 are the other examples in the
study area. Also noted is the homogeneous nature of the ceramic materials. All have grog
tempering. This may indicate a short-term occupation. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists
that, if impacted, archaeological testing should be implemented to further assess the site and to
determine the significance of the lack of debitage. Determination of NRHP eligibility should wait
until further assessment is completed.
Site 41TT401
Background Data
Site 41TT401 is a prehistoric site with a possible historic component located on the
edge of the uplands east of a spring-fed drainage that flows into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is this drainage, which is 75 m west of the site. At present, this site
lies in an open improved bermudagrass pasture that slopes gently to the west and slightly to the
northwest. The presence of improved pasture indicates historic clearing and cultivation. The
ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the site elevation is 130-131 m msl. A study

of both the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) and the 1936 County highway map (Figure 17)
revealed no structures on the site.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. A total of five shovel tests, two of which were
culturally positive, were excavated, and an intensive surface survey was conducted. Shovel testing
showed the soil on the site to be a loamy sand extending to a clayey sand by 80 cm below ground
level. The three culturally negative shovel tests placed around the periphery of the site were much
shallower (30-50 cm), indicating erosion, possibly due in part to historic cultivation. Based on
shovel tests, the site size is estimated to be 40 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
Eight artifacts were recovered from the two positive shovel tests on the site. Shovel
Test 1 produced one amber glass fragment and one secondary quartzite flake in Level 1 (0-10 cm),
one whiteware sherd in Level 2 (10-20 cm), one secondary quartzite flake in Level 3 (20-30 cm),
one corticate quartzite chip in Level 4 (30-40 cm), one decorticate quartzite chip in Level 6 (50-60
cm), and one secondary quartzite flake in Level 7 (60-70 cm). Shovel Test 3, Level 5 (40-50 cm)
yielded one secondary quartzite flake.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT401, is a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter with a recent
historic component in the upper levels of the soil horizon. This site is of undetermined temporal
affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered either from the surface or from
the shovel tests. The 1910 and 1936 maps indicate no historic structures present at the site. None
were observed on the site during the survey, although there are modern houses approximately
125 m southeast and northeast of the site. It is probable that the non-prehistoric artifacts are
random refuse from the nearby houses.
Bioturbation such as rodent activity has heavily impacted the integrity of this site. This
is exemplified in shovel tests 1 and 3, where there is no distinct horizon of artifacts; instead, a
vertical mixing and distribution through the soil profile is present. The mixing of historic debris
with prehistoric debris illustrates the mixing of horizons by cultivation practices. In the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists, Site 41TT401 would likely not yield vital information necessary to
interpreting the prehistoric sequence of the area and should not be considered eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT402
Background Data
Site 41 TT402 is a prehistoric site with a recent historic component located on the
distal end of an upland toe ridge extending into the floodplain of a spring-fed drainage flowing into
Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This site is located 100 m north-northwest of 41TT401, which lies on
the same landform. The nearest natural water source is the drainage 60 m west of the site. The

10723/880206

135

topography of the site gently slopes to the west, north, and northeast, with erosion evident on the
slopes of this toe ridge, due in part to historic cultivation and ranching practices. At present, this
site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture. The site has been subjected to historic clearing
and cultivation. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the site elevation 128 m
msl. A study of both the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) and the 1936 County highway map
(Figure 17) revealed no structures on the site.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. Four shovel tests and an intensive surface
survey were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries. Two of the four
shovel tests were positive, yielding artifacts in levels 1 through 4. No artifacts and no historic
structural remains were observed on the surface. Shovel testing showed that the soil is a loamy
sand becoming clayey by 30-40 cm below the surface. Based on the shovel tests, the site size is
estimated to be approximately 20 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 22 artifacts were recovered in the two positive shovel tests on this site.
Table 19 documents the artifact inventory.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The moderate-density prehistoric component of this site is of undetermined temporal
affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from either the positive shovel
tests or the surface survey. The recent historic artifacts have likely been scattered from houses to
the east of the site. None of the historic artifacts recovered from this site is of great antiquity, but
likely date from the mid- to late twentieth century. The prehistoric artifacts recovered in the
shovel tests on this site are well-distributed through the top 40 cm of the soil profile, and
undoubtedly have been mixed by plowing. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site has
little potential to yield significant information on the history or prehistory of the area and, as a
result, is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT403
Background Data
Site 41TT403 is a prehistoric site located on a small upland lobe extending out into
the floodplain of the confluence of Piney Creek and three tributaries of Piney Creek (Figure A-1).
Located on the west side of Piney Creek, this site is north of the intermittent drainage that flows
east into Piney Creek. The nearest natural water source is this intermittent drainage 70 m south
of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture that slopes gently
toward Piney Creek and the drainage to the south and southeast. The pasture is terraced which
indicates historic clearing and cultivation. The ground surface visibility is less. than five percent
except in the rodent burrow tailings and site elevation is 119 m msl.

Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. One prehistoric ceramic sherd was recovered
from the first shovel test placed on the location of the site. An additional four shovel tests were
excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted to assess the site and to determine the
site boundary. Shovel tests 1, 4, and 5 were culturally positive, but no artifacts were observed on
the site surface. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a sandy loam overlying sandy clay beginning
between 25 and 70 cm below the surface. Based on the shovel tests, the site size is estimated to
be 30x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of six artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests in levels 2 and 3 (10-30 cm)
and 5 and 6 (40-60 cm). Shovel Test 1, Level 3 (20-30 cm), yielded one incised rim sherd, grogtempered. Shovel Test 4 yielded a total of four artifacts. Three grog-tempered, plainware body
sherds were recovered, one each in levels 3 (20-30 cm), 5 (40-50 cm) and 6 (50-60 cm). Also in
Level 6 (50-60 cm), a limonite rock was recovered that is possibly worked on one edge. Semicircular in shape, this item measures almost 10 cm long, 4.3 cm wide and 2.3 cm thick. The ventral
surface is :flat while the dorsal surface is convex. Possible large :flake scars are present along the
rounded side. Shovel Test 5 yielded one decorticate chert chip in Level 2 (10-20 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT403, is a buried, moderate-density post-Archaic site most likely related
to the Caddo. However, the lack of diagnostic artifacts prohibits a Caddo phase designation.
Historic cultivation and terracing have heavily impacted the site. Bioturbation by rodent activity,
as seen by the presence of rodent burrow tailings on the surface of the site, has also played a role
in displacing the artifacts through the soil profile. Because of these impacts it is felt that the
research potential of the site has been compromised. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists
that this site is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT404
Background Data
Site 41TT404 is a prehistoric site situated on a rise at the base of the creek valley wall
just above the active :floodplain of Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source
is an intermittent tributary of Piney Creek 125 m east of the site. A stock tank has been
constructed just below the site. The site slopes about 10 degrees to the east and at present lies
in open improved bermudagrass pasture. Near the site are one large oak and two large
cottonwood trees. The ground surface visibility is about 10 percent due to erosion caused by the
stock tank construction and rodent burrow tailings. The elevation of this site is 118 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first located by observing lithic debitage on the surface in eroded areas
above the stockpond. In order to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries, an intensive

10723/880206

138

surface survey and three shovel tests were conducted. All the shovel tests were culturally negative,
although a total of three artifacts was observed on the surface. Shovel testing outside the eroded
area showed the soil to be a sandy loam 50 to 70 cm in depth over sandy clay. The site size is
estimated to be 10 x 5 m.
Artifact Analysis
One quartzite flake, one angular quartzite fragment, and one possible burned quartzite
cobble were observed in the eroded area exposed by erosion near the stock tank. None was
collected.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT404, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined temporal
affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from either the shovel tests or
the surface survey. The integrity of the observed cultural materials is compromised due to the
erosional site surface. This site has been heavily impacted by the subsequent erosion associated
with the construction of the stock tank. For this reason, it is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and should not be considered eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT405
Background Data
Site 41 TT405 is a prehistoric site located on a slope overlooking the floodplain at the
confluence of Piney Creek and an intermittent drainage to the northeast (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is the intermittent drainage approximately 175 m north of the site. At
present, this site lies in an open improved bermudagrass pasture that gently slopes to the
northeast. A stand of pine trees is located on the south edge of the site. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and the site elevation is approximately 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first located by shovel testing. Four shovel tests were excavated, two of
which were positive. No artifacts were observed on the surface of the site. Shovel testing showed
the soil to be a loamy sand overlying clay at 70 cm in the upper elevation of the site and 50 cm on
the lower reaches of the site. The site size, based upon the shovel test materials, is estimated to
be 40 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of six artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests. Shovel Test 1, on the
north end of the site and highest up the slope, yielded one decorticate quartzite chip in Level 1
(0-10 cm); one grog-tempered, plainware basal sherd and one grog-tempered, plainware body sherd
in Level 4 (30-40 cm); and one grog-tempered, plainware body sherd in Level 5 (40-50 cm). A

10723/880206

139

unifacially flaked quartzite point stem and a corticate quartzite chip were recovered from levels 1
(0-10 cm) and 3 (20-30 cm), respectively, in Shovel Test 4, lower on the slope.
The stem is undiagnostic and is covered with cortex on one side. It is manufactured
of rose-grey chert and exhibits cortex on the side that is not flaked. Approximately 1.1 cm long,
the stem is 0.33 cm thick with a base approximately 0.85 cm wide. The specimen weighs 0.45 g.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT405, a buried, low- to moderate-density prehistoric lithic and ceramic
scatter, is located on a slope overlooking the floodplain of Piney Creek. This site likely dates to
the Post-Archaic Caddo due to the presence of ceramic materials; however, a more precise
temporal assessment cannot be made from the recorded ceramics. Historic impacts affecting the
integrity of this site include clearing and cultivation, although these likely did not affect the cultural
deposits in levels 3, 4, and 5. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, although the lower
deposits of this site appear to be relatively intact, Site 41 TT406 would be a better representation
of this settlement area and would yield more information than 41 TT405. To this end, it is their
opinion that this site has been sufficiently documented and should not be recommended as eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT406
Background Data
Site 41 TT406 is a prehistoric site located at the top of a low ridge at the base of the
creek valley wall, above the floodplain (Figure A-1). This ridge is an extension of the same
landform on which 41 TT405 is situated. Site 41 TT405, however, is located towards the proximal
end of this ridge, whereas 41 TT406 is located on the low distal projection of the ridge. At present,
this ridge is barely perceptible above the colluvial wash that has filled the creek bed. The nearest
natural water source is an intermittent drainage flowing into Piney Creek 20 m to the north of the
site. At present, the site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture, with large sweetgum and
oak trees present along the drainage banks. The ground surface visibility is very poor at less than
five percent, except in rodent burrow tailings. The elevation of this site is 116-117 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. An intensive surface survey and five shovel
tests were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundary. No artifacts were
observed on the site surface, although three of the five shovel tests were culturally positive. The
shovel tests showed the soil to be a loamy sand to approximately 90 cm in depth over clay. Based
upon shovel testing, site size is estimated to be 40 x 25 m.
Artifact Analysis
Table 20 documents the artifacts recovered by shovel test level. From Shovel Test 1,
one piece of chipped petrified wood was recovered from Level 4 (30-40 cm) and one tertiary
quartzite flake was recovered from Level 5 (40-50 cm). Shovel Test 3 yielded one incised body

This site, 41 TT406, is a buried, low-density prehistoric ceramic site located at the distal
end of a low ridge that extends into the floodplain of Piney Creek and its tributaries. One sherd
with no visible temper was recovered from this site. This possibly has a sandy paste temper, which
may be indicative of an Early Ceramic site. Historic cultivation practices have caused an infilling
of colluvium in the creek valley (see Geomorphology Section, Chapter III), thereby burying much
of the original valley floor. This has caused the ridge where the site is located to be only a shallow
"bump" in the floodplain. Bioturbation has also affected the site and can likely explain the seven
charcoal fragments in Level 8 of Shovel Test 5 just above the hard clayey layer. Overall, however,
there appears to be an intact horizon of cultural materials 30-60 cm below the surface. It is the
opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that a study of this site may lead to a better understanding of
the presence of sandy paste ceramics in the prehistoric chronology of the area. Archaeological
testing is recommended if the site is to be impacted.
Site 41 TT407 (Hayes Cemetery)
Background Data
Site 41 TT407 is an historic cemetery located immediately west of an intermittent
drainage flowing south into Tankersley Creek and west of County Road NW-4 (Figure A-1). The
cemetery lies on the edge of an erosional gully (Figure 25) which, at present, is wooded with cedar,
walnut, and oak trees. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and site elevation is
127 m msl. This site is shown neither on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) nor on the 1936
county highway map (Figure 17).
Due to the nature of the site, no subsurface testing was conducted and no artifacts
were collected. The cemetery area is approximately 6 x 6 m and is delineated by a fallen barbedwire fence. Some of the cedar corner posts are still evident. On the west side of the site, at the
edge of the erosional gully, is a brick cairn measuring approximately 1 x 2 m (north/south by east/
west). In the gully, to the west of this feature, is a fallen headstone and base. The headstone
reads:
Robt G. Hayes
Born Nov. 9, 1830
Died Nov. 4, 1882
A loving husband
A father dear
A faithful friend
Lies buried here.

Figure 25. Site 41 TT407, Hayes Cemetery. View to the east.
Note the brick cairn and fallen headstone.

143

The bricks of the cairn appear to be reused, with some exhibiting fire-glazing as is common in
chimneys. Two sandstone cobbles to the south of the cairn and a scatter of bricks on the east side
of the site may represent additional burials.
The site is a small family cemetery that has been abandoned and forgotten for many
years. In one published history (Russell 1965:33), reference is made to the Hayes (spelled as Hays
in this book) Cemetery about six miles northwest of Mt. Pleasant on the W.A. Ford Estate lands.
Russell reported that there were eight or ten graves, some of which had monuments for various
members of the Hayes family. Two of the graves, he noted, had brick vaults; however, one had
been washed away, leaving some of the brick in a ditch. Archival research confirms that land
including the cemetery was owned by W.A. Ford by the 1920s. Previous owners included J.W.
Edwards and W.T. Cameron. The only Hayes family member known to have owned the property
was J.L. Hayes in the 1890s (Titus County Deed Records, Volume 1, Page 541). No earlier deed
references were uncovered during this research effort and probably were destroyed in a courthouse
fire in the 1890s.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT407, is the location of the Hayes Cemetery. Little historical
documentation is available for this cemetery, probably due to the courthouse fire in the 1890s.
Although eight to ten graves have been reported at this site, the present survey only recorded one
brick cairn and one headstone. The headstone, with a burial date of 1882 and located at the
bottom of the gully, illustrates the antiquity of this cemetery as well as the advanced state of
erosion present. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists and historian that this site should not
be recommended as eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Avoidance of this site, however, is
recommended in accordance with the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act
(TSCMRA).
Site 41TT408
Background Data
Site 41 TT408 is an historic occupation with an extant barn and well located on a broad
upland ridge adjacent County Road NW-26 (Figure A-1). A single artifact may also represent a
small prehistoric component. The nearest natural water source is Piney Creek approximately 225
m west of the site. No structure is indicated on this location on either the 1910 soil survey map
(Figure 16) or the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17), and the site lies on the edge of an
overgrown pasture with grasses, hackberry, sweetgum, and oak present. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and site elevation is 116 m msl.
This site was initially discovered by observation of a barn and well. No artifacts were
observed during the surface survey of the site. The barn, measuring 30 x 15 ft and facing east-west,
has a gable-roof central section with an attached shed on the north and south sides (Figure 26).
Of vertical board construction, this structure is built of modern-dimension milled lumber and wire
nails with a corrugated tin roof. The central barn area has a wood floor. To the northeast of the
barn is a brick-lined well. The bricks appear to be very high in sand content although they are

145

machine pressed. All that remains of the superstructure of the well is several layers of brick. At
the time of the survey, the well was filled with water within 10 ft of the surface.
Testing Program
A total of three shovel tests was excavated on the site. Only one of these, Shovel
Test 1, which was located north of the barn and west of the well, was positive, yielding artifacts in
levels 2 through 4. The soil is a loamy sand, becoming more clayey with depth. The extant
structures suggest a site size of 30 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of nine artifacts was recovered from Shovel Test 1, the only positive shovel
test. Level 2 (10-20 cm) yielded one stoneware base with an alkaline brown glaze and one clear
jar-glass fragment. Two sheet-metal fragments and one clear bottle-glass fragment were recovered
in Level 3 (20-30 cm), as well as a fire-cracked rock fragment. Level 4 (30-40 cm) yielded four
amorphous rusted metal fragments that appear to be the remains of wire nails.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The fire-cracked rock may represent a prehistoric component, or, since it was found
mixed with historic debris, the rock may have been fired historically. The barn and well suggest a
former farmstead, although no house remains were observed at the time of the survey. The site
appears neither on the 1910 soil survey map nor on the 1936 county highway map and, in
conjunction with the scant artifacts recovered from the one positive shovel test, a post-1936
occupation is identified for the site. The barn is not architecturally unique and, due to the absence
of early or pre-twentieth century materials and the paucity of the buried deposits, it is the opinion
of EH&A's personnel that the site has been sufficiently documented and it does not appear eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT409
Background Data
Site 41TT409 is a prehistoric site located on the long north-south interfluve above the
confluence of Piney Creek and an intermittent drainage (Figure A-1). This interfluve slopes to
the east and west, with Piney Creek to the west and the intermittent drainage to the east. The
nearest natural water source is either of these two drainages, each approximately 40 m from the
edge of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved bermudagrass pasture with various
other forbs present. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent, although there are
numerous rodent burrow tailings evident on the surface of the site. The elevation of this site is
147-148 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. A total of eight shovel tests was excavated
along the crest of the interfluve, and an intensive surface survey was conducted to assess the site

10723/880206

146

and to define the site boundaries. Seven of the eight shovel tests were culturally positive, with
cultural materials in levels 2 through 8. Shovel testing showed the soil to be a 50-cm deep loamy
sand on the higher elevation of the site. On the lower elevation, a loamy sand 80-100 cm in depth
was encountered. The topography and the positive shovel tests suggest a site size of 200 x 100 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 20 artifacts was recovered from the seven positive shovel tests. Table 21
documents the recorded artifacts and Table 22 documents their distribution by shovel test.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT409, is a large buried, high-density prehistoric lithic scatter which, based
on the fire-cracked rock and the piece of petrified wood that may be burned, may have been a
campsite. The site is of undetermined temporal affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts
were recovered either from the surface or from the eight shovel tests excavated. The absence of
ceramics was noted on this site in an area where other sites contain ceramics. Further testing of
this site would likely yield diagnostic materials to date the site, thereby providing insight into the
intersite relationships. If the site is to be impacted, limited archaeological testing is recommended
to determine the cultural affiliation of this site to the sites in the surrounding vicinity.
Site 41 TT410
Background Data
Site 41 TT410 is a prehistoric site located on an upland lobe overlooking an
intermittent drainage that flows into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source
is the intermittent drainage approximately 100 m south of the site. The site topography slopes
gently to the south toward the drainage and, at present, the site is situated in cultivated open
improved bermudagrass pasture. The elevation of this site is 123 m msl.
Testing Program
Located by shovel testing, a prehistoric sherd was recovered from Shovel Test 1, the
first test placed on the location of the site. An additional three shovel tests were excavated, and
an intensive surface survey was conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries.
No artifacts were observed on the surface and only one of the additional shovel tests uncovered
an artifact. Shovel testing showed the soil to be fairly shallow, with loamy sand over clayey soil at
30-50 cm below the surface. Based on the positive shovel tests, the site size is estimated to be 30 x
20m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of two prehistoric ceramic artifacts were recovered on this site. One sandy
paste incised/brushed body sherd was recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 1. Shovel
Test 2 yielded one grog- and bone-tempered plainware body sherd in Level 2 (10-20 cm).

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT410, is a shallow, low density prehistoric ceramic site located on the
upland edge above an intermittent drainage that flows into Piney Creek. The scant artifacts are
shallowly buried and have likely been heavily impacted by historic clearing and cultivation practices,
as indicated by the presence of open improved pasture. Due to the likelihood that little or none
of this site retains its original integrity, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that 41 TT410
should not be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT411
Background Data
Site 41 TT411 is an historic occupation represented by an extant frame barn and frame
garage, a well, and related artifacts. The site is located in the uplands, east of an intermittent
drainage flowing into Hayes Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is the
intermittent drainage 95 m southwest of the house. At present, the site lies in an open area with
crepe myrtle, oak, juniper, and pine also present. Ground surface visibility is less than five percent
and site elevation is 136-138 m msl. This site is indicated on (Figure 17) the county highway map
but not on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16.)
Site 41TT411 is located on land in the Joseph J. Dew Survey (Abstract 156). The
earliest recorded owners are W.W. and M.E. Nugent, who deeded the land to Walter W. Nugent
on January 5, 1894. In 1906, the land was divided into lots among the heirs of Walter W. and
A.E. Nugent. C.T. Nugent received Lot Number Four which consisted of 50 acres, and
W.W. Nugent was awarded 35 acres in Lot Number Three (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 17, page 476).
W.W. and B.L. Nugent sold Lot Number Three to C.W. Bowden for $600 in August
1908 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 20, page 232), but the following year the land was
conveyed back to W.W. Nugent for the cancellation of a promissory note (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 22, page 112). In December 1909, W.W. Nugent sold the land for $700 to
N. Hinson (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 199), who deeded the land to
J.R. Stevens for $850 in October 1912 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 457). The
ad valorem tax rolls for 1910 appraise the property at $300.
J.R. Stevens acquired title to Lot Number Four in October 1910. He purchased the
tract from R. Harrison for $1,700 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 450). The
appraised value of the property in 1910 was $800. R. Harrison had bought the land from
C.T. Nugent in September 1909 for $1,500 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 23, page 59).
Mrs. J.R. Stevens deeded the tract to Bill Brown in July 1919 for $5,411.25 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 38, page 181). This $2,861.25 profit probably indicates that the
Stevens built a house during their ownership of the tract. Also, the 1915 ad valorem tax rolls state
that the property had an appraised value of $1,100. Theodocia Brown, the widow of Bill Brown,
conveyed the property to W.T. and Dephia Cameron for $3,500 in November 1928 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 71, page 101). The tract remained in the Cameron family until 1948, when

10723/880206

150

W.T. Cameron's heirs sold the land to Arthur Hooks for $4,162.50 (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 161, page 156).
According to one unidentified farm hand, the former house on the site was moved out
of the area in the 1960s by the children of the former residents. The house foundation measures
approximately 20 x 36 ft and consists of brick piers, the remains of a two-skirt brick wall, and
cement steps on the south side of the former structure. Indoor plumbing is evident on the west
side of the house.
The concrete culvert-lined well is to the west of the former house. The depth of the
well could not be determined, since it was filled with assorted trash and construction materials.
Also to the west of the house and north of the well is a brick structure, possibly used as a pump
house. Measuring 4 x 4 ft, this brick structure also has a glazed clay septic pipe.
A frame single-car garage (Figure 27) with horizontal lapped siding is southwest of
the house. It measures approximately 20 x 30 ft and has a shed on the north side which is
approximately 6 ft wide.
A barn is located approximately 35 ft south of the garage (Figure 28). Facing eastwest, this structure is gable-roofed with a wide lean-to shed on either side (north and south). Of
corrugated-tin construction, the barn and the sheds cumulatively measure approximately 40 x 30 ft.
Testing Program
No shovel tests were excavated on the site in accordance with the owner's wishes.
Two kitchen pots were observed on the southwest side of the house. Various debris was noted in
the garage and barn. Also, to the west-southwest was an old wooden horse-drawn wagon with a
1968 Texas license plate. The remaining surface features indicate a site size of approximately 80 x
60m.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT411, is an historic former house site. A prehistoric component for this
site is considered unlikely, since none is found in adjacent fields. Likely built between 1910 and
1919, the house was moved after 1965. Due to the lack of unique architecture of the remaining
buildings and the lack of early twentieth-century or earlier occupation of the site, it is the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and should not be
considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT412
Background Data
Site 41 TT412 is an historic artifact scatter located on the west side of State
Highway 2152 (Figure A-1). The site is on a small ridge which is bordered by erosional drainages
to the north and south. The nearest natural water source is the upper reaches of Hayes Creek
250 m west of the site. There is a structure indicated in this location on both the 1910 soil survey

the site lies in an open improved pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type. The
ground surface visibility is less than five percent except in the cattle trails, where the ground
surface is exposed. The elevation of this site is 135-136 m msl.
Site 41 TT412 is located on a 111.5-ac tract in the Joseph J. Dew Survey
(Abstract 156). In November 1901, W.W. and Mattie E. Nugent, the legal heirs of Henry W. and
Nancy Jones, conveyed the land to C.T. Ludlow for $3,250 (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 10, page 62). One the same day, C.T. Ludlow deeded 69.2 acres of it to J.H. Combs for
$1,400 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 12, page 4).
T.D. Robertson purchased a portion of the tract in June 1909 for $900 from J.H. and
A.E. Combs (Titus County Deed Records Volume 20, page 619). The 1910 ad valorem tax rolls
list T.D. Robertson owning 40 acres with an appraised value of $400. Two years later, T.D. and
Ola Robertson conveyed the land to W.A. McGraw (Titus County Deed Records Volume 35,
page 336). In 1915, the tract was appraised at $600. The property changed ownership again in
November 1916 when W.A. and Julia McGraw sold the tract to B.E. Kennedy for $1,700 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 35, page 444). In September 1939, B.E. and Mollie Kennedy
deeded one acre to George Lee Keith (Titus County Deed Records Volume 115, page 19).
J.H. and A.E. Combs sold approximately 102.5 acres of the tract to W.T. Edwards in
December 1917 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 40, page 24). According to the ad valorem
tax rolls, J.H. Combs owned 242 acres in the Dew Survey in 1915. This property was worth $2,420.
W.M and Jennie L. Edwards conveyed the land to John A Cooper in February 1924 for $6,600
(Titus County Deed Records Volume 56, page 502). The 1925 ad valorem tax rolls indicate that
John A Cooper owned approximately 150 acres in the Dew Survey. The appraised value of this
property was $3,000. The heirs of John A Cooper sold the land to George Lee Keith in May 1929
for $825 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 70, page 552). The probate minutes list the
102.5 acres as the Cooper's homestead, and the property has an appraised value of $3,500 (Titus
County Probate Records Volume 10, page 106). The 1930 tax rolls state that the 102.5-acre tract
has an appraised value of $1,500, and the property is listed as George Lee Keith's homestead in
1935.
George Lee Keith retained ownership of the entire tract until April 1942, when it was
purchased by E.L and Coy Autria Hockaday for $6,500 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 126,
page 234). The land was conveyed to AN. Pepper in September 1945, for $7,500 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 149, page 242). The property has remained in the Pepper family since that
time.
Testing Program
The site was first observed as historic debris scattered in the cattle trail. Even though
the landowner had given permission to survey the area, the foreman denied permission to excavate
shovel tests. The soil is shallow, 10 cm or less, with orange clay showing on some portions of the
cattle trails and other erosional spots. Based upon the landform and similar scatters of debris
throughout the Monticello-Winfield area, site size is estimated to be about 50 min diameter.

Artifact Analysis
Debris observed in the cattle trails traversing the site included clear bottle glass, amber
glass, stoneware, whiteware, smoked glass, Coke bottle fragments, wire nails, and milk glass. No
collections were made.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The site represents the remains of a former twentieth-century occupation, possibly a
residence, judging by the presence of household ceramics and deed research. No well or cistern
was located. Deed research suggests that a structure was constructed between 1901 and 1015 by
J.H. Combs, when the value of the property appreciated nearly 100 percent. There is no archival
or artifactual evidence for a nineteenth-century occupation of the site. The soils over the site are
shallow and eroding, virtually eliminating the possibility for culturally intact twentieth-century
materials. A prehistoric component to the site is also considered to be highly unlikely, since
prehistoric artifacts were not found in the vicinity. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the
site has been sufficiently documented and is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT413
Background Data
Site 41 TT413 is a prehistoric site located on a small, broad, nondescript upland ridge
between two upland drainages (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent
drainage of Piney Creek 50 m southwest of the site. At present, there is a stock pond on this
drainage indicating the possible locale of an upland spring. The site lies in open improved pasture,
with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type. Pine, sweetgum and oak are present in the
drainages below the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the site
elevation is 141 m msl.
Testing Program
Although the field crew was originally testing this location for an historic structure
indicated on the 1936 County highway map, Shovel Test 1 yielded a piece of lithic debitage. An
intensive surface survey and an additional three shovel tests were conducted. No historic artifacts
were observed; however, another piece of lithic debitage was recovered from Shovel Test 4. No
prehistoric artifacts were observed on the surface of the site. Shovel testing showed the soil to be
a deep sandy loam at least 70 cm deep, overlying clay. Positive shovel tests indicate that the site
measures 30 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered from this site. Shovel Test l, Level 7 (60-70 cm),
yielded one tertiary quartzite flake and Shovel Test 4, Level 5 (40-50 cm), yielded one secondary
quartzite flake.

10723/880206

155

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT413, is a deeply buried low density prehistoric lithic scatter located on
a broad upland ridge adjacent an intermittent drainage which may have a spring that is now under
a stock tank. The site is of undetermined temporal affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were recovered from the surface or the four shovel tests. The site appears to be relatively
intact and may represent a buried single-component site. Such sites are important to research
issues raised in the research design. If the site is to be impacted, archaeological testing is
recommended to determine the site's eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT414
Background Data
Site 41TT414 is an historic occupation represented by the remains of a demolished
residence and the remains of a log barn partially sided with old motor oil cans. The site is located
in an upland area immediately south of County Road NW-24 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural
water source is an intermittent drainage approximately 200 m northwest of the site, although there
is also a stock pond only 50 m northwest of the site. The 1936 county highway map (Figure 17)
depicts a structure at this location. At present, the site lies in open improved pasture, with
bermudagrass, the dominant vegetation type, restricting ground surface visibility to less than five
percent. The elevation of this site is 139-140 m msl.
This site was first observed in 1987 as two structures, a collapsed house (Figure 29)
and a barn (Figure 30a), in an open pasture. The former house is located adjacent to County
Road NW-24, while the barn is 50 m southwest of the house. A third structure, a small frame
shed, is located south of the house and east-southeast of the barn. In a later visit to the site, the
barn was found to be destroyed by hurricane-force winds that ravaged the study area in May 1989
(Figure 30b ).
The barn was at one time a double-pen log structure; however, only a single pen
remained intact in 1987. Figures 31 and 32 show the barn as it was before it destruction. The
horizontal logs of the extant pen are sawn and half-notched and appear to have been carefully
selected for size and grade (Figure 31). The vertical gable logs were also sawn and were selected
for size and grade (Figure 32). The rafters were a combination of milled lumber and logs. The
east and west sides of the former intact pen were lean-to areas constructed of vertical split pine
logs approximately 3 inches in diameter (Figure 30). The outside walls of the demolished structure
are lined with quart-sized motor oil cans, split at the seams and used as siding (figures 30 and 32).
Many of the brand names are legible (Table 23). The floor of the former pen is constructed of
wooden split logs, while the roof of the entire structure was covered by sheet metal. The size of
the collapsed structure is approximately 30 x 30 ft.
The former 15- x 20-ft house was at least partially constructed of pine logs (Figure 29),
but due to the advanced state of decay, only a few logs (six or less) remain partially intact. Asphalt
shingles covered the roof, and the house exterior was covered by vertical shiplap siding tacked with
wire nails. The former residence stood on brick piers mortared with cement. A machine-cut brick
chimney base is located on the east side of the structure.

The 3- x 5-ft shed to the southeast of the barn and to the south-southwest of the
house is made of the same vertical pole and oil can construction as the barn. Damage was also
sustained to this structure by the storm.
Site 41 TT414 is situated on a 25-acre parcel in the Thomas McPeters Survey
(Abstract 374). The earliest known owner was P. B. Branch, who conveyed the property to Roy
Allen for $465 in 1907 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 495). Efforts to determine
the previous owner were unsuccessful, as Branch's name was not listed in reverse indexes to the
deeds. Tax rolls shed little light on the early history of the property, as Branch's name does not
appear as a resident or nonresident of Titus County.
Despite these setbacks, pertinent information was garnered on later owners. In 1909,
Walter Rolf purchased the 25 acres for $300, substantially less than the sale price of two years
earlier (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 494). Census records for 1910 identify Rolf
as an Englishman who had come to Texas as early as 1892 when his son, Jesse, was born in the
state. Rolf's wife, Susan, was a native of Illinois, and they had been married for 23 years. Rolf
was a farmer and maintained title to the land until his death in 1946. At that time, his heirs,
including his wife, children and their respective spouses, sold the property to Ike and Bernice
Allman for $1,000 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 153, page 377). Since then, ownership
of the land has changed several times.
Testing Program
Three shovel tests were excavated on the site, to the west (Shovel Test 2), south
(Shovel Test 1), and southeast (Shovel Test 3) of the house. All were culturally positive to a
maximum depth of 30 cm below the surface. The soil is a loamy fine sandy with clay content
increasing in depth below 30 cm. The site size is estimated to be 80 x 60 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 19 historic artifacts was recovered from shovel tests. Table 24 documents
the artifacts recorded.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT414, is an historic site located on the south side of County Road NW24. The demolished barn and damaged shed were noteworthy examples of folk architecture, as
their probable builder, Walter Rolf, utilized flattened oil cans as siding. Until the May 1989 storm,
the barn and shed had survived remarkably well since their construction about 1930, and they
illustrated the care and level of craftsmanship exerted in their construction. The collapsed barn
and damaged shed were unique and "embodied the distinctive characteristics of a method of
construction" (NPS guidelines, Criterion C). The extensive storm damage, however, has severely
compromised (if not destroyed) the structural integrity of the barn and related shed. The collapsed
house (also probably built by Rolf) also lacks integrity. As a result, the site is not considered
eligible for the NRHP, in the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists.

Site 41 TT415
Background Data
Site 41TT415 is a prehistoric site located on a low knoll above the confluence of two
intermittent tributaries of Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This knoll is approximately 20 min diameter
at the base and is a probable floodplain terrace remnant. Piney Creek lies to the west of the
confluence of the two drainages, with the nearest natural water source for the site being one of
the two Piney Creek tributaries located approximately 125 m north of the site. The site is located
in open improved pasture, with bermudagrass the dominant vegetation type. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and site elevation is 116 m msl. The site is extensively disturbed.
At least two barbed wire fence posts are placed on the site. The fence at this location has a gate,
which, when open, allows cattle to cross from one field to the next. An eroding cattle trail
transects the site east to west, and a deep cattle wallow is found on the north side of the site.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was recovered in
the first shovel test. An intensive surface survey was performed and five additional shovel tests
were excavated to assess the site and to determine the site boundary. No artifacts were observed
on the surface, although two of the additional shovel tests were culturally positive. Shovel tests
were excavated to depths varying between 70 cm and 1 m and revealed the soil to be a loamy sand,
becoming more clayey with depth. Positive shovel tests and topography suggest a site size of 20 x
15 m.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests at this site. One corticate quartzite
chip was recovered from Shovel Test 1, Level 8 (70-80 cm). Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test 3
yielded one secondary quartzite flake. One chert chip was observed but not collected from Level 2
(10-20 cm) of Shovel Test 6.

This site, 41 TT415, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on a knoll above
the confluence of two intermittent tributaries of Piney Creek. This site is of undetermined
temporal affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed either on the surface
or in the three shovel tests. The site represents little more than an isolated find and there does
not appear to be any distinct cultural horizon present. It is likely that the artifact recovered from
Level 8 was moved down in the profile by ground rodents, which may be seen in the area. Due
to the paucity of artifactual materials and extensive site disturbance, it is the opinion of the
investigators that the site has been sufficiently documented and should not be considered eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41 TT416
Background Data
Site 41 TT416 is an historic site located in an upland setting west of County Road
NW-37 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent drainage approximately
400 m northwest of the site. The land slopes gently to the northeast and, at present, the site lies
in open pasture, which limits ground surface visibility to less than five percent. The elevation of
the site is 149-150 m msl. This site is indicated on Figure 17, but not on Figure 16.
This site was first located by observation of the remains of three structures at the
location of a structure plotted on the 1936 County Highway map. These structures include a root
or storm cellar, a well, and a pumphouse. Also present on the site are two Purple Martin
birdhouses, a picnic table, and a fruit orchard. The root/storm cellar is constructed of "Corsicana
Brick Co." bricks and cement. There is a metal vent on the roof. The entrance to the cellar is on
the north side.
North-northwest of the cellar are a modern concrete culvert well and a brick
pumphouse which houses an electric pump. Brick fragments, clear and brown bottle glass,
whiteware, stoneware, wire nails and other metal fragments were seen sparsely scattered across the
surface of the site.
Testing Program
A total of four shovel tests was excavated in an attempt to locate the house remains.
Two of the shovel tests, 1 and 4, were culturally positive. These were located northeast of the
cellar and in between the cellar and the pumphouse, respectively. Testing revealed the soil to be
a loamy sand that extends below 80 cm below ground surface. Shovel Test 1 extended only to
30 cm, where a water pipe was uncovered. The site size is estimated to be 100 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 10 artifacts was recovered from the two positive shovel tests. Before the
water pipe was struck by Shovel Test 1, a simple clear glass-bottle fragment was recovered. A
sheet-metal fragment and two window-pane fragments were recovered from Level 1 of Shovel
Test 4, along with two window-pane fragments, a brick fragment, a four-penny wire nail and a clear
glass-jar fragment from Level 2. A single window-pane fragment was also found in Level 3 of
Shovel Test 4. No other artifacts were recorded from Shovel Test 4 despite continued excavation
to 80 cm below ground surface.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The map data from 1936 and archaeological materials present on the site suggest that
the location represents the remains of a former farmstead dating from ca. 1936. Although no
structural remains of the former house are present, the ancillary structures tend to substantiate the
conclusion that a former residence once occupied this location, as shown on the 1936 highway map.
The lack of early twentieth-century or earlier artifacts and the lack of a structure shown at this

location on the 1910 soil survey map suggest an occupation for the site dating from the 1930s. The
site is not unusual, nor is it a good example of a representative historic site from the study area.
In the opinion of the investigators, Site 41TT416 has been sufficiently documented and should not
be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT417
Background Data
Site 41TT417 is a prehistoric site located on the west side of an upland intermittent
drainage that ultimately flows into Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The intermittent drainage is
approximately 30 m southeast of the site and is the nearest natural water source. The site slopes
gently to the east towards the drainage. At present, the site lies on the edge of an open improved
pasture, with bermudagrass and other grasses the dominant vegetation type. Pine, oak, hickory,
and sassafras trees are present in the drainage and along the slopes below the site. A fence runs
east-west, bisecting the site. The ground surface visibility on the site is less than five percent, and
site elevation is 131-137 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was recovered
from the first shovel test placed at the site location. Five additional shovel tests were excavated
in the area. An intensive surface survey yielded two secondary quartzite flakes and three sherds.
The additional shovel tests were all culturally negative. Rodent activity was also noted over the
site area. The site area is about 60 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of six artifacts were found on the site, four of which were collected. Three
sherds were recovered from the surface just north of the fence. These include one brushed body
sherd, one plainware rim sherd, and one plainware body sherd, all grog-tempered. Level 5 (4050 cm) yielded one tertiary quartzite flake.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The sherds on the site's surface date it to the Caddo. It is possible, that the buried
piece of debitage represents another occupation; however, it is more likely that the flake was
displaced by rodent burrowing. The site has been greatly impacted by historical cultivation and by
bioturbation. At best, the site represents a moderate artifact density on the surface and a low
artifact density below ground surface. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site
offers little research potential and is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41 TT418
Background Data
Site 41 TT418 is a prehistoric site located on an upland toe ridge overlooking East
Piney Creek to the west of the site (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is East Piney
Creek, 100 m west of the site. The topography gently slopes to the northwest along the ridge, with
a more pronounced slope to the northeast and southwest. Although the 1965 field topographic
map indicates that this site is in open pasture, at present it lies in a wooded area with oak, pine,
elm, and some juniper. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent and the elevation of
the site is about 120 m msl.
Testing Program
This prehistoric site was located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
located in Shovel Test l. An intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests were
conducted in the area of the first shovel test, all with negative results. Shovel testing showed the
soil to be shallow, with brown sand over red sandy clay at a depth of approximately 30 cm. The
site size is estimated to be 5 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A quartzite corticate chip was recovered in
Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test l. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT418, is an isolated prehistoric artifact located in an upland setting. The
closest water source is East Piney Creek 100 m west of the site. This site is of undetermined
temporal affiliation, since no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed on the surface or in the
three shovel tests. The lack of cultural materials and the probable disturbance due to historic
clearing and subsequent slopewash lead to the conclusion that this site has likely lost much of its
original integrity. The site has a low potential to yield information pertinent to regional research
problems. It is the opinion of EH&A's consultants that this site has been sufficiently documented
and is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT419 (Hinson Site)
Background Data
Site 41 TT419 is an historic farmstead located north of and adjacent to FM 1734 at the
southern boundary of the study area (Figure A-1). This site is situated on the uplands and extends
onto a small ridge that protrudes into the Tankersley Creek drainage floodplain to the east of the
site. The nearest natural water source is Tankersley Creek, about 100 m away. At present, the
site lies in open improved pasture, with bermudagrass the dominant vegetation type. Sycamore and
hackberry trees are also present. The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent and elevation
of this site is approximately 117 m msl. The site is indicated on Figure 17, but not on Figure 16.

The farmstead includes a house and four ancillary structures. All are still in use and
in good condition. The house (Figure 33) is a one-and-a-half-story structure with detailing
associated with the Craftsman bungalow tradition, an architectural expression that gained
considerable popularity throughout the nation from the late 1910s to the late 1930s (McAlester and
McAlester 1984:452-462). The house rests on a pier-and-beam foundation and features a relatively
low-pitched, side-gabled roof with composition shingles. The exterior walls have 117/121 wood
siding over what is likely to be balloon-frame construction. The front, which faces south, is
symmetrically arranged, with doors in the inner bays and windows in the outer bays. The windows
on the front have four-over-four-light sashes, while windows on the other elevations have six-overone-light sashes. A three-bay porch with tapered box supports and brick pedestals extends across
the front. A small gabled dormer projects from the roof on the south elevation.
Other structures located on the property include a gambrel-roofed barn (Figure 34)
with corrugated metal covering and two gable-roofed barns to the east of the house (Figure 35).
A small brick-veneered shed stands behind the dwelling.
The site is located on a 67.36-acre tract in theJohnBecknell Survey (Abstract 60) that
was purchased in 1924 by W. L. Hinson from the heirs of M. L. Rogers (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 62, page 318). According to Hinson's son, the current owner, the house was built
in 1927 and has been occupied by members of the family since that time (Hinson 1987). A review
of mechanic's liens indexes failed to include Hinson's name, which suggests that he paid cash for
the house and its construction materials. Ad valorem tax rolls provided inconclusive evidence of
this improvement, as the property value actually dropped from $1,200 in 1925 to $1,000 in 1930.
By 1935, however, this parcel included W. L. Hinson's own "designated homestead". Alvin Hinson
acquired the house in 1959 and allows his own son (the third generation of the Hinson family) to
occupy the dwelling (Titus County Deed Records Volume 401, page 272; Hinson 1987).
Testing Program
The site was located during the vehicular structure survey of the study area and was
revisited during the pedestrian survey. Based upon extant farm buildings, site size is estimated at
about 150 x 60 m. Four shovel tests were eventually placed on the site, one on the north side of
each of the ancillary structures. The soils were a brown loamy sand about 60 cm deep over clay.
No artifacts were observed in the tests. Only the immediate yard of the house was not walked or
shovel tested, an area about 0.2 ha in size.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41TT419 is an excellent illustration of a side-gabled Craftsman bungalow, as
defined by McAlester and McAlester (1984:452-462). According to a former occupant (Hinson
1987), the structure was built in 1927 when similarly detailed dwellings were built in large numbers
throughout the nation. Although archival research (of tax rolls and mechanics liens) failed to
verify this construction date, the house's form and detailing are typical of Craftsman bungalows of
the 1920s. The dwelling retains its integrity to an exceptional degree and remains an outstanding
local example of the Craftsman bungalow style. In the opinion of EH&A's investigators, the house
may be eligible for the NRHP under criterion C. Several outbuildings stand nearby, but are of little
or no architectural significance. They have all been altered and possess no noteworthy architectural

for inclusion in the NRHP. Since shovel tests by the ancillary structures revealed no evidence for
prehistoric material, it is unlikely that the main house occupies a prehistoric site. Avoidance of
the main house is recommended.
Site 41TT420 (Damascus Cemetery)
Background Data
Site 41TT420 is an historic cemetery immediately west of County Road NW-12
(Figure A-1), and across the road from the Damascus Church, a modem brick structure. The site
is located in the uplands and slopes north down to a small intermittent drainage area that flows
into Tankersley Creek. Ultimately, the nearest natural water source is this intermittent drainage
approximately 300 m west of the site. The vegetation is comprised mostly of bermudagrass with
juniper trees, rose bushes, and crepe myrtle, with irises or daffodils also present. The ground
surface visibility is variable and the elevation of the site is 125 m msl. The cemetery is indicated
on both the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county highway map.
A survey of the cemetery (Figure 36), which is still active, revealed the oldest marked
grave stone to be that of W. L. Roberson, son of T. Q. and M. A, born May 31, 1875, died July 3,
1876. In general, the older graves are located towards the western side of the cemetery, where
there are also many unmarked graves. Most of these unmarked graves are marked with small
cement head- and footstones, although a few are of petrified wood or limonite. Some graves on
the east side of the prope_rty are swept and mounded.
The Damascus Church was organized in 1868 by Dr. I.R. Riddle, a prominent pioneer
in the area (Bragg 1987). The congregation met in a small log structure on land owned by Josh
Stevens. In 1869, he conveyed a 2-acre parcel to the congregation, and the deed describing the
transaction confirms that the "church house" stood on the property (Titus County Deed Records,
Volume 24, page 101). In 1879, the original log structure was replaced and the church served the
congregation for the next 73 years. No details of the church's construction were found. The
church acquired an additional property in 1889, when J.W. and Florence Edmonds donated two
acres to the church. According to the deed, the land was to be used as a "burial ground forever"
(Titus County Deed Records, Volume 24, page 103). The church remained an important local
landmark until 1967, when lack of membership forced its closing. Five years later, however, local
citizens reorganized the church, and it remains an active church group to the present. The extant
structure was completed in 1980, replacing one built in 1952 (Bragg 1987).
Testing Program
The site was first observed on the vehicular historic survey conducted with the EH&A
historian and was later revisited during the pedestrian survey. No shovel tests were conducted and
no artifacts were recovered. The cemetery covers an area about 27 x 38 m.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The cemetery and modern church (not a part of the site) will not be impacted by
TUMCO. Avoidance is recommended in accordance with TSCMRA. In the opinion of EH&A's
investigators, the cemetery does not meet the criteria of eligibility to the NRHP.
Site 41TT421
Background Data
Site 41TT421 is an extant residence and modern garage located just west of County
Road NW-4 in an upland area very near the Big Cypress Creek/White Oak Creek drainage basin
divide (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent drainage which lies 500 m
west of the site and flows southwest into Tankersley Creek. At present, this site has a manicured
lawn and is surrounded by open improved pasture. Pine, oak, and sweetgum trees are also present
on the site. The elevation of this site is 136 m msl. The site is indicated on the 1936 county
highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
The residence is an occupied one-story frame dwelling that faces northeast onto the
old Paris Road (Figure 37). The house has a clipped-gable roof with composition shingles and
exposed rafter ends. The front entrance is a single doorway that opens onto a two-bay, clippedgable porch. The original porch columns have been replaced with wrought-iron supports.
Asbestos shingles cover the exterior wall which likely have some type of wood siding underneath.
A small detached two-car garage stands southeast of the house.
Testing Program
The residence was viewed only from the road during the structure survey since
permission to survey or enter the yard was not obtained. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area
was not surveyed. Shovel tests were not conducted and no artifact collections were made. Based
solely upon the residential yard area, site size is estimated to be approximately 50 m in diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The house can be classified as a cross-gabled Craftsman bungalow (McAlester and
McAlester 1984:452-462) and was built about 1930, based upon an analysis of surviving historic
fabric. Since its construction, however, the dwelling has been considerably modified, including the
installation of wrought-iron supports on the porch and the application of asbestos siding on the
exterior walls, which compromise its integrity. Based upon the lack of artifacts from fields
surrounding the house and the upland setting of the structure, it is unlikely that the yard contains
a prehistoric component. Shovel testing for a prehistoric component is not recommended. It is
the opinion of EH&A's personnel that the house is not eligible for the NRHP.

Site 41 TT422
Background Data
Site 41 TT422 is an historic occupied residence located immediately west of County
Road NW-33 just north of the Forest Grove community (Figure A-1 ). Situated on the uplands near
the source of an upland drainage, the nearest natural water source, an intermittent tributary of
Tankersley Creek, is 100 m west of the site. The site is surrounded by open improved pasture,
with lawn grass and pine trees the dominant vegetation on the site. The elevation is 137 m msl.
A structure is indicated both on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) and the 1936 county highway
map (Figure 17).
The house at Site 41TT422 is located in the Hannah Northcut Survey (Abstract 416).
This parcel was part of a 100-acre tract J.R. Leftwich acquired from l.R. and H.L. Riddle in
December 1893 for $1,000. This deed also describes the survey as "Hannah Northcut alias Harrah
Fuller" (Titus County Deed Records Volume 12, page 473). J.R. Leftwich conveyed 16 acres of
this tract to D.M. Leftwich for $192 in March 1907 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 19,
page 503). The 1910 United States Census lists J.R. and Mary Leftwich as merchants, with three
children and two grandchildren living with them.
D.M. Leftwich had purchased 66.9 acres in the Northcut Survey in 1860 from J.C. and
C.G. Robertson (Titus County Deed Records Volume 17, page 439; Volume 19, page 389). D.M.
and M.E. Leftwich deeded 82.9 acres to J.E. Hollis for $800 in December 1907 (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 18, page 285). Two years later, J.E. and Maggie Hollis sold the land to Sarah
Lann for the same amount (Titus County Deed Records Volume 21, page 143). Between 1915 and
1920, the property value increased by $130.
In November 1923, P.D. Wood acquired the 82.9 acres from Mrs. Sarah A. Lann for
$1,500, nearly double the original purchase price. This probably reflects the construction of the
present house (Titus County Deed Records Volume 61, page 307). In 1924, a deed of trust was
executed by P.D. and Mary Jane Wood to M.H. Gossett (Titus County Deed of Trust Records
Volume 3, page 205). Evidently, P.D. Wood was unable to pay the loan because in July 1936, the
Federal Land Bank of Houston conveyed 82.9 acres to Irl Crowder for $829 (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 110, page 155). The 1935 ad valorem tax rolls do list the tract as P.D. Wood's
homestead.
In February 1938, Irl Crowder deeded the tract to E.M. Lide for $10 and the
"assumption of the balance due the Federal Land Bank of Houston" (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 110, page 159). E.M. Lide sold 6.1 acres to Alvis and Ione Franklin in February 1943 for
$122 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 131, page 94). The tract has changed ownership
several times since 1943.
Although little of its original detailing is discernible from the highway, the house
appears to be a shotgun dwelling with a front-gabled roof (Figure 38). A large board-and-batten
addition has been built onto the front and north side, thereby obscuring much of its original
appearance. The south side is relatively unaltered, and the 117/121 siding and four-over-four-light
windows are intact.

Testing Program
The site was first observed during the vehicular historic structure survey of the study
area by the EH&A historian. As shown on Figure A-1, survey on the property was not allowed
and access was not obtained. Based upon lawn and house location, site size is estimated to be
approximately 50 m in diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Deed research and the type of siding and the window configurations suggest that the
present house was built between 1920 and 1923, although little of its original fabric remains visible.
Because of modern alterations and additions, the present structure has lost much of its historic
character and integrity. As such, the house is not eligible for listing in the NRHP, in the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists. Archival research shed little light on an alleged structure at this
location in 1910. Values of the property varied little, as shown by the $1,000 paid for 100 acres
in 1893 and by $800 for 83 acres in 1907. If a structure was present in 1910, the period land prices
suggest a structure of little value (e.g., a shed or corral). Additionally, shovel testing to identify
prehistoric evidence on the property on which the house is located is not recommended because
surrounding properties which were shovel tested revealed no such materials. The upland setting
of the house has a low potential for prehistoric resources.
Site 41 TT423
Background Data
Site 41TT423 is an historic occupied residence located north of the Forest Grove
Community and immediately west of County Road NW-33 (Figure A-1). Situated in the uplands,
this site lies near the drainage basin boundary between Big Cypress Creek and White Oak Creek.
The nearest natural water source is approximately 380 m northeast of the site, an intermittent
tributary of Piney Creek. The site area is surrounded by open improved pasture. Vegetation on
the site includes various lawn grasses and oak trees, and site elevation is 133 m msl. This site is
indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
The structure is a one-story frame dwelling (Figure 39). With a cross-gabled roof, the
house has exterior walls with vinyl or aluminum siding which probably covers some type of wood
siding. A variety of double-hung windows are present and have four-over-four, nine-over-nine, or
twelve-over-twelve lights. A small one-bay porch is set within the southeast corner of the frontprojecting gabled extension. A single wrought-iron column supports the porch at the corner.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during a vehicular historic structure survey of the study
area by the EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were recovered from
the site since property access was not obtained (Figure A-1 ). The site size is estimated to be about
50 m in diameter.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The site exhibits architectural features that are commonly associated with the
Craftsman bungalow, and McAlester and McAlester (1984:452-462) have defined the cross-gabled
bungalow as an important subtype of this twentieth-century style. Based upon the form and type
of details, the house likely was built in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Earlier examples, such as
41 TT419 and 41 TT425, have more noteworthy architectural features, unlike this dwelling, which
is relatively sparse and straightforward in its detailing. Numerous alterations, including the
wrought-iron porch support and the man-made siding, detract from its historic character. Because
it has lost much of its integrity and is only a typical example of a very common house-type, the
structure is not believed, in the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, to be eligible for listing in the
NRHP. Because survey on tracts of land surrounding the property found no evidence for
prehistoric materials, the property tract on which the house is located is thought to have a low
potential for prehistoric materials.
Site 41 TT424
Background Data
Site 41 TT424 is an historic occupied residence located near the intersection of
FM 2152 and County Road NW-26 very near the Green Hill Community (Figure A-1). The site
is situated on the broad uplands with very little slope present, and the nearest natural water source
is an intermittent tributary of Piney Creek located approximately 300 m southwest of the site.
Surrounded by open improved pasture, the vegetation on the site includes oak, crepe myrtle, and
briars along the fencelines. The elevation of the site is about 124 m msl. This structure is
indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not the 1910 soil survey map.
The house is a one-story frame dwelling with a gabled front (Figure 40). The walls
have drop siding and double-hung windows with six-over-six lights. A screened inset porch is set
within the north end of the front.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during an historic structure survey conducted by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected on this site since
yard access was not obtained. Approximately 0.2 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Estimated site
size is about 50 min diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT424 is a vernacular interpretation of the front-gabled Craftsman bungalow
style which was popular from the 1910s to the 1930s. The house's location is indicated on the 1936
county highway map (Figure 17), but the lack of any significant architectural detailing, which
characterized early versions of the style, suggests that it was built in the early to middle 1930s. The
house is not a particularly outstanding example of this house type and therefore is not judged to
be architecturally significant. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the house does not meet
any of the NRHP criteria and has been adequately documented. Based upon survey and shovel

tests on fields surrounding the house and yard, shovel testing to locate a prehistoric component
is not recommended. The house location is thought to have a low potential for prehistoric site
occurrence.
Site 41TT425 (Blackstone Residence)
Background Data
Site 41TT425 is an historic occupied residence located on the south side of County
Road NW-24 on a broad upland area (Figure A-1). This site is situated on the interfluve between
two intermittent drainages that flow west into Piney Creek. The nearest natural water source is one
of these intermittent drainages, which is 170 m south of the site. The site is surrounded by open
improved pasture with oak and various domestic lawn grasses and shrubs located on the site. The
elevation of this site is 124 m msl. This structure is indicated on the 1936 County highway map,
but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
Although it can be classified as a vernacular structure, this one-story frame house
displays some Neoclassical detailing (Figure 41). It rests on a pier-and-beam foundation and has
a hipped roof with composition shingles. Exterior walls feature 117/121 wood siding over,
presumably, balloon-frame construction. The front faces north into a county road. The primary
entrance is set within a seven-bay, L-shaped porch that extends to the east elevation. The single
door is flanked on each side with sidelights and is capped with transoms. The windows are double
hung with one-over-one lights and wood sashes. Other noteworthy features include the broad
unadorned frieze below the boxed eaves and a brick interior chimney that extends from the west
side of the hipped roof. Although access to the interior was not granted as part of this field
investigation, the front-projecting room at the northwest corner and the centrally located doorway
in the front suggest that the house has a central-passage plan.
Two outbuildings associated with the house stand nearby and include a frame garage
and a metal barn, both of which are of modern construction.
This house is located on a 43-acre tract in the Berry Merchant Survey (Abstract 359).
The earliest documented owner ofland that includes this dwelling is J. T. and Viola Roberson who
conveyed a 25-acre parcel to T. R. Blackstone in 1900 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 13,
page 405). The purchase price was $255, a relatively low value at that time. Although
Blackstone's name does not appear in the 1900 census for Titus County, it is listed in the county's
ad valorem tax rolls but not as a property holder. By 1905, however, Blackstone (whose name is
sometimes spelled Blackston) is cited as the owner of a 40-acre tract in the Berry Merchant Survey.
In subsequent years, he acquired more property, but its value maintained the same relative
assessment (about $10 per acre) until the late 1910s. A moderate increase is indicated between
1915 and 1920, which possibly indicates the construction of the extant house. Another scenario
explaining this rise could stem from a general reassessment of property values by county tax
officials. Such a conclusion is likely, because this trend was evident in tax roll research of other
properties in the study area.
Blackstone, according to the 1910 census, was a farmer born in Texas in 1871. He and
his wife Elvira, also a native Texan, had been married for 15 years, and all four of their children

10723/880206

1,83

lived with them. Their oldest child, Willis, was 14 years old and listed his occupation as farm
laborer.
The Blackstone family continued their association with the land in later years. By
1935, when the State Comptroller added the category "homestead designation" to ad valorem tax
rolls, the Blackstone residence is noted on a 72-acre parcel in the Berry Merchant Survey. Local
informants (Bragg 1987; Deaton 1987; and Franklin 1987) confirm the extant structure to be the
Blackstone residence. On September 30, 1945, T. R. Blackstone died and his widow sold the land
to their son, W.E. Blackstone, early the next year (Mt. Pleasant Public Library Cemetery Records;
Titus County Deed Records Volume 152, page 162). He later conveyed the house and property
to Margaret and Mary Ann Blackstone, the current owners (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 410, page 293).
Testing Program
Site 41TT425 was first observed during a vehicular historic structure survey conducted
by the EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated on the site since yard access was not
obtained. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Estimated site size is 50 m
in diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Although the house is a vernacular structure, it exhibits modest Neoclassical details,
including the molded frieze that extends beneath the eaves of the house and the Doric-like
columns on the porch. Such features were quite popular during the early years of this century.
While tax roll data shed little light as to the possible construction date, as does information
gathered from local informants, the EH&A historian has concluded that the house likely was
erected for T. R. Blackstone between 1900 and 1910.
The structure remains virtually unaltered, and the most intrusive nonhistoric element
is the modern screen door at the front entrance. Because the house stands as a good and intact
example of an early twentieth-century dwelling with some Neoclassical detailing, EH&A's
archaeologists believe that the house may be eligible for the NRHP under criterion "C".
Avoidance is recommended. Shovel testing of the yard is not recommended, since there was no
evidence for cultural materials in fields surrounding the house.
Site 41 TT426
Background Data
Site 41TT426 is an historic occupied residence located on the broad uplands at the
intersection of Highway 271 and County Road NW-24 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water
source is an intermittent drainage located 280 m east of the site and flows into Piney Creek.
Vegetation on the site includes manicured lawn grass and oak trees. The elevation of the site is
131 m msl. This is indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey
map.

10723/880206

184

The house is a one-story front-gabled dwelling with frame construction and drop siding
(Figure 42). The roof is covered with composition shingles and has exposed rafter ends at the
eaves. A five-bay hipped porch extends across the front. Two single-door entrances open onto this
porch. The windows are double hung with one-over-one lights and wood sashes.
Testing Program
The site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected since yard access
was not obtained. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Estimated site size
is about 50 min diameter. Survey of fields surrounding the yard found no evidence for cultural
materials.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This house is yet another local example of a vernacular residence with some
Craftsman bungalow detailing and can be classified as a front-gabled subtype of this popular house
form. The house is indicated on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17), and is believed to have
been built in the 1930s. The structure is not a particularly noteworthy example of the Craftsman
bungalow style and is not considered to be architecturally significant. EH&A's archaeologists
conclude that the site has been adequately documented and is not eligible for NRHP listing. The
lack of prehistoric materials on surrounding fields strongly suggests that house's location has a low
probability for site occurrence. No further investigation is recommended.
Site 41 TT427
Background Data
Site 41 TT427 is an historic occupied residence located on the west side of
Highway 271 (Figure A-1). Situated above the confluence of two intermittent tributaries of Piney
Creek, this site is located on the uplands. The nearest natural water source is one of these
tributaries, which is 180 m south of the site. The site is surrounded by open improved pasture with
pine, sweetgum, and oak trees on the site. The elevation of this site is 127 m msl. This site is not
indicated on either the 1936 county highway map or the 1910 soil survey map.
The residence is a one-story frame dwelling with beveled siding and a side-gabled roof
(Figure 43). Composition shingles cover the roof, which has exposed rafter ends, a distinctive
feature of the Craftsman bungalow tradition. A small clipped-gable porch marks the front, singledoor entrance. This porch has wrought-iron supports and a concrete floor. The double-hung
windows are grouped in pairs and have wood sashes with one-over-one lights. A one-story addition
with a large exterior brick chimney extends from the north end of the house.
Testing Program
The site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected since property
access was not obtained. The area not surveyed is shown on Figure A-1. Estimated site size is

SO min diameter. Later pedestrian smvey of fields surrounding the property on which the house
is located found no cultural materials.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This house can be classified as an example of a side-gabled Craftsman bungalow
(McAlester and McAlester 1984:4S2-462). Although its date of construction is unknown, the house
is not indicated on Figure 17. Architectural details, such as the clipped-gabled porch, suggest a ca.
1930s completion date.
Although a good illustration of the Craftsman tradition, the house has been altered,
including the porch floor and supports, as well as the addition on the structure's north end.
Moreover, better and more intact examples of the style, such as 41TT419 and 41TT43S, can be
found in the area. In the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, the site has been adequately
documented and is not eligible for listing in the NRHP. The lack of evidence for prehistoric
remains in fields surrounding the property indicate that a prehistoric component is not likely in
the yard. No further investigation is recommended.
Site 41TT428
Background Data
Site 41 TT428 is an historic abandoned residence located west of Highway 271 at the
intersection of Highway 271 and Loop 419 (Figure A-1). This site is situated on the broad uplands
with a slight slope to the south. The nearest natural water source is the head of an intermittent
drainage, which is 90 m south of the site and which ultimately drains into Hayes Creek. The site
is surrounded by open improved pasture, although bermudagrass and various trees are found on
the site. The elevation of this site is 138 m msl. The site is located neither on the 1910 soil survey
map (Figure 16) nor on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17).
The structure is an historic dwelling that is unoccupied but remains in fair but stable
condition (Figure 44). A steeply pitched hipped roof with composition shingles is the house's
dominant architectural feature. The dwelling rests on a pier-and-beam foundation and utilizes
frame construction with 117/121 wood siding. An inset porch at the northwest corner of the house
marks the primary entrance, although some of the porch posts have been removed. U.S.
Highway 271 runs east of the residence but the front faces north, away from the road. While some
of the original, wood-sash, double-hung windows with one-over-one lights have survived, most have
been replaced with modern aluminum-sash equivalents.
This site occupies a 38.26-acre parcel in the Hannah Northcutt Survey (Abstract 416),
but prior to 194S was part of a larger SO-acre tract. The earliest transaction involving this land and
examined in conjunction with this investigation occurred on December 4, 1900, when N. F. Harbor
acquired the SO acres from J .A. Reed for $400 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 12, page 21S).
The land retained its relatively low value in the years immediately afterward. In 190S, the property
was purchased by T. B. Caldwell for $460 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 11, page 460).
Ad valorem tax rolls for 190S show Caldwell as the owner of over 1,800 acres in the county;
however, this SO-acre parcel is not included in the listing.

10723/880206

188

Figure 44. Residence at 41 TT428. View to the west.

189

In 1908, Caldwell conveyed the property to C. F. O'dea (alternately spelled O'Dea)
for $650 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 36, page 272). O'dea, as reported in the 1910
census, was born in Alabama about 1882 and cited farming as his occupation. He had been
married to his wife Alice, a native Texan, for seven years and their two children, aged four and two
years, were born in the state. Although ad valorem tax rolls show a modest increase during O'dea's
period of ownership (the value increased from $350 in 1910 to $400 by 1915), the land was
significantly more valuable when O'dea sold the property to T. R. McLean for $2,000 on
December 10, 1917 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 36, page 497). McLean, in turn,
conveyed the 50 acres to M. J. James later that day for the same purchase price (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 36, page 495). James is listed as the owner in ad valorem tax rolls by 1920,
but the assessed value stood at $500, significantly less than the amount he paid for the property.
In subsequent years, the assessment remained at that level.
John R. Edwards acquired the land on February 6, 1928, for $1,000 and the
assumption of a $759.58 note due to the Federal Land Bank (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 67, page 456). By 1935, ad valorem tax rolls confirm a house, located on this 50-acre
parcel in the Hannah Northcutt Survey, that was described as Edwards' "designated homestead".
In 1937, Edwards conveyed a 2.44-acre strip of land to the State of Texas for the right-of-way for
U.S. Highway 271 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 110, page 10).
Testing Program
The site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. Six shovel tests were excavated in the yard, four of which were culturally
negative. Sandy loam soils were found to 40 cm deep and overlying clay. Site size is estimated to
be about 50 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Debris observed on the site surface included broken glass, nails, aluminum cans, and
wire, all modern materials. From Shovel Test 1, placed in the backyard, a milk glass fragment and
a crockery fragment were uncovered at about 5 cm below ground surface. An aluminum pop top
and a clear glass fragment were uncovered in Shovel Test 5 about 10 cm below ground surface.
Shovel Test 5 was placed in the front yard. All six tests were excavated to clay and no other
cultural materials were encountered.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Shovel testing revealed no evidence for nineteenth-century artifacts or a prehistoric
component on the site. This frame dwelling is classified as a vernacular interpretation of a hiproofed bungalow, a common subtype of the Craftsman bungalow house form, as defined by
McAlester and McAlester (1984:463). Distinguishing features include the hip roof and inset porch.
Deed and archival research suggests that the house probably was built for C. F. O'dea, although
a mechanic's lien which could establish an exact date of construction was not filed at the county
courthouse. The house is in poor condition and has been altered. Because other, better examples
of this house type exist in the area, such as 41 TT425, the dwelling is not considered, in the opinion

believe that the site is not eligible for the NRHP and has been adequately documented.
Site 41TT429 (Rogers House)
Background Data
Site 41 TT429 is an historic occupied site located just southeast of the Forest Grove
community on the east side of County Road NW-4 (Figure A-1). The site is situated on the
uplands with the nearest natural water source, an intermittent tributary of Tankersley Creek, 95 m
north west of the site. Although the site is surrounded by open improved pasture, cedar, walnut,
and oak trees are present on the site. The elevation of this site is 135 m msl. This site is indicated
on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
Set back from a paved road that extends to the Forest Grove community,
Site 41 TT429 is an extant historic dwelling that remains in good condition (Figure 45). Its
architectural detailing is modest and unpretentious, yet it exhibits features typically associated with
hip-roofed bungalows. Such a house-type was common throughout much of urban and rural Texas
during the 1920s and 1930s. The house has a four-bay inset porch with squared wood posts. Two
single-door entrances open onto the porch and provide access to the interior. The windows are
double hung with wood sashes and four-over-four lights.
The house stands on a 62.3-acre parcel in the H.C. Campbell Survey (Abstract 131)
and is known locally as the Rogers House (Bragg 1987; Hinson 1987). Archival research confirms
that the house was owned by M.L. Rogers as early as 1920; however, efforts to determine previous
owners were unsuccessful. Ad valorem tax records for 1915 list several members of the Rogers
family as residents of Titus County, but none paid taxes or property in the Campbell Survey.
Census records indicate that M.L. Rogers lived in Titus County by 1900 although the location of
his residence is unknown at this time. Rogers was a farmer who was born in Alabama in 1860.
He and his family moved to Texas from Arkansas between 1891and1894. B.G. Rogers, one of
M.L. and Annie Rogers' sons, acquired the property from various members of the family in 193940 (Titus County Deed Records, Volume 15, page 453; Volume 120, page 179; Volume 119,
page 339). In 1974, Luther Rogers Hinson, a nephew of B.G. Rogers, acquired the property but
sold it to Mark and Debe McKellar, the present owners, in 1985 (Titus County Deed Records,
Volume 394, page 466; Volume 481, page 658).
Testing Program
The site was first observed on an historic structure survey of the study area conducted
by the EH&A historian. Yard access was not obtained. No shovel tests were excavated and no
artifacts were collected. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Site size is
estimated to be about 50 m in diameter. Survey and shovel testing conducted on fields surrounding
the yard revealed no cultural materials.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT429 is an intact vernacular dwelling whose most distinctive architectural
feature is a steeply pitched hipped roof. This house type was popular in Texas and other parts of
the country during the first and second decades of this century, and numerous extant examples are
found in this section of Titus County. Although a relatively good illustration of this house-type,
Site 41 TT429 has been altered slightly, and such changes as the concrete porch floor and the wood
posts are insensitive to the structure's historic character and integrity. Because better examples
exist within the study area (41 TT425), this house is not believed, in the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists, to be eligible for listing in the NRHP. The lack of prehistoric sites surrounding the
house indicate that the yard has a low potential for prehistoric site occurrence. No further
investigation is recommended.
Site 41TT430
Background Data
Site 41 TT430 is an historic site located near the intersection of Loop 419 and County
Road NW-35 (Figure A-1). The site is situated on a broad upland area on the east side of County
Road NW-35. The nearest natural water source is an intermittent drainage 240 m southwest of
the site, which flows into Hayes Creek. The site is surrounded by open improved pasture, although
other vegetation, including lawn grass, pine and oak trees, is present on the site. The elevation
of this site is 141 m msl.
Site 41 TT430 is another hip-roofed bungalow, a house type found frequently
throughout the study area (Figure 46). With a pier-and-beam foundation and a slightly tapered
skirt wall, the dwelling is a one-story frame structure sheathed with drop siding. The expansive
hipped roof is the house's most distinctive physical feature. The roof has composition or asphalt
shingles and a simply detailed brick chimney that rises from the western slope of the roof. Two
single-door entrances open onto a two-bay inset porch at the southwest corner of the house. The
windows are double hung with wood sashes and one-over-one lights. A frame barn (Figure 47)
with a gambrel roof stands southeast of the house on the south side of a chain-link fence that
surrounds the residence.
Both structures are located on a 17.8-acre parcel in the northwest corner of the
William Porter Survey (Abstract 437). This tract ofland was carved from a 320-acre parcel (which
encompassed the entire Porter Survey) purchased by E. H. Gregory and J. J. Hays, Jr. in 1902
(Titus County Deed Records Volume 13, page 46). The land was sold for less than three dollars
per acre. Two years later, Gregory and Hays divided the property, with Gregory obtaining the
western half. On January 11, 1910, Gregory conveyed 20 acres, including the land on which
Site 41 TT430 is located, to his daughter, Annie, and her husband, A. A. Riddle (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 22, page 217). Although no money was exchanged in this transaction (i.e.,
it was given to the Riddles), ad valorem tax rolls indicate that the property was worth an assessed
value of $140.
Charles 0. Lide acquired the property in 1916 (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 34, page 593). However, ad valorem tax rolls do not reflect his ownership. None of his

landholdings, which were greatest in Mt. Pleasant, included property in the William Porter Survey.
As a result, the likelihood of his occupying the structure is small. Titus County Deed Records
(Volume 124, page 390) indicate that Benny H. Dillard purchased the property from Lide on
January 31, 1942, and local informants still refer to this structure as the Dillard House (Franklin,
personal communication 1987). Ad valorem tax rolls confirm that a house was located on this
land.
Testing Program
The site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area
conducted by the EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected,
since property access was denied. Figure A-1 shows the property area not surveyed. Based upon
structure location, site size is estimated to be approximately 50 x 200 m.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Although the house is in an area where survey was not conducted, the fields
immediately north of the structure were surveyed. No evidence for cultural materials was found.
Located on a flat upland on which survey found no prehistoric resources, it is unlikely that the yard
contains a prehistoric site.
The house is a noteworthy and excellent example of a hip-roofed bungalow, as
described by McAlester and McAlester (1984:452-462). Except for the awnings on the porch and
front window, the house is virtually unaltered and retains its historic character and integrity. The
integrity of the barn has not been compromised, either. Both the 1910 and 1936 maps show a
structure at this location, dating the site to at least the early 1900s. Insufficient data has been
uncovered regarding the history of the house, its occupants and its associated barn. As a result,
EH&A's archaeologists cannot fully assess the site's historic significance and further investigation,
particularly oral histories, is recommended. Investigation to determine if prehistoric materials are
present on the site is not recommended.
Site 41 TT431
Background Data
Site 41 TT431 is an historic occupied residence located on the uplands east of County
Road NW-35 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is the head of an intermittent
drainage which is located 90 m northwest of the site and drains into Piney Creek. The dominant
vegetation on the site is bermudagrass, with oak and elm trees also present. The elevation of the
site is 143 m msl. This site is indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil
survey map.
The residence is a one-story frame dwelling that rests on a pier-and-beam foundation
(Figure 48). The gabled roof is covered with composition shingles and has box eaves. The
windows are grouped in pairs, but the original wood-sash windows have been replaced with
aluminum-sash equivalents. A small, partially inset porch is located at the southwest corner of the

10723/880206

196

Figure 48. Residence at 41 TT431. View to the northeast.

197

house. Its original supports, which likely were tapered box columns, have been removed and wood
posts installed in their place.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during an historic structure survey conducted by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected since property
access was denied (Figure A-1). Site size is estimated to be about 50 min diameter. Later survey
and shovel testing on fields across the highway west of the house found no cultural materials.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The structure can be classified as a front-gabled Craftsman bungalow, a subtype of this
popular architectural movement of the early twentieth century. It probably was built in the late
1920s or early 1930s and is noted on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17). Porch and window
changes compromise its historic integrity. The site, in the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists, does
not meet NRHP criteria. Although the house is located in an area not surveyed, the flat upland
location is thought by EH&A to have a low potential for prehistoric occupation. This conclusion
is based on surrounding survey (e.g., across the street) which found no evidence for prehistoric
resources. No further investigation is recommended.
Site 41 TT432
Background Data
Site 41 TT432 is an historic occupied residence located on the west side of County
Road NW-35 in an upland area (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent
drainage which flows into Piney Creek and is 180 m north of the site. The site is surrounded by
open improved pasture, although other species of vegetation are located on the site, including oak
trees. The elevation of this site is 139 m msl. This house is indicated neither on the 1936 county
highway map (Figure 17) nor on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
Facing east toward a paved county road, Site 41TT432 includes a small one-story
frame dwelling with a front-gabled roof (Figure 49). Shed additions have been built on the north,
south and west elevations, and all of the walls, including those of the original structure, are covered
with asphalt-shingle siding that presents a brick-like appearance. The windows are modern with
aluminum sashes. Access to the interior is gained by way of a centrally placed, single doorway in
the original structure.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area
conducted by the EH&A historian. Because yard access was not obtained, no shovel tests were
excavated and no artifacts were collected. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not
surveyed. Site size is estimated to be about 50 min diameter. Survey and shovel testing conducted
later in fields around the house and yard revealed no cultural materials.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
As initially built, the house could be classified as shotgun-style; however, the dwelling
has been altered severely over time and little of its original fabric is discernible. The house does
not appear on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17); therefore, its date of construction is
estimated to be the late 1930s. Because the structure lacks architectural integrity, EH&A's
archaeologists believe that the site is not eligible for listing in the NRHP. Since surrounding
survey found no evidence for prehistoric cultural materials, EH&A considers the yard of the house
to have a low potential for prehistoric resources. No further investigation is recommended.

Site 41 TT433
Background Data
Site 41TT433 is an historic residence located just north of 41 TT432 on the west side
of County Road NW-35 (Figure A-1). This site is also situated on the same upland landform as
41 TT432. The nearest natural water source is an intermittent drainage which is located 100 m
north of the site and flows into Piney Creek. Like 41 TT432, this site is surrounded by open
improved pasture, with large oak trees and lawn grasses present on the site. The elevation of this
site is 139 m msl. The site is indicated on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17), but not on
the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16).
The house is a one-story frame dwelling that remains occupied (Figure 50). It has
shiplap siding and a front-gabled roof with composition shingles and exposed rafter ends. A small
two-bay porch, set within the northeast corner of the house, has two metal supports/columns and
a concrete floor. The windows are double hung with wood sashes and one-over-one lights. One
window, at the east end of the south elevation, has been removed and its opening has been
enclosed with shiplap siding that resembles that of the rest of the house. A gable-roofed barn, in
deteriorated condition, stands northwest of the house. The barn features balloon-frame
construction and weatherboard siding, although some lumber pieces are missing.
Testing Program
The site was first observed during an historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated in the yard and no artifacts were collected.
Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Estimated site size is about 50 m in
diameter. Surrounding fields surveyed for cultural resources found no cultural artifacts.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The dwelling appears as another example of vernacular interpretation of a front-gabled
Craftsman bungalow (McAlester and McAlester 1984:452-462). Its detailing and features, such as
the grouped windows and exposed rafter ends, suggest a 1930s construction date. In addition, the
house is indicated on the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17). Alterations, such as the porch
changes and the window enclosure, compromise its integrity. In the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists, the site has been adequately documented and is not eligible for listing in the
NRHP. Because the surrounding area contained no evidence for prehistoric resources in this

immediate area, the yard of the house is not likely to include a prehistoric component. No further
investigation is recommended.
Site 41TT434 (Baxley House)
Background Data
Site 41TT434 is an historic occupied residence located west of FM 2152 and south of
County Road NW-24 (Figure A-1). The site is situated on an upland area on the interfluve
between two drainage heads. The site is surrounded by open improved pasture; however,
manicured lawn grasses, pine, cedar, and crepe myrtle trees are present on the site. The elevation
of this site is 151 m msl. This site is indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the
1910 soil survey map.
The residence is a one-story frame dwelling located just west of FM 2152. The house
is still occupied and remains in fair condition (Figure 51). It rests on a concrete-block foundation
that possibly replaced an earlier wood-post, pier-and-beam support system. A gable roof extends
across the eastern (front) section of the house, while a hipped roof caps the rear portion. A brick
chimney with a corbeled cap rises from the south gable end. A shed-roofed porch is attached to
the east elevation and protects the single-door primary entrance. The porch has exposed rafter
ends and square wooden posts. Such details are not typical of the period in which the house was
probably built and likely indicate that the present porch is a replacement. Other alterations
include the modern aluminum-sash windows, although a few of the original one-over-one light
windows with wood sashes are still in place.
Site 41 TT434 is located on a 32.5-acre tract in the Thomas McPeters Survey
(Abstract 374). Earlier, this parcel was a component of a 120-acre tract that was owned by Eva
and Porte Ransom of New York. In 1895, they conveyed the land to W. A and Minerva Baxley
for $120 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 1, page 27). Census records for 1900 note a "Dack"
Baxley, aged 45, married to Minerva Baxley, aged 42. These individuals are assumed to be those
associated with this property, because the 1910 census lists a W.A and Minerva Baxley,
respectively, at 55 and 52 years of age. In both enumerations, Baxley was tallied as a farmer. Ad
valorem tax rolls record his steady financial success over the years, as his property and livestock
holdings increased in value. Between 1900 and 1905, for example, his acreage in the McPeters
Survey doubled in value, probably reflecting the construction of the house.
The Baxleys retained title to the entire parcel until 1922, when they partitioned a 40acre tract for their daughter Thelma Baxley. No money was involved; however, the deed notes that
the land" ... together with all houses and improvements thereon located ... " be conveyed to her
(Titus County Deed Records Volume 67, page 357). By 1935, Thelma Baxley's homestead was
located on this parcel, according to ad valorem tax rolls.
R. B. "Bev" Gilpin acquired the land on August 25, 1939 for $1,226 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 114, page 551). He resided there until his death and in 1954, his heirs,
including his wife, Ruby Gilpin, sold the land to John H. and Cappie Reid, the present owners
(Titus County Deed Records Volume 212, page 185).

Testing Program
The site was first observed during a historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected since property
access was denied (Figure A-1). Site size is estimated to be about 50 min diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Although this structure is not indicated on the 1910 soil survey map, archival research
suggests that the house was built between 1900 and 1905 for W. A and Minerva Baxley. The
dwelling is a hybrid retaining many characteristics associated with vernacular structures (the form
of the front rooms, for example, is indicative of center-passage houses which were popular in Texas
throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century), while incorporating other elements of the
burgeoning popular architectural movement. The 117/121 siding is a good example of this new
trend. Alterations in recent years have compromised the integrity of structure and it has lost much
of its integrity. Because the structure lacks architectural significance and is not associated with any
locally important individuals or events, the site appears ineligible for NRHP listing, in the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists. Although the site is located in an area not surveyed, survey of upland
areas to the south and east of the house revealed no evidence for prehistoric resources. It is also
felt that shovel testing conducted to locate early twentieth-century artifacts would reveal little not
already learned about the structure and little new information pertaining to the twentieth century.
No further investigation is recommended.
Site 41TT435 (Edwards House)
Background Data
Site 41 TT435 is an historic site located west of FM 2152 and north of County
Road NW-12 on the south-central boundary of the study area (Figure A-1). This site is located on
the high point of a broad upland interfluve between two erosional gullies leading to an intermittent
tributary of Tankersley Creek. The nearest natural water source is this tributary 280 m to the west
of the site. The elevation of the site is 137 m msl.
Facing east toward FM 2152, the house at Site 41 TT435 is a cross-gabled Craftsman
bungalow (Figure 52), as defined by McAlester and McAlester (1984:452-462). It is a one-story
frame dwelling with 117/121 wood siding. As its architectural classification connotes, the house
has a gabled roof over the main section with gabled extensions that project at 90-degree angles.
The roof is covered with composition shingles and features exposed rafter ends at the eaves. The
gable ends display a half-timbered-like motif with vertically placed boards. A single doorway on the
east elevation serves as the primary entrance and opens onto a porch with front- and side-facing
gables. Squared brick columns support the porch. Grouped in threes, the windows are double
hung with wood sashes. The upper sashes have muntins which appear as a series of three adjoined
Latin crosses. Such geometric designs are strongly associated with Prairie- and Craftsman-style
traditions. A gabled porte cochere extends from the south side of the house.
Presently situated on a small two-acre parcel in the J. J. Dew Survey (Abstract 156),
the house at Site 41 TT435 earlier had been a part of a 102-acre tract. The earliest known owners

10723/880206

204

Figure 52. Residence at 41 TT435. View to the southwest.

205

were W. N. and Mattie Nugent, who conveyed the property to C. T. Ludlow in 1901 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 10, page 62). Although Ludlow is not listed in the 1900 ad valorem tax
rolls, he does appear as the owner of 104 acres in the Dew Survey (the discrepancy in acreage
between tax and deed records cannot be explained) by 1905. The assessed value of the property
was $1,200. In subsequent years, the land increased slightly in value, rising to $1,250 in 1910. Five
years later Ludlow conveyed the property to W. M. Edwards (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 34, page 371). During Edwards' ownership, the land's value increased to $2,000by1920,
which possibly indicates the construction of the house by that time. A review of mechanic's liens
on file at the Titus County Courthouse failed to verify an exact date of construction. Possibly,
Edwards paid cash for the house's construction and no lien was filed. Mt. Pleasant merchant John
A Cooper purchased the property in 1924 and resided there until his death two years later (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 56, page 502; Probate Records Volume 10, page 106). George Lee
Keith acquired the house and land in 1929 and retained possession until 1942 (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 70, page 552; Volume 126, page 234). Since that time, the property has changed
owners several times.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during a historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected since yard access
was not obtained. Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area was not surveyed. Site size is
estimated to be approximately 50 m in diameter. Later survey conducted over fields surrounding
the house and yard found no evidence for cultural materials.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Tax rolls suggest that the house was built in the mid-1910s for W. M. Edwards. It
stands today as a noteworthy example of a Craftsman bungalow, a popular architectural style in this
section of the county. While similarly styled structures are extant in the area, this is one of the
least altered and best preserved. In the opinion of EH&A archaeologists, the house meets criterion
C and may therefore be eligible for listing in the NRHP. Avoidance is recommended. Based upon
the house's topographic upland setting and the fact that no prehistoric materials were found in
surrounding fields, shovel testing of the yard to test for prehistoric remains is not recommended.
Site 41TT436
Background Data
Site 41TT436 is an historic occupied residence located west of Loop 419 at the
intersection of County Road NW-35 and Loop 419 (Figure A-1). The site is situated in an upland
area with a slight slope to the southwest. The nearest natural water source is an intermittent
drainage which is 100 m southwest of the site and drains into Hayes Creek. The vegetation on the
site is predominantly bermudagrass; however, pine and oak trees are also present on the site. The
elevation of this site is 136 m msl. This site is indicated on the 1936 county highway map, but not
on the 1910 soil survey map.

as

Presently occupied and in good condition, the house at 41 TT436 is a one-story frame
dwelling with Craftsman-style detailing, massing and form (Figure 53). A clipped-gable roof with
composition shingles and exposed rafter ends caps the structure. Although its underlying
construction is not known (likely of balloon-frame construction), the house is sheathed with drop
siding. The front faces east onto FM 2152 and has a small one-bay porch with a clipped-gable
roof. Tapered box columns with brick pedestals support the porch. The windows are grouped in
pairs and most retain their original wood sashes with one-over-one lights. However, a few
aluminum-sash windows have been installed.
Testing Program
This site was first observed during a historic structure survey of the study area by the
EH&A historian. No shovel tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected from the yard.
Approximately 0.2 to 0.4 ha of yard area were not surveyed. Site size is estimated to be about
50 min diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
The house is an example of a front-gabled Craftsman bungalow, a house-type popular
throughout Texas and the rest of the nation from the 1910s to the 1930s. While only a moderate
level of alterations affect its integrity, better illustrations of the style are found within the study
area, such as 41TT419 and 41TT435. As a result, EH&A's personnel believe that the house is not
eligible for NRHP listing. Because of its topographic setting, which is not conducive to prehistoric
site location, and because the surrounding fields contain no prehistoric resources, the yard is
thought to have a low potential for prehistoric resources. No further investigation is
recommended.
Site 41TT437
Background Data
Site 41TT437 is an historic artifact scatter located north of County Road NW-24
(Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is an intermittent drainage 50 m to the north. A
structure is located near this area on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey
map. The site slopes slightly to the northwest and lies in an open improved pasture, with one
crepe myrtle on the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent, except in the rodent
burrow tailings. The elevation of the site is 131-132 m msl.
The site was first located by observation of historic debris in the rodent burrows
around the crepe myrtle. Brick fragments, clear and brown bottle glass, whiteware, and stoneware
were seen sparsely scattered over the surface of the site. No well or other features were observed.
Testing Program
A total of three shovel tests were excavated to help assess the site. All three were
culturally positive, with cultural materials in levels 2 and 3 (10-30 cm). The soil is a loamy sand

10723/880206

207

Figw-e 53. Residence at 41 TT436. View to the west.

20.8

extending to clayey soil approximately 40 cm below the surface. The surface scatter indicates a site
size of 40 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 10 artifacts was collected from the shovel tests. Table 25 documents the
artifacts recovered from the shovel tests. None was collected from the site surface.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
No structures were observed on the site; however, the 1936 county highway map
indicates that a structure once stood at this location. The artifact material does not refute this
date. Due to the absence of any structures or features, the absence of nineteenth-century artifacts,
and the shallow nature of the deposit in an area that exhibits a high rodent activity, it is the
opinion of EH&A's investigators that the site would not yield new information pertinent to a better
understanding of the twentieth century and that it is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT438
Background Data
Site 41 TT438 is a prehistoric site located on one of two toe ridges extending together
into the floodplain of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The site is situated on the northern ridge
with Site 41 TT441 at the proximal end of the ridge. The nearest natural water source is East Piney
Creek 190 m west of the site. The site slopes slightly to the north and west, and is situated in
open improved pasture, although the drainages and drainage slopes are wooded with oak, elm,
sweetgum, and some dogwood and pine. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent,
although some soil is visible in the rodent burrow tailings observed on the surface. The elevation
of this site is 122-123 m msl.
Testing
A total of eight shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were conducted on the
site to aid in site assessment and to determine the site boundaries. Lithic debitage and ceramic
were observed on the surface of the site in the rodent burrow spoil piles. Three of the five shovel
tests were positive and the soil is a brown sand over orange clay sand beginning between 30 and
90 cm below the surface. The surface scatter seen in the rodent tailings and the positive shovel
tests indicate a site size of 70 X 35 m.
Artifact Analysis
Five artifacts were recovered from the three positive shovel tests. These include one
primary chert flake in Shovel Test 1, Level 4; one grog-tempered plainware body sherd with tan
exterior in Level 1 of Shovel Test 2; two decorticate chert chips of high-quality chert in Level 2
(10-20 cm) of the same shovel test; and one pot-lidded decorticate chert chip in Level 2 (10-20 cm)
of Shovel Test 3.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT438, is a shallow moderate density prehistoric camp site located on a
ridge extending into the East Piney Creek floodplain. Shovel tests and surface scatter indicate a
higher concentration of artifacts on the northern half of this basically east-west oriented ridge,
although it is still low in relation to other sites in the area. Of note is the high-quality chert
observed at this site. This fine chert is not local and it must be inferred that it was brought into
the region. The presence of debitage on this chert indicates that the chert was not brought in as
a finished piece, but instead, some form of reduction took place at the site. Ceramic was also
found on the site, indicative of a probable Caddoan occupation. It is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that most of this shallow site has been impacted by historical cultivation and,
therefore, much of the integrity has been compromised. They are also of the opinion that this site
has been sufficiently documented and that it should not be recommended for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT439
Background Data
Situated in the Thomas Hunt Survey (Abstract 270), the frame barn (Figure 54) at
Site 41 TT439 stands just east of a small, paved county road (NW-26) that extends through the
eastern third of the property (Figure A-1). The modern house associated with the barn is located
on the opposite side of the road and is out of the study area. The nearest natural water source
is the head of a minor upland intermittent tributary of Piney Creek approximately 140 m north of
the site. Located in bermudagrass pasture, site elevation is about 125 m msl.
The barn, located in an open pasture, is abandoned and in deteriorated condition. It
is a gable-roofed structure that utilizes balloon-frame construction. Several pieces of the weatherboard siding have been removed, exposing the frame structural system. The steeply pitched gable
roof has corrugated metal covering.
The earliest owner documented for this site was John E. Williams, who conveyed land
that included this site to I. N. Williams in 1895 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 1, page 237).
Ad valorem tax rolls reveal that the latter Williams owned tracts in nine different surveys, as well
as five town lots in nearby Mt. Pleasant. His most valuable properties, according to these records,
were situated in town, which suggests that Williams resided in Mt. Pleasant, rather than in the
country. Throughout the duration of his ownership of land in the Thomas Hunt Survey, a similar
pattern can be seen.
On May 7, 1907, J. H. Atkins acquired 160 acres of the Williams land and 11 days
later sold the western half (including this site) to M. L. Ray (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 19, page 536; Volume 18, page 168). Tax rolls do not list Ray as the owner of any land
in the Thomas Hunt Survey until 1910, when he paid taxes on 80 acres of land, valued at $800.
William M. Hill purchased the 80 acres for $2,000 on August 24, 1912, and maintained
ownership until his death in the mid-1930s (Titus County Deed Records Volume 28, page 558).
Ad valorem tax rolls indicated that this land represented Hill's only property in the county. When

these tax records included a category for "homestead designation," Hill claimed this property as the
location of his residence. In 1937, his widow, Lela Hill, conveyed 4.13 acres to the State of Texas
for the construction of State Highway 49 (now U.S. Highway 271). She sold the remainder of the
property to D. C. Calvert in 1946 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 150, page 535).
Testing Program
The barn was observed first from the road during the structure survey of the study
area by the historian. The field in which the barn is located was later surveyed and shovel tests
found no artifacts either in the field or adjacent to the barn. The site number assigned the location
of the barn does not include the occupied residence across the street/highway, since it is not a part
of the study area. Site size is estimated to be about 25 m in diameter.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Although the barn may have been built by M. L. Ray some time after 1907, William
and Lela Hill maintain the strongest historical association with the property. The barn is
representative of an early twentieth-century farm-related structure, but lacks any architectural or
historical significance. In the opinion of EH&A's investigators, the barn does not meet the criteria
of eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT440
Site 41 TT440 is a prehistoric site located on one of two toe ridges extending into the
floodplain of East Piney Creek at the confluence of this creek and a major intermittent tributary
(Figure A-1). Whereas Site 41TT438 lies on the northern ridge, this site, 41TT440, lies on the
southern ridge. These two ridges are separated by a short, fairly shallow erosional gully which
drains into the creek. The length of the southern ridge slopes at about 2 to 3 percent to the
southwest. An old road bed was observed, cut into the distal end of the ridge. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and the soil may only be observed in the rodent burrow tailings
that dot the surface of the site. The vegetation consists of open improved pasture, although the
slopes of the ridge are wooded with oak, elm, and sweetgum. The elevation of this site is 119123 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed by shovel testing. A total of four shovel tests and an
intensive surface survey were conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries.
One prehistoric ceramic sherd and lithic debitage were observed in the rodent burrow tailings.
Three of the four shovel tests were positive, yielding artifacts in levels 2-3 and levels 5-9. Shovel
Test 1 showed the soil to be a brown sand extending to a depth greater than one meter although
not all the shovel tests were as deep. The shovel tests and surface scatter indicate a site size of
110 x 60 m.

10723/880206

213

,,---------------------------------------------...Artifact Analysis
A total of nine artifacts was collected from this site. One prehistoric ceramic sherd,
the only one observed on the site during the current survey, was observed in a rodent burrow
tailing. This sherd is a bone-tempered plainware body sherd with a tan exterior and a black
interior. Shovel Test 1 yielded debitage in levels 2 (10-20 cm), 5 (40- 50 cm), 7 (60-70 cm), and
9 (80-90 cm), as well as a dart point in Level 8 (70-80 cm). This dart point, which is typed as
Wells, is made of a dark rose-colored chert. It measures 4.55 cm long, 1.58 cm wide at the
shoulders, and 0.59 cm thick. The shoulders are not well-pronounced and the stem is contracting
and slightly rounded. Shovel Test 2 yielded a chert flake in Level 3 (20-30 cm), while Shovel
Test 3 yielded one chert flake in levels 4 (30-40 cm) and 6 (50-60 cm) each. Table 26 shows the
artifact distribution within the shovel tests on the site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT440 appears to be a moderate-density multi-component site, with the upper
component dating from the Caddoan period and the lower component dating from the Early
Archaic. The deepest cultural deposition is at the center of the landform in the vicinity of Shovel
Test 1. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that much of this site is still intact below the
plow zone and that the site might shed some light on the prehistoric settlement of the headwaters
of East Piney Creek. If impacted, limited archaeological testing is recommended to determine its
potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT441
Background Data
Site 41 TT441 is a multi-component prehistoric and historic site located in an upland
setting on a small rise at the conjunction of two toe ridges which extend west and south towards
East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is East Piney Creek, 280 m to
the west of the site. The topography generally slopes to the southwest. At present this site is
located in open improved pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type, although
trees such as oak, elm, pine, and hackberry are present on the slopes of the nearby ridges. The
ground surface visibility in the site area is very good at 50 to 60 percent, and is greatly augmented
by the presence of burrowing rodents. The elevation of this site is 125-126 m msl. This site is
indicated neither on the 1910 soil survey map (Figure 16) nor on the 1936 county highway map
(Figure 17).
Testing Program
This site was initially examined upon observation of a dilapidated wood-frame barn
on the site (Figure 55). Upon closer examination, this structure appears to be of recent vintage,
although constructed of portions of earlier anonymous structures. The roof of the barn,
particularly the trusses, are modern. Milled lumber and wire nails are used in construction
throughout the structure. The siding appears to be made in sections, some of which some appear
to be 1 x 6-inch flooring and 2 x 4-inch flooring. This structure measures approximately 20 x 10 m.

Prehistoric debitage and ceramics were recovered both from the surface and the shovel
tests. Two shovel tests were excavated on the site, one each on the east and west sides of the barn.
Prehistoric materials were recovered from the surface down through Level 7 (60-70 cm). Historic
material was recovered in Level 5 (40-50 cm). The soil is a brown sandy loam over a hard-packed
orange clay loam beginning at about 85 cm below the surface. Shovel tests and surface material
suggest a site size of 25 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of nine artifacts was collected from this site. One grog-tempered plainware
body sherd with a tan interior and exterior was collected from the surface, while the remainder of
the cultural materials were collected in the two shovel tests. Shovel Test 1, west of the barn,
yielded two tertiary chert flakes, one each in levels 2 (10-20 cm) and 5 (40-50 cm), and one
secondary petrified wood flake and one quartzite uniface in Level 7 (60-70 cm). A total of four
artifacts was recovered from Shovel Test 2, east of the barn. One grog-tempered plainware body
sherd with tan interior and exterior was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm). Level 3 (20-30 cm)
yielded one decorticate quartzite chip. A wire nail fragment was recovered in Level 5 (40-50 cm),
while a decorticate chert chip was collected in Level 6 (50-60 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT441, is a small moderate-density prehistoric site with a barn constructed
on top of the site. The prehistoric component extends from the surface down through Level 7 in
the soil profile. Ceramic materials appear to be concentrated on the surface and in the first level
only, whereas debitage extends throughout the profile. This division likely indicates a multiphase
prehistoric component with a Caddo occupation at the top and a pre-Caddo occupation below. The
lack of temporally diagnostic materials in the lower levels precludes a more precise data estimate.
The proximity of this site to 41 TT438 and 41 TT440 suggests some relationship
between the sites. The site is not wholly intact, since the construction of the barn and its
subsequent use has impacted the upper component of the site. Rodent activity has also played a
major role in impacting this site. This is best seen by the presence of a wire nail fragment in
Level 5 (40-50 cm) of Shovel Test 2. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, due to a
lack of integrity, the site has a low potential to contribute new knowledge to the region and that
it should not be recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT442
Background Data
Site 41TT442 is a prehistoric site located east of East Piney Creek on a high interfluve
between two tributaries of this creek (Figure A-1). This interfluve is fairly well eroded with a
ground surface visibility of 50 to 70 percent in some areas. The nearest natural water source is
either of the two drainages to the north and south of the site, only 100 m away. The vegetation
consists of open improved pasture, and rodent burrow tailings are evident on the surface. The
elevation of this site extends from 120-123 m msl.

i,1

Testing Program
The site was first observed when lithic debitage was noted on the surface in eroded
areas. A total of five shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were conducted on the site to
determine the nature of the site and to establish the site boundaries. Several pieces of debitage,
one burned rock, and one biface fragment were observed eroding from the distal end of the
interfluve. The biface fragment was collected. The five shovel tests were placed along the length
of the crest of the interfluve. Three were positive. The soil, as seen in the shovel tests, is a
shallow, brown loamy sand with orange-brown clay loam beginning as early as 28 cm below the
ground surface. The site size is estimated to be 210 x 95 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 11 artifacts was collected from the site for laboratory analysis. Shovel
Test 1 yielded one decorticate chert chip in Levell (0-10 cm), one tertiary chert flake and two
decorticate chert chips in Level 2 (10-20 cm), and two corticate chips in Level 3 (20-30 cm), of
which one was of quartzite and the other of a pot-lidded chert. Shovel Test 3 yielded artifacts in
levels 1 and 2. One corticate chert chip and one decorticate quartzite chip were recovered in
Level l (0-10 cm) while one decorticate chert chip was reccwered in Level 2 (10-20 cm). Shovel
Test 5 yielded one secondary chert flake in Level 5 (40-50 cm).
The biface fragment is manufactured of grey-brown quartzite. This fragment is
0.87 cm thick, approximately 4.6 cm long and weighs 8.65 g. No evidence of edge wear is apparent.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT442 is a prehistoric campsite located on the interfluve between two major
tributaries of East Piney Creek. The site is manifested as a shallow prehistoric occupation and
likely dates to one of the pre-ceramic periods. A more precise date is not possible due to the lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Floral and faunal bioturbation, especially by rodents, has played
a major disturbing role in the site integrity, especially when coupled with historic clearing and
probable cultivation with subsequent erosion. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this
site lacks a good research potential and is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further
investigation is recommended.
Site 41TT443
Background Data
Site 41TT443 is an historic site located on the south side of County Road NW-28 and
situated on the upland interfluve between two major intermittent tributaries of East Piney Creek
(Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is one of these drainages, approximately 200 m
northeast of the site. At present, the vegetation consists of open improved pasture with scattered
oaks, narcissus, and a fig tree. The ground surface visibility is 0 to 10 percent, with rodent
burrowing evident. The elevation of this site is approximately 126 m msl.

10723/880206

218

Site 41 TT443 is located on a 155-acre tract in the Joseph J. Dew Survey
(Abstract 156). Approximately 80 acres on this tract was owned by G.W. and Sarah Gilpin in 1877.
They conveyed a 160-acre parcel to Thomas Elliott for $960 in October 1877 (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 37, page 284). Thomas and Sallie Elliott, Sr. deeded 80 acres to E. Cox in
January 1892, for $447.48 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 37, page 283). In November of
that year, Ed and Elizabeth Cox sold the property to AM. Wheeler for $260. The deed describes
the 80 acres as "... being the north.half of a 160 ac survey ... " (Titus County Deed Records
Volume 37, page 282). From 1910 to 1915, the assessed property value increased only $50. AM.
and Rebecca Wheller of McCurtain County, Oklahoma conveyed the 80 acres to L.M. Cobb for
$1,600 in December 1916. This deed describes the tract as the "George Gilpin Old Place" (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 35, page 435). This may indicate that George Gilpin, who sold the
land in 1877, resided at this location at one time. A few days later, L.M. Cobb deeded the land to
Herbert Smith and Hettie Smith, a "feme sole" (Titus County Deed Records Volume 35,
page 445). The Smiths sold the land to W.P. Willmon and W.T. Bryan in January 1918, for $3,600.
The 80 acres is described as the "AM. Wheeler place" (Titus County Deed Records Volume 39,
page 77). The property doubled in value from 1916 to 1918, probably indicating that a structure
was built. W.P. and Rhoda Leona Willmon retained possession of the tract until 1938, when they
sold the land to W .E. Derrick for $150 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 112, page 463). The
1935 ad valorem tax rolls do not record this as the Willmon's homestead.
The remaining portion of the tract was owned by Henry D. and Mattie J. Matthews
in 1907. They sold 162.5 acres to G.L. Keith and S.R. Crabtree in November 1907, for $850 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 22, page 283). S.R. Crabtree conveyed 81.25 acres to D.F. Sims,
Jr. for $1,125 in November 1910. The deed describes this as the "... east half of the land deeded
from G.L. Keith to S.R. Crabtree" (Titus County Deed Records Volume 22, page 514).
S.R. Crabtree has gained sole title to the 162.5 acres in November 1909, for $600 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 22, page 284). E.H. Cobb purchased 81.25 acres in August 1911, from
D. Frank and Laura Sims for $1,450 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 26, page 333).
Mack R. Brown, also known as McRoy Brown, purchased the approximately 160 acres
in the late 1940s (Titus County Deed Records Volume 159, page 145; Volume 157, page 108). In
1968, he conveyed the tract to James Curtis and Mamie Myrtle Seaton (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 341, page 68). The tract has remained in the Seaton family.
Testing Program
The site was first located upon observation of a slightly mounded, flat area surrounded
by introduced vegetation. A total of two shovel tests were excavated around the periphery of the
flat area, which was determined to be the house location. The shovel tests showed a dark soil
extending to 15 to 25 cm below the surface and orange sandy clay beginning by 32 cm. Both shovel
tests were positive, with artifacts contained in the midden-type soil only. Also visible near the site
are a modem cattle-lodging pen to the east of the house location and a modem barn with recycled
house materials on 41 TT441, approximately 250 m southwest of the house location. The site size
was determined to be 70 x 30 m.

Artifact Analysis
Both shovel tests were positive. Table 27 documents the artifacts recovered from the
site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT443, is a historic scatter representing a former house location. No well
or intact structural remains were observed. Both the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county
highway map show a structure in this location. Deed research suggests that two structures (likely
residences) may have been constructed at this location; one possibly dating from the middle
nineteenth century relating to the Gilpin family, the second dating between 1916 and 1918 and
possibly related to the Smith family.
The artifacts recovered from the site do not refute the archival data, and loosely
support one or more construction episodes based upon wire and square nail fragments. Based
upon the evidence uncovered from the survey data, the possibility for a middle nineteenth-century
occupation (pre-1877) cannot be discounted. Even with mixed artifacts, information may yet be
obtained relevant to nineteenth century lifestyles. If the site is to be impacted, archaeological
testing is recommended to test for middle and late nineteenth-century occupation.
Site 41TT444
I,.

Site 41 TT444 is a prehistoric site situated on a north-south ridgeline above East Piney
Creek (Figure A-1), with the southern boundary of the site identified by an east-west fenceline.
The nearest natural water source is a tributary of East Piney Creek 200 m northwest of the site.
The site slopes predominantly to the north-northeast. At present, this site lies in a wooded area
with oak, pine, elm, and hackberry trees along with numerous shrubs, and some grasses and
greenbriar. The ground surface visibility is estimated to be less than 10 percent due to heavy leaf
fall. The elevation of this site is 122-125 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first observed by shovel testing when one piece of debitage was
recovered in Level 3 of Shovel Test 1. An additional two shovel tests and an intensive surface
survey were conducted to assess the site boundaries. One of these additional shovel tests proved
positive. The soil is a brown sandy loam over orange-brown clay sand by 30 cm below the surface.
Shovel tests and topography suggest a site size of 45 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of two artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. One corticate chert chip
was recovered from Level 3 (20-30 cm) of Shovel Test 1 and one corticate quartzite chip was
recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 2.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT444 is a shallow, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located above East
Piney Creek. Cultural material appears to be very sparse judging by the results of the shovel tests.
No specific time period may be assigned to this site due to the lack of temporally diagnostic
materials. Due to the shallow nature of the site and extremely limited inventory of cultural
material, the site offers little opportunity to address research concerns raised in Chapter V. It is
the opinion of EH&A's personnel that this site is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT445
Background Data
Site 41 TT445 is a prehistoric site located on the slope above an intermittent tributary
of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This slope is highly eroded and has an incline of approximately
7 to 10 percent. The nearest natural water source is an intermittent tributary of East Piney Creek
100 m to the east of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved pasture with a ground
surface visibility of 0 to 50 percent, due to the extensive erosion present. The elevation of the site
is 121 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed when a piece of lithic debitage was noted in an eroded area
on the slope above the drainage. This eroded area is marked by a high concentration of limonite
pebbles on the surface and a lack of any substantial soil deposition. An intensive surface survey
yielded no further cultural materials. Due to the lack of soil, no shovel tests were placed in the
immediate vicinity of the artifact; however, four were excavated uphill from the area on several
erosional remnant hillocks which did retain some soil. All were negative. The soil on these
hillocks is a brown loamy sand no more than 40 cm in depth. Due to the lack of additional
artifacts and the nature of the find, the site size is estimated to be 1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Only one artifact, a decorticate chert chip, was observed on the site. It was not
collected.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT445, is an isolated find on an eroded slope above an intermittent
tributary of East Piney Creek. It may have been washed down from the top of the slope; however,
four shovel tests showed no artifacts upslope. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that the
integrity of this surface find is in question and as such, it should not be considered eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41 TT446
Background Data
Site 41 TT446 is a prehistoric site situated at the tip of a low ridge just above the
floodplain of an unnamed intermittent tributary of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is this intermittent drainage 100 m from the site. The site is currently in a
mixed pine and oak woodland with a sparse shrub understory. The ground surface visibility is less
than five percent due to leaf litter. The elevation of the site is 125 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed by shovel testing when a piece of lithic debitage was
collected in Level 1 of Shovel Test 1. An intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests
were then conducted to determine the nature and size of the site. All were culturally negative.
The soil is a tan sand over orange clay sand beginning about 35 cm below the surface. The
topography and positive shovel test suggest a site size of 15 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Only one artifact was observed on the site. A primary quartzite flake was recovered
in Shovel Test 1, Level 1 (0-10 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT446 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that is restricted to one small rise at the tip
of an upland ridge. A single flake was recovered from the upper 10 cm of soil which is disturbed
by roots. No features were observed and a precise date may not be determined due to the lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has
been sufficiently documented, since sparse lithic scatters are typically of questionable research
value. In the opinion of EH&A, the site is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT447
Site 41 TT447 is a prehistoric site located on a small rise near the base of the valley
wall of an unnamed intermittent tributary of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural
water source is this tributary 75 m southeast of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved
pasture with nearby oak, pine, and elm woodland across the drainage. The ground surface visibility
is less than 10 percent, although some soil is visible in rodent burrow tailings. The elevation of
the site is 122 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed when a piece of lithic debitage was recovered in Shovel
Test 1, which was excavated in the center of the small rise. An intensive surface survey and an
additional shovel test were conducted on the rise; however, no other cultural materials were noted.
No features were observed on the site. The soil is a tan sand overlying sandy clay which begins

approximately 65 cm below the ground surface. The positive shovel test and the landform suggest
a site size of 10 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A single artifact was collected from the site. One decorticate chert chip was recovered
in Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test l.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT447, is a prehistoric isolated artifact located on a small rise above the
floodplain of the East Piney Creek drainage. A more precise date cannot be determined at this
time due to the absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts. It is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that this shallow low density site has likely been disturbed by historic cultivation, and
has little potential to address research concerns raised in Chapter V. No further investigation is
recommended.
Site 41TT448
Background Data
Site 41TT448 is an historic site located on the south side of County Road NW-28 and
situated in the uplands overlooking a small intermittent drainage approximately 90 m north of the
site (Figure A-1). This drainage is the nearest natural water source. The site lies in open
improved pasture, with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type and juniper and crepe myrtle
also present. The ground surface visibility is 0 to 20 percent with some eroded areas evident and
no rodent activity observable. The elevation of this site is 138 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed as a surficial historic scatter. A total of two shovel tests
was excavated on the site in order to fully assess the site. One artifact was recovered in Shovel
Test l. The soil is a very shallow sandy loam with sandy clay beginning at about 10 cm below the
surface. The surficial scatter of artifacts indicates a site size of 30 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One piece of brown bottle glass was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test l.
On the surface, however, less than 20 artifacts were observed, including purple glass, a brick
fragment, whiteware, and molded brown glass.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
No well or intact structural remains were observed on Site 41 TT448, although a
shallow, sparse scattering of historic artifacts was observed. Although the 1936 county highway
map shows a structure in this location, very little evidence remains of it at present. Due to the
sparse remains and the extremely shallow nature of the site, it is felt that little integrity remains

10723/880206

224

on this site. No nineteenth-century artifacts were obseived in the site. As such, it is the opinion
of EH&A's personnel that this site is of little research potential and should not be considered
eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT449
Background Data
Site 41 TT449 is an historic site located north of County Road NW-20 and situated in
the uplands between East Piney Creek, Hayes Creek, and Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is the head of an upland intermit tent drainage, which is approximately 200 m
south of the site. At present, this site lies in open improved pasture with crepe myrtle, juniper,
elm, sycamore, and daffodils also present. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent,
with little rodent activity visible. The elevation of this site is 150 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first located when a concrete culvert-lined well was obseived during the
pedestrian suivey. No other features were evident. Shovel testing placed the former house
location west of the well. A total of three shovel tests was excavated on this site, two of which
were culturally positive. Shovel tests show the soil to change to a lighter brown sandy soil by 20
to 30 cm and extending past 60 cm in depth. (When this site was recorded, the soil was very wet
due to recent heavy rains and an abundance of water was encountered in each test unit below
60 cm below the ground surface.) The site size is estimated to be 70 x 60 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 44 artifacts was recovered from the two positive shovel tests at this site.
Table 28 lists the types of artifacts and their proveniences.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT449 is an historic scatter with a concrete culvert well. Although a structure
is indicated at this location on both the 1910 soil sUIVey map and the 1936 county highway map,
the cultural material recovered at this site does not indicate the earlier 1910 date. It is likely that
the earlier occupation was eradicated by the more recent construction. It is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that the remains of this site are twentieth-century materials and do not
possess sufficient potential to pursue further studies pertinent to nineteenth-century research
questions. The site should not be nominated for inclusion to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT450
Background Data
Site 41TT450 is a prehistoric site located on the north-south interfluve between East
Piney Creek and a major intermittent tributary of this creek (Figure A-1). The interfluve is above
the confluence of these two drainages and projects into the large floodplain at this confluence.

The sides of this interfluve have been severely incised by the drainage so that the crest is only 20 m
across at the site and narrows to 3 m across just north of the site. The crest of the interfluve is
nearly level, although the slope on the west and east sides is very steep at approximately 45
degrees. The nearest natural water source is either of the two drainages approximately 100 m
away. The site currently lies in woodlands, with oak and elm as the dominant species and pine
present to the south of the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent, due to the
leaf litter. The elevation of the site is 116 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed when lithic debitage was recovered in Shovel Test 1.
Subsequently, an intensive surface survey and a series of four additional shovel tests were
conducted along the interfluve to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries. No artifacts
were observed on the surface and only one of the additional shovel tests was culturally positive.
The soil on the site is a tan sand extending to orange-brown clayey sand that begins 20 to 60 cm
below the ground surface. North and south of the site boundaries, along the interfluve, the soil
is very shallow, with clayey sand beginning at 15 cm below ground surface. The site size was
estimated to be 20 m in diameter.

II

Artifact Analysis
A total of four artifacts, all lithic debitage, was recovered from the two positive shovel
tests. Shovel Test 1 yielded two tertiary chert flakes, one each in levels 1and5 (0-10 cm and 4050 cm). Shovel Test 2 yielded one tertiary chert flake in Level 1 (0-10 cm) and one corticate chert
chip in Level 2 (10-20 cm).

'1'

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT450, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on a narrow
interfluve along East Piney Creek. The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts precludes a more
precise date. The site was perhaps larger at one time, but the incising of the interfluve by the
drainages has likely taken place since occupation, thereby destroying portions of the site. Although
the site presently lies in a wooded area, these woods are not virgin timber; in fact, planted pines
are present just south of the site. It is likely that historic clearing and subsequent erosion
attributable to the clearing has significantly impacted the integrity of the site. It is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and does not meet any
criterion for inclusion to the NRHP.
Site 41TT451
Background Data
Site 41 TT451 is an historic site located south of County Road NW-28 on the uplands
between East Piney Creek and a major intermittent tributary of this creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is an upland intermittent drainage approximately 200 m southwest of
the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent. At present, this site lies in open
improved pasture with scattered oaks. Oak, sycamore, pecan, and crepe myrtle surround the

former house area. The elevation of this site is 127-130 m msl. A structure is indicated at this
location on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
The site was first observed when a house foundation and a barn were noted during
the pedestrian survey. The house measures approximately 12 x 12 m with 2.5 m-wide covered
porches on the north, east, and south elevations. At present, all that remains of the house are the
porches, two chimneys, and the foundation. The house interior appears to have contained four
rooms. The two rooms at the east end had a double-sided open fireplace while the two on the
west end shared a small stovepipe chimney. Both chimneys are intact and are presently standing.
Based on the roof line visible on the larger chimney, the house appears to have been one-and-ahalf stories. Board-and-batten construction is present throughout, with milled lumber and wire
nails. The foundations are brick piers approximately 40 x 25 cm in size and are placed at 2.5-m
intervals. The roof appears to have been of roll-composition shingles over boards and corrugated
tin. There is a half-inch metal pipe under the house and an electric pole nearby.
The barn lies to the southeast of the house. It measures approximately 13 x 4 m with
lean-to additions on the north and east elevations. There is also an open lean-to along the west
elevation. This barn is of mixed construction with oak beams on cast cement piers. The current
structure is likely modern, and former building materials were utilized in its construction.
Also present at this site are a covered well and an outhouse. The well is adjacent to
the west elevation of the house. The outhouse is a one-hole outhouse of board-and-batten
construction with a tin roof and a metal stand for a seat.
Testing Program
A total of three shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the house, two of which
were positive. The soil is a tan sand extending below 40 cm in depth. Due to the high amounts
of rainfall at the time of the survey, the shovel tests were not extended below 40 cm. One shovel
test, Shovel Test 2, excavated within the house foundation area, was terminated at 10 cm when a
large piece of corrugated metal was encountered. The site size, due to extant structural remains,
was determined to be 150 x 50 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of eight artifacts was recovered from the site. Shovel Test 1 yielded one piece
of window glass in Level 1 (0-10 cm). Shovel Test 3 yielded cultural materials in levels 1 and 2.
One piece of brown glass and four sheet-metal fragments were recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm),
while two sheet-metal fragments were recovered in Level 2 (10-20 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT451 is an historic house site with an associated barn, outhouse, and well.
This location is shown on the 1936 county highway map, although it does not show on the 1910
soil survey map. This indicates a construction date between these two dates, and the cultural
assemblage supports this conclusion. Due to the shallow nature of the site, the lack of nineteenth-

10723/880206

228

century artifacts, and the absence of any intact standing structures of antiquity, it is the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists that this site is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT452
Background Data
Site 41 TT452 is an historic site, with a small prehistoric component, located on the
north side of County Road NW-12. The site is situated on the narrow interfluve between two
intermittent tributaries of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is either of
these two tributaries 50 m to the north and south of the site. At present, this site lies in open
improved pasture with bermudagrass and clover the dominant vegetation type. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent, although some evidence of rodent activity is visible on the
surface. The elevation of this site is 123 m msl. A structure is indicated at this location on the
1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map.
Testing Program
This site was first observed when a shovel test was excavated on a former structure
location indicated on the 1936 county highway map. A total of four shovel tests, two of which were
positive, was excavated in the site area. Historic artifacts were recovered in levels 1 and 3 and one
prehistoric artifact was recovered in Level 2. The soil is a brown sandy loam, becoming an orangebrown sandy clay after 30 cm below the surface. No cultural features were observed; however,
conversation with the landowner revealed that there was a well on the site which has been filled.
He did not remember its location, however, and had never seen a structure there (Leake 1988).
Shovel testing indicates a site size of 40 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Five artifacts were recovered during the shovel testing of this site. Shovel Test 2
yielded one clear bottle-glass fragment in Level 3 (20-30 cm). Artifacts were recovered from
levels 1 and 2 in Shovel Test 3. One milk-glass lid fragment and two machine-pressed brick
fragments were recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm). Level 2 (10-20 cm) yielded one corticate chert
chip.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT452 is a multi-component site located on an interfluve just north of NW-12.
This site location is shown on the 1936 county highway map, but not on the 1910 soil survey map,
indicating that the structure originally standing at this location was built between these two dates.
The artifact assemblage supports this with the absence of turn-of-the-century, early twentiethcentury artifacts. At present, very little remains of this site. The prehistoric component has likely
been disturbed by the historic occupation and both have been impacted by cultivation practices
since the destruction of the house. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has
been sufficiently documented and has little research potential pertinent to research questions raised
in Chapter V. As a result, the site does not merit recommendation for inclusion to the NRHP.

Site 41 TT453
Background Data
Site 41 TT453 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of an upland hill overlooking
a tributary of Hart Creek to the southwest and south (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water
source is this intermittent tributary approximately 85 m southwest of the site. At present, the site
lies in open pasture, predominantly under a modern corral complex. The slope of the site is less
than three percent to the south and southwest. The ground surface visibility is less than five
percent and the absence of rodent burrow tailings was noted on the site. The elevation is approximately 119 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was originally located by shovel testing when a prehistoric sherd was
recovered in Shovel Test 1. An intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests were
conducted to assess the site. Due to the poor ground surface visibility, no artifacts were observed
on the surface. Only one of the additional shovel tests was positive. The soil is a brown sandy
loam overlying an orange sandy clay at about 40 cm. The site size, based on the two positive
shovel tests and the topography, is estimated to be 25 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered in the shovel tests. One plainware grog-tempered body
sherd with light brown interior and exterior was recovered in Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test 1.
Shovel Test 2 yielded one heat-shattered quartzite chunk in Level 3 (20-30 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT453 is a low-density prehistoric open campsite that lies on an upland edge
underneath a modern cattle corral. Dating to the Caddo occupation, this site appears to be a
small, shallow, single component site. No features were observed. Due to the high concentration
of livestock on the site, attributable to the corral complex, the upper soil levels of the area are
disturbed. In wet seasons the high probability of severe deep site disturbance exists, damaging the
shallow site even more. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that the research potential of
this site has been greatly diminished by the modern influences mentioned above and that the site
does not meet the criteria of eligibility to the NRHP.
Site 41TT454
Background Data
Site 41 TT454 is a prehistoric site located on a small east-west toe ridge above an
intermittent tributary of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). Site 41TT453 is approximately 175 m westnorthwest of this location. The nearest natural water source is the tributary of Hart Creek 35 m
south of the site, which gently slopes south towards the drainage. At present, this site lies in open

10723/880206

230

improved pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation. The ground surface visibility
ranges from 0 to 30 percent. The elevation of this site is approximately 119 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed when one flake was recovered in Shovel Test l. An
intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests were conducted to assess the site and to
determine the site boundaries. Both of these shovel tests were negative. No artifactual materials
were observed on the surface. The soil is a brown sandy loam with gravels overlying orange-brown
clay loam beginning at about 60 cm below the surface. The site size is estimated to be 15 m in
diameter, based on the topography and one positive shovel test.
Artifact Analysis
A single artifact was recovered from this site. A decorticate chert chip was collected
in Level 4 (30-40 cm) of Shovel Test l.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT454, is a prehistoric isolated artifact located above a tributary of Hart
Creek. The lack of cultural materials, particularly diagnostic artifacts, precludes a precise dating
of this site. Due to the lack of significant cultural material, the function of the site cannot be
definitely determined, although it was possibly an open lithic scatter of short-term duration. It is
the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, due to the lack of cultural materials, this site does not
possess great research potential and should not be recommended as eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT455
Background Data
Site 41TTT455 is an historic site with a prehistoric component, located on a small lobe
of the upland edge above the confluence of Hart Creek and an intermittent tributary of this creek
(Figure A-1). The site looks out over this tributary which is the nearest natural water source, 90 m
south of the site. At present, the site lies in an open improved pasture with a dirt road traversing
the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent in the pasture, while on the road
it is almost 100 percent. The elevation of the site is approximately 119 m msl. Neither the 1910
soil survey map nor the 1936 county highway map indicate the presence of a structure in this
location.
Testing Program
This site was first observed when historic debris was noted in the dirt road. An
intensive surface survey was conducted and a total of three shovel tests was excavated on either
side of the road. All three were positive. The soil is a dark brown loamy sand, changing to a light
brown sand with charcoal flecks at 20 cm and then to an orange-brown clayey sand beginning at

10723/880206

231

about 30 to 40 cm below the surface. The topography and positive shovel tests, as well as the
historic debris along the road, all suggest a site size about 30 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 40 cm below the surface. The majority of the
artifacts are historic; however, two grog-tempered plainware body sherds with a black core were
recovered in Level 2 (20-30 cm) and one corticate quartzite chip was recovered in Level 4 (3040 cm) of Shovel Test 1, excavated on the east side of the road. A complete list of artifacts is
shown in Table 29. The prehistoric ceramics found in Level 1 are well mixed with the historic
debris. The snuff bottle base collected from Shovel Test 1, Level 2 (10-20 cm), likely dates to the
late nineteenth/early twentieth century. Shovel Test 2 was terminated at 20 cm below the surface
when a brick was encountered, obstructing the shovel test.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT455 is an historic site with a prehistoric component located on the upland
edge along the Head Creek drainage. The prehistoric component has been severely compromised
by the later historic component. This historic component, judging by the artifacts, dates to an early
twentieth-century occupation, although this site is indicated neither on the 1910 soil survey map
nor on the 1936 county highway map. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that little
information may be gained from the testing of this shallow site. As such, this site is not
recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT456
Background Data
Site 41TT456 is an historic scatter located on the north side of County Road NW-12
and situated on a high, broad interfluve between two tributaries of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is one of these tributaries 150 m north of the site. At present, this
site lies in open improved pasture with daffodils and several oak trees present. The ground surface
visibility is less than five percent and no evidence of rodent activity was noted. The elevation of
this site is 123 m msl. Neither the 1910 soil survey map nor the 1936 county highway map indicate
a structure in this vicinity.
Testing Program
This site was first located by shovel testing. A total of two shovel tests was excavated
on the site, both positive, with artifacts recovered through Level 4. Shovel testing showed the soil
to be a brown loamy sand becoming higher in clay content by 60 cm below the surface. The
positive shovel tests and the topography suggest a site size of 40 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 26 artifacts were recovered in the shovel tests. The artifacts are listed by
shovel test and level in Table 30. All are middle twentieth-century artifacts.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT456 is an historic scatter indicative of a structure. Because figures 16 and
17 do not show a structure at this location, and because of the lack of any nineteenth- or early
twentieth-century artifacts, a post-1936 date is postulated for the site. It is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and should not be considered eligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT457
Background Data
Site 41 TT457 is a prehistoric site situated on an upland edge overlooking a small
upland intermittent drainage which flows into East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This drainage had
flowing water at the time of the survey and is the closest natural water source, only 75 m northeast
of the site. The vegetation, at present, is comprised of woodlands, predominantly pine and oak.
The ground surface visibility is less than five percent due to the leaf litter. The elevation of the
site is 126 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was initially discovered when a piece of lithic debitage was recovered in
Shovel Test l. Subsequently, an intensive surface survey and two additional shovel tests were
conducted. Due to the leaf litter, no artifacts were observed on the surface. The two shovel tests
also proved negative. The soil is a tan sand, with grey clay with orange mottles beginning 80 cm
below the surface. The topography and one positive shovel test suggest a site size of 10 m in
diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A single artifact was recovered from this site. A decorticate quartzite chip was
collected from Level 5 (40-50 cm) of Shovel Test l.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT457, is a prehistoric site, suggestive of a small single-component lithic
scatter and located on a small upland hillock above a drainage of East Piney Creek. A more
precise date may not be determined due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. It is the
opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this low-density site would not shed important insight on
the research concerns raised in Chapter V and should not be eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT458
Background Data
Site 41TT458 is an historic site located on the west side of NW 28 and situated on the
edge of an open improved pasture which overlooks an intermittent drainage to the northwest and

10723/880206

235

west (Figure A-1). This pasture has a slope of about three percent. At present, the vegetation
on the site consists primarily of bermudagrass with hackberry and narcissus also present. The
ground surface visibility is less than three percent with some rodent activity observable in the form
of rodent burrow spoil piles. The elevation of this site is 119 m msl. A structure is indicated in
this location on both the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county highway map.
Site 41 TT459 is located on a 58-acre tract in the James W. Green Survey
(Abstract 229) and is a component of a 107-acre parcel. In September 1893, B.C. Branch and
R.R. Gilpin purchased 93 acres of the Green Survey from J.N. and C.H. Grigsby for $700 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 18, page 582). In 1896, B.C. Branch and R.R. Gilpin divided the
tract with B.C. Branch receiving 49 acres (Titus County Deed Records Volume 18, page 583).
B.C. Branch purchased an additional 54 acres from J.N. and C.H. Grigsby in September 1906, for
$1,200 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 20, page 259). Approximately half of this was
conveyed by B.C. and May Branch to L.C. Branch for $1,000 in December 1906 (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 20, page 260). The 1910 ad valorem tax tolls indicate that L.C. Branch
owned 59 acres worth $550 and that B.C. Branch owned 154 acres worth $1,000. According to the
1910 census, B.C. Branch was a 41-year old farmer. His wife, Mary, was 35 years old, and the
couple had five children. L.C. Branch was also a farmer and was 64 years old. His wife, Martha,
was the same age, and the couple had four children. None of the children were living with L.C.
and Martha Branch. B.C. was probably the son of L.C. and Martha Branch.
In 1920, B.C. Branch owned 86.5 acres which had an appraised value of $900, and
Mrs. L.C. Branch paid taxes on 47 acres which had an appraised value of $500. The heirs of
L.C. Branch deeded the land to J.D. Weaver in December 1917 for $1,500 (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 68, page 611). In 1938, the tract was returned to B.C. Branch for the cancellation
of debts (Titus County Deed Records Volume 142, page 612). The 1935 ad valorem tax rolls
indicate that B.C. Branch lived on the 112.5 acres he owned in the Green Survey. This land was
appraised at $1,060. The L.C. Branch estate retained ownership of 48 acres which was worth $400.
This tract was not listed as a homestead. The property remained in the Branch family until 1963,
when 106.93 acres was conveyed to the Veterans' Land Board of Texas (Titus County Deed
Records Volume 287, page 453). The tract has had several owners since that time.
Testing Program
This site was first located when a surface scatter of historic artifacts was observed in
conjunction with domesticated plants. Corrugated metal and several brick fragments were observed
on the surface. In order to assess the site and determine the site boundaries, two shovel tests were
excavated. Shovel Test 1 yielded artifacts down to 20 cm below the surface, while Shovel Test 3
contained cultural materials to 30 cm. The shovel tests show that the soil is a dark brown sandy
soil down to 25 to 30 cm with orange-brown sandy clay beginning between 20 to 40 cm below the
surface. The surficial scatter and the shovel tests indicate a site size of 60 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 48 artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests at this site. Table 31 shows
their number and provenience.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Based on deed research and on the artifacts, Site 41 TT458 is an historic site dating
to the first quarter of the twentieth century. The site most likely was originally associated with the
B.C. Branch family dating to ca. 1906. No structural features are present on the site. The artifacts
recovered in the shovel tests are devoid of nineteenth-century materials. It is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this site can offer little new information concerning the early twentieth
century and it is not recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT459
Site 41 TT459 is a prehistoric site located on the broad crest of a ridge extending out
from an upland hill overlooking an intermittent tributary of East Piney Creek to the south of the
site (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is this tributary, located 80 m away. At
present, the site lies in open improved pasture, with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation.
Artificial terracing is extensive on this ridge, and the ground surface visibility is less than five
percent. Numerous rodent burrows are present, aiding in ground surface inspection. The elevation
of this site is 119 m msl.
Testing Program
The site was initially located by shovel testing this high probability landform. A
projectile point was recovered in Level 5 of the first shovel test. An additional ten shovel tests
were excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted in the site area. One quartzite
tertiary flake was observed on the surface near Shovel Test 4 and two of the additional shovel tests
were positive. The soil is a brown sand over orange-tan hardpacked clay sand beginning by 50 to
60 cm below the surface. The positive shovel tests, the surface artifacts, and the landform suggest
a site size of 40 x 50 m.
Artifact Analysis
Four artifacts were recovered from the three positive shovel tests on site. AKent dart
point was collected in Level 5 (40-50 cm) in Shovel Test 1. Shovel Test 3 yielded one decorticate
chert chip in Level 1 (0-10 cm) and one corticate quartzite chip in Level 4 (30-40 cm). One
decorticate chert chip was also recovered in Level 4 (30-40 cm) of Shovel Test 4.
The projectile point is a Kent made of chert. The artifact is made of an orange-brown
secondary chert flake. It measures 3.67 cm in length and 1.82 cm wide at the shoulders, is 0.79 cm
thick and weighs 4.2 g. This projectile point has a convex blade, only slight shoulders, a square
stem, and a straight base.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT459, is a prehistoric low-density lithic scatter located on a toe ridge
overlooking a tributary of East Piney Creek. This lithic scatter may have been a reduction site and
campsite. Artifacts were observed from Level 1 (0-10 cm) and in levels 4 and 5 (30-50 cm) in the
soil profile, suggesting a possible multi-component site possibly dating from the Late Archaic;

10723/880206

238

however, artificial terracing and numerous rodents in the area are a major contributing cause to
the lack of integrity of this apparently multi-component deposit. Therefore, it is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this site is sufficiently documented and should not be recommended
for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT460
Background Data
Site 41TT460 is an historic house site located north of County Road NW-12 and
situated on a broad upland mass west of Hayes Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water
source is a tributary of Hayes Creek, approximately 240 m northeast of the site. At present, this
site is surrounded by open pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type, with
Hercules club, catalpa and black locust flora also present on the site. The ground surface visibility
is less than five percent. The site elevation is approximately 132 m msl.
The house is approximately 10 x 10 m in size and is in a severely deteriorated
condition (Figure 56). The residence is a one-story frame dwelling with horizontal and board-andbatten siding and a front-gabled roof. An inset porch at the southwest corner of the house marks
the main entrance, although most of the porch has been completely removed. Much of the
northwest corner of the house is collapsed or also missing. A covered cistern is located off the
northwest corner of the house. Approximately 8 m east of this house is a modern occupied
dwelling.
Testing Program
A total of three shovel tests was excavated on the site and a surface survey was
conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries. On the surface of the site, a
profuse amount of refuse was noted, including feed sacks, plastic containers in a wide range of
shapes and sizes, clothing, sheet metal, used lumber, and glass containers. Two of the three shovel
tests were positive, with artifacts recovered through Level 4. The soil is a light brown fine sand
extending to 70 cm, where the sand becomes very hard. The extant structure and the positive
shovel tests indicate a site size of 30 x 30 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 20 artifacts was recovered in the two positive shovel tests. Table 32 lists
these artifacts and their proveniences. All artifacts date from the present century and likely do not
pre-date the 1950s.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT460, is a dilapidated historic extant structure located in the uplands on
the south edge of the study area. This dwelling does not show on either the 1936 or the 1910 map,
which strongly indicates a post-1936 construction date. The recent historic refuse seems to
corroborate this view. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been
sufficiently documented and is not recommended as eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

Site 41TT461
Site 41 TT461 is a retention wall located east of FM 2152 and situated below a stock
tank on an intermittent drainage of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source
is this drainage which flows over the top of the site. At present, the drainage bottom is wooded
with oak, elm, pine, juniper, and hackberry. The elevation of the site is 134 m msl.
The site was first observed during the pedestrian survey. The site consists of a
sandstone constructed feature (Figure 57) across a small upland drainage approximately 25 m
below a stock tank. The center of this feature is approximately 3 feet high while the sides rise
another 2 to 2-1/2 feet above the center. Well-crafted, this feature spans a drainage but does not
act as a water-flow retardant. According to B. Robertson, co-owner of the property on which the
wall is found, the structure was constructed for erosion control in the 1930s as part of the Civilian
Conservation Corps (Phillips 1988). According to Robertson, the wall was built to give out-of-work
men "something to do".
Testing Program
No shovel tests were excavated near this feature because the site is in a drainage
bottom. The site (dam) is estimated to be 5 x 3 m. No other features or artifacts were found at
the site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT461, is an historic feature whose function is erosion control. It is
noteworthy in the attention to detail expended in the construction of this feature. This may be due
to the fact that a good effort took longer to perform and was worth more money. It is the opinion
of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and should not be
recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT462
Background Data
Site 41 TT462 is a prehistoric site located on a small erosional remnant at the upper
edge of the interfluve overlooking Hart Creek to the southwest of the site (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is Hart Creek, 120 m from the site, and the topography of the site
slopes gently towards Hart Creek. At present, this site lies in open improved pasture with one oak
on the site. A feed shed is also located on the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five
percent, although extensive rodent burrows are evident on the surface. The elevation of the site
is 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located when a piece of lithic debitage was recovered in Level 2 of the
first shovel test. An intensive surface survey and an additional two shovel tests were subsequently
conducted on the erosional remnant. One of the two additional shovel tests was positive. The soil

is a brown loamy sand over orange sandy loam beginning about 65 to 70 cm below the surface,
where excavation was terminated. On the basis of the positive shovel tests and the extent of the
landform, the size of the site is estimated to be 30 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered in the two positive shovel tests. No artifacts were
observed on the surface of the site. One corticate chert chip was recovered from Level 2 (1020 cm) of Shovel Test 1, while Shovel Test 2 yielded one tertiary chert flake in Level 4 (30-40 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41TT462 is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on an erosional remnant
of the interfluve overlooking Hart Creek. A more precise date cannot be determined at this time
due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Rodent activity has disturbed the integrity of the
site and likely accounts for the spread of the artifact assemblage through levels 2 and 4. Lowdensity sites with little artifact variation offer little potential for research, and it is the opinion of
EH&A's archaeologists that this ephemeral site is not potentially eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41TT463
Site 41 TT463 is a prehistoric site situated along the main branch of the headwaters
of Hart Creek (Figure A-1). The site is on a rise just above the creek floodplain. The nearest
natural water source is Hart Creek, 75 m southwest of the site. At present, this site lies in open
improved pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation. The ground surface visibility is
approximately 10 percent and may be attributable mainly to extensive rodent activity. The
elevation of the site is 122 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first located by observation of cultural materials on the ground surface
in rodent burrow tailings. A total of three shovel tests was excavated. All were negative. The soil
is a brown loamy sand, becoming lighter with depth and turning to an orange-tan clay sand by
approximately 70 cm below the surface. The surface scatter observed suggests a site size of
25x20m.
Artifact Analysis
Three artifacts were observed on the surface of the site, only one of which was
collected. One chert flake and one secondary flake were observed and left on the site. One grogtempered plainware body sherd with a light orange exterior and a tan interior was collected.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT463, is a low-density prehistoric scatter of undetermined function, most
likely relating to a Caddoan occupation. The site appears to be buried, since rodent tailing is the

10723/880206

244

only evidence for a site, despite shovel testing. The rodent activity is extensive and, coupled with
the paucity of a~tifacts, it is the opinion of the EH&A consultants that this site has lost virtually
all of its integrity, and as such, would not yield important new information pertinent to prehistoric
research. In the opinion of EH&A, the site is sufficiently documented and is not eligible for the
NRHP.
Site 41 TT464
Background Data
Site 41 TT464 is a prehistoric site located on the eastern edge of the interfluve
between Hart Creek and an unnamed intermittent tributary which flows south to join Hart Creek
just below 41TT464 (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is the tributary, which is
approximately 120 m east of the site. The slope of the site is minimal, although the slope of the
interfluve, just east of the site, is considerably more. At present, this site lies in open improved
pasture with trees (oak dominates) on the slope of the interfluve. The ground surface visibility is
less than five percent, although some rodent activity is evident. The elevation of this site is 117 m
msl.
Testing Program
The site was first observed when one piece of lithic debitage was recovered in Level 1
of the first shovel test. An intensive surface survey and three additional shovel tests were
conducted in the site area. All were negative. The soil, as seen in Shovel Test 1, is a brown sandy
loam, becoming orange brown by 15 cm, with an increase in clay content by 65 cm below the
surface. The presence of one artifact in the shovel test suggests a site size of 1 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
One artifact was observed on the site. A decorticate quartzite chip was collected in
Level 1 (1-10 cm) of Shovel Test 1.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT464, is a prehistoric isolated artifact. A more precise date may not be
determined at this time. The site is very shallow in depth and has been impacted heavily by
historic clearing and cultivation practices as well as rodent activity. It is the opinion of EH&A's
archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and is not eligible for nomination to
the NRHP.
Site 41TT465
Background Data
Site 41 TT465 is a prehistoric site located on a small upland knoll at the end of a ridge
between two erosional drainages along Tankersley Lake (Figure A-1). The lake at this location was
formed by construction of a dam on Tankersley Creek south of the study area. The nearest natural

10723/880206

245

water source, a small intermittent tributary of the now-flooded Tankersley Creek, is located 40 m
north of the site. At present, the site lies in open improved pasture with bermudagrass as the
dominant vegetation type. The ground surface visibility is less than five percent, although
considerable evidence of rodent activity is visible on the surface of the site. The elevation of this
site is 116 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was initially located when one piece of lithic debitage was recovered in
Level 4 of the first shovel test. An additional two shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were
conducted to assess the site and to determine the site boundaries. No other artifacts were
recovered and no cultural features were observed. The soil is a brown fine sand overlying orangebrown clay sand at 50 cm below the ground surface. The one positive shovel test and the
topography suggest a site size of 10 m in diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Only one artifact was observed on this site. A decorticate chert chip was collected
from Level 4 (30-40 cm) of Shovel Test 1.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT465, is an isolated artifact. The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts
precludes a more precise dating of the site. Due to the lack of artifacts and a well-defined cultural
horizon, it is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been adequately recorded and
is not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT466
Background Data
Site 41TT466 is a prehistoric site located on an upland knoll overlooking Tankersley
Lake, which is approximately 45 m east of the site (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source
was likely Tankersley Creek, which is now flooded by Tankersley Lake. Currently, this site lies in
open improved pasture with bermudagrass as the dominant vegetation type. Elm, sweetgum and
pine were observed along the edge of the lake. The ground surface visibility on the site is less
than five percent, although rodent activity is prevalent. The elevation of the site is 116 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was initially located by shovel testing. The first shovel test yielded two pieces
of lithic debitage in Level 6. An additional two shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were
conducted with negative results. The soil is a light brown fine sand that extends greater than 1 m
below the ground surface. Shovel testing and topography suggest a site size of 20 x 15 m.

10723/880206

246

through Level 3. The soil is a dark brown sandy loam to 10 cm, becoming lighter with depth. By
40 to 50 cm below the surface, it develops into a reddish-brown clay sand. The site size is
approximately 100 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 18 artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests. Table 33 lists the artifacts
recovered by shovel test and level. The stoneware sherd recovered in Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel
Test 1 is a basal fragment and is polychrome decalcomania with a blue and green floral design.
The whiteware rim sherd recovered in Shovel Test 2, Level 2 (10-20 cm), is a decalcomania with
a green and pink floral design. For the most part, over 90 percent of the artifacts noted are of
recent vintage.
Arc!'~aeological

Interpretation and Conclusion

This site, 41 TT467, is an historic site which is indicated both on the 1910 soil survey
map and on the 1936 county highway map. The 1965 quadrangle map also shows that this site was
likely occupied through that year. None of the remaining structural features are indicative of a
1910 occupation and most of the artifacts are of recent vintage. Only the decalcomania and
square-cut nail suggest a 1930s or earlier occupation. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists
that the earliest occupation has been destroyed by recent occupants and that, as a result, archaeological testing would not yield significant data pertaining to the nineteenth century. This site should
not be recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT468
Background Data
Site 41 TT468 is an historic site located south of FM 1734 and west of Tankersley
Creek (Figure A-1). The site is situated on a broad upland area between Tankersley Creek and
a major intermittent tributary of this creek. The nearest natural water source is the head of a
minor upland tributary of Tankersley Creek, approximately 150 m north of the site. At present,
the vegetation largely consists of bermudagrass with elm and juniper surrounding the house area.
The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent and the elevation is 125 m msl. Although the
site is present on the 1965 quadrangle map, it is not present on either the 1910 soil survey map
(Figure 16) or the 1936 county highway map (Figure 17).
The site was first observed when a series of cement piers were observed scattered on
the surface in the former house area. To the east of the house area is a pump house divided into
two compartments. The northern one-half contains a glazed culvert-lined well with a pump. The
southern half is empty. Also, several cement slab fragments measuring approximately 8 x 3 feet
are present south of the house area and may be the remains of outbuildings.
Testing Program
Only one shovel test was excavated on this site and it was located just north of the
house foundation area. This shovel test was excavated to 40 cm below the ground surface, and

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT468, is a former house site located along FM 1732. The house appears
to have been moved off the site and the outbuilding shown on the 1965 topographic map is no
longer present. In fact, it appears that the land to the south and west of the site has been
substantially altered. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site is not 50 years old
and should not be recommended as eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT469
Background Data

,,i,

Site 41 TT469 is an historic scatter located on the north side of County Road NW-28
and situated at the upland margin of East Piney Creek at the head of a tributary (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is this tributary, which is approximately 20 m south of the site. At
present the site lies in open improved pasture with scattered elm and juniper trees. Narcissus is
also present on the site. The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent and the elevation of
this site is approximately 122 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first located when narcissus plants were observed on the survey. Three
shovel tests were excavated in the site area and an intensive surface survey was conducted. No
artifacts or cultural features were observed on the surface of the site and two of the three shovel
tests were positive. These yielded artifacts in levels 2 and 4. The soil is a brown loamy sand,
becoming sandier by 20 cm below the surface and clay sand by 50 cm. The site size is estimated
at 25 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests. Shovel Test 1 yielded
one unbleached bottle glass sherd in Level 2 (10-20 cm) and one eight-penny wire nail in Level 4
(30-40 cm). Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel Test 2 yielded one six-penny wire nail.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT469 is an historic scatter that is neither present on the 1910 soil survey map,
the 1936 county highway map, nor the 1965 topographic map. Very little artifactual material is
present on this site and that which is present likely dates to after the first quarter of this century.

~-Â·--~~~.........---------------------

A barn was to the northeast of the house (Figure 59). It was of frame construction with vertical
board siding. A collapsed lean-to was located along the east side of this structure.
Testing Program
Fifteen shovel tests were placed over the site area. The soil was found to be an
undifferentiated sandy loam approximately 1 m deep. Testing at this depth was difficult due to a
high water table which flooded the test about 90 cm deep. At this point, however, clay was
reached in two tests. Most of the remaining tests were terminated between 50 and 80 cm below
ground surface. Eight of the tests contained cultural materials. Site size was determined to be
about 100 x 50 m.
Artifact Analysis
Artifacts recorded from the shovel tests document a wide range of occupation, from
the late nineteenth century to the middle twentieth century. The depth of cultural materials is
typically between ground surface and 40 cm; however, Shovel Test 15 documented materials as
deep as 65 cm (this depth anomaly is suspected to be caused by vertical displacement from rodent
burrowing). While there is no obvious cultural stratification, the older square nails recorded from
the site are typically below more recent material. Table 34 documents the artifacts recovered from
shovel testing.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
Site 41 TT470 represents a historic farmstead that possibly dates from the 1870s. The
house and barn were photographed by the survey field crew before the current owners demolished
it in the winter of 1988-89. The overall form and massing of the house resemble typical east Texas
homesteads of the mid- to late nineteenth century; however, more recent alterations had detracted
from its integrity. Despite the razing of the old farmhouse, the site could possibly shed light into
early farming practices in the area and could be eligible for the NRHP under criterion D. Further
work is recommended to better assess the site's potential for listing in the NRHP.
Site 41 TT471
Background Data
Site 41TT471 is a prehistoric site located on a long upland knoll at the distal end of
the interfluve between two intermittent tributaries of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is one of these unnamed tributaries 200 m east of the site. Lumbering activity
had been recently completed (not by TUMCO) at the location of the site prior to EH&A's field
visit. The site was cleared of most vegetation and much of the soil profile was disturbed by hauling
and heavy machinery associated with lumbering activities. Ground-surface visibility was excellent
in disturbed areas, although it was less than five percent in the few undisturbed areas that remain.
The site elevation is 116 m msl.

Testing Program
This site was first observed by shovel testing in one of the few remaining undisturbed
areas. One piece of lithic debitage was recovered from Level 1 of the first shovel test. To assess
the site and to determine the site boundaries, a series of four additional shovel tests was excavated
and an intensive surface survey was conducted in the site area. Shovel Test 2 yielded one piece
of lithic debitage in Level 1. Shovel Test 5 yielded one piece of historic glass also in Level 1. The
soil is a brown loamy sand to orange sandy loam beginning at about 50 cm below the surface. The
positive shovel tests suggest a site of 30 x 20 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts was collected from the shovel tests. None was observed on
the surface. Shovel Test 1 yielded one decorticate quartzite chip in Level 1 (0-10 cm). One
secondary quartzite flake was recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 2. Also, one etched
clear-glass fragment was collected from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 5.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT471, is an extremely shallow, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter
located in an upland setting. A more precise date may not be determined at this time due to the
absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site. One historic artifact was
recovered in the shovel tests. A study of the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county highway
map reveals that no structure stood in this location. Since only one artifact was recovered, EH&A
archaeologists feel that this represents an isolated occurrence and does not represent an historical
component of the site. Much disturbance is present due to the lumbering activities concurrent with
the survey. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been destroyed and offers
little potential to yield additional information. As such, it also is not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP.
Site 41 TT472
Site 41 TT472 is a prehistoric site situated on a low ridge at the confluence of two
branches of an unnamed tributary of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). This ridge consists of several
rises and swales between the rises. The nearest natural water source is the unnamed tributary
25 m to the south of the site. At present, the site lies in open unimproved pasture surrounded by
an oak, elm, and pine woodland. The ground surface visibility is 5 to 10 percent with rodent spoil
piles evident on the surface. The elevation of the site is 126-129 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located when a burned quartzite cobble was noted on the surface of the
site. To better assess the site and to determine the site boundaries, five shovel tests were
excavated in the area and an intensive surface survey was conducted. Two of the five shovel tests
were positive, with cultural material only in Level 1. The soil is a tan sand with orange clay sand
beginning 50 cm below the ground surface. The positive shovel tests reflect a site size of
100 x 50 m.

10723/880206

258

Artifact Analysis
A total of three artifacts was observed on the site, two of which were collected.
Shovel Test 1 yielded one fire-cracked rock in Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 1. Shovel Test 4
yielded one decorticate chert chip in Level 1 also. Between the two shovel tests and the north edge
of the swale, one quartzite cobble was observed on the surface. This cobble had at least one flake
removed and was subsequently burned.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT472, is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on two rises of
a low ridge. A more precise date is not possible due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts.
Two of the five shovel tests were positive; however, all materials were recovered from the surface
or in Level 1. Due to the shallow nature of the site, it is likely that historic clearing and
subsequent historic land use practices have greatly impacted the original integrity of the site. It
is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site has been sufficiently documented and is not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT473
Background Data
Site 41 TT473 is an historic scatter located south of FM 1732 and northeast of
Tankersley Creek (Figure A-1). This site is situated along a small intermittent upland drainage
of Tankersley Creek. The nearest natural water source, though, is Tankersley Creek, 90 m to the
east of the site. At present, the vegetation on and around the site is predominantly bermudagrass
with various trees in the drainage areas. The ground surface visibility is less than 20 percent and
the elevation of the site is 116 m msl. This site is shown on the 1936 county highway map, but not
on the 1910 soil survey- map.
Testing Program
This site was first observed when machine-made bricks were observed on the east side
of the site by a modem shed near a borrow pit area. No other artifacts were noted on the surface.
A total of two shovel tests were excavated on the site, both of which were positive. The soil is a
brown sandy loam becoming a yellow-brown clay loam by 45 cm below the ground surface. The
site size is estimated to be 40 min diameter.
Artifact Analysis
A total of two artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. One manganese
solarized glass base fragment was recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 1 and one
sixteen-penny wire nail was recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 2.

"I
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT473, is an historic site that is shown on both the 1936 map and the
modern 1965 topographic map. Because the site is not represented on Figure 16, a 1930s date is
assigned the site. At present, however, only a very shallow cultural deposit is present and this has
likely been severely disturbed by cultivation practices that have taken place subsequent to the
destruction of the structure. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this site is not of
sufficient antiquity and the integrity of the site is too disturbed to warrant archaeological testing.
This site is not recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT474
Background Data
Site 41 TT474 is a prehistoric site situated at the tip of a low ridge that separates an
unnamed branch of Hart Creek from a small tributary of the same branch (Figure A-1). At
present, the nearest natural water source is the small intermittent tributary approximately 25 m
east of the site, although the number and location of stock tanks in the area suggest the presence
of springs. The vegetation currently consists of open improved pasture with oak/elm woodland
along the drainage. The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent, with extensive rodent
spoil piles evident over the entire ridge. The elevation of this site is 122 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located on the survey by shovel testing. The first shovel test yielded a
piece of historic glass in Level 1 and a prehistoric ceramic in Level 5. An additional two shovel
tests were excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted to better assess the site. All
were negative. The soil in the first shovel test is a brown sand over orange sandy clay beginning
at 55 cm below the surface. The landform and the artifact distribution suggest a site size of 20 m
in diameter or less.
Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were recovered from the site, one historic and one prehistoric. One clear
glass fragment was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel Test 1. One grog-tempered plainware
body sherd was recovered in Level 5 (40-50 cm) of the same shovel test.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
While it is true that one piece of clear glass was recovered from the shovel test, it is
the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that this does not represent an historic component, since
the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936 county highway map both show no structures in the vicinity.
The prehistoric component is very ephemeral, and the sherd was recovered from the transition
zone between the sand and sandy clay. The location of this sherd suggests downward displacement
by a disturbing agent such as rodents. A number of rodent burrow tailings were noted on the
surface. It is the opinion of the consulting archaeologists that, due to the ephemeral nature of the

10723/880206

260

site and the rodent activity in the site area, the site maintains no integrity and should not be
considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT475
Background Data
Site 41 TT475 is a prehistoric site located south of NW 28 at the tip of a low ridge that
separates two drainage branches at the head of a tributary of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). Both
branches have large stock tanks, suggesting the presence of springs. The nearest natural water
source is either of the two branches 50 m to the east and west of the site. At present, this site lies
in open pasture with varied grasses and scattered shrubs. An oak/elm/pine woodland is located
nearby. The ground surface visibility is less than 20 percent with rodent spoil piles and an
unimproved road bed present on the site. The elevation is 128-129 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was located by shovel testing. Three shovel tests were excavated in the site
area, of which two were culturally positive. An intensive surface survey yielded no artifacts
observed on the surface. The shovel tests show the soil to be a tan loamy fine sand over a light
orange clay sand beginning at 80 to 95 cm below the surface. The two positive shovel tests and
the topography suggest a site size of 30 m diameter.
Artifact Analysis
Four artifacts were found in the two positive shovel tests. Shovel Test 1, on the east
side of the site, yielded two secondary chert flakes in Level 5 (40-50 cm) and one decorticate chert
chip in Level 7 (60-70 cm). One secondary chert flake was recovered in Level 1 (0-10 cm) of
Shovel Test 2, located on the west side of the site.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT475, is a buried prehistoric low- to moderate-density lithic scatter
located on a small rise at the tip of a ridge in the East Piney Creek drainage basin. A more
precise date is not possible due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. There is a great
difference between the tests in the vertical distribution of artifacts, suggesting a two-component
site separated by culturally sterile soil. The site may yield information valuable to the
understanding of current research problems raised in Chapter V region and, if impacted,
archaeological testing is recommended.
Site 41 TT476
Background Data
Site 41 TT476 is an historic site located on the east side of County Road NW-41 at the
intersection of this road and an old abandoned road shown on the 1910 soil survey map and the
present quadrangle map (Figure A-1). This site is situated near the head of an unnamed branch

drainage at tile margin of the divide between Piney and East Piney creeks. The nearest water
source is 250 m northeast of the site. At present, this site lies in open improved pasture with
scattered oak and elm present. The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent. The elevation
of the site is 117 m msl. This site is shown on the 1936 county highway map.
Testing Program
This site was first located when a well was observed on the side of the road. This well
has a cast-concrete collar and cover with two holes in the collar for a pipe just above a small
cinder-block foundation. Two shovel tests and an intensive surface survey were conducted to
determine the site size and to assess the site. Also present on the surface of the site were a
bulldozed pile of cast-cement piers, a gas or water pipe, scattered bricks, a pile of lumber and
miscellaneous debris, a 55-gallon drum filled with cans and bottles, and a pile of brick piers, a
toilet, and a sink that may cover a second well or other hole in the ground. Modern bottle glass,
tin cans, and miscellaneous metal parts were also observed scattered around the site. The two
shovel tests excavated yielded artifacts in levels 1 and 2. The soil is a brown loamy sand changing
to a lighter brown fine sand by 20 cm below the surface which became higher in clay content with
depth. The site size is estimated to be 75 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of eight artifacts was recovered from the shovel tests. Shovel Test 1, Level 1
(0-10 cm) yielded one milk-glass fragment, two clear bottle-glass fragments, and two wire nail
fragments. One clear bottle-glass fragment and one wire nail fragment of undetermined size were
recovered in Level 2 (10-20 cm) of the same shovel test. Only one artifact was recovered in Shovel
Test 2: one mortar fragment was collected in Level 1 (0-10 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT476, is an historic site indicated on the 1936 county highway map,
although it is not present on the earlier 1910 map nor the more recent 1964 topographic map.
The two different types of piers (cast concrete and cemented brick) and a possibility of two wells
may indicate that two house locations are represented here. The maps and artifacts suggest a post1910 occupation to the 1960s, most likely dating from the 1930s. The site is little more than
50 years old and is disturbed. Because of this it is the recommendation of EH&A's archaeologists
that this site should not be recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41 TT477
Background Data
Site 41 TT477 is an historic site with a prehistoric component located east of County
Road NW-41 along an old abandoned road that is shown on the 1910 soil survey map and the 1936
county highway map (Figure A-1). This site is situated on a high spot on the upland edge
overlooking a drainage which flows into East Piney Creek, south-southeast of the site. The nearest
natural water source is this drainage, approximately 225 m southeast of the site. At present, the
site lies in open improved pasture with hackberry, walnut, chinaberry, narcissus and trifoliate

10723/880206

262

orange. The ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent over most of the site area, although
the southern edge of the site is eroded and visibility is greater than 50 percent. The elevation of
the site is 116 m msl. This site is shown on both the 1910 and the 1936 maps, but by 1964, it no
longer showed on the topographic map.
This site was first noted when a machine-made-brick and cement-lined well was
observed in conjunction with the narcissus and trifoliate orange plants. A total of three shovel
tests was excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted to better assess the site. Two
level rectangular areas were surrounded by vegetation, possibly indicative of former structure areas.
Also noted on the site surface were whiteware, clear glass, and corrugated metal. In the eroded
area, crockery and purple glass were observed.
Testing Program
Of the three shovel tests excavated, two were placed near the possible structure areas.
One of these was culturally positive down through Level 6 (50-60 cm), while the other had
artifactual materials 10 to 30 cm below the surface. The third shovel test, excavated on the north
side of the site, contained artifacts in levels 2 and 3 (10-30 cm) also. The soil is a brown loamy
sand becoming lighter in color by 30 cm and turning to an orange-brown loamy sand with
increasing clay. The deepest shovel test was excavated to 70 cm below the surface. The surface
scatter and the positive shovel tests indicate a site size of 100 x 75 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 33 artifacts was recovered from the three positive shovel tests. Table 35
illustrates the artifact assemblage and provenience. The biface recovered in Level 3 (20-30 cm)
of Shovel Test 3 is a crudely made chert biface fragment. It measures 1.35 cm thick, is 3.35 cm
long and 3.3 cm wide, and weighs 16 g.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT477, is a multi-component site with an historic occupation and a small
prehistoric component. The prehistoric component consists of a single artifact located on the
western one-half of the site and is disturbed due to its shallow provenience. In fact, it may have
been collected by the historic occupants. The historic component, a house site, appears to originally
date from the early twentieth century, and possibly earlier, to the mid-nineteenth century. The site
is relatively intact and subsequently offers a high potential to yield information on turn-of-thecentury farmsteads. If the site is to be impacted, archival research and testing to determine NRHP
eligibility is recommended. Testing for the prehistoric component is not recommended.
Site 41 TT478
Background Data
Site 41TT478 is an historic site located east of County Road NW-41 at the end of an
old abandoned road that is shown on the 1910 soil survey map and the modern topographic map
(Figure A-1). This site is situated on an upland knoll at the top of a slope above and to the south

of an intermittent tributary of East Piney Creek. The nearest natural water source is this tributary,
which is approximately 85 m north of the site. At present, this site lies in open improved pasture
with one large elm tree on the north side of the site. The ground surface visibility is less than five
percent, although numerous rodent burrows are present on the site. The elevation is 116 m msl.
This site is shown on the 1910 soil survey map, but not on the 1936 county highway map.
Site 41TT478 is located on a 178.2-acre tract in the James W. Green Survey
(Abstract 229), which was owned by the Wood family for approximately 73 years. W.W. Wood
purchased 112 acres of this tract from W.A. and R.M. Baxley in January 1904, for $665 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 10, page 551). A Deed of Trust was executed by W.W. Wood to
A.C. Rubey in July 1927, to secure four promissory notes held by the Bonner Loan and Investment
Company in Dallas (Titus County Deed of Trust Records Volume 13, page 506). A release was
issued in November 1933 to W.W. Wood by the Bonner Loan and Investment Company (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 18, page 256). Anna, probably referring to Texana, and Mintie
Wood, both "feme soles," sold the tract to Earl Summerlin in October 1933, for one dollar and the
assumption by Earl Summerlin of a $700 debt (Titus County Deed Records Volume 81, page 168).
The remaining 65.4 acres was part of the Mrs. M.S. Wood homestead. She purchased
60 acres from W.W. Wood in October 1894, for $123.75 (Titus County Deed Records Volume 16,
page 354) and acquired an additional 84 acres in November 1883 from T.G. Black for $450 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 15, page 353). Tom L. Gates, et al. deeded 81.24 acres, the north
half of the Mrs. M.E. Wood homestead, to Texana and Mintie Wood in February 1925 (Titus
County Deed Records Volume 62, page 592). At the same time, Mintie and Texana Wood
conveyed the south half of the Mrs. M.E. Wood homestead to Tom L. Gates, et al. (Titus County
Deed Records Volume 65, page 376). In August 1940, Texana Wood, a "feme sole," sold Earl
Summerlin 54.4 acres for one dollar and" ... in further consideration of the love and affection I
(Texana Wood) have for my nephew, Earl Summerlin." (Titus County Deed Records Volume 119,
page 364). The tract has been sold since this time.
According to the 1910 census, W.W. Wood was a 45-year old single male farmer. His
widowed 67-year old mother, Melissa, and two sisters, Texana and Mintie, lived with him. Texana
and Mintie were 42 and 38 years old respectively. Earl, Josephine, Ruth, and Janie Summerlin also
resided with the Wood family. The 1905 ad valorem tax rolls state that W.W. Wood owned
304 acres with an appraised value of $1,300. Mrs. M.E. Wood is not listed, indicating that
W.W. Wood paid her taxes. Mrs. M.E. Wood is listed in the 1915 tax rolls owning 144 acres. This
land increased in value from 1910 to 1915 by $135. W.W. Wood owned 103 acres in 1915
according to the ad valorem tax rolls. The discrepancy in acreage cannot be explained. The
property was appraised at $600. The 1935 ad valorem tax rolls state that Anna Wood owned
76.25 acres, her homestead, which was worth $500. Also, Earl Summerlin owned 109 acres worth
$880. This was not his homestead.
Testing Program
The site was first located when a well was observed during survey. In order to assess
the site, a total of three shovel tests were excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted.
The well, on the southwest side of the site, is lined with large ferruginous sandstone cobbles below
ground while the superstructure is constructed of machine-made bricks and cement. The bricks

10723/880206

read "CORSICANA BRICK CO". On the northeast edge of the site is what may be the remains
of a shed, although all that remains is a decayed pile of boards and corrugated metal. Also noted
on the surface, in rodent burrow spoil piles, were whiteware, brown glazed stoneware, and clear
bottle-glass fragments. The shovel tests were all positive, with the largest concentration of artifacts
in Shovel Test 1, which was placed nearest the well. The depth of cultural deposit extends from
0 to 50 cm. The soil is a brown fine sand becoming lighter in color and higher in clay content
beginning in Level 5 (40-50 cm). The shovel tests were generally terminated by 60 to 65 cm below
the surface. The surface artifacts and positive shovel tests indicate a site size of 120 x 100 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of 31 artifacts was recovered from the three shovel tests. Table 36 lists these
artifacts by shovel test and level.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
No occupation structures are present on the site, although a structure is indicated on
this location in 1910. Archival research suggests the site represents the Wood family homestead
dating from ca. 1900. Site 41TT478 appears to be similar in age to historic site 41TT477, a short
distance to the southwest. Site 41TT478 is not nearly as intact as 41TT477, which was
recommended for testing. The integrity of this site has been severely compromised by rodent
activity and historic cultivation and, in the opinion ofEH&A's archaeologists, 41TT478 should not
be recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT479
Background Data
Site 41TT479 is a prehistoric site located on a small rise on the upland edge
overlooking the floodplain of a major tributary of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest
natural water source is this tributary, which is approximately 100 m south of the site. At present,
the site lies in open improved pasture. The grasses are thick on the top of the rise where the
ground surface visibility is less than 5 percent, with extensive rodent burrowing evident. On the
slope, below the crest of the rise, on the south and southeast borders of the site, the ground is
highly eroded and little vegetation is present. The elevation of the site is 116 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was initially located by shovel testing. One piece of lithic debitage was
recovered in Level 2. A second shovel test was placed on the rise, away from the upland edge, but
it was culturally negative. An intensive surface survey was also conducted, closely studying the
rodent spoil piles and the eroded areas especially. One burned sandstone rock was observed on
the surface. The positive shovel test showed the soil to be a tan sand with many limonite gravels
and an increase in clay and gravels beginning after 15 cm below the surface. The site size is
estimated to be 20 x 15 m based on the artifact distribution and the topography.

Artifact Analysis
Two artifacts were observed on the site. One burned sandstone rock was observed
on the surface and one tertiary quartzite flake was collected from Level 2 (10-20 cm) of Shovel
Test 1.
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT479, is a shallow, buried low-density lithic scatter and probable campsite
located above a major tributary of East Piney Creek. A precise date cannot be determined for this
site at this time due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Erosion has played a major role
in impacting this site, especially along the downhill edge, and rodent activity has also affected the
integrity of this site. It is the opinion of EH&A's archaeologists that, due to the shallow,
ephemeral nature of this site and the obvious disturbing factors mentioned above, this site has a
low potential to yield further information and should not be considered eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP.

Background Data
Site 41 TT480 is a prehistoric site located in the uplands on a small rise on a narrow
toe ridge extending southeast toward the confluence of two intermittent tributaries of East Piney
Creek (Figure A-1). The nearest natural water source is one of these tributaries, approximately
90 m southwest of the site. At present, the site lies in an area that was wooded; however, now it
is cleared, with little ground cover. Lumbering activity was taking place concurrent with the survey.
The ground surface visibility is approximately 75 percent and much of the ground surface has been
disturbed by heavy machinery. The elevation of this site is approximately 119 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was initially observed by shovel testing during the pedestrian survey. An
additional two shovel tests were excavated and an intensive surface survey was conducted to assess
the site and to determine the site boundaries. No artifacts were observed on the surface despite
the good ground surface visibility. Only Shovel Test 1 was positive, with artifacts extending from
10 to 30 cm below the ground surface. The soil is a tan fine sand, becoming a loamy fine sand
about 40 to 50 cm and an orange-tan sandy clay by 80 cm below the surface. The site size is
estimated to be approximately 15 m in diameter, based on the topography and the positive shovel
test.
Artifact Analysis
Three artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 1, the only positive shovel test. One
decorticate chip was collected in Level 2 (10-20 cm), and is made from a semi-transparent chert
which is of non-local origin. Level 3 (20-30 cm) yielded one tertiary chert flake and one
decorticate chert chip.

Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41TT480, is a low-density shallowly buried lithic scatter. The site has been
heavily impacted by lumbering, and it is the opinion of the consulting EH&A archaeologists that
this site would not yield vital information pertinent to the prehistoric cultural sequence of the
region. It is not recommended for nomination to the NRHP.
Site 41TT481
Background Data
Site 41 TT481 is a prehistoric site located on the extension of an upland landform
above the confluence of two intermittent tributaries of East Piney Creek (Figure A-1). The
nearest natural water source is one of the tributaries 100 m north of the site. The upper portion
of the site is artificially terraced open improved pasture, while the lower extension is in a partially
wooded area with pine as the dominant species. The ground surface visibility is less than five
percent in most areas with evidence of rodent activity observable. The elevation of the site is 111114 m msl.
Testing Program
This site was first observed when artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 1, near
the upper edge of the site. An intensive surface survey was conducted and an additional five
shovel tests were excavated to determine the site boundaries and to assess the site. Two of the
additional shovel tests were positive and the surface survey yielded less than five ceramic sherds,
two of which were collected. The soil is a brown fine sand with an orange-brown sandy clay
beginning in some areas at 40 to 50 cm below the surface and in other areas at 80 cm below the
surface. The surface artifacts and positive shovel tests suggest a site size of 90 x 40 m.
Artifact Analysis
A total of nine artifacts was collected from this site: two from the surface and the
remaining seven from the positive shovel tests. Both of the surface artifacts are grog-tempered
plainware body sherds. Shovel Test 1 yielded one grog-tempered plainware body sherd in Level 2
(10-20 cm). Shovel Test 2, excavated downslope from the first, yielded artifacts in levels 2, 3 and
5. Level 2 (10-20 cm) yielded one secondary chert flake and one grog-tempered brushed body
sherd. One tertiary chert flake was recovered in Level 3 (20-30 cm) and one plainware body sherd
with grog temper was collected in Level 5 (40-50 cm). Shovel Test 4, located still further
downslope, yielded one decorticate quartzite chip in Level 3 (20-30 cm).
Archaeological Interpretation and Conclusion
This site, 41 TT481, is a prehistoric moderate-density ceramic occupation. Shovel
testing shows that the site does not extend to the distal end of this ridge projection, but instead,
seems to be confined to the top and middle of the slope. Terracing is not evident in the middle
slope area. Due to the wide distribution of plainware sherds through the profile and the lack of
temporally specific artifacts, the number of components at this site is unknown. The site is buried
and may contain intact materials, if not features. Archaeological testing is recommended to
determine NRHP eligibility.
