ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed Sunset Ridge development project in
central Brazos County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) in June of 2005. The State agency associated with this project is the Texas
Historical Commission. Federal involvement is through the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). The area examined consisted of 99.47 acres. The Principal Investigator
was William E. Moore, and Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist. The project
area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing.
One historic site (41BZ159) was recorded. This is a wooden frame house with a shed and
well that was probably constructed circa 1939. The site is not viewed by BVRA as
significant, and no additional work is recommended. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
Southern Realty & Financial Company of College Station, Texas plans to
construct a manufactured housing community known as Sunset Ridge on a 99.47acre tract of land within the city limits of College Station in central Brazos County,
Texas (Figure 1). Topographic coverage of the project area is found on the
Wellborn topographic map dated 1977 and photo-revised 1980 (Figure 2). The
project area is roughly rectangular in shape and is bounded on the north by North
Graham Road, on the south by a subdivision, on the east by private property, and
on the west by Old I & GN Road. The nearest drainage is a tributary of Hopes
Creek that parallels the southern boundary of the proposed manufactured housing
community, and two branches of this tributary pass through the project area.
According to a map prepared by CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants,
Inc., these tributaries have been defined as Waters of the United States
(ephemeral). This determination is based on criteria established by the United
States Corps of Engineers.
Because of planed changes to Waters of the United States, the United
States Corps of Engineers has requested the client apply for a Nationwide 39
permit prior to construction. This permit is required when Â½ acre or more of Waters
of the United States will be affected. Changes to the waters include filling in a pond
and 200 feet of the easternmost tributary in the project area and constructing a
sanitary lift station and associated piping near the southern boundary of the site
between the two tributaries of Hopes Creek. In addition, three drainage control
structures will be constructed adjacent to or within the tributaries of Hopes Creek in
order to detain incremental increases in storm water runoff from the site.
The 428-lot manufactured housing community will be completed in five
phases and will contain roads, septic systems, and overhead utilities. There is a
wood frame house and shed on the property. These structures will be demolished
prior to development.
Brazos County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic. In a letter from F. Lawerence Oaks, Executive Director of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), signed by William A. Martin to W. R. Cullen dated
May 19, 2005, âthe tract proposed for development has never been surveyed for
cultural resourcesâ and âareas within 100 m of drainages could contain
archaeological material.â Therefore, an archaeological survey of the area is
required. In order to satisfy this requirement, Southern Realty & Financial
Company retained BVRA to conduct an archaeological survey and report all
findings to the THC in a report.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological
formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly
and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an
area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that
are acid sandy loams or sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature
of 95 degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days
(Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project
area is located on a tract of land that is drained by Turkey Creek and its tributaries.
Elevations vary from 250 feet along the creek bottoms to 332 feet in the uplands,
which comprise the majority of the project area. Figure 3 is an aerial photograph
that presents an overall view of the project area.
Soils
According to the recently published soil survey for Brazos County
(Chervenka 2003), three soil types dominate the project area (Figure 4). These are
Credge fine sandy loam (GrC), 1-5% slopes; Gredge fine sandy loam (GrD), 5-8%
slopes; and Zulch fine sandy loam (ZuB), 1-3% slopes. In addition, there are two
soils that are barely present. These are Tabor fine sandy loam, 0-2% slopes (TaA)
and Sandow loam, frequently flooded (Sa).
GRC and GRD soils contain a fine sandy loam above very strongly acid
clay. The depth of the sandy loam in these soils varies from 7 to 13 inches. Below
the clay is a clay loam and alkaline, stratified loamy sediments. These soils are
subject to sever water erosion. ZuB soils contain a fine sandy loam to between 5
and 13 inches. Below the clay is slightly acid clay. The underlying material is a
clay embedded with soft shale. The hazard of water erosion is severe.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is
situated within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according
to a statistical overview published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et
al. 1985:114), Brazos County contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985, 0 sites in the
county had been excavated, 0 had been tested by hand, and 33 had been surface
collected. Two recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Paleoindian,
1 was listed as General Archaic, and 1 was listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al.
1985:114). The archaeological potential of Brazos County is reflected in part by the
increasing number of recorded sites found as a result of cultural resource
management studies. As a result of these investigations, the number of recorded
sites now stands at over 150 sites (TARL site records).
One archaeological survey has been conducted within a portion of the
project area. According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Map, the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) investigated approximately 13 acres of the
extreme northeast section of the project area as part of a larger survey area, and
no sites were found. This report is not on file at TARL.
The nearest recorded site (41BZ149) was recorded by archaeologists from
the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) (Jurgens 2000) as a âlimited use
campâ on a ridge top near the upper reaches of Hopes Creek. Site 41BZ149 is
.065 km from the northwest corner of the project area and is a very sparse site in
terms of artifact yield. Artifacts observed included several chert biface fragments,
thick tertiary flakes, and chert core fragments, all in the upper 25 cm of the soil
profile. That portion of the site within the project area was determined to be not
significant.
One large area survey has been conducted in the vicinity. In 1992, the
TWDB examined a portion of a proposed wastewater treatment on White Creek to
the west of the current project area (Whitsett and Jurgens 1992). Six sites
(41BZ112-41BZ117) were recorded. And testing was recommended for sites
41BZ112 and 41BZ115. An additional survey was requested to cover 102 acres
not encompassed during their in-house investigation.
Archaeologists from Texas A&M University surveyed the 102 acres and
recorded a probable farmstead complex (41BZ115) occupied during the late 1800s
and early 1900s (Thoms 1993). This site was considered to be significant, and
testing was recommended. Testing was conducted at 41BZ112, and archival work
was conducted for site 41BZ115. That portion of 41BZ12 within the project area
was not viewed as significant.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the
presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and
vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Brazos County were
reviewed in order to become familiar with the kinds of prehistoric and historic sites
found in the area.
Field Survey
A 100% Pedestrian Survey with shovel testing was conducted on June 16
and 17, 2005. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and Edward P.
Baxter was the Project Archaeologist. Approximately half of the project area in
pasture, and the remainder was heavily wooded. The surface was examined
visually, and 48 shovel tests were excavated in order to locate buried cultural
materials if present. All excavated earth was screened through quarter-inch
hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). All shovel tests were backfilled after evaluation and mapping, and the
location of each test was plotted on the topographic map (Figure 5).
The single historic site was photographed, described in the field notes, and
assigned a field number (TS-1). The location of this site was depicted on the
topographic map (Appendix II). Later, a site form was submitted to TARL, and an
official trinomial (41BZ159) was issued. The Brazos County Courthouse was
visited in an effort to identify past owners of the project area and approximate date
of construction of the house.
Archival Research
The Brazos County Courthouse was visited, and deed records were
examined to determine land ownership. In addition, an interview was conducted
with Edsel Jones, a resident of the area since 1936.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41BZ159 is a farmstead which consists of a house (figures 6-7), shed,
corrals, and well. It is a wooden building of pier and beam construction. Several
sections of the house appear to have been added to the original core structure of
the house. Board and batten siding is present on a 15 x 30 foot rectangular section
of the house (Figure 7). This is presumed to be the original structure of the house.
Later, 105 and 117 siding were added to the later additions. The house is Lshaped and has a corrugated metal roof that appears to be newer than the original
structure. There are two smoke stacks or chimney vents on the roof that suggest
wood or propane stoves inside.
According to Edsel Jones (personal communication to William E. Moore on
June 15, 2005), the house has been remodeled several times and is not in its
original condition. This was obvious to the survey crew. Only one wooden window
remains. The rest of the windows are modern and made of metal.
There is a well in front of the house that contains a concrete casing that has
been painted to resemble bricks. Behind the house is a small wooden shed that
was probably used for storage. Today, it is vacant.
Deed records at the Brazos County Courthouse revealed the project area
was acquired by the current owner (Cheyenne II, ltd) from the heirs of W. C. Bond
on October 25, 1991 (Volume 1386, Page 69). Mr. Bond purchased the property
from the J. H. Gandy family on January 31, 1939 (Volume 99, Page 277, Deed
Records). The Gandy family obtained the land from J. H. Hensarling on March 1,
1924 (Volume 63, Page 212, Deed Records). The project area is part of a dairy,
which was operated by the Gandy family and was greater than 300 acres in size.
According to Edsel Jones, the current structure was probably not built by the Gandy
family, because their house was on the high ridge of the property. This house has
been demolished, and there is a subdivision under construction on the site. Mr.
Jones remembers the structure being referred to as the âBond Residence,â and he
recalls it being there in 1942 when he was in the 8th grade. Therefore, it is likely
that it was constructed sometime after 1939 when Mr. Bond purchased the tract.
Tax records for the property prior to 2000 are not available.
Although the house meets the age criterion to be assessed for significance,
it does not appear to meet other criteria such as a unique form of construction,
having been built by a master craftsman, or occupying a major role in local or state
history. Therefore, this site is not considered to be eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Background Research
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have
been recorded in the project area. It was learned, however, that TxDOT surveyed a
portion of the project area in 1994. No sites were found.
Field Survey
This survey did not discover evidence of prehistoric utilization or occupation
of the project area. BVRA believes that this area was not a suitable location for a
prehistoric site because of the ephemeral nature of the nearby sources of water
and the lack of deep sandy soils. No cultural materials were found in any of the 48
shovel tests, which were dug to depths of 10 to 80 cm below the existing ground
surface. All tests encountered the clay subsoil, and the majority of tests were only
dug to 10 cm or less.
One historic site (41BZ159) was found. This is a farmhouse that is
approximately 66 years of age (see Site Description above). This site does not
appear to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Disturbance to the project area was mainly confined to two areas. In the
wooded portion, there is a well pad and access road. In the eastern portion, there
is a cleared area that has been subjected to cultivation. Contours from this activity
are visible on the aerial photograph (Figure 3).
This survey was done in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as
outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
One historic site was found. It does not appear to be eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Therefore, it is recommended that the project should proceed without
further consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. Should evidence of an
archaeological site not discussed in this report be encountered during construction,
all work must be temporarily suspended in the area of the find until assessed by a
professional archeologist in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission.
