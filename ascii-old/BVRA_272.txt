ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the site of the proposed wastewater treatment
plant expansion in west-central Zapata County, Texas was performed by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on July 10, 2015 (Antiquities Permit 7336).
The size of the area examined is 4.58 ac. The field methods included a 100%
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching. Virtulaly the entire area was littered with
historic trash and there were sparse scatters of prehistoric lithic debris as well. This
area was recorded as multi-component site 41ZP965. Due to the extent of
disturbance over the entire APE, it was not possible to identify the source area of
the cultural materials. The prehistoric scatter probably represents a limited use
area that included limited activities and a possible camp. A probable metate
fragment and unifacial scraper suggests plant procurement and preparation. An
exausted core, and flakes representing all reduction stages are indicators of tool
and blade manufacture. The scraper may have been used to process Agave and
other similar plants.
The historic trash scatter covers most of the entire tract. Types observed are
bottles and bottle fragments, ceramics, colored glass, window glass, and a coffee
tin lid. The historic component could represent a dump that was pushed when the
area was cleared of vegetation. The area could also be the site of a former house,
line shack, or store. The research potential of this site is limited to an analysis of
the artifacts described in this report, on the site, and archival research that may
identify what was present at the time. It is recommended that the county be
allowed to proceed with construction of the new plant as planned. Copies of the
report will be housed at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, the County of
Zapata, Premier Civil Engineering, LLC, regional libraries, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The County of Zapata plans to expand the size of an existing wastewater
treatment plant in west-central Zapata, Texas (Figure 1). The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) is 4.58 ac. The entire tract is located in an upland setting of about 330
ft. above mean sea level. The nearest source of water that may have been
utilized in prehistoric times is Arroyo Veleno, 1830 m to the northeast. This
arroyo drains into Arroyo Indio that is 2140 m, also to the northeast. The major
source of water in the area is the Rio Grande River and the main channel is
about 4.7 km to the south. There is another channel or arroyo about 370 m to the
southwest. There are no cemeteries in the APE and the only existing structures are
those related to the existing wastewater treatment plant (Figure 2). The project
area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Zapata (2699-434)
(Figure 3).
The purpose of this permit amendment is to increase flow from 0.8 million
gallons per day (MGD) to 1.6 MGD as part of a proposed plant expansion
project. Currently, the wastewater treatment facility is operating at about 90% of
its capacity and is struggling to meet the discharge parameters set forth by Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 5/15 discharge permit. The
current permit (WQ0010462001) issued by the Texas Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (TPDES) dictates that whenever the flow reaches 90%, the
Permittee (Zapata County) shall obtain necessary authorization from the
Commission to commence construction of the necessary additional treatment
and/or collection facilities. The Permittee has taken all the proper steps to
secure funding from the United States Department of Agriculture to expand the
existing facility and is ready to commence the required permit amendment
process.
In addition to the plant having reached 90% of its capacity, the life
expectancy of the 0.8 MGD wastewater plant has expired. Both existing
oxidation ditches have major structural damage present that prevents Zapata
County Personnel from operating the facility properly. Additionally, most
of the mechanical components throughout the plant are worn out and need
total replacement. For these reasons, the proposed 1.6 MGD wastewater
treatment plant improvement project shall consist of constructing a new
headworks facility, two new aeration basins, two new clarifiers, one
chlorination basin, and a new office with TCEQ compliant laboratory.
These new plant improvements will be designed and constructed in strict
accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by TCEQ. In addition,
the planned improvements will be designed to meet the existing 5/15
discharge permit requirement. The design flow of 1.6 MGD and 2-hr peak flow
of 6.0 MGD were carefully calculated from existing plant data as required by
Rule §217.34 (Re-Rating, Expanding, or Materially Altering an Existing Facility)."

The area investigated had been cleared of all major vegetation through
grading, a process that uses an excavator with a grading blade. This method
disturbs at least six inches of the topsoil. The APE is on sloping terrain that
drops about 20 feet from the east to west. In parts of the site, mainly towards the
west, sandstone bedrock crops out at the surface. The entire site was fenced
with modern chain link fencing. Other disturbance including installation of a twoinch waterline. This line was placed in a trench 24 in. wide and 26 in. deep. One
pipe parallels the fence that forms the northwest boundary and the disturbance
associated with this waterline extends at least 5 feet from the fence. The other
waterline is a six-inch pipe that was installed to provide sufficient pressure to the
existing belt press. This six-inch line comes out from the belt press towards the
southwestern property/fence line and travels at an eight foot offset towards the
most southwesterly corner. From here, the six-inch line changes direction and
travels northeast along the same fence line for about 550 ft, before it turns to the
southwest and eventually connects with another six-inch waterline at Madison
Street.

Before the Rio Grande became an international boundary, the citizens of
Mexico lived on both sides of the river. Settlement began as early as 1765 when
the town of Roma was founded. Any cultural resources survey on or near the north
bank of the Rio Grande must consider the possibility of Spanish Colonial activity in
the area.

ENVIRONMENT
Thomas R. Hester (2004:217-259) presents an excellent discussion of
South Texas prehistory and he cites numerous sources that support his
statements. Regarding changes to the environment, Hester (2004:217) states
“The difficulty in describing, in any detail, the hydrology, fauna, and vegetation of
the region is results from wholesale modification of the south Texas environment
during the Historic period.” Today, this area is referred to by different names,
and South Texas Brush Country is one example. This is a large region that
covers about 20.5 million ac. It extends from Del Rio to San Antonio and
southeast to Rockport. The current vegetation consists mainly of mesquite,
blackbrush, brasil, cactus, and other thorny plants. There are ecoregions in the
area that affect the diversity of vegetation communities along the fringes of this
area (e. g. Inglis 1964; Taylor et al. 1999). Today’s plants are quite different from
the prehistoric past. The plant communities in south Texas were created by
types of soil, amount of rainfall, temperature, growing seasons, and grazing by
livestock. The diversity of plants and vegetation determine the species of fauna
that inhabit the area. Mesquite and many of the thorny plants that are currently
dominant spread or increased in density in historic times (e.g. Inglis 1964; Taylor
1999). Research by Richard G. Holloway (1986) identified wood species found
preserved as hearth charcoal and he deduced that that mesquite was clearly
present in riverine zones as early as 6000 B.C. Christopher J. Jurgens (1980),
believes that the typical riverine environmental pattern that exists today was
established by 300 B.C. The dominant vegetation in the area is in dispute.
Some believe that the landscape was mainly covered with native grasess while
others think that mesquite was widely distributed (Inglis 1964; Weniger 1984).
The climate in the area is defined as subtropical-subhumid. Temperatures vary
from an average of 44° F to 69 ° in January and 75° to 100° in July. The averge
annual temperature is 74°. Rainfall averages 19 inches annually and the growing
season is long at 295 days (Alvarez 2004).
Spanish explorers were in South Texas in the1600s. They reported large
areas of grasslands that apparently dominated the landscape; they also
observed woody plants (trees and shrubs) in thickets, upland areas, major
drainages and river bottoms. Mesquite was present throughout the region but at
a much lower density than today. Natural fires helped to maintain the region as a
savannah, and control woody plant densities on the prairie (e.g. Inglis 1964;
Taylor et al. 1999). South Texas was settled circa 1820-1870 and significant
changes to the landscape ensued. Concentrations of livestock near towns
resulted in an intensification of brush more rapidly than elsewhere in the rural
areas. Overgrazing on the larger cattle ranches was not a major problem as long
as open range was available.

5

The introduction of barbed wire changed land use drastically. The lack of
grass due to grazing and decreased occurrence of natural fires allowed brush to
invade the open country. Brush distribution was no longer restricted to river
bottoms, upland areas, or in thickets on the prairie. Other contributing factors
were soil compaction and droughts. The spread of brush was regarded by
ranchers as detrimental to livestock operations and attempts to control it were
intensive and widespread attempts at brush control including cabling, chaining.
root plowing, roller chopping, disking, and chemicals. These practices affected
the types of vegetation in the area and they were very destructive in terms of
turning over the soil to depths of one foot or more in some areas.
The soils in the county are generally light in color and loamy in texture
over reddish or mottled clayey subsoils. Limestone and sandstone often occur
on the surface or within 40 inches of the surface (Molina and Guerra 2011).
The Natural Resources Conservation Service website describes the soils in the
APE as Brennan fine sandy loam with 0 to 3 percent slopes (BeB). The A horizon
is sandy loam and the B horizon is sandy, clayey loam. A typical B horizon is only
10 in. below the ground surface. Another soil that may be present in this area is
Copita fine sandy loam with 1 to 5 percent slopes (CpC). The A and B horizons are
similar to the Brennan soils but the B horizon is about 11 in. below the surface.
Rock outcrops associated with the Copita soils are exposed sandstone.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to Biesaart, et al. (1985:Figure 15), the APE is located in the
Southern Coastal Plains Cultural-geographical region of Texas. In 1985, there
were 1516 recorded sites in the region (7.50% of the state). This region
encompassed 19 counties. At the time, eleven sites were listed in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and one site had been designated as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). In Zapata County, there were 75 known
prehistoric sites. Two were classified as Paleoindian, twenty-eight as Archaic,
and 12 as Late Prehistoric. In 1983, four sites in Zapata County had been given
SAL status (41ZP73; 41ZP99 – 41ZP101). Types of sites and features included
hearths, burned rock middens, unspecified burned rock features, shell and earth
middens, a bone bed, burials, and areas where stone tools were manufactured.
Disturbance was recognized as a major factor in evaluating site condition.
Erosion was the major form of disturbance to 71 sites, followed by “disturbed and
capped” (29 sites), and construction (16 sites). Although only two sites were
described as having been impacted from digging and surface collecting by
collectors, this number was probably greatly underreported. A more recent and
serious form of disturbance in the area is due to the mining of coal from the
Jackson-Yegua formation that is near the surface (Mercado-Allinger, et al. 1996).
In the uplands, much of the soils in South Texas that comprise the A-Horzion are
relatively shallow (10”-12”); therefore, this type of activity destroys those kinds of
sites. Other current forms of disturance not listed above are oil and gas
production, agriculture, and root plowing as a means of brush control. Reservoir
construction typically affects large areas and the creation of Lake Falcon in Starr
and Zapata counties covers an area of 83,654 ac. or 33,854 ha.
Most of the major sites are found along the Rio Grande; in the floodplain,
on terraces, and in nearby uplands. Sites are also numerous along the many
arroyos that help drain the area. An arroyo is usually defined as a dry streambed
or small, deep gully or channel of an ephemeral stream. They usually have
relatively flat floors and are flanked by steep sides consisting of unconsilidated
sediments. Water is usually only present after heavy rains. Sites may occur on
the banks or in the bed of the arroyo. William A. Dickens (personal
communication) has observed hearths in arroyo beds. The nearest source of
water to the APE that may have been utilized in prehistoric times is Arroyo
Veleno, about 4000 m to the northwest. The probability of a site in the APE is
considered to be high because of recorded sites nearby on similar landforms.
The first recorded sites in the county were as a result of the survey for the
proposed Falcon Reservoir during three seasons, 1950 (Krieger and Hughes),
1951 (Hartle), and 1952 (Cason). At the time of this study, there were 995
previously recorded sites (TARL files).

7

The closest recorded site to the APE is 41ZP395. It was recorded by
Samuel D. McCulloch and James E. Warren (1999) during a reconnaissance
survey of Falcon Reservoir. It is located about 420 m to the southwest on a
gravel hill along an upper terrace between two arroyos that drain into Arroyo
Veleno. No features were observed, but burned chert found on the site may
have been associated with hearths. Warren described this site as a lithic
procurement area and possible camp. Artfacts observed consisted of a single
Matamoros point; tested chert cobbles; and primary, secondary, and tertiary
flakes scattered over the surface in an area estimated to be 60 m in diameter.
The recorders describe this site as small and probably shallow. Its significance
remains undetermined.
Site 41ZP396 was also found by Samuel D. McCulloch and James E.
Warren (1999) during a reconnaissance survey of Falcon Reservoir. It was
described as a lithic scatter on a gently sloping hillside along the west side of an
arroyo that drains ito Arroyo Veleno. No artifact concentration was noted and the
scatter was estimated at 30 m in diameter. Artifacts observed included one
Matamoras point; burned chert fragments; and primary, secondary, and tertiary
chert flakes. This site is about 600 m southwest of the APE and 200 m from site
41ZP395. Both sites were estimated to be Archaic in age based on the single
point found at each one.
The major source of water in the area is the Rio Grande River and the
main channel is at about 3.6 mi. to the south. This river has a history of
meandering but it has never been close enough to the APE to be considered a
factor in choosing a place for a site. Gravels are numerous throughout this area
and many appear on the surface due to delation and erosion. Many upland sites
were created because of the abundance of cobbles suitable for making stone
tools rather than the resources of the river. These sites are usually regarded as
temporary in nature, although it is likely that these areas may have been visited
numerous times when more stone was needed. The APE is depicted on the
USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Zapata (2699-434).

ZAPATA COUNTY
Zapata County is located on U.S. Highway 83, 50 miles south of Laredo in
Webb County. It is bordered on the north by Webb County and on the east by
Jim Hogg and Starr counties. Mexico shares its western border. The county
covers 999 square miles and the landscape varies from 200 feet to 700 feet
above mean sea level. Zapata is the county’s largest town and is also the county
seat. It is located on the Rio Grande River at the junction of U.S. Highway 83
and State Highway 16. Contrary to popular belief, it was named for a loca
rancher named Antonio Zapata – not the Emilio Zapata the revolutionary and folk
hero.
Spanish explorer Miguel de la Garza Falcon is reputed to be the first
European to visit the area when he led a group of fellow adventurers down the
northern bank of the Rio Grande in 1747 from the present town of Eagle Pass to
the mouth of the river. This route later became known as the Old Military
Highway. At the time, the area was inhabited by Carrizos, Tepemaca, and
Borrado Indians. The first settlement was founded in 1750 by a rancer from
Coahuilla named Jose Vazquez Borrego. He was the creater of the Nuestra
Senora de los Dolores Hacienda only a few miles from the current town of San
Ygnacio. Another Spanish explorer, Jose de Escandon, was in the area at the
same time as Borrego and he also founded new settlements. By 1755, the ferry
located at the Dolores Haciendo was the most important crossing on the river.
Colonists who lived on the south side of the river owned land on the other side
also. They established a settlement circa 1770 and named it Carrizo. This
settlement later became Zapata. Ranching was the primary industry in the early
years of settlement. Hacienda Dolores was abandoned in 1818 due to constant
attacks by Indians. In 1821, the area that is now Zapata County became part of
the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.
The area now called Zapata County was claimed by Texas and Mexico.
During this time, there were numerous Indian raids by Apaches and Comanches
and the Dolores Hacienda was destroyed. The Spanish government continued
to grant land to settlers. In 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo awarded the
land to Texas. Zapata County was created in 1858 and it was officially organized
in January of that year with Bellville the county seat. The name was changed to
Carrizo and finally Zapata.
The early economy was largely subsistence farming and ranching with
cattle and sheep the primary animals for production. Later, goats played a major
role with the export of mohair being a major item for export. Around the turn of
the century, cotton became important and by 1920 cotton farmers were
producing 2000 bales annually. Commercial oil and gas wells entered the scene
in the 1920s and the creation of a toll bridge between Zapata and Mexico created
new markets across the border.

9

Arguably, the biggest boost to the economy occurred when the
International Falcon Reservoir was constructed on the Rio Grande and provided
flood control and water reserves for both countries as well as recreational
opportunites that brought in large scale tourism. Patsy Byfield (1966) discusses
the history of the dam and its effect on the local population. Old Zapata, for
example, is the original town that now lies beneath the waters of the lake. New
Zapata was created in 1953 on the high ground that is not prone to flooding.
By the 1960s, the influx of tourists and “snowbirds” from the north was a leading
form of income. The above information was taken from “ZAPATA COUNTY,”
Handbook of Texas Online, written by Alicia A. Garza and Christopher Long.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and other archaeological surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Zapata County were reviewed in order
to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Contract reports by Warren (1989, 1993), Moore (2010), Uecker and Warren
(2005), Kotter (1980) and a book by Thomas R. Hester (1980) were among those
reviewed prior to this study. In addition, William A. Dickens shared his knowledge of
the area and helped formulate the Scope of Work. The project area was
investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey and backhoe trenching. The client is
concerned about being required to retain a professional archaeologist to investigate
the site of the existing treatment plant. We walked over the area and found no
large areas that appeared to be undisturbed. Given the nature of construction for a
treatment plant and the shallow soils at the site it is my opinion that the only future
work that might be needed would have to do with hazardous waste issues should
the plant be dismantled.
The site of the proposed expansion of the wastewater treatment plant was
the focus of this investigation. It is 4.58 ac. in size and fenced. When we arrived at
the site, we were met by Carlos Trevino (Utilities Director for Zapata County),
Eloy Chapman (Maintenance Supervisor), Mike Bonoan, Kiko Valadez, and Tino
Zapata. The first step was to walk over the area in an attempt to identify artifacts
and features that might be present on the surface. The surface survey was carried
out by walking randomly over the entire area and stopping to inspect areas that
were devoid of vegetation. We entered the tract in the northwest quadrant. Our
first observation was sandstone cropping out at the surface. Overall, surface
visibility was excellent (Figure 4).
Because the surface had been disturbed through grading, we decided a
series of backhoe trenches would be the best course of action since the A horizon
was not only disturbed but reported to be shallow. The first three backhoe trenches
were excavated parallel to the fence that borders the southern side of the tract and
each trench was oriented from west to east. The shallow depth of the A horizon
was quickly confirmed, but the trenches (except for Backhoe Trench 6) were dug
from 90 cm to 179 cm, well into the B horzon (Appendix I). The profiles were
checked for cultural materials that might indicate a buried site or staining that might
be an indication of a fire (cultural or natural). The profiles in five of the six trenches
were similar.

Measurements were taken of the length, width, and depth of each trench as
well as the vertical extent of the A horizon. A hand held GPS was used to take
coordinates at the center of each trench. The distance from the trenches to the
nearest fence was measured with a tape for more accuracy in the mapping
process. The location of the backhoe trenches appear in Figure 6. These data
also appear on a specially designed log (Appendix II) and the entire project was
documented through field notes and digital photography. The kinds of artifacts
were noted and those specimens considered to be diagnostic or unusual were
photographed. A random sample of historic trash and lithic debris was described
in the field notes and photographed in the field. Table 1 is a summary of those
identified.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
previously recorded sites had been recorded within the boundaries of the current
APE. The two nearest prehistoric sites (41ZP395 and 41ZP396) are between 400
and 600 m from the current APE. They are described on the site forms as lithic
procurement areas and/or possible campsites next to arroyos. At both sites,
cultural materials were described as probably restricted to the surface. The
presence of tested cobbles; primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes; some burned
chert; and a Matamoros point at each site suggests that there was a good
probability that a similar site might be present within the project area.
The entire APE had been cleared of vegetation by chaining. This method
disturbs the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches. Other disturbed areas include the
installation of water line. The pipe was placed in a trench 24 in. wide and 36 in.
deep. The soil around the trench was compacted from the weight of the heavy
equipment used in the installation of the waterline.
One multi-component site was recorded at TARL as 41ZP965. The artifacts
at this site are all surface finds. No evidence of human activity was seen in any of
the six backhoe trenches. The prehistoric component is described here as a very
sparse scatter of flakes, tools, and tested cobbles over an undetermined area.
Identifiable specimens include one probable metate fragment, at least ten flakes
representing all reduction stages, three tested cobbles, and a unifacial scraper that
was created by splitting a cobble. An exhausted core and a core showing the scar
from blade removal were also found. No burned rock or chert was observed.
Because of the disturbance caused by chaining, the original location of these
artifacts could not be determined. Therefore, no attempt was made to estimate the
size of this component. The absence of diagnostic artifacts precluded any attempt
at dating the site. Not many cobbles were seen but it was noted that they appeared
to be most numerous near a small arroyo to the south and outside the APE. Two of
the tested cobbles have enough sharp edges that they could have been used as
tools. Very little can be said about the prehistoric component except the most
obvious activities were probably lithic procurement, plant processing, some tool
maintenance, and/or a campsite near the arroyo.
The trash scatter was large and the artifacts were numerous (See Table 1).
The kinds of artifacts noted include glass bottles and bottle fragments, ceramics,
coffee tin lid, milkglass, and unidentified metal fragments. The size of the original
site could not be determined due to chaining with an excavator to remove the
brush. One possibility of site type could be that of a trash dump that was scattered
during the brush eradication process. This could explain any mixture of types of
artifacts and those that were manufactured at different times. The span of time
represented by the artifacts is from the latter part of the 19th century through the
early years of the 20th century.

16

Another plausible explanation for the presence of this large scatter of historic
trash could be the site of a former homestead. Conversations with local informants
suggest that this area was very rural during the early to middle part of the 20th
century. Although the vast majority of artifacts observed were items that would
have been purchased and used by a normal family of that time. However, the only
items that suggest building materials were some flat clear glass fragments that may
be the remains of broken window panes and a thick ceramic that has a reddishorange glaze on both sides. This specimen could be a fragment of very old tile
used on a roof or floor. It is very similar to some of the early terracotta tiles that
originated in Spain. In Roma and San Ygnacio, similar tiles were observed on the
roofs of some of the older buildings. No bricks or other building materials typically
found at a more recent house site were seen. If a structure was present, it probably
rested on piers. Wood seems the most likely candidate since no bricks or rocks
large enough to serve that purpose were present. It is, however, possible that such
materials could have been borrowed to be used elsewhere at a later date. Again,
site size could not be determined.
It was possible to identify some of the artifacts by their markings or other
recognizable features. For example, some of the brown glass was obviously
fragments of a snuff bottle. One bottle top bears the name “Sauza” and I was able
to determine that Sauza is a company in Mexico that began making Tequila in 1873
and is still in business. One small brown bottle bears the name “Whitehall.” Both
bottles have a screw top that indicates they were probably manufactured sometime
after 1920. One very small clear glass bottle (2 in. tall and ½ in. in diameter) was
identified by images on the Internet as a medicine bottle but purpose is not known.
It has numbers on the base but only two are readable. It has no seams and a
crimped lid. This dates it to sometime before the change to screw top bottles but
an estimated on the age of this bottle is not possible at this time. One brown bottle
was also molded and it appears that it conforms to a type manufactured circa 1910.
Its purpose is also not known. Two manufacturer’s marks represent the Owens
Glass Company. One mark identifies bottles that were manufactured in 1954 and
the same logo is still in use. The other mark was only used from circa 1929 to 1960,
The artifacts bearing these logos are a clear bottle base, a brown bottle base, and a
the brown Whitehall medicine bottle. The age of manufacture of the historic artifacts
ranges from sometime in the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The prehistoric and historic components at site 41ZP965 are not considered
to be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. This assessment is based on a
lack of association with the following criteria for evaluation and only applies to that
portion of the site within the APE.
•
•
•
•

Site not known to be associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of prehistory or history.
Site not known to be associated with the lives of significant persons in the
past.
Site not believed to embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable
entity whose components may lack individual distinction.
Site not likely to yield information important in prehistory or history.

Although some information can be obtained from artifacts, this site has been
virtually destroyed through land clearing operatons. Also, there is no evidence that
any portion of this site exists except on the surface.
It is, therefore, recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered
during the excavation of the trench at any of the areas investigated, all work must
stop until the THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in
accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
