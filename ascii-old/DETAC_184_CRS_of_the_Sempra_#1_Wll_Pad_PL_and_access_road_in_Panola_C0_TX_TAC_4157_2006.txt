ABSTRACT
On 30 May 2006 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed Sempra #1 well location and access
road in Panola County, Texas for Will Drill Production Co. Inc. A pipeline between the
well location and the Yellow Dog Gas Unity #1 was added on 19 September 2006. All
work was conducted under Antiquities Permit #4157. The project plans include building
an access road 10 meters (30 ft) long and a 90 x 107 meter (300 x 350 ft) well pad on the
military crest, slope, and tow slope of an upland ridge overlooking the Sabine River
floodplain. The pipeline was in the floodplain and extended roughly 2.5 km (1.6 miles)
between the well locations. Excavation of 35 shovel tests of the area found varying
depths of loamy sand on the uplands and clay in the floodplain. Evidence of logging on
the site includes shallow depressions and mounds along with disturbed soil profile on the
uplands. One light lithic artifact scatter was found as a result of the shovel testing. Of
the 13 shovel tests excavated in the site area only six flakes and one tested pebble were
recovered. Artifacts recovered from the site will be curated at TARL upon completion of
the project. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area because of the abundance of this
type of site in east Texas, the lack of diagnostic artifacts, and a combination of the scant
and scattered material from logging. Cultural resource clearance is requested.

INTRODUCTION
On 30 May 2006 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of the proposed Sempra Energy Gas
Unity #1well location and access road in Panola County, Texas for Will Drill Production
Company, Inc. On 19 September, a pipeline was added that extended from the Sempra
well location to the nearby Yellow Dog Gas Unity #1. Roughly three-quarters of the well
location was on private property owned by Temple Inland. The remaining quarter of the
well pad and the pipeline was on land managed by the Sabine River Authority (SRA). In
adherence with the Antiquities Code of Texas, the SRA requested a cultural resources
survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
number 4157.
The proposed project focused on the proposed Sempra #1 well location, pipeline
to the Yellow Dog Gas Unit #1, and access road to an improve gravel road. The area was
located east-southeast of Carthage, TX near the Louisiana – Texas border and along the
northern edge of the Sabine River floodplain. The purpose of this survey was to locate,
describe and record any cultural resources within the project area boundaries. The report
was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas
Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area encompassed approximately 4.7 hectare (11.7 acres) in Panola
County, TX (Figure 1) with a 10 meter (m) (30 foot) access road, 2.5 km (1.6 mile) long
pipeline right-of-way and a 90 m x 107 m (300 ft x 350 ft) well pad. The access road and
well pad area was dominated by the slope and tow slope of an upland ridge overlooking
the Sabine River floodplain.

The proposed access road extended from an existing

logging road was an elevated surface with drainage ditches to the pad. The pipeline
crosses a frequently flooded portion of the Sabine River bottoms; water lines on the trees
were evident and flood debris in trees were common. The privately owned portion of the
well location was clear cut roughly ten years ago and was replanted in pine trees. The
lowland, SRA property, was dominated by mesic vegetation and dark clayey soil.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Panola County has been studied in numerous small surveys and larger
investigations. The small surveys have focused on well locations, the U.S. 59 corridor,
smaller farm to market roads by TxDOT, and rural development throughout the county
by FHWA. Of these small surveys, the ones crossing lowland areas have recorded more
sites than the upland surveys. Larger investigations in Panola County have focused on
the Martin Lake area (Clark and Ivey 1974; EH&A 1986 and 1994) and the Sabine River
has been studied on several occasions, ranging from Skiles, Bruseth, and Perttula (1980)
to more recently by Perttula (1989). Surveys in the Martin Lake area revealed a majority
of these resources are prehistoric open campsites near year round water and on sandy
knolls, tow slopes, or ridges. Both prehistoric and historic sites were found adjacent to
the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges. The Sabine
River studies are synthesis of many investigations and attempt to describe and order
prehistoric habitation of the area into holistic terms for future examinations.
Panola County is in the Eastern Archaeological Planning Region. This region
included populations ranging from the Paleo-Indian (pre 6000 B.C.) through the Archaic
(6000 B.C. – 200 B.C.), Early Ceramic (200 B.C – A.D. 800), and Late Prehistoric (A.D.
800 – A.D. 1680) into the Historic (A.D. 1680 – present). These periods were based on
changes in environment, technology, and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to
meet varying circumstances.
The Paleo-Indian populations were characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters
and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals (Story 1990; Bryant and
Schafer 1977:19-20). Paleo-Indian sites are rare and generally consist of isolated finds.
Artifacts recovered in the region suggest that early occupations were principally distributed
on Tertiary deposits in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). These finds were
typically lanceolate projectile points with ground, concave bases and longitudinal fluting.
Toward the end of the Paleo-Indian period, point styles gradually changed to more
stemmed and barbed varieties.
The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally
specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment but retained a huntinggathering subsistence (Story 1990). The Archaic is further divided into Early, Middle, and

3

Late divisions. The Early Archaic is viewed as transitional from Paleo-Indian to Archaic
(Duffield 1963) with technology and population as the driving forces, requiring a greater
emphasis on territoriality and a greater reliance on the inferior, local east Texas lithic
resources. The Middle Archaic subsistence strategies remained dependent on a hunting and
gathering economy with a greater reliance on native plants (Thurmond 1990). The Late
Archaic period occupations remained dependent on seasonal variations in food sources and
probably moved whenever a food source became scarce or unavailable (Story 1981). Later
Archaic site distributions show a shift from major streams to minor streams and natural
springs (Perttula and Skiles 1986: 48-53). This greater number and distribution of Late
Archaic sites in East Texas suggests the successful adaptation to the environment lasting
until the development of pottery (around 500-100 B.C) and/or until the development of the
bow and arrow.
The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period, also referred to as the Woodland
period, represents an increasing utilization of the environment. A number of characteristic
innovations appear during the Early Ceramic period, in particular, a greater reliance on
cultigens (corn and squash) and more prolonged occupations at specific locales. The
technological innovations appearing during the Early Ceramic period include the bow and
arrow and the widespread production of pottery (Story et al. 1990).
The Late Prehistoric period in northeast Texas involves the Caddoan culture (A.D.
800-1680).

This culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the

Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Wyckoff 1971; Story 1990:323).
Caddo subsistence and social organization differ markedly from earlier periods.
Horticulture and then agriculture supplemented hunting and gathering. Larger aggregates
of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas.
Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds. A stratified social
structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962;
1975). Extensive commercial networks were also established. Larger settlements are
mainly distributed on elevated landforms adjacent to major streams, while smaller
farmsteads can be found along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches. Hamlets and
farmsteads are the most common type of Caddoan settlement, although larger communities
occur in association with mound centers. The Caddo tradition lasted until European

4

domination of the area.
The Historic period (1800-present) described the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations’ domination of the
area to the European immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The earliest
Americans in the area included Nicholas Trammel who traveled Indian trails in Panola
County. Daniel Martin established the first settlement near present day Beckville and built
a trading post near Martin’s Creek. The first major influx of Anglo settlers into the area
encompassing Panola County occurred after the Texas Revolution in 1836 most of which
came from Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama. Panola County was
founded in 1846 and Carthage was established as the county seat in 1848. Population
growth began based on plantation farming and continued to grow even after the Civil War
with corn and lumber as the major products following cotton. This was followed by the
discovery of lignite in 1889. This prosperity continued until the Great Depression. The
1930s saw a change to cattle ranching and the mechanization of farming, effectively
reducing the number of farms. The discovery of petroleum gave the industrial economy a
boost which continues today with ranching, mining, and oil as the primary industries of the
county (Webb, 1952).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970);
the guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, the Register of
Professional Archaeologists; and the survey standards required by the Texas Historical
Commission.
The program of site evaluation was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey area.

Sites were then delineated vertically and

horizontally to determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary evaluation of
potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), J.J. Pickle
Research Campus, UT and at the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2004). The site
location maps and cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the
location, types, and both State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of
previously recorded sites within or in close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas
was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites,
the pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination. Shovel testing
included excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4
inch) levels down to the B horizon or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was
screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth of each shovel test
was recorded and notes about the soil texture and color were made. Visual examination
was a continuous effort between shovel tests, but it was limited by the dense vegetation
and heavy ground cover to noting modern modifications such as bulldozer piles and road
impacts.

RESULTS
The previous investigation research found no previously recorded sites near the
project area. The closest documented survey was conducted by the National Park Service
in 1972 adjacent to the north side of the well pad. The next closest surveys were
conducted 1.2 km (0.75 miles) to the east southeast and in the Sabine River floodplain.
Although the surveys in the area sampled both upland and lowland environments no
cultural resources recorded.

The closest documented site was 41PN7 roughly 1.4 km

(0.9 miles) to west along the Sabine River.

Site 41PN7 was documented as Late

Prehistoric open camp site documented as part of the initial Toledo Bend survey (Dan
1962).
Topographically, the project area included the upland slope and tow slope of a
ridge overlooking the Sabine River for the well pad and access road, while the pipeline
was exclusively in the Sabine River floodplain. Vegetation in the project area varied
from 10-year old planted pine with moderate to dense understory on the higher elevation
to scattered hardwood trees and light understory in the lower elevation. Additional
evidence of logging was apparent in the several areas of piled soil and adjacent cuts in the
terrain from heavy machinery. Logging disturbance was most prominent in the northern
half of the well location while the southern half was less disturbed. The southern portion
was more open with grasses and water resistant vegetation dominating area. Soils in the
project area include Wrightsville-Cart complex on the upland, Bienville on the slope,
Estes-Mantachie complex on the toe slope and in the floodplain. Wrightsville-Cart
complex includes Wrightsville with 20 cm of silt loam over clay and Cart with fine sandy
loam over 90 cm deep. Bienville loamy fine sand consists of loamy fine sand over 90 cm
deep. Estes-Mantachie complex consists of Estes and Mantachie with 10 to 15 cm of
clay over clay loam.
In compliance with the THC’s survey standards for areas between 11 and 100
acres, a total of 35 shovel tests were excavated in the 11.7 acre well pad and pipeline
areas. Shovel test depth and texture varied with topographic location. Shovel test were
excavated over the well pad judgmentally in areas with less than 10 percent slope and

7

shovel tests were excavated on all elevated surfaces along the pipeline to test for sandy
soils (Figure 2). More tests were excavated in areas with deeper sandy soils and fewer
tests in areas with clayey soil on the well location and pipeline. The tests at the southern
end of the well location and along the pipeline were on the toeslope in SRA property
while the tests at the northern end of the well location were in private property on the
military crest of the ridge. Shovel tests results are described in Table 1:

Table 1. Shovel Test Results
Shovel test results generally conformed to the soil descriptions provided by the NRCS
with loamy sand on the uplands and clay on the lowlands. Upland shovel tests further
upslope were shallower than tests closer to the slope. This generalization is consistent
with bulldozers pushing soil to create a more level and easier surface to work.
Disturbance from logging was evident in the upland shovel tests found all of the upland
tests had an abundance of burned plant material between the surface and the Bt horizon.
Most notably, the two flakes found in ST 18 were 10 cm above a large timber. The
logging disturbance was further delineated by several depressions and mounds from
bulldozing activity and an air photo showing the planted rows of trees on the uplands.
41PN222
Site 41PN222, the Dickson-Thompson site, was documented as an open campsite
on the edge of the upland overlooking the Sabine River floodplain and an intermittent
drainage (Figure 3).
The soils at the site are deep fine sands between 40 cm (16 inches) deep and
excess of 90 cm (35 inches) deep. Of the 14 tests excavated on the upland five contained
one flake (one tested pebble in ST 15) and one contained two flakes (ST18). All of the
cultural material was found between 40 and 70 cmbs (16 and 28 inches below ground

surface) with the artifacts in the shallower tests found close to the Bt horizon. An
abundance of burned wood fragments were found in every shovel test between the
surface and the Bt horizon. The burned wood along with low mounds and depressions
was attributed to modern logging on the site and attests to the depth of disturbance by
modern logging. The site’s size is an estimated 30m north to south by 60m east to west.
Site boundaries were established by topography on the western and southern extents
while site boundaries to the north and east were established by negative shovel tests.
Site 41PN222 consists of a light lithic scatter that was highly disturbed by
logging. The site has little research value and does not, in the opinion of DETAC, merit
further investigation. Without diagnostic artifacts, no profusion or clear concentration of
material, and abundant logging disturbance there is little information to be gathered from
this site beyond initial survey documentation. This site does not meet the criteria for
NRHP or SAL nomination. Despite the discovery of the site, DETAC requests cultural
resource clearance for the Sempra #1 well location.

12

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed well location utilized the military crest, slope and tow slope of an
upland ridge overlooking the Sabine River floodplain. The pipeline was in the floodplain
exclusively.

The crest and slopes have deep sandy soil while the floodplain was

dominated by frequently flooded clayey soils. A total of 35 shovel tests were excavated.
Shovel tests focused on finding cultural material along the military crest of the upland
ridge.

One archaeological site, 41PN222, was documented.

This site includes the

disturbed remains of an open camp site with no definitive period of occupation.
In conclusion, the shovel testing and surface inspection found one small
prehistoric site in the project area. Given the scant evidence recovered, the abundance of
this kind of site in east Texas, and the disturbance from modern activity, DETAC is
requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on historic properties for
the proposed project area.
