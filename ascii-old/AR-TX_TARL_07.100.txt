CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEY OF
THE MARTIN HILL TRANSMISSION MAIN
Travis and Wi Iliamson Counties, Texas
INTRODUCTION
Under agreement with Curington Associates,

Inc.,

the Texas

Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin,

Archeological

conducted a pedestrian survey for cultural resources along a ten
proposed

water

Texas (Fig.

mi Ie

transmission main in Travis and Wi I I iamson counties,

The proposed water

main

fol lows the McNei I Road

right of way (ROW) from its intersection with State Highway 183 to the
Martin Hi II water storage tank west of Farm to Market 1325 in southern
Wi I I iamson County.

The survey was conducted on Apri I 7 and 8, 1987 by

Leland Bement and Dan K.

Utley (Fig.

1).

FIELD METHODS
The pedestrian survey

was carried

out by

walking serpentine

transects along sections of the route not contained in a road right of
way.

Vehicular survey was used along

the

roadways

to

locate any

potential historic structures that might be impacted if the route left
the ROW.
