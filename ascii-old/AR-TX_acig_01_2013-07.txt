MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Capital Area Rural Transportation System (CARTS) proposes to construct a Vehicle
Maintenance and Operation Center (VMC) on a 13.8-acre tract of property owned by
CARTS located near the northwest corner of the intersection of Highway 71 and Tucker
Hill Lane with frontage on each roadway. The project area of potential effects (APE) is
13.8 acres of land and is divided by the Travis County and Bastrop County lines (Figures
1 and 2). CARTS is a public entity; therefore the entire project area is newly acquired
public land and subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas compliance. The proposed
vehicle maintenance center would include the maintenance center, paint and body shop,
fuel stations, wash stations, intermodal facility, salvage yard and vehicle storage, and a
retention or detention pond (Figure 3). The depth of disturbance will be up to 6 feet.
This investigation conducted by archeologist from aci consulting consists of an intensive
archeological survey of the proposed site of the CARTS Vehicle Maintenance and
Operations Center pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]). The
overall investigation includes pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface testing
(backhoe trenching, n=7), basic archival research, data analysis, and report preparation in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) standards. No artifacts or intact prehistoric or historic deposits
were discovered. Based on the results of this archeological survey, no further
archeological work is recommended.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. No artifacts were collected. Ann M. Scott served as Principle Investigator,
Robin Benson Barnes served as Project Archeologist, Julie Shipp served as
Geoarcheologist, and Sophia Salgado served as archeological field technician. Jennifer
Hatchett Kimbell assisted with the preparation of the permit application, and Megan Zoch
drafted the figures. Field work was conducted on December 18, 2012. Twenty person
hours were invested in the permit application and background research, 26 person hours
in preparation for the field work and the field work, and an estimated 40 person hours in
report writing and production as well as preparation of the records for curation.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1
Environmental Setting
The project area lies near the border between Texas Blackland Prairie to the west and the
East Central Texas Plains to the east (Griffith et al. 2007). The Blackland Prairie supports
prairie vegetation along with small woods often found along low gradient streams. The
East Central Texas Plains are also known as Post Oak Savanna, as they were originally
covered with post oak savanna vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Current land cover
includes improved pasture, rangeland, and some post oak woods, and the landscape is
often somewhat dissected and irregular (Griffith et al. 2007). The project area consists of
a mowed field and areas containing grasses, forbs, and shrubs, including mesquite, as
well as a number of trees, primarily hackberry, growing along a fence line. Surface
visibility ranges from none to approximately 40%.
2.2
Geology and Soils
The project area is located in a previously plowed field east of Dry Creek, a tributary of
the nearby Colorado River, in Quaternary Alluvium (Qal) (Austin Sheet) consisting
primarily of clay, silt, sand, and gravel (Barnes 1974). The unit is calcareous to the
surface and generally dark gray to dark brown. The sand is composed primarily of quartz.
The Soil Conservation Service (SCS 1974, 1979) classifies four different soil units within
the project area (Figure 4). All of the soil units consist of deep clays. The soil units are
described below.
Altoga silty clay, 3 to 6 percent slopes, eroded (AgC2) – This soil typically occurs as
long, narrow areas paralleling major streams. The surface layer is light brownish-gray
silty clay about 5 inches thick. The second layer consists of very pale brown silty clay
loam about 24 inches thick. The third layer is pale-yellow silty clay loam approximately
60 inches in thickness. Permeability is moderate, and the available water capacity is high.
Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (HeB) – This soil is found on narrow ridges or foot
slopes in long narrow strips or irregular shapes with areas ranging from 30 to 100 acres.
The surface layer is dark grayish-brown clay about 18 inches thick followed by a layer 48
inches thick of grayish-brown clay mottled with olive yellow. This soil consists of welldrained, deep clay soil that has a high water capacity and slow permeability.
Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded (HeC2) – This soil type occupies side slopes
on a gently undulating topography in areas ranging from 20 to 50 acres. The surface layer
is dark grayish-brown clay, and below is mottled yellow silty clay for 60 inches. This soil
consists of well-drained, deep clay soil with a high water capacity and slow permeability.
Tinn clay, 0 to 1 percent slope, (Tv) – This deep and nearly level soil is found on
floodplains and along small streams in areas that range in size from 10 to 200 acres. The
surface layer is a dark gray clay about 25 inches thick followed by a grayish brown clay
55 inches in thickness. The soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous. The water capacity
is high and the soil drains poorly.

record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the area including modern-day Travis and Bastrop
Counties began in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century when Spanish
explorers traveled through the region searching for routes to the missions in East Texas.
The first European known to enter Travis County was Domingo Terán de los Ríos during
a reconnaissance tour. Later Spanish incursions recorded insightful information on
various Native American tribes, collectively referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one
point lived in the area around modern-day San Antonio. Late seventeenth century
accounts describe these people as family units of hunter gatherers that resided near
streams and springs, in areas conducive to nut harvesting. These camps were revisited on
a seasonal basis, allowing interaction with different groups along the way as well as the
hunting of bison in open grassland settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989). By the
eighteenth century, the cultural integrity of these native groups was significantly
compromised by European settlers and invasive neighboring Native American groups,
such as the Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache, made possible through access to European
horses. Efficiently skilled Comanche horsemen, in turn, displaced the Lipan Apache
culture, continuously raiding European and Native American settlements alike in Central
Texas (Hester 1989). In response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche
raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas, a series of Spanish missions and
presidios were erected along the San Antonio River during the eighteenth century. The
Spanish governor of Coahuila and Texas, the Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo,
established San Antonio as the focus of European settlement (Cox 1997).
Anglo-American settlement in the area began with numerous land grants from Mexico
following its independence from Spain in 1821. Stephen F. Austin established the first
European settlement in what is now Bastrop County when he received a land grant in
1827; some of the settlers of his colony founded the town of Mina, now known as
Bastrop, in 1830 (Marks 2010). Settlement associated with that colony spread into the
area that is now Travis County, and in 1840 the town of Waterloo (now Austin) was
chosen as the location for the capital of the Republic of Texas (Smyrl 2012).
In the mid-nineteenth century, cotton and corn farming and sheep and cattle ranching
were the principal industries in the area. Lumbering also became a major industry with
the establishment of the Bastrop Steam Mill Company, but agriculture remained the
primary source of income for residents of the area. As the site of the state capital, Austin
attracted businesses and population and grew faster than surrounding towns. The Civil
War and Reconstruction impacted Bastrop and Travis Counties as they did much of the
South, with racial tension and economic disruption (Marks 2010; Smyrl 2012).
The 1870s saw the establishment of the Houston and Texas Central Railway, which
connected Austin to Brenham and ran through the northern portion of Bastrop County.
Additional railway development in the 1880s and 1890s further encouraged population
growth and the establishment of towns (Marks 2010).

In 1913, oil was discovered in Bastrop County, leading to extensive testing and
development. Other industries that were established during this time included lignite
mining and brick making. In the 1920s and 1930s, cotton and corn farming gave way to
cattle ranching due to changes in growing conditions and the economic depression of the
1930s. World War II contributed to the abandonment of farming in the area, as workers
were needed at nearby factories. Following the war, the remaining farmers began to
successfully diversify their crops and began growing sorghum, peanuts, pecans, and
watermelons. The next few decades saw the continued shift from farming to cattle
ranching. The growth of the city of Austin beginning in the 1970s has impacted Bastrop
County as well as Travis County through increasing urbanization, bringing with it
challenges of sustainable development (Marks 2010; Smyrl 2012).
Previous Archeological Research
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Sites Atlases and records at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory indicates the project area has not been subject to
previous cultural resource survey and no sites have been recorded within the project area.
Sites within one mile (1.6 km) of the project include 41TV2403 and 41TV2404 located
approximately 1400 yards (1250 meters) north of the APE (Moore 2012). Both sites are
prehistoric artifact scatters located in plowed fields on the banks of Dry Creek, a tributary
of the Colorado River. The artifact assemblage at Site 41TV2403 may indicate a Late
Archaic or Late Prehistoric occupation due to the presence of ground stone in addition to
debitage and other stone tools. Subsurface deposits were identified during shovel testing.
No subsurface deposits were found during shovel testing at 41TV2404. A limited number
of lithics were found on the surface. Neither of the sites was assessed for eligibility for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The Fowler Buck Cemetery is also located within one mile of the project area on the
north side of HWY 71, 0.10 mile east of Buck Lane and 1,410 yards (1,286 meters) from
the western edge of the APE. The cemetery is European with numerous marked graves.
Grave markings indicate that the cemetery dates from 1860 to 1945.
Historic aerial imagery of the APE from 1940, 1954, 1967, 1973, 1980, 1988, 1994,
2005, and 2010 was reviewed to determine the historic conditions within the APE and in
the general area. The general setting of the area appears to be historically agricultural,
and existing disturbance within the APE is limited to agricultural plowing, a fence line,
and the Tucker Hill Lane right-of-way. The APE is located in an agricultural field that
appears to have been modified by farming practices since the 1940s. Historic maps
including Austin topographic quadrangle maps from 1910 (1896 data) and a Montopolis
topographic quadrangle from 1955 were reviewed to determine if any historic structures
are located within or adjacent to the APE. No historic structures were identified. Aerials
beginning from 1940 show structures adjacent to and north of the APE. These structures
change over time and are present in other aerials from 1954, 1967, and 1973 through
today. A review of the 1968 Webberville 7.5’ Quadrangle topographic map, which is

5

based on aerial photographs from 1967, reveals two structures adjacent to and north of
the project area, one of which may be a homestead structure.

METHODS
After a review of the current archeological sites data and historical research, a 100%
pedestrian survey of the entire project area was conducted to locate any archeological or
historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction of the facility. Due to the
depth of deposits, backhoe trenching was used to assess subsurface deposits. No sites
were encountered, eliminating the need for submitting site forms or conducting site
assessments for NRHP inclusion or State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.
Pedestrian Survey
Survey methods were in accordance with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall
project area. A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological
or historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction. The subject area was
walked in parallel transects spaced no greater than 30 meters apart in order to adequately
cover the APE. Backhoe trenches were excavated due to the depth of deposits. Seven
backhoe trenches were excavated in the 13.8-acre APE in order to adequately test the
subsurface deposits.
Subsurface Examination
Soils maps of the clay sediments within the project area indicate sediment depths up to 80
inches. Tinn clays in particular have been known to yield intact buried cultural remains in
the Holocene deposits. Backhoe trenching was utilized within the entire proposed project
area in order to confirm the depth of deposits and adequately assess the subsurface
sediments for cultural material.
Deep Soil Testing
The THC minimum standards require testing of areas that may contain deeply deposits.
Backhoe trenching is a widely accepted means for testing deeply buried deposits for
archeological remains. The soils in the proposed project area illustrated in the USDA Soil
Surveys of Travis and Bastrop Counties indicated that deep soil testing was necessary to
determine whether deeply buried archeological sites are present. Backhoe trenches were
placed across the proposed project area to explore for deeply buried intact deposits in the
Holocene age alluvium as well as in the adjacent soils for due diligence. This testing was
monitored by two archeologists, one who observed the progress in the trench, examining
the walls for cultural materials, and one who examined the sediments being removed.
Trench data was recorded and described, and photographs of trench walls were taken. All
applicable statutes, regulations, and rules regarding the treatment of burials were
considered during the investigation.

Laboratory Methods
No artifacts were collected or curated as part of this permit. All project paperwork will be
housed at the laboratory at aci consulting before it is curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).

RESULTS
No evidence of historic or prehistoric occupation was observed during the pedestrian
survey of the project area. Surface visibility ranged from practically none in areas of tall
grasses and shrubs to about 40 percent in areas that had been more recently mowed.
Backhoe trenching was conducted in lieu of shovel testing as the sediments were deep in
the project APE.
An examination of the profiles and back dirt from the seven backhoe trenches (Figure 5)
also did not reveal any evidence of cultural deposits. The subsurface deposits appeared
to be intact with the exception of the plow zone near the surface. The backhoe trenches
were generally 20 feet (6 meters) in length, 3 feet (1 meter) in width, and 7 feet (2.4
meters) in depth. Trench depth appeared adequate to assess Holocene deposition. All of
the trenches showed a profile with A and B horizon black blocky clays underlain by
lighter brown or yellowish blocky clays containing carbonates. A typical profile (BHT 7)
is shown in Figure 6. Backhoe trench descriptions are found below.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed vehicle maintenance operation center in
Travis and Bastrop counties in Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching (n=7), in accordance with CTA and THC
guidelines, in the 13.8-acre proposed project area. This work was conducted in
compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit #6388. No
artifacts or intact prehistoric or historic deposits were discovered. Based on the results of
this cultural resources survey, no further archeological work is recommended. It must be
noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features
within a project area. Therefore, should previously unrecorded cultural resources
including human remains be discovered during the course of construction for this project,
the CARTS will contact the Texas Historical Commission regarding any inadvertent
finds.
