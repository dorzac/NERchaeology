ABSTRACT
In July 2006, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed recreational park the City of Nacogdoches, Texas under
Antiquities Permit #3508. The proposed park will occupy a 2.8 hectare (7 acre) area east
of La Nanna Creek, south of Main Street, and west of University Drive. The
investigations relied primarily on historic research and backhoe trench profiling to
establish a sequence of both geomorphic and cultural events on the property. Historic
research found that the area was initially used as a residence followed by a park (Aqua
Vita) then heavily modified in the 1960s with the construction of a chicken processing
plant. Backhoe trench profiles illustrated the location and amount of disturbance as well
as found evidence of LaNanna Creek migration across the floodplain. No indication of a
buried soil horizon or cultural activity was found in the profiles beyond the cutting and
filling associated with the 1960s construction. Despite the modern disturbance, the
remains of one elevated water well structure (locally called the “Silo”) from the Aqua
Vita park was found on the property. No artifacts were collected. No further
investigations are recommended. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the
determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area as
the city will create a new Aqua Vita park on the property and refrain from destroying the
remaining well structure.

INTRODUCTION
In July 2006, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed recreational park the City of Nacogdoches, Texas (Figure
1). Cultural resource management was required because the city is a political subdivision
of the State of Texas and must follow the Antiquities Code of Texas. Texas Antiquities
Permit #3508 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out. The project area
consisted of a 2.8 hectare (7 acres) area. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a
determination of “no effect” to cultural resources for the proposed park.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed park will occupy an area east of La Nanna Creek, south of Main Street, and
west of University Drive. The southern boundary is a private property line roughly 400
m (1310 ft) south of Main Street. The area most recently was an abandoned chicken
processing plant, but had also served as the location of Aqua Vita Springs in the early
part of the 20th century. The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record
any cultural resources on the property that may remain from past prehistoric or historic
occupations. Due to the project area size and negative findings, the report was prepared
following the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA)
(1995a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Nacogdoches County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both
larger examinations and numerous small surveys. A majority of these investigations in
the City of Nacogdoches were in connection with public utilities. Examples of these
investigations include sewer replacement and construction lines (Murin 1998; Galan 2001;
Galan 2002). The surveys that have successfully documented archaeological sites were
conducted along larger streams with well developed floodplains where the toe slopes and
shoulders of the adjacent ridges were not previously impacted by development. Corbin
(1986) of the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Department conducted a
survey and assessment of archaeological sites in the city limits. Many of the sites recorded
along the La Nanna Creek floodplain during Corbin’s survey were found along toe slopes
and ridges overlooking the creek floodplain.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of
primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of
which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to
synthesize the current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems
and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources management.
Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these
studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic
continuities are some of the general research directions that these recent studies emphasize
as important for developing future archaeological research designs.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D.
800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro
American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca.

3

10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that
consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200
B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches
toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)
stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing utilization of the
environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens, prolonged
occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and the
emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of east Texas in
the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1600). This
culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of
the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became sedentary
and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in association
with large mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom
level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations
domination of the area, to the European immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and
counties. Today, the area remains largely agricultural and produces crops including cotton,
corn, hay and vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised. The
timber and oil industries currently play a prominent role in the area’s commercial
enterprises (Webb 1952).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using maps
and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) via the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2006) and records at the East Texas Research Center
(ETRC) at the Stephen F. Austin State University Library. The site location maps and
cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both
State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites
within or in close proximity to the project areas.

The Site Atlas was consulted for

published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys. The records at the
ETRC include San Born Fire Insurance maps, news paper articles, and private
correspondence as part of donated collections regarding the property.
The pedestrian survey was conducted with a combination of visual examination and
backhoe trenching to find any evidence of cultural resources and to investigate the
possibility of deeply buried cultural resources in the floodplain. No shovel tests were
excavated because the most recent use of the property disturbed the entire surface by
5

cutting and filling to make a level surface. The visual examination was conducted over the
entire project area. Every portion of the proposed development was inspected for historic
period structures. Backhoe trenches were placed in an effort to examine the sequence of
modifications to the property, establish the geomorphological processes acting on the
project area to determine the potential for deeply buried cultural resources away from the
creek. DETAC archaeologist monitored backhoe trench excavations and documenting the
findings after the existing building and parking areas are removed. Trenches were
excavated per the requirement outlined in the Texas Historical Commission (THC) survey
standards. Once the trenches were excavated, the archeologist took photographs and make
representative profiles.

RESULTS
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2006) record search of surveys, sites, historic
districts, and neighborhood surveys within 0.8 km (0.5 miles) of the project area revealed
three archaeological surveys, two sites with associated historic districts, two incorrectly
illustrated neighborhood surveys, and a historic cemetery. The archaeological surveys
include two surveys along the La Nana Creek floodplain by the Ft. Worth District Corps of
Engineers in 1981 and a survey conducted for the Environmental Protection Agency in
1989. Neither of these surveys documented cultural resources near the project area. The
archaeological sites near the project area include 41NA49, Washington Square Mound site
and Washington National Register District with the Middle Caddo mound complex and
classical reveal architectural style houses on ridge west of La Nanna roughly 375 m (1230
ft) northwest of site and 41NA144 Stern-Hoya Historical house and district on ridge west
of La Nanna roughly 200 m (660 ft) west of the project area. The search of the Site Atlas
also illustrates two neighborhood surveys as being on the project area property but describe
a Victorian house at 904 West Main Street “Main Street west of town and railroad tracks”
(Victor 1986). Several other neighborhood surveys are documented along Main Street and
intersecting roads east and west of project area and reflect individual houses or buildings
not part of or associated with the project area. The final property of historical significance
within 0.8 km (0.5 miles) of the project area is the Oak Grove cemetery 200 m (660 ft)
northwest of the project area which includes the burial place of Thomas J. Rusk and other
individuals associated with early Texas history. None of the mentioned sites will be
impacted by the proposed development.
The history of the property is consistent with the gradual change in the City of
Nacogdoches from rural farming to urban center over the past century. Like most of the
current city maintained lands, the property was initially used for farming, and then with
the discovery of a unique resource, it was developed and industrialized. Today, the
property is owned and managed by the city and is scheduled to become a park
reminiscent of its early history.

This history is compiled from several resources

accumulated by the City of Nacogdoches and resources available at the East Texas
Research Center on the Stephen F. Austin State University Campus.

7

Prehistorically, there is little use of the property as it is situated in the floodplain with
clayey frequently flooded soils and adjacent to elevated sandy landforms. As proven in
several surveys in the region, prehistoric occupations are more frequently found on
elevated sandy landforms adjacent to floodplains than in the floodplains (Strahler 1952;
Thurmond 1990:Figure 29). One historical description of the property called it marshy
and frequently flooded (Johnson 1983).
The historic resources were compiled into a general story of Aqua Vitae Park published
in the 25 October 1992 issue of the Daily Sentinel. The newspaper story describes how
“Uncle” Charlie Bird sold his property to Robert Lindsey and June Harris in 1909 after
selling water from his well since September 1908 for medicinal purposes. The two
entrepreneurs marketed the water as Aqua Vitae (water of life). The land was cleared of
Charlie Birds’ house, leveled and gated. Two wells were erected with pavilions and
pumps. The park was opened to much fanfare on Monday 5 April 1909. No admission
was charged to enter the park, but water was sold at 10 cents for half a gallon.

The

property was roughly 14 acres, approximately 700 x 870 ft east of and adjacent to
LaNanna Creek. “Vestiges of this privately owned public park still remained at the
site...” until the 1930s (Hayter 1927).
This description of the origins and history Aqua Vitae Park is generally accurate. The
1983 (Johnson) SFA Oral history program interviewed Ruth Fouts Pochmann who
described Aqua Vita park with two elevated bandstands and several families would meet
there on weekends to pick-nick. The adults would visit and the children would play
under the bandstands around the wells. Well No. 1 was enlarged to 8 feet in diameter and
lined with cement, new pumps and a bottling apparatus installed September 11, 1909. A
large pavilion erected over well No. 1 and a pump added. Well No. 2 was dug close by.
What is untold in the Daily Sentinel story and the Johnson interview is the reason the
park closed. Robert Lindsey and June Harris wanted to market the park as a summer
attraction and utilize the Railroad to bring in tourists from Houston.

8

Without city

support, the investors moved their operation to Houston and continued to bottle water
from the park and ship it to Houston for sale. The park closed March 1910 and Robert
Lindsey becomes sole proprietor 1911. He eventually turned the property over to the city
and a local club took responsibility for the property with the goal of getting the park
accredited. A 28 Febuary 1927 letter from Mr. S.B. Hayter, representing the club,
discusses the renovations of the property and the failure to acquire A1 status by the state
as a park because of the absence of public toilets. With the Club’s inability to secure the
pubic facilities, they returned the property to the city with “houses etc”.
Maps of the City of Nacogdoches provide a spatial component to this history (Figure 2).
Two historic maps of the area aid in understanding the change in the property over time:
A map of Aqua Vita Park property in 1916 and the 1929 Sanborn fire Insurance map.
The Sanbore fire Insurance maps from 1885 to 1922 either do not include the property or
show no structures although the wells and their associated bandstands should be visible
on the 1912, 1921, and 1922 maps. The 1929 map shows a domicile and shed near the
creek and three buildings on park property roughly 300 ft east of bridge and between 125
and 275 ft south of Main bridge. None of these buildings are labeled as either residences
or as well, although the Daily Sentinel article and the Hayter letter both suggest the wells
and their structures were visible into the 1930s. The 1964 San Borne Map No. 344 shows
Burgess Poultry Market, Inc. on the property where the domicile and shed were, with a
silo where one of the Sanborn 1929 buildings was located. Scaling and overlaying the
two historic maps and a modern map of the area illuminate several key points: 1) The
project area occupies a narrow strip along LaNanna Creek that was traverse by the stream
in recorded history, 2) The lack of early documentation of the property is indicative of the
light use, 3) Construction of the Poultry facility destroyed the domicile, shed, and the
three buildings illustrated in the 1929 Sanborn map but a “silo” feature remains at the
location of the middle building (Figure 3).
The “silo” is in the same location as one of the buildings on the 1929 Sanborn map. The
Sanborn map depicts the three buildings as one story wood frame buildings with an open
hoist and wood shingle roofs. The description of the bandstands described by Mrs.

Pochmann in (Johnson 1983) and the photos of the bandstands fits the Sanborn
description. It is unknown if the picture is of Well #1 or #2 as both had bandstands and
no description was given as to if they were numbered by order excavated or proximity to
Main Street. Regardless, this well is a significant feature representative of a series of
events important to local history.
Modern surface features in the project area were limited to the foundation remains of the
Poultry Facility and the “silo”. The foundations included two retaining walls in the
northwest and north east corners of the property, cement pads of adjacent buildings, and
an overgrown asphalt parking area near the southern border. Additionally, the city of
Nacogdoches will be removing large buried storage tanks near the southern end of the
property. The cultural resources investigations focused on those areas least disturbed by
the modern impacts and attempted to find evidence of buried horizons that may contain
remains of the earlier occupations of the property.
Soils in the proposed park included Hannahatchee-Urban Land Complex, frequently
flooded (NRCS 2004). Hannahatchee-Urban Land Complex included 1.65 m (5.4 feet)
of loam and fine sandy loam over clay that formed in stratified loamy alluvial sediments
but do not describe the matrix below this. Examination of several profiles in backhoe
trenches confirmed the description of the Hannahatchee soil within the project area. The
Geologic Atlas shows the project area is on Quaternary Alluvium deposited during the
Holocene with Eocene age Sparta Sand creating the uplands east of the site and a
Quaternary Terrace deposits from the late Pleistocene on the upland west of the project
area under the historic portion of Nacogdoches city. The relatively recent age of the
deposits and the renewed archaeological interest in finding deeply buried Paleoindian
sites requires deep testing with backhoe trenches to confirm or deny the buried surfaces
and the potential for these rare sites in the project area.
Backhoe trenches were excavated in five locations on the property (Figure 4). The deep
fill in the northwest corner, buried utility lines in the northeast corner, cement pad
foundations, the buried storage tanks, and the asphalt area limited the areas where

each trench and illustrated in Figure 5:
Backhoe trench 1 was excavated near the “silo” in the area with the most potential for
historic context. The profile included:

65-106
106-130
130+

Very Dark Gray (5YR3/1) Loamy sand with common medium distinct
mottles; knife edge boundary; granular structure; loose consistency; most
recent fill with modern rubble.
Brown (7.5YR4/3) Sandy loam with common medium distinct mottles;
gradual boundary; blocky, angular fine structure; very friable consistency;
contains red clay and brick fragments from lower fill and grades darker in
color with depth.
Red (2/5YR4/8) Loamy sand with common medium distinct mottles; knife
edge boundary; blocky, angular fine structure; firm consistency; fill with
brick fragments that grade into sandy fill above. This layer represents the
oldest fill and the depth of the clearing for the poultry facility.
Dark yellowing brown (10YR4/4) clay with common, medium, distinct
mottles; abrupt boundary; massive structure; very firm constancy; mottles
appear to be calcium carbonate but not HCL tested.
Light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) clay with many medium prominent
mottles; gradual boundary; massive structure; very firm constancy; mottles
become less common with depth.
Dark yellowish brown (10YR4/4) clay with red and grey mottles; massive
structure, very firm constancy; this horizon and the one above may be
from the same deposition.

The Backhoe Trench 1 profile illustrates the amount of disturbance in the northern
portion of the project area between the building foundation and the retaining wall. The
upper 65 cm (2 ft) is fill with the red loamy sand layer being deposited on a cleaned
surface at the time of construction and overlain by more loamy fill to support vegetation
presumably from the construction of the factory in the 1960s. Below the red layer the
soil is indicative of more natural clayey floodplain soils with more gradual boundaries
and mottles from frequent and long-term oxygen poor environments. No artifacts or
cultural features were observed in the lower strata.
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated in modern fill consisting of construction rubble to
roughly 4 m (13 ft) below ground surface. This area was most likely filled along the
creek bank to build a level platform for the parking area. No profile was prepared for this
trench.

Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated near the eastern extent of the project area east of
Backhoe Trench 2 to see the extent and content of the fill in this area matched what was

Light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) Loamy sand; abrupt boundary; blocky
angular fine structure; weak consistency; fill.
Dark greenish gray (Gley 1 4/5GY) Sandy clay; few, medium, faint
mottles; gradual boundary; sub-angular, blocky, fine structure; firm
consistency; this is the boundary between the saturated soils below and the
fill on top.
Dark greenish gray (Gley 1 4/5GY) Clay; common, coarse, distinct
mottles; massive structure; firm consistency.

The Backhoe Trench 3 profile shows progressively less historic fill toward the east end of
the property.

The dark gley colors and clayey soil texture suggest the area was a

backswamp for LaNanna Creek before filling. Additionally, the 1916 Aqua Vita Park
Map shows a small island or a channel of LaNanna Bayou in the immediate area of the
trench. With no channel migration obvious in the profile, this area was most likely the
backswamp to a nearby channel.
Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated in the southeast corner of the property. The profile
included:
0-100 cmbs
100-130
130-360
360+

Light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) Loamy sand with common frequent
prominent mottles; distinct wavy boundary; blocky angular fine structure;
friable consistence; sandy fill with modern debris.
Dark greenish gray (G14/10y) Sandy clay; few common faint mottles;
blocky angular structure; firm consistency; this is the top of the saturated
clayey soils below with some fill mixed in from above.
Dark greenish gray (G1 4/10y) Sandy clay; massive structure; very firm
constancy; fining upward gradually
Dark greenish gray (G1 4/10y) rounded gravel with lesser amounts of
sandy clay; saturated; migrating stream channel with fining upward
sequence in horizons above.

Similar to Backhoe Trench 3, the Backhoe Trench 4 profile contains a one meter (3 ft) of
loamy sand fill with a distinct boundary over gray sandy clay. Below the modern fill,
Backhoe Trench 4 has saturated stream rounded gravel under a fining upward sequence

16

of sediment size typical of a point-bar system in migrating stream channels. The
Sanborne 1929 map shows the creek channel ending near the location of Backhoe Trench
4.
Backhoe Trench 5 was excavated near the active LaNanna Creek channel and near an
environment similar to Backhoe Trench 3 on the Aqua Vita Park map of 1916 and the
trench profile should have fill similar to Backhoe Trench 2. The profile included:
0-70
70-90
90-190

friable consistence; sandy fill with modern debris.
Dark greenish gray (G14/10y) Sandy clay; few common faint mottles;
blocky angular structure; firm consistency; this is only saturated
clayey soils.
Strong brown (7.5YR5/6) Sandy clay loam; blocky, angular, fine
structure; firm consistency;
Reddish yellow (7.5YR6/6) Sandy clay loam; blocky, angular, fine
structure; firm consistency;
Yellowish brown (10YR5/4) rounded gravel with lesser amounts of sandy
clay; saturated; migrating stream channel with fining upward sequence in
horizons above.

The Backhoe Trench 5 profile was most similar to the Backhoe Trench4 profile with
roughly one meter (3 ft) of modern fill over a fining upward sequence of sediments in the
lower 1.5 m (4 ft). Both trenches have a migrating stream sequence from LaNanna Creek
moving westward.
Combined trench profile and historic maps show the stream channel activity across the
project area. From north to south the project area ranges from a more stable landform
(BHT 1) to a backswamp (BHT3) and a narrow floodplain (BHT 2) to a migrating stream
channel (BHT 4 and 5). The historic maps confirm the profile data with the stream
location varying widely across the southern end of the project area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In July 2006 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resource management survey of a recreational park the City of Nacogdoches, Texas. The
proposed park will occupy a 2.8 hectare (7 acre) property southwest of the intersection of
Main Street and University Drive. This survey was conducted in order to locate,
describe, and document any cultural resources within the proposed project area. Historic
research and backhoe trench profiling revealed the property was infrequently used
prehistorically, was privately owned, converted into a park, returned to private use, then
became publicly owned and is scheduled for becoming a park. Backhoe trenching
revealed a variation from more stable landform to the north to a migrating stream channel
to the south. No indication of a buried soil horizon or cultural activity was found in the
profiles beyond the cutting near the north end and filling in the southern two-thirds of the
property. The chance of encountering any further undiscovered cultural resources is low;
however, if during construction any cultural material is recovered, than excavation should
stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact. Based on the
evidence presented, cultural resources clearance is requested for the proposed Aqua Vita
Park development.
