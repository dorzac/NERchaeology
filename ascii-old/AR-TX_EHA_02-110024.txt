Abstract
Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) was contracted by Oncor Electric Delivery Company to conduct
a cultural resources survey of the proposed Central Bluff to Bluff Creek 345-kV Transmission Line
Project. Fieldwork on accessible properties began on July 15, 2010, but the majority was surveyed
between November 18 and December 2, 2010. The line runs for a distance of approximately
15.4 kilometers (9.6 miles) from the southwest corner of Taylor County to just within the
southeastern corner of Nolan County. The right of way (ROW) will be 48.8 meters (160 feet) wide.
In total, the entire proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area of approximately 186.2 acres
(75.4 hectares).

The survey defined 12 newly recorded sites (41TA296 to 41TA307)—10 prehistoric and 2 with
both prehistoric and historic components. Sites 41TA298 and 41TA305, whose boundaries have
been fully defined, do not appear eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The
eligibility of each of the other 10 sites cannot be determined at this time, as they extend beyond the
limits of the current project area; however, based on the recorded portions of these sites, no
additional cultural resource investigations are recommended within the ROW. Monitoring of
selected structures within floodplains revealed no further cultural resources. No artifacts were
collected. All project records and photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

Management Summary
At the request of Oncor Electric Delivery Company (Oncor), Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Central Bluff to Bluff Creek 345-kV
transmission line connecting the future Central Bluff Substation in Nolan County to the existing
Bluff Creek Substation in Taylor County. In its entirety, the proposed project will extend 15.4
kilometers (9.6 miles). The right of way (ROW) will be 48.8 meters (160 feet) wide. In total, the
entire proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area of approximately 186.2 acres
(75.4 hectares).

The Principal Investigator was Michael Smith. The survey field crew consisted variously of Ellen
Ledgerwood, Barry Dwiggins, Robert Beckwith, Dawn Riggs, Katrina Miller, Walker Van Item, and
Krista McDonald. Fieldwork on accessible properties began on July 15, 2010, but the majority of the
project area was surveyed between November 18 and December 2, 2010. Monitoring of selected
floodplain crossings was conducted on October 13, 2011.

The intensive pedestrian survey traversed the entire project area in two transects due to the width
of the ROW. In all, over 500 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed ROW in an effort to
locate cultural resource sites. This is an average of approximately 32 shovel tests per kilometer per
transect (26 per mile per transect), or over 2.7 shovel tests per acre of the entire project area. This
number exceeds the minimum number of shovel tests required by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.

The survey documented 12 previously unreported cultural resource sites, 41TA296 to 41TA307 All
12 are prehistoric, with 2 also possessing historic components. Sites 41TA298 and 41TA305, whose
boundaries have been fully defined, do not appear eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. The eligibility of each of the other 10 sites cannot be determined at this time, as
they extend beyond the limits of the current project area; however, based on the recorded portions
of these sites, no additional cultural resource investigations are recommended within the ROW.

The project operated under a diagnostics-only collection policy, but found none. All project records
and photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University
of Texas at Austin. It is recommended that construction of the proposed Oncor Central Bluff to Bluff
Creek transmission line be allowed to proceed with no further consultation. Monitoring of
construction occurred at five tower locations within the floodplains of Valley Creek and Spring
Creek; no additional cultural resources were observed. If evidence of presently undiscovered
cultural remains is encountered during construction, it is recommended that the discovery be
evaluated by a qualified archeologist who can provide guidance on how to proceed in accordance
with federal and state regulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) was contracted by Oncor Electric Delivery Company to conduct
a cultural resources survey of the proposed Central Bluff to Bluff Creek 345-kV Transmission Line
Project. Fieldwork on accessible properties began on July 15, 2010, but the majority was surveyed
between November 18 and December 2, 2010. Monitoring of selected tower construction was
performed on October 13, 2011. The line runs for a distance of approximately 15.4 kilometers (km)
(9.6 miles) from the southwest corner of Taylor County to just within the southeastern corner of
Nolan County (Figure 1). The right of way (ROW) will be 48.8 meters (m) (160 feet [ft]) wide. In
total, the entire proposed transmission line ROW occupies an area of approximately 186.2 acres
(75.4 hectares).

The transmission line will consist of double-circuit V-towers within a 48.8-m (160-ft) ROW. The
ROW will be subjected to mechanized land clearing, vehicular travel, and, to a much lesser areal
extent, construction of tower footings. The mechanized land clearing will impact depths of 15 to
61 centimeters (cm) (6 to 24 inches). The double-circuit V-towers will be 38.1 m (125 ft) high and
have a footprint of about 9 x 4.5 m (30 x 15 ft). Each of the four piers will be 0.6 m (2 ft) in diameter
and will be excavated to depths of approximately 4.3 to 7 m (14 to 23 ft).

This project falls under the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone process, has been designated as a
Critical Constraint Project by the Independent System Operator, and has been approved by the
Public Utilities Commission. The current survey was conducted according to the methods outlined
in the generic research design for Oncor projects approved by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) (PBS&J 2008). The cultural resource investigations were performed in compliance with the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992;
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat. 915 USC 4231, 1970); the
Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the Archaeological
Resources Protection Act of 1979; as well as the guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

II. PHYSICAL SETTING
The Central Bluff to Bluff Creek transmission line extends through the southwestern corner of
Taylor County and terminates just over the county line into the southeastern corner of Nolan
County. Within the project area, level terrain has mostly been affected by either recent or historic
agricultural activities, including plowing and terracing. At the time of the survey, such properties
were generally furrowed for crops or left overgrown with grasses for livestock (Figure 2). The
hillier terrain was generally lacking in soil and suitable only for grazing (Figure 3).

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY

Physiographically, the project area lies within the Edwards Plateau Resource Area of Texas (United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1976). Geologically, at its
northern end the project area is underlain by the Lower Cretaceous‐aged formations of Edwards
Limestone, Comanche Peak Limestone, and the Walnut Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology
[BEG] 1974). Shallow soils overlie limestone bedrock, which has been exposed in many areas by
erosion, and cobbles of Edwards chert are ubiquitous on the surface (Banks 1990:59–61). Due to
such accessibility, these chert resources were likely utilized by native peoples over millennia, as
evidenced by lithic manufacturing debris observed widely but thinly spread across the larger
landforms. These often‐eroded uplands are dissected by numerous intermittent drainages,
including the larger Bluff Creek.

In the central third of the project area, the Quaternary Seymour Formation consists of sand and silt
with minor lenses of clay containing freshwater mollusks (BEG 1974). This formation, along with
other Quaternary alluvial deposits, composes relatively level to gently rolling prairie and stream
channels, such as those of Valley and Spring creeks.
The Permian San Angelo Formation is the predominant geological formation underlying the
southwestern third of the project area, which consists of relatively level uplands (BEG 1974). This
formation is made up chiefly of sandstone, shale, and a conglomerate of dolomite and siliceous
pebbles.

SOILS

Soils within the area are mapped as belonging to the Tarrant-Tobosa association, the Pitzer-Mereta
association, and the Hamby-Miles-Colorado association (USDA, SCS 1976). The Tarrant-Tobosa
association consists of calcareous, cobbly clays, and these have been heavily eroded within the
project area. Shallow gravelly loams and clay loams form the predominant soils within the PitzerMereta association. Finally, the Hamby-Miles-Colorado association is described primarily as deep
fine sandy loams to loams. The characteristics of the major soils within these associations are
provided in Table 1 and are discussed within the individual site descriptions.

FLORA
As delineated by Hatch et al. (1990), the project area falls within the Edwards Plateau vegetation
area of Texas. The Edwards Plateau vegetation area is bordered by the Cross Timbers and Prairies,
Rolling Plains, and High Plains vegetation areas to the north and the Blackland Prairies vegetation
area to the east. Additionally, this area includes the mesas and hills of the Callahan Divide, which
Gould et al. (1960) include in the Edwards Plateau vegetation area.

The Edwards Plateau is a highly dissected plateau that supports woodlands and shrublands, which
are interspersed with pastures dominated by short to mid-grasses and forbs (Hatch et al. 1990).
Mixed hardwood-juniper woodlands and forests occur on steep hillsides and in moist canyons, and
riparian woodlands are present along larger streams and rivers. The most important climax
vegetation of the Edwards Plateau includes switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), several species of
bluestems and gramas, Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), and
buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), with the rough, rocky areas typically supporting a short- or
mid-grass understory and a brush overstory complex made up primarily of live oak (Quercus
virginiana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), shin oak (Quercus sinuata), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei),
redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii), and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa).

FAUNA

The project area lies within the Kansan Biotic Province, as described by Blair (1950). The Kansan
Biotic Province in Texas extends south and east from the Oklahoma and New Mexico borders,
eventually transitioning to the Chihuahuan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.

Blair’s Kansan Biotic Province represents the grassy plains that extend across northwestern Texas.
These tend to be drier than the Texan province but are still relatively well drained by southeast10006286/110024

trending streams. At least 59 species of mammals have been identified in the Kansan province in
recent times, in addition to 14 lizard species, 31 snakes, 1 land turtle, 14 anurans (frogs and toads),
and 1 urodele (salamander) (Blair 1950). Mammal species that may have been important to
prehistoric and early historic inhabitants for food, shelter, and clothing include American bison
(Bos bison, formerly Bison bison), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), Audubon’s cottontail
(Sylvilagus audubonii), coyote (Canis latrans), spotted ground squirrel (Citellus spilosoma),
American badger (Taxidea taxus), black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and various rodents.

III. CULTURAL SETTING
CHRONOLOGY
The project area is part of the Plains Planning Region as delineated by the THC (Mercado-Allinger et
al. 1996). The cultural history of the region has been developed from archeological and historical
records and can be assigned to four primary chronological and developmental stages: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These divisions are believed to reflect changes in
subsistence and cultural developments as reflected by the material remains and settlement
patterns.

The known prehistory of the region in which the project area is located is generally assumed to
have commenced with the Paleoindian period. Beginning prior to 10,000 B.C. and continuing to ca.
6500 B.C., the Paleoindian period was a time of climatic changes from the cool, moist climate of the
late Pleistocene to the warmer and drier climate of the Holocene epoch. Subsistence during
Paleoindian times may have been dependent upon hunting now-extinct fauna including mammoths
and Bison antiquus. It is also believed that hunting was supplemented by the utilization of plants,
small animals, and marine life when available (Bryant and Shafer 1977). The social organization of
the Paleoindian period probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile groups composed of
several nuclear families referred to as bands. Temporally diagnostic toolkits associated with the
Paleoindian consist of a variety of finely chipped, sometimes fluted, lanceolate projectile points,
such as the Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Firstview types (Willey 1966). Paleoindian sites have
been recorded in Fisher, Briscoe, Lubbock, and Lipscomb counties in the Plains Archeological
Region.

The project area lies in a geographic zone in which Archaic cultural traits from central and west
Texas are present. This period is postulated to extend from approximately 6500 B.C. to A.D. 750 and
is marked by the onset of modern climates marked by a gradual warming. This period reflected
changes in lithic technology, the more intensive exploitation of varied local resources, and a
correspondingly less mobile and larger population. Based on various differences, there is a
tripartite division of the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late. Primary distinctions between the
three subperiods include distinctive projectile point/knife types and a variation in some of the
economic pursuits. The Early Archaic sites in this region are in areas with reliable water sources
and a diverse subsistence base. Middle Archaic sites are larger, more numerous, and more widely
distributed than those of the Early Archaic. This may be due to an increase in population densities
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). The presence of burned rock middens at sites that date to the latter part
of this period suggest that subsistence strategies included a greater reliance on vegetal foods
(Prewitt 1985). Although more emphasis was being placed on plants as a food source, hunting was
still a very important aspect of the overall subsistence strategy as is evidenced by the tool kits of the
period. In the rolling plains, bison played a minimal part for Middle Archaic peoples, but during the
10006286/110024

7

III. Cultural Setting
Late Archaic, bison represent an important economic and subsistence focus (Dibble and Lorrain
1968; Hofman et al. 1989; Hughes 1991).

The Late Prehistoric period, from roughly A.D. 750 to European contact, marks a significant change
from the earlier lifeways of the region. Most important is the introduction of the bow and arrow,
which greatly facilitated hunting and may reflect a heavy emphasis on bison hunting (Bos bison). In
general, the aboriginal groups still functioned as nomadic hunters and gatherers, living at the band
level of social organization. Ceramic technology also made its debut during the Late Prehistoric. In
central Texas, the Austin and Toyah phases (Prewitt 1981) are recognized for the Late Prehistoric
period.

Historically, the project area lies in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Comancheria, the region
of Comanche dominance (Thurmond et al. 1981). From approximately A.D. 1700, the region’s
population grew to include displaced Lipan Apaches, various bands of Comanches, and, it is
supposed, the remnants of the original bands of hunters and gatherers. The introduction of the
horse and European firearms allowed the Comanches to function as the dominant cultural group
until the late 1870s. By 1880, however, both the Native Americans and the buffalo had been either
forcibly removed from the area or killed, and the land divided into huge ranches. This post-1870s
period witnessed an increase in Anglo population as a result of ranching and oil production.

Taylor County was established by the Texas legislature in 1858 from parts of Bexar and Travis
counties. Comanches of the Penateka band had arrived in the region in the eighteenth century and
remained in the Taylor County area until the 1870s, when the U.S. Army defeated them. Enough
white settlers had arrived by 1878 for the county to be organized, with the county seat at the
centrally located settlement of Buffalo Gap (Leffler 2009). By 1880, the county had a population of
917. The early economy was dominated by cattle and sheep ranching, with agriculture limited to
minimal acreage planted in wheat and corn. Settlement in Taylor County increased with the arrival
of the Texas and Pacific Railway in the early 1880s. With the railroad, the new town of Abilene
developed as a shipping center and replaced Buffalo Gap as county seat in 1883. By 1900, the
county had a population of 6,957 and agriculture, particularly cotton cultivation, replaced ranching
as the most significant element of the local economy (Leffler 2009). While frequent droughts and
the Great Depression brought difficulties to farmers and ranchers, the county population increased
to 41,023 in 1930. Oil was discovered in 1929 but did not become a significant contributor to the
local economy until the early 1940s.
Anglo buffalo hunters entered the area of Nolan County following the end of the Civil War and
provided the impetus for the creation of the town of Sweet Water (later Sweetwater) (McDaniel
2011). The area was part of the Young-Bexar territory until 1876, when the Texas legislature
attached it to Shackelford County, and was established as a county in its own right in 1881. The
Texas and Pacific Railroad ran through Sweetwater, the county seat, and brought numerous settlers
to the areas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ranching was the predominant

10006286/110024

III. Cultural Setting
economic element in the 1880s and 1890s, but yielded that position to the cultivation of cotton by
the early 1900s (McDaniel 2011). Tenant farming was common, with sharecropping increasing to
over 50 percent of the farms by 1910. This trend continued into the 1930s until the Great
Depression, when the number of tenant farmers dropped significantly along with the farming of
cotton. Though the cotton industry recovered somewhat by the 1970s, the county’s population
continued to drop. The petroleum industry, beginning in 1939, is now the primary economic factor
of Nolan County (McDaniel 2011).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Knowledge of the archeology of this area is based primarily on the various previous investigations
associated with the construction of dams and other features within the Elm Creek Watershed. The
majority of these were conducted by Southern Methodist University in 1977 (Lynott 1978). That
survey resulted in the identification of 79 sites in Taylor and Runnels counties, both historic and
prehistoric, with the majority of the latter represented as lithic procurement sites.

Later work was performed by personnel of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) (Sanders 2006). This survey located seven previously unrecorded prehistoric sites along
Bluff Creek. Only site 41TA268, located roughly 1.6 km (1 mile) southeast of the current project
area, was deemed to merit additional testing. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility
testing investigations were performed by McCulloch Archeological Services LLC, with support from
the NRCS (McCulloch et al. 2008). Late Prehistoric arrow points, probable Middle or Late Archaic
dart points, chert scrapers, and metates suggest a campsite that saw multiple occupations over a
long period of time. In addition to the remains of 15 possible burned rock hearths on the surface,
the investigations discovered 2 possible subsurface cooking features. Based on the results of this
study, the site was reported as potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP (McCulloch et al. 2008);
avoidance was recommended.
Recently, investigations were conducted by PBS&J for the Oncor Bluff Creek to Brown 345-kV
Transmission Line (Smith 2010). This project resulted in the revisiting of 3 sites—2 previously
recorded by Lynott (1978) and 1 by Sanders (2006)—and the identification of 11 new sites in
Taylor County. All were prehistoric sites, primarily surficial, and lacked diagnostic materials and
features (Smith 2010). None were recommended for additional work.

Within Nolan County, the most recent archeological survey was performed by Geo-Marine for the
Oncor Sweetwater to Central Bluff 345-kV Transmission Line in the fall of 2010 (report pending).
Numerous sites were identified, the vast majority consisting of surface lithic scatters. Of these, only
two sites—41NL293 and 41NL294—were found within 1,000 m (3,280 ft) of the current Central
Bluff to Bluff Creek project area. Both were reported to be lithic procurement sites resting on
exposed bedrock, and neither was recommended for additional work.

IV. METHODS
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate and record all cultural resources that might be
within the proposed ROW; (2) assess their significance and potential eligibility for listing in the
NRHP; and (3) provide site-specific recommendations for additional research, as appropriate.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND RECORDS CHECK

A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of The
University of Texas at Austin, the THC, and on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online (Atlas).
The files at TARL were reviewed for previously recorded archeological sites within, or close to, the
proposed ROW; while at the THC, the files and maps were examined for NRHP properties and State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Reports of previous investigations within or close to the project
area were plotted and reviewed for information on local site types and conditions. The records
search included an intensive examination of the area within 300 m (1,000 ft) of the proposed ROW.
The files of the Local History Program at the THC were also examined for locations of Official State
Historical Markers. The Texas Historic Overlay Project (Foster et al. 2006) and the online files of the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) were consulted once historic sites were located, in
order to refine their chronology. Limited deed research performed by the land agents of Universal
Field Services was also provided for the properties possessing historic sites.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY

The survey area is situated within the Central Texas region as regards to methodology defined by
the Oncor Generic Research Design (PBS&J 2008). The field methods approved by the THC called
for the proposed ROW to be stratified into high probability areas (HPAs), moderate probability
areas (MPAs), and low probability areas (LPAs) on the basis of perceived likelihood for the
occurrence of unidentified cultural resource properties. HPAs were defined as possessing the
greatest potential for containing prehistoric cultural resource properties; site integrity was also
presumed to be highest in these areas. HPAs included areas that contain deep soils and lie within
305 m (1,000 ft) of water sources. These included levee remnants and rises within floodplains,
toeslopes, and lower alluvial terraces. HPAs were initially identified prior to the field effort by
examination of aerial photographs and topographical maps and were adjusted during the actual
survey based on microtopography, soil conditions, and the degree of surface erosion or
disturbance. LPAs were defined in the field as areas of very steep slopes (i.e., greater than
45 percent), exposed bedrock, modern development, or extensive ground disturbance, such as mass
wasting, sheet erosion, or vegetation clearance. MPAs were also defined in the field as undisturbed
uplands, undisturbed areas greater than 305 m (1,000 ft) from water sources, and nonbedrock or
undisturbed slopes of greater than 20 percent.

IV. Methods
The survey consisted of a pedestrian surface inspection of the proposed ROW, with varying degrees
of shovel testing to locate buried cultural resources or those resources obscured by vegetation.
HPAs were subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, with a density of shovel tests of
approximately 1 per 30 m (100 ft) of linear ROW. The MPAs of the proposed ROW were subjected
to a walkover to verify surface conditions, with shovel testing conducted at the discretion of the
field archeologists. The LPAs were walked but were not shovel tested.

Shovel tests were at least 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter and were excavated in arbitrary levels not
exceeding 10 cm (4 inches). These were excavated to subsoil, bedrock, or a maximum depth of
80 cm (31.5 inches). The fill from each shovel test was screened through 6.4-millimeter (0.25-inch)mesh hardware cloth when possible. Soils with high clay content were sorted by hand. The depth of
each shovel test was recorded on a shovel test form, along with a description of the sediments
present, the general environmental setting of the shovel test, its Global Positioning System (GPS)
location, any artifacts that were present, and any additional comments. No artifacts were collected.
Each shovel test was completely backfilled upon completion, along with all artifacts.

SITE RECORDING

Once a cultural resource site was located, a program of systematic shovel tests was implemented to
help define the site’s horizontal and vertical boundaries within the proposed ROW, and to provide
information on the potential integrity of the cultural deposits. Where appropriate, site boundaries
were delineated by surficial extent of artifacts or surface features. In areas where subsurface
deposits were identified, site boundaries were defined by a series of shovel tests within the ROW
along transects parallel to the ROW corridor. Generally, shovel tests were placed at intervals of
15 m (49.2 ft), with two consecutive negative shovel tests confirming the site’s outer margins. Once
an archeological site was identified, its location was recorded using a GPS unit and noted on a U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle map. A sketch map of the site was drawn, showing
the location of all shovel tests and other salient features, and the area was photographed with a
digital camera. All of the artifacts recovered from the shovel tests were described on shovel test
forms; representative samples were photographed and/or sketched. The range of variability of any
observed surface artifacts was described in field notes, with photographs taken and/or sketches
made of selected artifacts representative of the site. After examination and recording, all artifacts
found within shovel tests were reburied, and surface artifacts were left where they were found. A
temporary field designation was assigned to each site, and a TexSite form subsequently was
completed and submitted to TARL for assignment of a permanent trinomial designation.

MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Although mechanical trenching is typically used to investigate Holocene-aged alluvial settings for
potential sites buried beneath the reach of hand excavation, it was not employed during the Central
Bluff to Bluff Creek survey due to engineering concerns, as detailed within the THC-approved
10006286/110024

IV. Methods
generic research design for Oncor projects (PBS&J 2008). The excavation of one or more backhoe
trenches at a proposed structure location would be destabilizing in regard to construction of the
tower structures since undisturbed soil is necessary to support the structure foundations. Instead,
in accordance with the approved generic research design, monitoring was conducted for the drilling
of all structure locations within Holocene floodplains.

MONITORING

The construction of five new transmission structures was monitored, all within the floodplains of
Valley and Spring creeks. These are lattice steel V-towers, each supported by four buried cement
corner footings. The footings were augered to a diameter of 0.6 m (2 ft) and depths of 4.3 to 7 m (14
to 23 ft), depending upon the unique engineering requirements at each structure location.
Monitoring involved the examination of the soil as it was removed from the foundation holes of
each structure in order to identify any cultural remains that might have been disturbed by the
construction. When possible, the profiles of the foundation holes were examined for the presence of
visible cultural features, though observation was limited by the narrow diameter of the holes and
the interests of safety. All observations were recorded, including soil color, texture, and type, and
depth from surface.

V. RESULTS
PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The cultural resources survey of the Central Bluff to Bluff Creek Transmission Line was conducted
at various times between July 15, 2010, and December 2, 2010, depending on access. The intensive
pedestrian survey traversed the entire proposed line in two transects due to the width of the ROW.
The survey documented 12 previously unreported cultural resource sites in Taylor County.
Probability areas were modified in the field at the discretion of the crew leaders based on
considerations of topography, disturbances, slopes, and other such factors. Roughly 37 percent was
determined to be HPAs, 58 percent to be MPAs, and at least 5 percent to be LPAs (Figure 4).
Throughout the project area, the archeologists placed over 500 shovel tests or probes, averaging 26
shovel tests per transect per linear mile. This number exceeds the THC Minimum Survey Standards
of 16 per mile. Site locations are shown in Appendix A (not for public disclosure).

Site 41TA296

Site 41TA296 represents a prehistoric lithic scatter. Occupying the gentle toeslope of an upland
ridge, the site lies roughly 150 m (492 ft) east of an intermittent drainage in an area defined as an
HPA. Soils at the site have been mapped as belonging to the Tarrant association, undulating (USDA,
SCS 1976); erosion has exposed copious limestone gravels, and soils were found to be less than
10 cm (3.9 inches) in depth. Site vegetation at the time of the survey consisted of junipers and low
grasses, providing 70 percent ground visibility. A two-track road runs through the center of the site,
a bermed stock tank lies at its southeastern margin, and an existing transmission line parallels its
northwestern side.

Six shovel tests placed to define the site’s horizontal and vertical extent all proved negative for
cultural materials. Based on surface observation, the site runs approximately 35 m (114 ft)
southwest-northeast (Figure 5); it extends the full 50-m width of the ROW and beyond both
boundaries. Roughly 50 pieces of debitage were found spread across the site, with three main
concentrations of slightly higher density—10 to 15 pieces per 10 square meters (m2) (108 square
feet [ft2])—identified. Also present were two fragmentary thinned bifaces.

Site 41TA296 likely represents a prehistoric campsite benefitting from both relative proximity to
water and abundant nearby chert resources. Erosion, modern improvements associated with cattle
ranching, and an existing transmission line have all contributed to the site’s lack of integrity. While
the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA296 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of
the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

V. Results

Site 41TA297
Site 41TA297 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on a narrow low rise formed by the confluence of
two intermittent drainages; consequently, this area is considered an HPA. Soils in the area have
been mapped as belonging to the Tarrant association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976); however,
erosion from wind and water has resulted in a paucity of soils, with limestone bedrock and gravels
exposed on the surface. Only sparse grasses and scattered junipers occupy what little soil remains,
providing roughly 80 percent ground surface visibility.

Based on the surface manifestation, the site measures approximately 50 m (160 ft) southwestnortheast by 25 m (80 ft) southeast-northwest, extending outside the ROW boundary to the
southeast (Figure 6). No shovel tests were excavated due to the lack of soils. The site consists of a
thin surface scatter of chert debitage, roughly one piece per 4 m2 (43 ft2). Secondary flakes were
present, but the majority was of tertiary stage of manufacture, with some being biface thinning
flakes. About 10 flakes exhibited signs of heat treatment, and some edge modification was observed
on approximately 5 pieces.

No time-diagnostic artifacts or features were present. The relative lack of raw materials and the
presence of debitage of later-stage manufacture suggest that chert was most likely brought from
nearby hills to be worked at a campsite. While the proximity to potential water places the site in an
HPA, the lack of soils has precluded any stratification that might provide further research potential.
While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA297 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the
portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation.

Site 41TA298

Site 41TA298 is a prehistoric site located on a low hilltop formed by the confluence of Bluff Creek
150 m (492 ft) to the southwest and an intermittent feeder 150 m (492 ft) to the east. Due to its
proximity to water, this site lies within an area categorized as an HPA. Mapped as the Tarrant
association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976), limestone gravels and slabs are ubiquitous on the
surface, exposed by erosion. Ground surface visibility was resultantly high, averaging 80 percent
among the low grasses and few junipers (Figure 7).
The site extends roughly 30 m (100 ft) southwest-northeast and 20 m (66 ft) southeast-northwest,
based on the extent of the surface scatter, and falls entirely within the ROW boundaries (Figure 8).
No shovel tests were excavated due to the paucity of soils. Chert debitage was found in a relatively
low density across the site, averaging about one piece per 4 m2 (43 ft2). The debitage consisted of
mainly secondary and tertiary flakes, with few primary flakes and only two cores/tested cobbles.
Also present were two thinned biface fragments, two scrapers, and a triangular two-beveled knife
(Figure 9).

Figure 9. Two-beveled knife from site 41TA298
No features were observed at the site nor were any definitively time-diagnostic artifacts. However,
beveled knives tend to be associated with toolkits of the Late Prehistoric period (Turner and Hester
1999:274), thus suggesting a rough date of occupation. Unmodified chert nodules are nonexistent
on the landform, and it would seem that the lithic resources were brought to the site from the
surrounding hills and worked there. Because of the lack of soil deposition and the absence of
features, site 41TA298 does not appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP and does not merit
additional fieldwork.

Site 41TA299

Site 41TA299 is a prehistoric lithic quarry situated across successive narrow limestone shelves at
the top of an upland ridge. The nearest water source is an intermittent drainage over 400 m
(1,312 ft) to the west; combined with the slope and exposed bedrock, this places the site area in a
section determined to be an LPA. Soils within the site area have been mapped as belonging to the
Tarrant association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976). Large limestone and chert nodules are scattered
across the bedrock, with sparse grasses and junipers only slightly limiting ground surface visibility.
10006286/110024

21

V. Results
No shovel tests were excavated due to the lack of soil. The site covers over 80 m (262 ft) from
southwest to northeast, and continues past the ROW boundaries on both sides (Figure 10). Large
chert flakes were found in concentrations of up to three pieces per square meter (11 ft2). Of these,
roughly 70 percent were secondary flakes, 20 percent tertiary, and 10 percent primary. Roughly 10
cores were also observed scattered across the landform among unmodified chert cobbles.

The site represents a lithic procurement area limited to the surface, with no diagnostic artifacts or
features present. While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA299 as a whole cannot be determined at
this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

Site 41TA300

Site 41TA300 is a prehistoric site located on a gentle slope at the base of an upland ridge, along the
banks of an intermittent drainage (Figure 11). Due to the periodic water source, this area qualifies
as an HPA. Kavett clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (USDA, SCS 1976) forms the predominant mapped soil
series. Scattered junipers and sparse grasses form the primary vegetation, but erosion has resulted
in little soil depth, exposing limestone bedrock and gravels across the surface. The resultant ground
surface visibility was approximately 80 percent.

Two shovel tests were placed in soils near the drainage, but these proved to be shallow and
negative for cultural materials. Based on the surface scatter, the site measures 80 m (262 ft)
southwest-northeast by at least 50 m (160 ft) southeast-northwest, extending beyond the ROW
limits (Figure 12). The construction of an existing transmission line to the northwest and a fence at
the site’s northern edge represent probable disturbances to the site’s integrity. Scattered across the
site were at least five chert cores and debitage in densities averaging one per square meter (11 ft2);
of the latter, roughly 60 percent were secondary flakes, and the remaining 40 percent were tertiary.
The site was most likely a temporary campsite occupied during wetter seasons and taking
advantage of nearby chert resources. No features or their remnants were observed, nor were any
time-diagnostic artifacts. While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA300 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

Site 41TA301
Site 41TA301 represents a prehistoric lithic scatter located at the confluence of two intermittent
drainages incised into the surrounding ridges (Figure 13). Due to the presence of a water source,
though ephemeral, the area is categorized as an HPA. However, the soils, mapped as the Tarrant
association, undulating (USDA, SCS 1976), are thin over limestone bedrock, with much of the latter
exposed due to the paucity of soils. Surface visibility was high overall, but limited in areas by
junipers and low grasses.

Only one shovel test was possible within the site area, and this was negative, consisting of gravelly
clay to a depth of only 10 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (4 inches). The site appears to
extend beyond the ROW boundaries and was likely impacted by the construction of an existing
transmission line and an access road to the northwest. Lithic debitage was observed on the surface
across a length of 135 m (443 ft) southwest-northeast at a density of roughly one per 4 m2. Nearer
the creek was one 10-m (30-ft)-diameter concentration of about three to five pieces per square
meter (11 ft2). Debitage was mostly of secondary and tertiary stage of manufacture. Only one
definite core was observed, but abundant raw material was present, some possibly tested.
The site likely functioned as a campsite as well as a probable lithic procurement area, but no
diagnostic artifacts or evidence of features was observed. While the NRHP eligibility of site
41TA301 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the
current ROW does not appear to merit additional investigation.

Site 41TA302
Site 41TA302 represents a prehistoric lithic procurement area. The site consists of a chert
outcropping on successive limestone shelves near the top of a high upland ridge (see Figure 3). An
intermittent drainage lies over 300 m to the west. Due to the steep slope and the distance from
water, this area would typically be categorized as an LPA. Soils have been mapped as belonging to
the Tarrant-Rock outcrop association, hilly (USDA, SCS 1976), with bedrock and ubiquitous
limestone gravels and cobbles exposed at the surface. What little vegetation was present at the time
of the survey consisted of sparse grasses and junipers, yielding an average of 90 percent ground
surface visibility.

No shovel tests were possible due to the paucity of soil deposition. Based on the surface
manifestation, the site extends roughly 130 m (427 ft) southwest-northeast to the top of the
landform and occupies the full width of the ROW (Figure 14). Evidenced by surface observation, the
site continues beyond the ROW boundaries and has most likely been impacted on its northwestern
margin by the construction of an existing transmission line and heavily eroded access road. Most of
the artifacts were found in a relatively tight concentration of up to three pieces per square meter
(11 ft2), with additional scatter downhill likely representing secondary distribution by erosion. The
artifact assemblage consisted of cores and tested cobbles, roughly 20 large pieces of debitage
(70 percent secondary, 20 percent tertiary, and 10 percent primary), and an early-stage biface.
Raw chert was abundant, but no diagnostic artifacts or features were present. For these reasons, it
is unlikely that further study of the site would produce significant additional information on the
area’s prehistory. While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA302 as a whole cannot be determined at
this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

Site 41TA303

Site 41TA303 consists of a lithic scatter found in and among historic refuse. It is located
approximately 30 m (100 ft) west of an intermittent feeder to Spring Creek within an area classified
as an HPA. Sagerton clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is the main soil type mapped (USDA, SCS
1976). The area is vegetated by scattered mesquite and junipers, and is currently used for grazing.
At the time of the survey, low grasses were of sufficient density to limit ground surface visibility to
less than 15 percent.

The site’s 90-m (295-ft) length was determined based on the extent of the surface scatter of
discarded historic artifacts, which spans and continues beyond the 50-m ROW (Figure 15). Thirteen
shovel tests were excavated, with none positive for cultural materials. Prehistoric artifacts were
found primarily near the center and northwestern corner of the site, but in no specific
concentrations. These included approximately 10 pieces of lithic debitage, a single core, and an

expedient scraper. Other fragments of chert were also observed, but many of these appeared to
have been machine-spalled during possible earlier clearing.

The historic materials were located in the vicinity of a small wire-fenced area. This assemblage
consisted of five old tires, six rusted cans of unknown purpose, bales of fencing wire, a wooden
beehive, and five brown-glass beer bottles dating to the 1940s and 1950s (Bureau of Land
Management/Society for Historical Archaeology 2011). These were widely scattered across the site
and represent a historic trash dump, according to the landowner, Mack Boyd, who has lived on the
property since 1943.

The prehistoric component of the site produced no diagnostic artifacts or evidence of features, and
was limited solely to the surface. Historic map research found no evidence of a structure in the
site’s locale on either the 1940 or 1961 general highway maps of Taylor County (Texas State
Highway Department [TSHD] 1940, 1961), confirming Mr. Boyd’s assertion that the area was a
trash dump. While the NRHP eligibility of neither component of site 41TA303 can be determined
fully at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit
additional investigation.

Site 41TA304

Site 41TA304 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the northeastern bank of Spring Creek within
a level plowed field. Due to the proximity to water, this area is considered an HPA. Gageby clay loam
(USDA, SCS 1976) is mapped as the predominant soil series within the floodplain. Ground surface
visibility ranged between 30 to 80 percent at the time of the survey, depending on furrows and the
density of wheat chaff left behind after harvesting. Hackberries, junipers, and high grasses formed
the predominant vegetation along the creek.

The site’s length was defined by surface observation and shovel testing to be approximately 75 m
(246 ft) southwest-northeast, and its width to be 50 m (160 ft), spanning the ROW and extending
beyond on both sides (Figure 16). Nine shovel tests were excavated to define the site’s vertical and
horizontal limits, with all proving negative for cultural materials. Large cores (up to 20 cm
[8 inches]) and pieces of debitage, mostly of primary and secondary manufacture, were found
across the surface of the site in a relatively low density of one per 9 m2 (97 ft2) (Figure 17). No
artifacts were observed within the creek’s cutbanks, but limestone and chert cobbles were plentiful
within the creek channel. No diagnostic artifacts or features were present.
The site appears to have taken advantage of both proximity to a larger water source and abundant
chert resources redeposited from upstream. While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA304 as a whole
cannot be determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not
appear to merit additional fieldwork.

Site 41TA305
Site 41TA305 is a small prehistoric site situated on the eastern edge of an abandoned channel
within the floodplain of Valley and Spring creeks. The channel has since vanished within a now level
agricultural field (Figure 18), and its presence is indicated only on aerial photographs. This area is
categorized as an HPA. Soils within the floodplain have been mapped as belonging to the Gageby
series of clay loams (USDA, SCS 1976). The agricultural field was plowed but not planted at the time
of the survey, yielding 90 percent visibility of the ground surface.

The site measures about 60 m (200 ft) southwest-northeast and 30 m (100 ft) southeast-northwest
based on shovel testing and surface observation (Figure 19). Thirteen shovel tests, averaging 60 cm
(24 inches) in depth, all proved negative for cultural materials. The artifact assemblage across the
site was sparse, comprising only 6 secondary flakes, 4 tertiary flakes, and 2 chert cores. While up to
10 pieces of fire-cracked rocks were present across the surface of the site, they were found in no
specific concentrations that might indicate the presence of intact features.
Site 41TA305 has been heavily impacted by modern agricultural practices, and the lack of
diagnostic artifacts and features appears to preclude the site’s potential to significantly supplement
the knowledge of the region’s prehistory. Therefore, site 41TA305 does not appear to be eligible for
listing in the NRHP and does not merit additional fieldwork.

Site 41TA306
Possessing both prehistoric and historic components, site 41TA306 is situated immediately east of
Valley Creek within the same plowed agricultural field as site 41TA305. Soils within the area are
mapped as belonging to the series of Gageby clay loam (USDA, SCS 1976), though shovel testing
encountered probable Holocene soils to depths of over 100 cm (39 inches), atypical of the soil
series. This area was assigned as an HPA based on its proximity to water. Ground surface visibility
averaged 80 percent at the time of the survey. Modern agricultural equipment and a pen for hay lie
within the ROW and are associated with a storage building located to the southeast outside the
ROW.
The site borders Valley Creek to the southwest and measures about 120 m (394 ft) southwestnortheast based on the observed extent of the surface scatter and negative shovel tests (Figure 20).
It extends beyond the 50-m (160-ft) ROW boundaries in both directions, and was likely impacted
by the construction of an existing transmission line to the northwest. Eleven shovel tests were
placed to define the site’s horizontal and vertical extent. Five of these produced cultural materials
to depths of 30 cmbs (Table 2).

V. Results
The majority of the site’s artifacts, both prehistoric and historic, were found across the surface. The
former consisted of 1 large chert core and 10 chert flakes, mostly of secondary and tertiary stage of
manufacture. No diagnostic artifacts or evidence of features were found at the site or in the cutbank
of Valley Creek. Artifacts associated with the site’s historic component were mostly domestic in
nature. Most plentiful were fragments of solarized, milk, green, dark blue, aqua, and brown glass, in
a density of roughly 1 to 2 per square meter. Fragments of stoneware and ironstone were also
present, but numbered less than 20 pieces in total. Five iron wire nails were the only evidence of
structures observed.

The landowner, Landa Z. Grohman, reported that her father, the youngest of eight children, was
born in the house in 1927. The family had moved there possibly earlier than 10 to 15 years prior to
his birth, and the house was already constructed by that point. Her family had leased and later
purchased the property from the Allison family for the purpose of farming cotton. According to
census records, in 1900, Henry H. Allison (59) appears as a property-owning farmer living in a rural
area of Taylor County with his wife Louisa J. (52) and son Arthur (13). They do not appear in the
1880 or 1910 Taylor County census records, but by 1920, the family had relocated to Abilene. H.H.
Allison was deceased by 1930 when his wife Louisa (82), still in Abilene, appears as the head of
household. It is possible that the Allisons occupied the property before they relocated to Abilene, at
which time they leased the house/land to Ms. Grohman’s ancestors, later selling the property to her
father.

The house is depicted on the 1940 and 1961 general highway maps of Taylor County (TSHD 1940,
1961), but does not appear on the USGS 1967 Shep, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map,
confirming the landowner’s recollection that the house was demolished in the mid-1960s. A firm
beginning date cannot be given for the house’s construction, but the nails suggest a date post-1880,
when the production of wire nails gained popularity (Horn 2008:5). The solarized glass indicates a
rough age range of ca. 1880 to 1919 (Stelle 2011), and a single ironstone sherd with a maker’s mark
likely represents the Homer Laughlin China Co., which opened in 1874 in East Liverpool, Ohio (the
potteries.org 2011) (Figure 21).

While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA306 as a whole cannot be determined at this time, the
portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to merit additional
investigation. However, despite the site’s surficial nature, the position within the floodplain
necessitated monitoring of construction for the single tower placed within its defined boundaries.
No new artifacts or features were observed either within the cores’ profiles or the displaced fill.

Site 41TA307
Site 41TA307 is a prehistoric site occupying a limestone bluff overlooking Valley Creek and its
floodplain; this area qualifies as an HPA. Miles sandy loam (USDA, SCS 1976) is mapped in the area,
yielding to exposed bedrock at the site’s northeastern margin. Most of the site area has been
cultivated in the past but is now used for livestock grazing; one small section was plowed at the
time of the survey. Visibility ranged from roughly 20 percent within the low grasses of the pasture
to the southwest and up to 90 percent within stands of junipers on the bluff. A deer camp and twotrack roads have impacted the northeastern margin of the site, and an existing transmission line
parallels the ROW to the northwest.

Based on the farthest extent of surface material and 16 shovel tests, the site measures
approximately 180 m (590 ft) southwest-northeast (Figure 22). The site continues beyond the ROW
limits to the southeast and northwest. The site is a primarily surficial lithic scatter with three shovel
tests testifying to a shallow subsurface manifestation of up to 20 cmbs (7.9 inches) (Table 3).
Debitage, mainly of the secondary and tertiary stage of manufacture, was thinly spread, averaging
only 1 piece per 1 m2 (11 ft2) at its highest density, between the tree line and the bluff edge; less
than 10 flakes were observed outside of that range. Scattered fragments of fire-cracked rocks were
observed within the plowed field, but these numbered less than 10 and were found in no specific
concentrations.

Due to its location overlooking Valley Creek, as well as the presence of burned rocks, site 41TA307
was most likely an open-air campsite. Raw chert eroding from the limestone bluff was also a likely
draw to this location. However, no features or time-diagnostic artifacts were observed to firmly
place the site chronologically. While the NRHP eligibility of site 41TA307 as a whole cannot be
determined at this time, the portion of the site that lies within the current ROW does not appear to
merit additional investigation.

MONITORING

On October 13, 2011, the augering of five tower structures within the floodplains of Valley and
Spring creeks was monitored by an archeologist (Appendix B), as called for within the THCapproved generic research design for Oncor projects (PBS&J 2008). Four auger holes were drilled
per structure, each using an auger bit 60 cm (24 inches) in diameter.

Three towers (3/4, 4/1, and 4/2) are located within the 0.8-km (0.5-mile) floodplain shared by
Valley and Spring Creeks, an area with soils mapped as belonging to the Gageby series of clay loams.
The tower foundations were drilled to depths of 4.3 m (14 ft), 4.3 m (14 ft), and 6.1 m (20 ft),
respectively. Tower 3/4 lies within the defined boundaries of site 41TA306, as confirmed by the
presence of whiteware and a piece of lithic debitage found on the surface. Tower 4/1 occupies the
area of floodplain between sites 41TA305 and 41TA306, and Tower 4/2 is located near the
northeastern margin of site 41TA305. In all of these, dark brown clay loam extended from the
surface to a depth of 0.3 to 0.6 m (1 to 2 ft). This yielded to yellowish sandy loam, which began to
increase significantly in clay and limestone gravel content from roughly 2 m (6.5 ft) to the
10006286/110024

V. Results
maximum depth of boring. Neither the profiles nor the backdirt from any of the auger holes
revealed evidence of artifacts or features.

The remaining two towers (4/3 and 4/4) parallel a minor intermittent tributary to the northeast of
Spring Creek, and their foundation holes measured 7 m (23 ft) and 5.8 m (19 ft) in depth,
respectively, Tower 4/3 is situated roughly 130 m from the margin of site 41TA304 near Spring
Creek, and Tower 4/4 lies farther to the northeast at a slightly higher elevation. The Gageby series
of clay loam is mapped in this area also, and the soils encountered in these auger holes were very
similar to those of towers 3/4, 4/1, and 4/2. The main difference between these areas was the
presence of dense limestone gravels and cobbles—some chert-bearing—which occurred at depths
of roughly 2.4 to 3.4 m (8 to 11 ft); below that, dark yellowish red sandy clay loam extended to the
maximum core depth. No cultural artifacts or features were observed in either the profiles or the
backdirt from any of the auger holes.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
The cultural resource investigations conducted in connection with the proposed Oncor Central Bluff
to Bluff Creek Transmission Line Project identified 12 previously unrecorded cultural resource
sites with the potential of being impacted by the project.

The survey defined 10 prehistoric sites—41TA296–41TA302, 41TA304, 41TA305, and 41TA307—
and 2 sites with both prehistoric and historic components—41TA303 and 41TA306. Only sites
41TA298 and 41TA305 were defined as solely within the boundaries of the ROW; these do not
appear to be eligible for listing in the NRHP or warrant further work. The NRHP eligibility of the
remaining 10 sites cannot be determined at this time, as they extend beyond the limits of the
current project area; however, based on the recorded portions of these sites, no further cultural
resource investigations are recommended within the ROW. Due to the possibility of buried sites
within the floodplains of Valley and Spring creeks, the construction of five tower structures was
monitored; no subsurface cultural resources were observed within the 20 auger holes.

Based on the results of the intensive pedestrian survey, it is recommended that construction of the
15.4-km (9.6-mile) proposed Oncor Central Bluff to Bluff Creek transmission line be allowed to
proceed. Within the entire project area, if evidence of presently undiscovered cultural remains is
encountered during construction, it is recommended that the discovery be evaluated by a qualified
archeologist who can provide guidance on how to proceed in accordance with federal and state
regulations.
