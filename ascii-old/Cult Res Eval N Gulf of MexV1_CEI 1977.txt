In the wake of the recent energy crisis has come accelerated explore-

i.'n and development of the t'ir.Lral resources of the outer continental shelf
(OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico, as has been true along the Californ4a coat,
Atlantic coast1 and the Alaskan coast. This increased extraction of the

mineral resources has raised the specter of irreversible damage and loS to

in r..cognit ion of possible damage 'o environmental and cultural re-

Its purpose was to determine the archeological potential, to

evaluation of bottom conditions and sedimentation patterns affecting

This order of study was followed:

Mappable Geolrgical Features

While each coastal system may conit of an assemblage of physiographic

units, the relict forn of these units may be so subtle or modified that they
cannot be eaiy identified. Identification or interpretation is also based
to 4 large extent on the scale of maps, ehart.s, or aerial photographs available for study and n availability of supplemental data, such as bottom sedi-

nt types.
Primary data in the form of maps, bathymetric charts, and aerial photographs were used at a variety of

scales.

Continental Shelf Features

The area of primary consideration in this study is defined as the
gently sloping. shallow-water

platform that extends

from the coast to the

shelf "break," or that point where a steep slope to deep ocean floor begins.

As emphasized in this report, the continental shelf of the northern
of Mexico is highly variable.

Gulf

The shelf ranges in width from about 30

kilometers in the Mississippi-Alabama-west Florida area to more than 120

kilometers in the south florida, east Texas, and west Louisiana areas.
While the shelf break generally occurs at about 100 meters, features of

tnteret in this study extend to about 200-meter depths in some areas of
the Gulf.

Barrier cpit Complexes - Price (1968: 51) deti.es a barrier as "...

are coimsonly connected below water by tidal deltas. While inlets migrate,
the makeup of a chain is changeable. The barrier (coastal) lagoon is a

succession of shallow troughs or barriers set oft by widening of the toland.
There are bay-mouth, midbay, and bahead barriers."
Barrier and spit complexes tend to be narrow near headlandi. The
downdrift ends, where they enter bays or migratory inlets typically become cor-iplicated by the farmation of recurved spit complexes. While barriers

and ;pits begL a single, water-said beach ridges. coionly vegetated, they
are isually e.evated by aeolian sand and become beach-dune ridges. Beach
ridges may be aided to the seaward side if a sand surplus exists to form a

beach plain (Fiurs 2-10). Washover fans may form on the lagoonal side and
are .ssociated rith washover flood channels1 which often develop during storms.
These may he vegetated to become part of the marsh apron on the lagoon side

of the barrier.
Dune development may also become complex.

Blowout fans form downwind

from blowout areas in the foredunes. Dunes may migrate across the island

and eentually enter the lagoon over tidal flats. Freshwater ponds are
coin features in conpltcated barrier dune areas.
Barrier and spit complexes are among the most comeon relict features

on the continental shelf. This should not be surprising since they are prminent around the Gulf margin in the present active coastal zone and possess
a verr distinctive geometry.

While some escarpments may be the surface expression of faults, the

Minor escarpments associated with ".eacliff&' are not entirely unknown

Modern examples are usually found slung the shores

In the Florida area1 the basin rocks are not as thick, and great depocenters with associated growth faults and diapiric str,.sctures are absent.
From the standpoint of sediment depaitiÃ¸n and tectonics, the Florida
area
is notably 'quieter" than the Louisiana Texas area. It can best be
characterized as an area of slow1 gentle uplifi. However1 local areas of

subsidence or uplift do occur.
These general patterns have persisted into tate Quaternary times.
While indications of some of theie movements are subtle, it is neverthe-

less posibie to delineate areas of uplift, subsidence, or relative stability. Data for the map presented in Figure 2-16 is derived in part from
the literature and in part from results of the present *tudy.

upon whirh an interpretive history

In order to achieve this, many of the form interpretations

made in this study iiIll require some locaL historical considerations,

in the

geoioai history section of this report (Chapter 6), a Gulf-wide synthesis
of these local historical indicators (i.e., the forms themselves) will be made.
We freely admit that there are many pcssibilities which could make the

interpretation

of submerged relict forms erroneous.

For s:ample, the interpre-

tation of channels as the re.ult of terrestri.l processes, when they may have
been formed by submarine processes, could negave many of the interpretations
to be presented.

However, our goal is the identification of areas which possibly were
favorable habitats for early indigenous people.

To accomplish this as ex-

haustively as possible, we should not exclude any area for which a reasonably

plausible interpretation can be

given to indicate that such habitat existed.

That some interpretations may later oe disproved by new information ii inevitable, but in the present state of knowledge, it would be unwise to discotmt any area simply because the interpretations on which it is judged
suitable habitat for people are not definitive or completely documented.

There are simply veryfew, if any, places on the continental shelf, as the
following discussIon will amply illustrate, for which sufficiently detailed
knowledg, exists to make such definitive arguments.

The channel forms in the southern

A

different set of coastal process eonditioni than the present shoreline.

While the present shoreline is exposed to a see that overlaps a broad,

the paleo-sboreline at this low level imst have directly

that rising sea level stage could have preserved any dwelling sites through

evLdence of channels is reen at about this same depth in

the northern part of the sout Texas shelf, where channel segments are seen
extending from -40 tO -4 m depths.
Inl.ind fron this feature1 there are at least two more barriers out-

lined by ptolongated bulges in ''e contours at -2C to -30 m and -18 to

20 m.

The outermost of these two forms extends into the vicinity of the Sebree
Bank, where rocks of unknown type occur that are at ieast partially a result
of encrusting orgaaism

(Mattison, l9e8).

Thie relief barrier and the Sebree

Bank are not necessarily related, but it is possible that the

bank repre-

sents an outcrop of shelly estuarine fades associated with this shoreline.
Some support is given this by a radiocarbon date reported by Curray (1960),

taken on sampLes of oyster shells from a depth of 30.5 m lying btween the
borrier and the Sebree Bank.

The date obtained on this material was 9,530

270 radio carbon years before

present (H.P.).

Â±

As the shoreline was submerged,

the shell was exposed and eroded partially by wave planation and became
L%.1cnjzed by encrusting organisms that have capped the outcrop of hard
iubstrate.

Likewise, the barrier was extensively eroded as it became sub-

merged in the wave zone.

The barrier outlined by the -18 to -20 m contour is a more distinct
feature.

If the -20 m contour is traced northward from this feature, it

indicates an area of rather irregular bottom topography about -15 to -20 km to
the rorth-northeast.

The irregular forms at this depth tend to be aligned

with si..t1ar, shallower features which trend south-southwestwardly in a

cinvex seaward arc toward the present shoreline.
43

This patteri of alignment has

led to the auggesion that they were active bottom features of material
being waved along the inner shelf floor.

Many workers (Swift Â£L..!J.

The present banks are developed wherever pre-

The earlier feature may be evidenced by the

their origin in the

Any rype of spring may have provided attractive habitat for early

The observation that few or the channel aigmencu show continuity

beween the 40 and -80 m isobath is possibly an indication of a later
shoreline which may have occupied this position for an interval that was

so brief that its major effect was merely the craaure or masking of the
earlier topography. This supposition will require much greater knowledge

to detect any evidence of such a shoreline.

may confirm or dirty such a speculation.
Toward shore from the calcareous bank and dendritic channel forms,
the central Texas shelf is remarkably featureless, presumably due
to sediment cover.

Inland fr'm the Laguna Madre, to the north of B.ffin Bay, there is a
remarkable coastal sand ridge of arcuate form which extends diseontinuou1y

to the south side of Matagorda Bay. This fature has been termed the
ingleside Barrier by Price (1933). As we shall see, this is the first appearance of an inner barrior form that we have seen in our progression
around the Cult t7largtn, but b' no means the last. Such barriers are coron

our ignorance about thea. coastal features, which outcrop on dry land where
they sr readily accessible for geological study, makes it overwhelmingly
apparent how difficult geological interpretation of the submerged

Just north of the Bat f in Bay mouth, the situation described by Rug

(l60) veil

liustrates the uncertainties of interpretation that exist.

A dense, brown "Pleistocene beach rock" is described cropping in front
of the Ingleside barrier (which is known as the Flour Ridge in this

local area).

also oy the name of the Encinal Paninsult) which is substantially different
from th*

of Hunter and Dickinson (1970), which lie, only 29 km to th. south.

This section is reproduced here as Figure 3-3.

Wilkinson et al. (1975) interpret that the Ingleside sand unit extends

y this point, it should be obvious that interpretation of the ingleside
shoreline featuree and their .trat..graphic relation to adjoining coastal
features ia by no means a c'ear-cut and settled isatter.

Before attempting a

preliminary interpretation of these features, let us consider a fw eore isolated bits of evidence known from th. central Texas area.
Prire (1958) reported the occurrence of lagoonal mud beneath the Ingleside
sand in a pit near the town of Ingleside, just to the north of Corpus Christi
day.

Althoih Wilkinson et al.

(1975) deny that ruch a sequence is typical.

of the area, they do not show that the sequence at this pit is not as dercribed by Price.

It is not to be expected that indicatoru of estuarine con-

ditions (estuarine shells and microfossils, in this case) would everywhere

qurvive the prolonged exposure above sea level which the In1eside sands and
the underlying clayey units have both ipparently endured.

Conditions fo'

preservation of these materials may have existed only rarely, and Price's
locale may well have been one of these rare sites.

Wilkinson et al.

(1915)

argue that the sediments beneath the Ingleside sand repreaent "older delta-

plain sediments" rather than lagoonal fill; however, in eocn usage at least,

'delta-platn sediments" may include l.agoonal fill fades with which ty aay
be intergraoational in spacs.

After all, the Naysrit littoral accumulative

to define the relationship has been published. Rusnak (1960) vas of the
o,iinL,n that it was a marina beach rock and part of the flour Ridge feature.
This is implied in Rusnak's statement that "the attitude of th.

exposed marine

beach rock which flanks the (Flour Ridge I barrier suggests that the
nearahore

area had a shallow gulf profile very similar to that of the 'dern
barrier"
(p. 190). Rusnak apparently regardd the betch rock as a nearshor.
or shoreface deposit. Modern shorefce d'posits h&v.
attitudes in th. order of 20 ft.

per mile of slope, which, it is important to note, is steeper than the base
of the Ingleside strandplatn sand as projected by Wilkinson
aj.. (1.97.
.

Fisk (1959) describes the ahoreface sands of this araa as stay sands with
abundant fossi1 and wood fragments.
These conSiderations couj.d be taken to indicat. tnat older sands underlying the lagoon and modern barrier could be at least
partially shoreface

sand fades of the Ingleside beach deposits. When the sea level, fell and the
Ingi.eside shoreline oecame straided, these aboreface deposits may have been
reworked and moaified in form b shoreljiie processe3, and then affected
by

prolonged weathering and erosion so that they presently resemble the Ingleside sands f the mainland. So far, no fosailjferoua evidence

Wilkinson et al. (1975) eirphaeize that the soil zone, or zone of weather-

ing which lies at the top of

the deltaic

interdistributary muds, slopes qufte

steeply (10 ft./zii.), as doea their Ingleside atrandplain sand.

In both of

their profiles, the slope is by no means uniform. In Figure 3-4,

a break in

slope of the weathered surface (the "soil zone") occuts at about 15

'

(30 ft.)

below se.i level; in Figure 3-3, a break exists at abo'it 12 m (40 ft.) below.

The corresponding slope-break elevations of the tope surface of the unit, called
the Ingleside strandplain sand, are at about 12 m and 6 m below sea level, respectavely.

Seaward of these slope breaka, the Ingleside stra'dplain sand

unit siopes more gently. The slopes beyond the

shoreline shown in the cross-

sect ions are presinaab.y prcjected since no mention is nade of borings or other

information utilized beyond the beach.

According to Figure 3-, the earlier

formed Ingleside strandplain sands underlie the modern beach at Mustang Island
at a depth of only about -7 m.

At this point, then, it would clearly aeeo

possible that this sand might outcrop only a short distance offshore.

An important element of this interpretation is that the slope of the
soil zone and the siope and configuration of the Ingleside sand itself are
essentially considered to be inherited from the slope of the pro-delta facies

or these reasons, the delta progradation must ha'e occurred either in

a sheltered situation or under conditions of slowl.y falling aa le'iei. The
shelter may have been a barrier, possibly the Ingleside shorelint. The delta
may nave prograded at the open Gulf ahoreline while sea level was falling.

In

this case, the Ingleside shorelines may represent merely pauses in the fall of

sea level.
Perhaps there was a prolonged 3tage of river-mouth discharge at the Gulf
shoreline. At euch tires, river-transported sands would have reached the coaSt

and may have contri'uted to the final stages of beach-ridge development, which
are the forms that we observe today.

In this special case, delta progradation

and beach-plain progradation may have been essentially the same thins I or some
span of time. During such a stage, the subtlety c the distinction be' ieeo suh
terms as barrier and straudplain reminds us of the arbitrariness of the terms

by which coastal features are described.

PrLe's interpretation of the Engleside barrier was no doubt influenced by
his well-known concern for the concept that coastal forms are products of equilibrium relationsbis of particular setS of coastal conditions. The large-scale

similarity of e Ingleside shoreline forms and the modern barrier forms clearly
suggests a sintlar equilibrium existed during th f rmatior. of both shorelines.
Not only is this sugge.ted by the forms, but if we try to suggest that coastal
conditions were in some way markedly different ir Ingleside times, than

it is

sedimentation has resulted in pulses of progradation.

Because of an abundant

The deltaic sedi-

Central Florida Area

This area for-ms the northern part of the Florida Platesu, a broad,flat

area ..zdrlain by relatively stable ithestone. The outer shelf consists of
what Price (1954) has termed the downvarped shelf (rigure 3-29). This is a
terrace-like feature lying between the -Z0( and -100 m Contours.

According

to Gould and Stewart (1955i, the laz%dward margin of this outer sheI is marked

Sinkholes are of three general typea

The collapse sinkhole (Jon et al., 1972)

occurs where the limestone rafT has caved into a void created by the soli'tion
of limestone.

A solution sinkhole (or doline) occurs where a soil mantle set-

tles into the sinkhole at the same rate that the limestone is diseolvei away at

the botom.

The most prevalent in Florida is the aquifer sinkhole where the

water table is high and erodes the o-erlying sediment and surroziding soil

into the sinkhole.

This results in sediment becoming trapped in the aquifer

system, and none being supplied to the Gulf for

msrine deposition.

Pzileo-lndian projectile points and bones of extinct Pleistocene vertebrates have been found in r.any of the sinkholes and at numerous locales -iithin

The outer shelf of south Florida consi.its of an extensive terrace-like
area, which is believed to be a downwaiped part of the continental shelf
(figure 3-30).

The downwarped shelf lies between the -200 and -100 m

Beginning at about -120 m, it has a series of intrinittent ridges along
its outermost edge.

These ridges may have a relief of as 4'n.ich as 18 w. Per-

haps the best known of the ridges is Howell Hook, which has beer described
by Jordan

136

Judging from

I

radiocarh'n dates (Scholl, 1964a). the mangrove peat unit began to form 3,0003,400 yearc a, after cessation of calcitic mud formation. Within a period of

a few hindred to a thousand years, formation of mangrove flbrou peat in areas
vhich are now waterways and intra--forest bays gave way to the deToeition of

shell" brackish-water and marine sediments of the upper aember of the transgressive sequence.

The environi mtal shift from freshwater to brackish-water

and marine milieus came ab'ut in response to a more or less steady rise in
sea level and marine inundation of former mainland swamps.

Because a con-

siderable body of evidence points to the probable tectonic stability of
southern Florida in Recent time, the recorded submergence is regarded as a
measure of an eustatic change in sea lev1. (SchoJi. 8rId Stuiver, 19f 7).

Based

on the age and elevation of fibrous peat overlying bedrock and freshwater

cacitic sediment, the rise in sea level across aouthwetern Florida 4,400 3,500 B.P. was 30 cm /100 years. About 3,00 B.P., when sea level stood

1.6 m below its contemporary position, the rate of rise diminished by a

factor of fire; since 1,100 B.P., the rate of rise has averaged only about
3 cm /100 years.

The shoreline has apparently prograded seaward since that time and the three

Their growth i3 directed toward the water's surface and

outward tuiard the open ocean.

This is a direct result of favorable condi-

tions seaward and upward and unfavorable conditions of mci eased temperatures,

salinity change., and sediment deposition landward. The result is the configuration shown in Figure 3-35. A broad platform of coral rock is forned

Farther seaward extension may

take p1au as a result of broken coral forming a base of dead rock upon which
more coral may grow.

In addition, large-scale movement of land or sea level

can create conditions for farther extension of the platform.

The

modern reefs, are bank reefs

which differ somewh.it from the usual fringing variety in that they

between lower and higher latitudes which, as a result, was greatly affected

by the glacial ages.

During the glacial ages, the low latitudes remained

relatively warm ard were able to support coral growth.

In the marginal areas,
however, corals died, leaving the shore unprotected. Waves wore away the

coast, creatg a platform just below sea level and addingdebrt. to the
offshore region.

Both the Keys and the living reefa are located upon a platform which was
once covered by a shallow sea. During the past million years, the platform
has been subjected to periodic exposure ana flooding as a result of with-

drawal of water during glacial periods and it release during interglacial
tines. Pleistocene reefs which grew over extensive parts of this 7latform
formed a thick layer of rock. During the last glacial age, when sea level
was low, a platform was cut into the land. When the ice caps melted for the
last time, the platform was flooded.

SEA LEVFL IN THE LATE QUATERART PERIOD

Introduction

The rise and fall of sea level during
geologists for decades.

the Quateruary has fascinated

This is an area of investigation which is very

poorly understood due to the nerous difficulties and problems that re-

main uniolved and also due to the eoparativeiy sm.l amoumt of study
given to the problem.

The thouaands of welli that have been drilled on

the Outer Continental Shelf have contributed virtually no information on
aurficial deposits, and investigations pursued for purely theoretical
science are rare.

Nevertheless, a generalized view of the latest cycle of glacial lowering and subsequent rising of sea level has begun to emerge.

In this study,

we have attempted to synthesize from all the available extant information a
history of sea level change which we can relate to observed relict features
now submerged on the shelf.
trol on sea

level

In recognition of the importance of glacial con-

changes, we have also attempted to

el&te the see level

changes to veil-documented episodes of glacial advance or retreat.

Fluctuarion

A chronology table and a

of Sea Level

correlation map treating fluctuations of

sea level are given in Volume III, Plates 1 and 3.

Plate 1 is a

chronology of Late Quaternary Events and presents an interpietative

history of the

relative fluctuations of the land-sea boundary (with

respect to present-day sea level as a datum).

A curve of the relative

change of land-sea level is correlated with the Intervals A-K discussed
later in this chapter, with glacial

periods, wtb physiograph-i.c unitti

and with corresponding events in faunal evolution, artifact traditions,

and cui.ural sequences.

It is

inÃ§ortant to stres the relativity of the sea level to lar.d fluctuation,
since it iq compounded of changs in

sea level and

changes in land level

(both with rospect to some arbitrary iatum, e.g.1 present sea level as
used here) and must therefore be expressed as a algebraic simi.
As Bloom (1967) has stressod. change in se.e level may in fact lead

to opposing changts In land level dte to isostatic effects.

Therefore1

the record of fluctuation we see at the present time may indicate a
somewhat amplified curve with respect to a curve of true or absolute
change of sea level.

Besides being

amplified, the curve of relative land-sea

level must

be in various ways distorted (again, with respect to a true or abso lute

of sea lvel fluctuation).

curve

Such distortion may result partly from a lag in

isostatic response to sea level change.

Other distortions are tectonic sub-

sidence or uplift md subsidence from compacti'n.

Tectonic effects nay be

of regional scale or of local scale (as seen ar,und salt domes).

Changes

in the configuration of the geoid as a result of a sudden shift in
position of the earth1s axis or in variations in the rate of rotation have
also been offsred as explanations for sea level change (Newman, 1968).

The latest part of the curve is

taken from a published version by Scholi

etal. (1969), which in turn is based on numerous dates of various coastal d.posits of southern Florida.

The earlier1

partly overlapping segment (about

4000 - 9000 radiocarbon years ago) is constructed in part from published dates
of Rehkemper (1969) from Galveston Bay and Coleman and Smith (1964) from
the Chenier Plain of Louisiana.

The displacement of this :urve with respect

to the curve of Scholl at aX. (1969) nay partially represent a distortion
such as described above, perhap. a regional tectonic distort ion, or
changes.

evidence dieussed later.
149

The curve from about 9000 years to about 10,000 ye.ra is based on two
dates. from the northwest Florida area, one from Jervey (1914) and one from
Schnsblc ard Goodell (1968).

Again, the shift in grographic area is Asso-

ciated with a dicontinu1ty which may well reprzsenc a distortion, possibly
from regional tectonic effects.

Beyond this time, only one possibly useful radiocarbon date is known.
This was reported by Curray (1960).

The sample I. an excellent one, but it

is underlain by a salt dome structure; therefore, the possibility of some
local tectonic effect exist..

The remainder of the curve is largely inferred from the fori

identi-

f led on the shelf, Chapter 3, i'nd from knowledge developed elsewhere which

indicates the history of glacial conditions (Geological History, below).

Paleoclimatology and

the

Deep-Sea Period

Some general considerations on Late Quaternary paleoclimatology are

important in a study of this kind, but in this area we are faced with the
fact that little attention has been paid to paleoclimate in past works. Consquent1y, there is little available evidence from which inference, can be
made.

Perhaps the moe authoritative work at concern here Is that of Watts
(1975).

Watts' pollen studies of core. from a lake basin in south-.ntral

Florida showed a dry climate characterized by dune vegetation appeaitd, which,
in turn, was replaced about 4700 years ago by vegetation similar to that

of the present.
Craf (1966) has made some interesting paleoclLmatic speculationq re-.
garding the northwestern Gulf coast area. He considers the soil zones in

150

the Beaumont formation, which are associat.d 'iith the Inglei'ide shoreline

features with their characteristic caliche zoea, to bc evidence of a former,

the characteristic mi.ro-

eaumont and older surfaces in

the area to be aeolian forms developed duJng a time of aridity post-dating
the Beaumont surface (and the

ng1eside shor.ali%Le feturea).

Lundelius (1972), in his faunal analysts of the pit at Ingleside, con-

elders th. palcoenvironment to have been warmer and more humId than that of

the present.

His tceatment af the age of this unit is noncanital, but e sug-

gests the possibility that it is younger than Late .iconin. This fauna,
in our opinion, may well represent an early Rolocene deposit in the order
of 8500 - 12,000 years in age.

The faunal material aseociated with fresh-

water dunaPonds may h.ve originated at this time when warming, possibly
induced by a surface layer of meitwater which covered much of the Gulf of
S

Mezico in a time of rapid glacial waning, brought to an end a cycle of
relative aridity that existed through s-ich of the period of glaciation.

The dune pond formed und': .ese wetter condition..

At about this same time, there may have been partial stabilization of
the south Texas sand sheet and deposition of pond marie it the stabilized

dune areas as discussed earlier.
In Louisiana, Otvos (l975b) has provided some paleoclimatic interpre-

tatiuns in his recent review of bees tratigraphy and distribution. Re states

that "the fact of bess accumulation in itself indicates a drier climate."

However, it should

While

probably Late Pleietoccne or Early Nolocene, the specific date of these feetur

has not been establiqhtd.
Part of the atidl.ty of the

ulf coast may have been due to a reduced

frequency of tropical storms because of lowcr ocea' tenperature (Moran, 1915;
Adams, 1975a).

Hammond (1976) has presented in prelisinary fashion some cone 1wions of
the Climap project, a major inter-toetitutional study of sea-floor sedimenti,
the results of which will shortly be pubiihed (Mctntyra et al. ,
Cater, 1976).

Some conclusions are that at about 18,000 yearL' B.P.:

1) the Culf Stream nay have followed a southerly course toward
then England; 2) equatorial oceans were as much as

Spain rather

6Â°C lover in surface

temperature, and the world ocean average was aboit 2.30C lower; 3) sea level

was at least 85 m lower than present; 4) July surface temperatures on land
were as much as 15Â°C lower than present in are's close to the ice sheets and,

on the average, about 5Â°C

lower over th'

continents; and 5) climate was gen-

erally drier than now, especielly in the northern

hemisphere.

Emiliani at al. (1975) have recently presented results of an analysis of
th

two deep-sea cores marginal to the DeSoto Canyon that are of the greatest

importance in interpretation of the Late Quaternary history of the Gulf of
Mexico.

The cores were investigated in several ways, including foraminiferal

studies, radiocarbon dating, a&:d determination of oxygen isotope ratios.

The foraminiferal studies showed several interesting trends: 1) warmwater forms (Spaeroidinella dehiscena, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, Globorotails menardii and G. tumida) were very scarce or absent throughout the cores
but increased in

the uppermost core

The exp'.ue of fluvial and marine beds during an interval of low sea level

important effect*, especially if that exposure per-

sisted over a proloflged interval of

time.

Among some of the

effects are:

1) volumetric chan3e effects resu1tn.g frost devaterine, consolidation, oxi-

daton of organic mactr, leaching of soluble constituents, etc.1 all of
which are changes whih say lead to varying degree. of local deformst ton

As sea level was falling1 streams extended directly to the

shoreline

and contributed th. bulk of their sediment loads directly to the shelf.
Inland from the shore, entrenchment led to remobilization of sediment d.posited as valley filla in previous periods of valley aggradation.

For

these r.asons, sediment reaching the shelf possibly increased in amoimt
during at least part ot such a

failing

stage, even if streams were possibly

dininished in volume due to net addition to glacial snow and ice storage.

Much of this remobilized sediment was of coaraer-grad

size which was re-

deposited, ftr the most part, in th. nearshore zone after a pariod of entrainment by coastal current and drift systems.

Interval C - A prolonged period of relative constancy of sea level at 60
to 90 e below its preseflt level is believed to have existed throughout the
interval of 28 - 46 thou'and years before the present.

During this perio1,

rivers and streams continued in their profile adjustments to the great base
level change of the previous falling

ea level interval.

Sediment delivery to the coset was probably still rapid, at least in

A prolong.d interval of

relatively stable sea level may mean that

no

net glacial snow and ice buildup was occurring and that world climate patterns
apparently exiated in a more oir less stable state of this kind for some tire.

We are aware of no particular explanation for such an event.

In the view of

Adam (1975b), an ice sheet once initiated -iill grow until the heat stored

in the surface waters of the ocean is used up and the energy grdient to
transfer water from the oceans to glaciers thereby diminishes.

Perhaps a

steady-state situation existed for some time thereafter in which each yearly
increment of solar energy led to sufficient transfer of moisture r.o the ice
sheets to more or less compensate for melting, but

t to produce net growth.

In Adam's (l975b) view, after the heat stored above the thermocljne in
the world ocean his declined in amount (and surface zone tanpratures decline
correspondingly), less energy transfer as latent heat and more as sensible
heat occurs.

This would perhaps signify somewhat drier climateo in many con-

tinentel areas since further warming or the air as ic flowed from the sea

over the land would cause more water uptae.

The au..enness of the decline he felt was

also a result of a tendency of the

lac crc to over-develop or over-ex'end.

Beca.se at the over-extension, rapid mlt.!ng ensued.

In an extremely

in-

teresting argument, Adam shows that rapid melting creates a surface water

layer which leads to high heat los.. with no potential for storage to drive
winter latent heat transfers,

this also contributes to

glacial disintegra-

tion by further cutting off nourishment.
However, it could bo argued that other factors may operate that could

perpetuate a steady-state glacial condition for a long period. While less
water Ia available from th cooler ocean, perhaps some compensation occurs
from evaporation over land areas. An increaeed aridity over mOst ungla-

dated land areas might then be seen, leading to still further reduction of
albedo over the unglaciated areas, which might also act to alinLain the
glaciers.
Emiliani

et al. (1975) have recently elaborated a hypothesis of

con-

ditions during Stage 3 of the Emiliani interpretation of deep-sea core
stracigraphy.

They state that all micropaleontological evidence presently

available "... indicate. that Stage 3 was 'cool' with teaperature closer
to those of a glacial age than those of an interglacial one" (Fmiliani et al.,
i/5, p. 1087).

They also state, witbouc offering evidence or cited work,

that "sea level during Stage 3 apparently stood not much below the present"
(ibid).

This coent perhaps I.

Millim.an and Emery (1968) presented, but these curves have few data points

They further state that "... continued rapid ablation under

equilibriue conditions would supply the Gulf of Mexico with a continued .bmdant influx of ice eeltwater while low temperatures would be maintained."

As Mae (1975b) has eephasized, the lower teperatur. of the Gulf and

Sea level rse rapidly by about 70 m frrm its maxirur1 low stand, which led to
generation of shoreline forma at approximately the same level as forms which
had been created earlier in Interval 0.

Algal and coralline banks which had

been exposed to weathering during the lower sea level became newly active.
Many previous forms were obliterated by coastal erosion and new deposition.

The size of some of the G-Interval forms may reflect their having been laid
over a base of prior forms and the contribution of materials reworked from

these prior

rapid rise of sea level and the most rapid period of deglaciation of the entire

We make no reference here to the problematic Valdere glacial episode
since Mickelson and Evenon (1975) have questioned its existence and main-

tained that. the tills from which this interval was named are actually 1der
than the Two Creeks forest bed. They point out that the tiU above the forest bed at Two Creeks may be evidence of a glacial episode after the varii
interval, and ther? in some possibility that some decline of sea level accompanied this renewed glaciation.
Geomorphic and archeological data from the coastal zone suggest a

relative stillstand during subintervala 112 and H3, terminating about 8500
years ago.

Extensive swamp development in the west Louisiana area suggests

that conditions may have been somewhat wetter than those which prevail at
present. The extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna had not yet occurred,

and mastodon, ma=oth, horse, and other forms were abundant.

There are several lines of evidence which suggest that subinterval H4
uay have been a tine of catastrophic events. Geomorphic evidence suggests

a reversal of the trend of gradual rise or even rolative stillstand of sea
level that had occurred for several thousand years prior to this period.
Gagliano and Thom (1967) tentatively place the Deweyville alluvial terrace

in this time interval. It was also during this period that the extinction
of the Pleistocene megafauna probably occurred. It is also noteworthy that

exist, in addition, primarily within the anthropology departsents and

useus of universitj. and in the riles of amateur archeologista in the
coastal states bordering the Cult. Although there are numerous impertant
5usaries of the archeology both at te continental and regional levels, no
single work satisfies the requirements of the present study.
A a point of departure1 the broid
cultural areas and subareas defined
by Willey (1966) can he used (Figure 5-li.
For the purposes of the present
study, the northern Gulf will be divided into western, central, and eaStern
areas. Ae shown in Figure 5-1, the Western Gulf
area corresponds to the
Northeaa Mexico - Texa culture area of Willey.
The Central gulf is
equivalent to Willey's Lower Missiippj Valley Subarea, and the Eastern

Gulf ares em'racee both the Southeast Subarea and the Ciades Subarea.
AlLhough it is
beyond the scope of the present report, it should
be noted that the subareas have also been segmented.
Willey (1949) defined three segmenis of the Florida Gulf Coast
within the Southeastern Subarea as the Manatee Region, Central Coast, aad Northwest Coast.
The work

of Trickey (1958) would suggest that Mobile Bay deserves
special treatment.
In Ioeisiana, Gagliano (1967) and Phillips (1970) have

both defined small-

er cultural units. The texas coast ha likewise been segmented

Summary treatments exist for a ni.,mber of triese

archeological units as well as for a few f the subareac. For example,

Coastal zone sites in favorable locales that are geologically atable
or where there is appreciable relief may be continuously occupied, or periodically re-occuraied, for long periods of time. For example, certain cave
sites along the South African coast were occupied for many thousands of years.
Sites associated with ephemeral. featnre of low-gradient &oasts are mor
often characterized by ccupations of shorter duration. Such conditions
obtained throughout much of the Northern Gulf area.

of occupation are likely to be associated with favorable ecological condi-

The value of utilizing artifact assemblages and "index" artifacts for

The technique

becomes shaky, however, when correlations are made far from the place where

The other Pre-projectii.e Point site that has received considerable
attention is Vriesenhahii Cave, located on the Priesenhahn Ranch, 21 miles
north of San Antonio1 Texa,.

Evans (1961), in his siary article on the

cave, states that Sellards (l919' was the first to mention the wealth of
Pleistocene fossils being found by local collectors.

It was not until 1949

however, that systematic excavation of the cave revealed ita true importance.
Over thirty

genera of !n,rmAls, b1rs, reptiles, and amphibians were dis-

covered lEvans, 191:7).

However, the most striking find was that of over

forty "flints that show a crude but nonetheless definite pattern of chip-

ping, resulting in steep, cdrtost vertical edges with small, protruding
'beaks.' These artifacts nrc piano-convex and cannot be accidental.. ."
(Krieger, 1964:45-6).

One such artifact, discovered beneath the articulated
skeleton of a large saber-tooth cat (Dinobasti serus) is illustrated in
Figure 6-1.

kside from these artifacts, a series of small bones was rec-'ered
which showed cut and polished ends.

It is possible that these cuts were niad

by a carnivorous animal, and the polishing resulted from the bones passing
through the creature's iritestnal tract.

by a vertical shaft approximately nine meters deep, through which th' exca-

vaors had a descend.
Four main trenches (Figure 6-2) were dug through the floor of the

cave, exposing four distinct zones of fill (Figure 6-3). Zone 1, the
deepest, was composed of limestone blocks, gravels, and red clay. Only a
few small ma,mal bones and some turtle shell fragments were recovered.

Zone 2 consisted of water-depoelted clays in which were found carbon-

aceous vegetable remains, limestone grit, and coarse rock debris. The zone

also contained the articulated remains of an adult and an infant sabertoothed cat, and a skeleton of a peccary (Mjphus masutrus). Under the
adult cat was found the scraper in Figure 6-1.
Zor.e 3 consisted of "banded, concordally-fractured,

grItty clay with

inter-bedded thin layers of small liueatone and flint gravels" (Evans, 1961:
15).

The clays were deposited in ponds, and carbonaceous material was pre-

sent in the entire zone. This zone also pssesaed the greatest quantity of
fossil vertebrates. Included were Dinobasts and another saber-toothed cat
(Smilodan ap.), a large number of -luvenile e..e,.nant bones (Elephas sp.).
young American mastodon (Mamiut americanum), a relatively large number of

turtle carapace fragments, bison bones (Bison sp.), and the bones of horse
(Equus sp.), camels (Camelopa sp.), deer (Odocoileus sp.), dire wolf (Canis

dirus), bear, and coyote. The diversity of fauna suggests that extinctions
had not begun to be evident.

Zone 4 is fill of a once-flowing stream channel on the cave's floor.

The channel fill is a mixture of older deposit-s rerked from below, fragmentry fossil finds, and rocks and ':tay. Also occurring in this channel was
a l.rge freshwater clam bnell that could only have come from a Stream several

it becomes more signifirant if one conider the scrapers &nd the pssibtlity
of the polished bones as man's work.

According to Evans, the faunal analysis leads ota to conclude that the
cats were catching the juvenile elephants and mastodons and dragging them
back to the cav.

The

adults of the other species were probably brought to

the caveri in a Â¶imilar manner.

This raises the possibility that if man were present at the cave during
the Late pleistocene, as evidenced by the choppers and scrapers, then he may
have likewise played a part in accumulating the bones of the fa-iu.a.
Western Gulf Paleo-lndian

In a 1940 paper, E.H. Sellards described artifacts and vertebrate

fossils from a series of sites in the Mission River drainage of Bee sad
Goliad Counties, Texas. The sites (41 BE 2, 3, 4, 5, and 41 GD 5, 6) were
associated with the Berclair terrace, interpreted by Sellards as a riverinL

equivalent of the coastal Beaunt (Figure 6-4).
Material was recovered along Blanco and Medicine Creeks, and controlled

excavations at the Buckner locality (41 BE 2) yielded both artifacts and
fossilized fauual remains. Artifact finds at the other sites, although never
excavated to an major degree as at the Buckner Site, serve to illustrate that

this whole drainage area is a prime location for early man sites.
At the Buckner Site, the Bercla!r terrace is the surface of a sequence
of alluvial fUl deposited ir a stream vall?y cut into the Coliad formation
(Pliocene) (Figure 6-5). Since deposit.on of the Berclair sediments, a second

interval of ettrencurit has occurred, and a sequence of fill is in progress.
L the lower reaches of this younger valley1 which is entrenched into the
Beaumont formation, the stream is now agrading its channels.

Since S.lLard correlates the Berelair terrace with the Beaumont ter-

race, these data present a serious challenge to the generally accepted age
estimates of the Beaumont terrace and its equivalent across the Gulf coast.
Most geologists would estimate the Beaumont to

25,000 to 120,000 years old.

Two addiUonal locales should be mentioned in our consideration of
possible relatiinships between Paleo-Indian occupations and the Beaumont

terrace in the western Gulf area. Both are beach

deposIts where the preser1

!'hore is eroding into delta...e fades of the Beaimont Formation. At both

places artifacts and bones of extinct Pleistocene

vertebrates have been

collected along the beach.

The first of these locales, the Sargent Beach Site (41 MC 4), is located between the mouth of the Brazos River and Matagr'rda Bay.

In 1?57

James Searcy reported that the site conn.Lsted of a low,blaek cisy bank
approximately 45 cm high, fronting on the Gulf

(Files of the Texas

Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin).

Searcy

reported finding bison bones, fossil shells. "elepI-.nt" bone fragments and

tusks, alivers of mastodon teeth and several flint

tifa.t.

In 1570 W. B.

Neyli..nd reported that the locus of the black clay bank had coiplete1y eroded

away, but that mastodon teeth were still found along the beach. This locale

208

is significant becau3e it is situated upon relict natural levees associated
with a late Pleibtocene or Early Holocene delta of the Colorado River.

A sitiijar situatior is

found at Mcaddin

es.h (41 37 "k') located

between the mouth of the Sabine River anc! the }Ugh Island salt dome (Figure
6-6).

Here the modern beach is being nourished by material derived from the

Beaumont for-nation, which is eroding offshore.

Relict dist.ributa-y channels

and natural levees of an old Trinity River delta exposed on the surface of
the Beaumont terrace just north of a narrow belt of Late Halocerte marsh

presunably extend to the offshore area beyond the beach.

It is from the surface of, or within these, Beaumont deposits that
artifacts and bones are being eroded.

clude Eden, San Patrico and Clovis-tike fluted forms.

Bones of mameoth

(Masenut sp.), giant tortoise (Ceochelone ap.), camel (Camlops ap.), and

horse CEquus sp.) have also been foimd.

A neighboring Rangia shell midden, the Willow Lake Site (41 SF 28), also
associated with a relict

distributary levee of the Trinity River, has produced

a single Scottsbluff Point along with pottery sherds and other

artifacts.

Western Gulf Archaic
flue major problem which confronts archeologists studying the Texas

coastal region is-the fact that the Archaic of this area is believed to be
an extremely long-lived tradition.

The Aransas Culture of the south end

central Texas coast, for example, hag an estimated time-span ranging from

5,000 yeaa B.C. to 1,000 A.D.

It is very difficult to place a site of the

Aransas Culture in an accurate time frame without absoluta dating controls,
such as C-14 dates.

The Johnson Site (41 AS 1; Campbell, 1947), the type-

site of the Aransas Culture, is a case in point.

For that reason, we have chosen an Archaic site from the northern Texas
coast nd have avoided the problem of exactly how old an Aranaa Culture Site

raI1y is.
The introdtctlon of pottery into the Galveston Bay area has been securely

datcd through the efforts of a nur of workers at about 100 A.D. (Ambler,
1967; 1973; Ateri and Bollich, 1969; Aten.. 1971; and others).

The early ceramic

periods of this Te& are generally thought of as "ceramic Arch.ic," that i,
the continuation of the coastal Archaic tradition with the aadftion of
ceramics to the artifact assemblage. Thus an Archaic site (i.e., pre-

pottery) of this northern coast area would be at least 1800 years old, and
probably older. It would then have been occupied during a period of slightly
lower sea level1 and sttta of similar nature may be expected to b located

on the continental shelf.
The Jamison Site (41 LB 2) in Liberty County, texas (Men, 1967), is

)ust such a site. Although the upper levels are rich in pottery, tIie lower
strati,Laphic levels of the site contain arttfacts, which are probably
Late trchaic.

The site Itself is located on an outcrop of the Deweyvtlle terrac

t

the western margin of the trinity River floodplain (Figure 6-7). This location would have afforded the occupants of the site both the uplands of te
terrace and the lowlan.s of the floodplain in which to carry on food prctre-

ment activities (Men, 1967: 1).
Excavations carried out by memberu of the Houston Archeological

Society from 1959 to 1961 revealed the site to be an earth middan. Four
analysis mits were therefore established. Men concluded that these lower
two units represent a preceramic occupation of the site. Included in these
units were dart point& af the Ellis, Gary, Neches River, Palmillas arid
Williams types. Williams points have a time range beginning approximately

at 4,000 B.C. and lasting well into the time of potter. Palisilla., Gary,

dates for Williams points1 that thse two units would have been occt'pie

We will be concerned here with two important discoveries believed to

In 1846, a Natchez physician by the name of M.W. Dickeson published a
short account of some fossilized bones ha had collected during the period
from 1837 to 1844 (Dickeson, 1846).

Re described the remains as coming from

In the southern portion of Louisiana, five major salt domes protrude

Avery Island, some of the earliest evidence of man in the central Gulf
area
has been recorded.

Gagliano (1967) published results of the work he had been
conducting on

Avery Island since 1962.

He a1,o reviewed all previous explorations at the
island carried out by Owen (1863), Leidy (1866; 1889), Joor (1895), Veatch
(1899). and others in which the presence of Pleistocene fauna
and artifacts

were revealed from what was termed the "bond bed1' (1967:32).
The Salt Mine Valley Site (16 lB 23), the actual location
on the
island where evidence of early man Pleistocene vertebrate fossils became
apparent, seems to have been formed by a repeated process of stream valley
cutting and filling (Figure 6-12).

Following this reasoning, Mac-

Donald describes five types of pieces esqillea from Debert: 1) rectangular
(small wedge forms); 2) "pseudo-core&' (multiple coliar fractures resem-

blin, remnants of poljhedral or cylindrical flint cores from which lamellar
flakes were struck); 3) "pseudo-burma" (lack negative bulk characteristic

of true burma, thus believed to be incidental to bone-splitting function of
the artifact class); 4) on-end scrapers (resulting, again, from splitting use);
and 5) on-other artifacts. It should be noted that at Debert, both hasileLstones and anvil stones are associated with pieces esquilles.
While th. pvssibie splitting and grooving functions of the bipolar
artifacts frrm Salt Mine Valley were recognized, their classification rested
on the assu-ptjon tLat the basic forms were produced by direct haimserstone
blows directed to pebbles placed on anvil Stones.
This conclusion was based
not only on the occurrence of anvil stones and hammertones,
but also by experiments which

produced comparable forms.

Characteristics of the bipolar

types described from salt Mine Valley are illustrated in
Figures 6-15 and

There remains the poasibilit)? that the tvo assemblages

frcrs the valley are somewhat different in age.

An Alternative explanation is

that they represent d:ffferent activity areas that were more-or-less contempor-

aneous.
The pre-projeetile point component at Salt Mine Valley can be sumearized
as follows:

During phase 1 of the valley'. geological history, while the vall"y
was forming and the rock salt was

exposed1 wandering hunting-gathering peoples

left artifacts in stream and solution pit deposIts.

artifacts are bones of a diversified assemblage

Associated with these

of extinct Pleistocene verte-

brates. Whether these animals were killed at the site or killed elsewhere and

brought to the site has not

been

established1 but the latter explanation seems

most likely.
Following this, while Iron Mine Run was slowly filling the valiey

with sediment, artifacts and bones were again InDrporated within the deposits,
this timc along the margins of small streamo.
B.adiocarbon asys have tentatively fixed the pre-projectile component at approximately 12,000 years B.P.

Salt domes with surface expression may have provided attractive habi-

tats for early inhabitants of the region. It follows that submerged salt domes
on the continental

shelf should be regarded as h.gh-prohability areas for site

occurrence.

Additional evidence comes from Pit VI and the surface area to its northeast (Analysis Unft 2) where prepared cores and bladelets have been found
(Cagliano, 1967;51.-52) (Figure 6-23).

These artifacts have been classified as

cores with prepared striking platforms, cores with natural striking platfor-'is,

blocky cores, cortex flakes, flake, with -ltip1e scars, flake and scrapers,
flake side scrapers, and bif.icial artifacts.

During the 1969 excavations, several pits were excavated into the ridge
deposits of Salt

Mine Valley (see Fgures

6-13 and 6-44).

These ridges are be-

lieved to havc been formed during Phase 2 of the proposed .-z1tey sequence (ca.
11,000 - 8,000 B.?.) and are composed of stream-deposited sands and gravels.

Although no true projectile pointa were located in 9tratigrphic context, the similarity of the prepared core and bladelet artifacts to PaleoIndian tool assemblages from elsewhere warrants the inclusion of this corn-

ponent in that time franE. The projectile points from around Dt Vancets Ptnd

The geciogic context of the William. Gravel Pit finds and the morphu-

logic relationships of ite in the area are significant in the present
study. The overall setting is similar to the Miaion River drainage
in
Bee and Goliad Counties, Texas, as described by Sellards(;940) and
discussed previously.

Within what sight be called the present floodplain of the river,
there are actually two levels which indicate surfacci of 5trea deposition.
The upper level, or high floodplain is somewhat dissected, has a mederately well-developed soil profile, and is covered with water on'.y during
flood.

Several feet below this sigh floodplain is a level of active ard

abando.-ied point bars.

At first inspection, It might appear that the upper

3urfaee was formed during floodetage, and the sandy bars represent
at3ge features.
However, dpogjti by the river seldom exceeds the

height of tne highest river bar, and only clays are deposited above the
bar crests during flood. In the segment of the Mziite River under cn-

5idtration, the stream is still adjusting its gradient by downcuttirtg.
Act tv deposition is presettly restricted
to sandbars and channel deposits in rind below the low level.

In their studies of river systems, Wolman and Leopold (1957:105).
hpve found that a channel has an associated floodplain whether stable and
flowing on bedrocK, gradually eroding a valley, or gradually
depositing a

fill.

Furthermoi-e, when the aggraded

valley fill of a floodplain is

incised after it deposition, the original level becomes a terrace.
They define an alluvial terrace as . ...an abandoned floodplain whos
surface no longer bears the normal relationship to the stream be'
(1957:105).

The true terrace, by 18 definition, must flat be overtopped by the
annual flood. The upper floodplain of the middle Amite River area is
necasia.J.ly flooded, but does not "....bear the normal relationship to
240

the stream bed." The upper surface, then, might be interpreted as a

I

poorly-defined terrace. It is the deposits of this upper surface that
have yielded Archaic artifnct in the Williams Gravel Pit.
The slope relationships between the upper Level and the Prairie

terrare are such that the two surfaces merge imsdiately north

The gravel canaiats pr&Iciinantly of tan, brown, red, and

black chert of varying degrees of purity, with occasional quartzite pebbles
and small slabs of ferruginaus sandstone.

Extensive site areas are found on the Prairie terrace along the scarp
separating Prairie and R.cent floodplain surfaces, i.e., the Baywood Site.
A few middons, such as the Doyle site, have been found on abandoned point

bar ridges within the active floodplain. All of these site are associated
with gravel accumulations, the largest complexes being located on the

Prairi, surface near the junctions of tributary streams and the river val-

ley, i.e., the Bluff Creek Site, The occupants simply selected spots where
stream were actively eroding and depositing gravel., resulting in &
readily available supply of raw material for tools and weapons. The Bluff
Creek, Doyle,

and Baywood Sites typify the settlement patterns of the

Amite River Phase.

In one sense1 the middle Amjte River sites can be considered as quarries

who3e locations were dictated by the availability of stream gravel.

However1

the diversity of the artifact assemblage suggests a much brooder range of

activities and has led to the conclusion that the principal mites were at
least seasonally occupied and that during these periods, the occupants were

engageu in a full range of econonic and social activities largely unrelated
to the manufacture of stone tools

(Figure 6-29 and Figure 6-30).

Small, chipped, gouge-like tools often exilbiting polished bits are
now believed to have functioned as hoes or digging-stick tips and may have

been used

in "root

gathering" or "early agriculture

.

Distinctive pro-

jectile paint forms are indicative of specialized hunting activity.

Bifaci.il knives and blades are related to these activitis. Another Suggestion of at least semi-sedentary activities is the

occurrence of small,

low, circular earth mounds. The specific function of the mounds has
not been established. They are usually solitary, but
Sometimes in

pairs.

in addition to Arite River sites, there are other suggestions of a
Middle Archaic age for the introduction of mound building in the central
Gulf coast area.

The most important of thue is the Monte Sano Bayou

in southea.etern Louisiana (16 EBR 17).

Site

Here Haag, Ford, and Gagliano

(unpublished manuscript), in a salvage archeological project in 1967, es-

tablished that two large conical earth mounds located on an alluvial terrace at the valley escarpment of the Mississippi R.tver were mounds con-

structed over cremation platforms (Figure 6-31 and Figure 6-32).

A char-

coal sample from the cremation platform within one of the mounds yielded
a date of 6,220 B.P. Â± 140 years (4,240 B.C.).

occur

Poverty Point traits

at the site, including a stylized grasshopper bead of red jasper,

Poverty Point-type inicroflints, and the similarity in construction technique.. of the mounds with those at the Poverty PoinL Site. This casts some doubt

on the 'ialidity of this surprisingly early date for mound building.

[low-

ever, another relatively early date from the Bnana Bayou Mound (16 lB 24),
a .mall conical cremation mound on the Avery Island salt dome, gives some

credibility to the date. Charcoal from

the cremation plat farm within th

Banana Bayou Mound was dated at 4,440 B.P. + 260 years (2,490 B.C.),

ceptions, however

One of the ex-

is the Copell Site (16 VM 102), located in an orange

grove on Pecan Islatd, Louisiana (Figure 6-33).

This site was first brought

to the attention of archeologists through two short reports compiled by
Henry B. Collins (Collins, 1927; 1941).

Later, Ford and Quimby (1945)

gave considerable review to the site and its art ifactual assemblagt in
their report on the Tchefuncte Culture.

In this report1 Ford and Quimby

placed the Copell Site in the same cultural context as Tchefuncte.
They did recognize, though, that the laJc of pottery at Copeli. probably

meant the site was earlier than the typical Tohefuncte Culture ates.

In

1947, Martin, Quimby, and Collier placert the Copell Site in the Archaic
Period.

However, in later studies (Mclntire, 1958; Haag, 1961), Copell was

still considered as Tchefuncte, although some doubt was expressed.

the continually subsiding Louisiana marsh area.

Indeed, scattered Paleo-

Indian pothts have been reported from Pecan Island.

Since we are here concerned with the Late Archaic Copell Site, a trait

list may be in order as a sary of the artifacts collected by Collins and
tnalyzed by Ford and Quimby.

buried at the site.

The only description of the depth or area! extent of the site is that
the burials were unearthed from several feet below the ground eurfact.

One other interesting item associated with the burials was asphaltijm,
a commonly occurring item along the Texas coast. This may possibly il-

lustrate tiea to the west with the Aransaa Phase and other Archaic peoples
of th Texas coast.
Another Late Archaic Period site in the central Gulf area i the Cedarland Plantation Site (22
30), located near the mouth of the Pearl
River in Hancock County, Mississippi (Figure 6-34).

The site, located in 1957, is a semi-circular, stratified, oyster
shell and earth 'nidden (Figure 6-3), situated on a low bluff overlooking ti-ic
Pe.rl River estuary (Gagliano, 1963; Cagliano and Webb, 1970). Immediately across a swampy depression to the south-southeast of the site is

another Indian habitation locale, te Poverty Point-age Claiborue Site
(22 HC 35), which is discussed in the following
section.
The Cedarland midden

material, as illustrated in the cross-ge:tion in
Figure 6-35, is basically coosed of two strata.
The lower stratum is made
up "predominar.cly of oyster shell (Crassostrea virgirijca) with bones of small
animals1 deer, bear, fish and waterfowl, and with charcoal and artifacts
intermixed (rigure6-36). Remnants of small, clay-lined hearths (Figuie 6-37)

are scattered throughout the shell" (Gagliano and Webb, 1970:47).

The

upper sratu is a black, organic sand containing the remains of animals,
charcoal, artifacts, nd clay lusg. An increase in the nimibers ot

heartl.s

was also noticed in this upper

strat.

The artifacts recovered at Cedarland (Figure 6-38) became the basis far
defining the Late Archaic Pearl River Phase (Gaglano, 1963). Most coimion1y

ceurring artifacts and raw materials were marine shells, terrace and scream
gravel, ferruginous sandstDne, red jasper pebbles, limonite, orthoquartzite
from southern Alabama, pink and white iaeta-quartzite from Arkansas, sandstone

Bipolar cores are also reported from Archaic sites in Texas (Honea, 1965),

suggesting that this technique. identified with Paleo-tndian levels of
Avery Island, may have persisted for long periods or have been revived for
special purposes.

The burin-like forms on bipolar cores of the Avery Island

assemblage have not been identified at Cedarland.

Pr'int at the neighboring Claiborne Site will be considered in the following
section.

phenomena of North American Archeology, can be traced to an

The real importance of Poverty Point Culture un-

folded as a result of the excavations at the Jaketown Site in Mississippi
(Ford, Phillips, and Haag, 1955). followed by those at the Po'verty Point Site
(Ford and

ebb, 1956).
255

Although the Poverty

Point culture had been identified at the Jiketown,

Poverty Point, and other Bites in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, as late

as 1963, the earliest ectablished component in the Louisiana coastal area
was Tchefuncte.

Various researchers had postulated pre-Tehefuncte occupations,

but had no .substantial proof upon which to base this supposition. Ford
and Quimby (1945) reported Poverty Point Objects from the Tchefune Site
(16 ST 1), the Little Woods Middens (16 OR 1-5), and Big Qak laland (16 OR 6),

all basically Tchefimct Period (500 B.C. - 100 B.C.) sites.

They attributed

the presence of the objects to their being hold-overs incorporated in the
Tchefunrte cultural milieu.

Earlier, C. B. Moore, in his early reconnaissance surveys of the lower
valley's archeological. remains, reperted Poverty Point Objects from the Bayou
Sorrel Site (16 IV 4), the Schwing Site (16 IV 13), and the Miller Site
(16 SM 6) (Moore1 l9l3:l2-6).
In a 1963 article in American Antiquity, Gagliano sod Saucier reported
three new Poverty Point sit
two of which, Bayou Jasmine (16 SJB 2) and
Linsley (16 OR 40), hd beeu revealed by dredging operations. The third
site, Garcia (16 OR 34), had been recorded along a heavily wave-washed beach.

In that same year, the Pearl Liver Phase of the Late Archaic Period was reported (Gagliano, 1963).

Situated across a swampy area from the Cedarland

Site, the type site for the Pearl Rivcr Phase, was the Claiborne Site
(22 HC 35), a Poverty Point Period locale. In this section,
we will first
dici.&& the Claibarne Site and then Bayou Jasmine, Linsley, and Garcia.
The Claiborne Site (Figure 6-35) is located only about 45 si. from Cedarland.

The site itself is almost identical in shape and orientation to Cedarland,
containing a semi-circular midden deposi: of black earth and thelle. In
contr-zst to Cedarland, however, the dominant shellfish forming the midden
was the clam R.anRia cuneta. This suggests a de'liiie in the salinity of

t'e water in the Pearl Li-r's estuary from Late Archaic to P.verty Point
times.

The most con type of Po'erty Point Object was the melon-shaped

variety, followed in frequency by biconical types (Gagliano arid Webb1
1970:52).

This statistic, plus the counts on the other types

nf

objects

of Claiborne, shows a marked similarity to the percentages of various types
of objects from the Poverty Point Site (16
(16 OR 40), to be discussed below.

5) Itself and the Linsley Site

Only minor differences in size and color

and amount of sand present, show up among objects from the sites (Gagltano
and Webb, 1970:52-57).

Virtually the entire Poverty Point assemblage is represented, leading
to the c.nc1usion that Claiborne was a regional center participating fully

in the Poverty Point

trade network and cultural organizaricn (Gagliano and

Webb, 1970:57).

A small conical earth mound was also associated with the Claiborne
Site, 323 meters east of the midden, but was totally destroyed before any
data could be obtained from it.

Other artifacts and ecofacts deqcribed as being abundant at Claiborne
are animal bone, terrace and stream gravel, and Pontchartrain-type projectile points.

The population shifted from Cedarland to

Claihorne, for whatever reasons, with the advent of the incorporation of
the Poverty Point cultural milieu.

Further evb'ence of this shift in locales is seen in the :adocarbon
determinations.

A charcoal sample troti the upper level of the Ctdartand

nidden yielded a date of 3,190 B.P., while a charcoal from the base of the
Claihorne mLtdden was determined to be 3,100 years old (Gagliano and Webb,
970).

Thus, the shift occurred approximately 3,130 years ago.

Claiborne was nost likely the major trading or cerenlal center of the

area during Poverty Point times, while lesser satellite vill"es or special
activity sites were situated in the marsh and swai o the surrounding
coastal region. The Garcia, Bayou .lamine, and Lthsley Site were Just
such hca lea.

Recent excavations by Louisiana State

The discovery of himan fossil reisains and cxtinct Pleistocene fossils
in an old straa bed near Vero, Florida, (Sellards, 1916) represents a rae,

al' it cont-oversial, situation relative to Pleo-Indiar occupation in the
e.atern Gulf area. Geogripically. the Vero Site lies beyond the boundaries
of the Gulf coast study area, but its coastal setting and significance warrant
inclusion.

The construction of a drainage canal between Vero and Gifford, Florida,

in 1913 revealed the presence of vertebrate fossils in a cut through an old
stream bed (Figure 6-50). This cut displayed three zones of deposition, which
eventually wre given temporal estimates on the baaia of geological

Bed 2 also contained a thin, sharp-edged flint, a small worked spall, two
small epalla, and part of a bone implement, which may possibly have been
engraved.

The sharpness of the spall's edges helps to negate a theory of

water travel to explain their appearanee in the deposit, and since the closest
flint outcrop is 160 km northwest of the site, the original Fource has yet

slnkhjle,

approximqtely

73 m In diameter and averging about ' m i.. 'Ã¸pth

(Clausen, Brooks, and Vesolowaky, 1975:193).

At a depth of about 13 m, a small ledge rings most of the sinkhole
(Figure c-53). This ledge, ranging fros 1 to 6 m in width, was formed as
softer rock and clay naterj&le both above and below it eroded it away.

Along

the northern side of the spring, the ledge forms a relatively wide platform
upon which sediments and organic deposits

have accumulated.

Here it was pos-

sible to carefully examine the ledge's three sedimentary zones and excavite
the test pit.

These zones, 0.9 to 2 m in thickness, are described by Clausen,

3rooka, and Wesalowaky (l97596-7) as:
Zone 1 - An algal slime1 the stratigraphically superior
layer, ranges from 0.20 to 0.50 m in thickness. It is composed
of a soft, aqueous, br.ack. algal ooze with shells of the
small snails still prevalent in the spring, Heleobops docima
and Pyrogohorus olatyrhachis. The bones of alligator, tarpon,
and turre are oc..aaional.ly found in this layer.
Zone 2 - Calcitic mud, the middle layer, ranges in
thickness from 0.15 to 0.50 mn.
It is predominantly a gray1 unconsolidated calcitic silt.

layers of wall tufa represent periods of spalling. Snail

shells are comeon, especially Physa cuberse, Heieoboj8 docim.a

are those of frogs and nice. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal
from the upper and lower portions of this zone are 8,520 Â± 400

The Zone 3 deposit was 70 cm thick at

8,920 Â± 190 years, 9,350 Â± 190 years, and 9,20 Â± 180 years before present,
respectively.

The bottom radiocarbon date came from the 70 cm level of Zone

The tst pit was then estab-

Fished near the sinkhole's sloping wall and n'asured one meter by one-half
r'eter, a rather small pit, but one which yielded considerable data.

While preparing the area for systematic excavation, it was necessary
to

clear away a portion of Zone 3so an approach giving easy access to the actual
plc could be facilitated.

During this clearing process, at a depth of 25 cm

into Zone 3, a fragmentary left 1.lium of a human juvenile was discovered.

it was determined that th liu

A large portion of Florida Paleo-Indtan

The Fish Creek

therefore, the

assignment of age nu.st depend on the time spans asaumed for the

projectile point. Although habitation at the site persisted beyoni the
Paleo-Indjan Period into late pre-ceramic Archaic, Orang.-, and Transitional
Periods, its significance as a Paleo site is foremost iii this review.

also from deeper submarine oyster shell deposit, of Tampa Bay (Warren,

The material has been collected from shell piles

that were dredged from the submerged deposits.

The shell deposits themselves are huge; there ha. betn continuous dredging

No data are available regarding the specific settings of the upland
strean locale.. Most of the bay-margin finds have been made in situations
where old terraces around the inner bay shores ire eroding back.

The arti-

facts, winnowed out of eroding sites, are con1y found along the active
beach or in the t'hallow waters of the bay.
The

1te situatjon at back barrier sites is very similar tn that along

the inner bay shores.

Atifacte are usually exposed by erobion and found along
the beach or in th1. bay shallows (Figure 6-56). However, a distinction has
been made between the two types of settir.gs because of differences in origin1

age, and fauna of the geomorphic features upon which the sites may have been
located.

In spite of

This will be done

which combines the east and west Louisiana shelf areas and the related coastal zone (Volutne III, Plate 2).

This extensive near-sea-level area make. up the Late Quaternary detaic
plain of the ?tisisippj River snd ha resulted from deposition of river
sediment (Figure 7-1). The Miieissippl River Delta, like all deltas,

is a zone of interactioa between fluvial and marine procees

and

COflstjtute

one of thL nost dyi-'..aic situations in nature. The ha2ance
between the rates of sediment deposition and the combined

effects of
subsidence and erosion by the iea cause shorelines in deltas alternately to advance and retreat. Seaward growth occurs at the mouths

of active streams, whereas erosion results near the mouths of inactive
streams which no longer tra..sport sufficient sedime:it to sustain their
or advance seaward.

Delta building can be thou;bt of as a
contest between the river and sea. If the river deposits sediment

faster than the sea is able to remove it, new land i added to tI
shore and the delta builds Seaward (Figure 7-2). As the delta is extended, it gradually builds upward, or aggrades, by processes associated with lateral shifting of chann.sls, by sediment deposited during
overbank flooding

and by accumulation of plant and animal reraans

(Figure 7-3).

Deterioration of trie delta occurs if all or part of it
is deprived of the supply of river-borne sediment necessary for ite
cuntinud growth. This resu1cs in removal of the seaward edge by wave

attack and the settling or subsiding below sea level of the surface
(Coleim.an and Gag]iano, 1964; Frazier, 1976; Gagliano and 'an Beck, 1970).

In a low coastal plain where plant and animal counf.ties are

a method and theory that is particularly useful in the present study.
For this reason, natural processes and forms and related cultura, associations are considered in some depth.
Pie geomorphic and environmental framework of the delta exerts
stron, influence on 9uch things as settlement pattern and economy.

In

the coastal portion, the listribution of habitation sites is dictated by
the location of Gulf and lake beach ridges and Mississippi River natural

levees (Figure 7-5).

These features provide virtually all of the firm,
relatively high places suitable for even periodic occupancy.
Deltaic Plain
The deltaic plain consists mainly of near-sea-level lakes, former
stream courses, marshlands, and swamps.

The main streams which pre-

sently flow through this area are the Mississippi River arid its major
distributary, the Atchafalays River. The Mississippi flows across the
eastern side of the plain and discharges its sediments through several
active distributaries, forming the present bitdfoot delta.

When the river shifted eastward,

were formed.

The relict beach ridges, or cheniera, mark progressive

Thus, the oldest

one of the oldest beach-ridge

system than either the deltajc plain or th

ft

developed into an extensive basin area
as the deltaic plain prograded
seaward. The baste is dominated
by three large, shallow

fresh-to-

brackish lakes (Lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrajn
and Borgrie). These
lakes, along with boriering swamps and
marshes, lie between the natural

levee ridges of the modern Mississippi River
on the south and on the
Prairjc Terrace to the north. The Late Quaternary
history of the basin
is complex. Included in the
area are Pleistocene and
Carly Holucen

barrier-island complexes, old delta lobes of
the Mississippi River, and
complex estuarine areas of smaller streams
draining parts of the coastal

plain east of the

Missis8jj (i.e., the

Ainite, Tickfaw, tangipahoa,

Tchefuncte, and Pearl Rivers).

Alluvial Valley
The boundary of the Late Hc'locene deltaic
plain, which merges

inland with the alluvial plain of the
lower Mississippi Valley, is arbitrarily placed where the valley begins to wid
toward the Gulf of
Mexico.

Inland in Louisiana, the Late Holocene
alluvial valley is inised into Pleistocene terraces and Tertiary
material. These older surfaces heighten from near sea level at the
contact between the Prairie
Terrace and Late Holocene ccastal wetlands
to several hjndred feet in
the northern part of Louisiana.

The valley is occupied by active and relict
meander belts of the

Mississjpj and Red Ri"er.

Subsequent

events have tilt.d the Oii. de1t-a surface upward and re8ulted in its
drainage, so that it now s.ands as a terrace.

Geologiats have long regarded the Prairie Terrace and relict
features on its surface as Pleistocene in age (Fisk, 1944, 1956; Kolb
and 'ian I.optk, 1958; Bernard and Lelilanc,

1965, and others), with age

estimates of frow 80,000 to more than 100,000 years.

Wijile this concept

is deeply entre,ched in the geo.ogtcal literature, it is basically incompatible with archeological data and some newly developed geological

data. An alternate hypothesis is presented here in which relict fea-

ures ,n the Prairie surface are considered to ha'.e formed during Early

The area from the east wall of the Late Holocene alluvial valley
and nurthern rim of t1;. marginal basin of the Mississippi Delta

to Mobijp Bay in Alabama is divisibie into the Prairie Terrace unit
bounded Qfl the north by disserted and weathered Pleistocene Terracee
(Uplands).

The Prairie Terrace in Louisiana is relatively flat, but

does exhibit a number

of rather subtle relict features.

These

include

delta lobes of coastal plain streams (Amite, Tangipahoa, and Pearl

divers), relict beaches, and dunes derived from point bar sands of
coastal plain streams.

The Prairie terrace along the coast of Missisrippi i' dominated

by relict barrier islands and lagoons.

The Amite, Pearl, and Pasta-

goula RivÃ¸-s exhibit a

series of sub-Prairie alluvial terraces that have

been termed

and related to Early to Middle Holocene (Cagliano

Deweyville

and Thom, 1967).

Prehistoric Land Ue

The Indian chose the sanctuary of the natural levees, salt

domes,

cheniers, .nd beaches of the delta as the locations for his campsites
and villagos. While this area had its flsadvancages in the form of

and the constant threat of flooding, it balanced
these with several advantages. Perhaps the st important was the
ever-present inserts

abundant f'od supply provided by the natural landscape. The waters were

rich in fish, molluscs, and edible plants. Animals and fowl were plen-

tiful as well as fruits, berries, and nuts. This plentiful food supply
attracted man to this deltaic area for thousand of years. Physical evidence found in the numerous middens, mounds, and quarries attests to the
long, continuous sequence of hiims: occupation.

of these sites.

Since the thhabttants gleaned food from neighboring
environments, the
midden matrix eontaina a concentrated sample
- usually in a stratified

sequence - of environmental indicators (ecofacti), such as shell, bones
,f a wide variety of animals, seeds and pollen. Shells o the
brackish-water clam Rangia cuneata make up the greatest portion of the
midden material and attest to the importance
of these animals in the

economy of the coastal inhabitants. Crassoetrea and Unio are also
f ten found in the midden and reflect different environmental situations.
While the vast majority' of these coastal shell middens are les, than
,OOO years old, and thus by our earlier definition are to recent for

consideration in this Btudy, they are mentioned here to emphasize the
attractiveness of a deltaic environment to early peoples and because
they provide essertial models for prospecting for drowned sites on the
continental shelf.
Relationships between delta development and hwsan habitation
have now been extended back some 12,000 years in the coastal

Lcuisiaxia area (agliaro, Weinstein, and Burden, 1975). Although
many of the detaile are still very sketchy, the overall pattern

The old swamp .ed now stands elevated and drained on the terrate surface,

East of the major delta and meander belt was an enbayment (Vermilion

The importPnt

The cut-and-fill sequence of deposits related to local streams

At Tunica Bayou, for example, organic

The cut-arid-fill sequence at

sampling and testing drowned

Given the present state of rhe art of OCS cultural

resource nethodology arid underwater remote-sensing and diving technology,

the most effecttve sequent1al approach to prehistoric site discovery

seems

to be as follows:

Interpretation of relict landforns and relict systems from largescale bathymetry, identification

of high-probability areas from these bathy-

metric maps, interpretation of the age of the feature, and associated highprobability areas, development of

dels for site types

st li-.ly to be

associated with the high-probability ares.

Sampling and testing with rete-aensing techniques. This can be
done either through a specific research project in a specific area or through
the present OCS survey requirement. A hierachLcal or step approach to testing should be employed.

The first array of instruments at Step 1 should include small-scale bathymetry (fathometer), sub-bottom profile to 30 feet or
to define the upper 30 feet, and a drag sample or grab sample.

If this hrst-

step survey indicates an anomaly or probable site, Step 2 testing might include aide-scan sonar, bottom core or cores, additional grab samples and
drag samples.

St:ep 3 inspection would include tmderwater photography or

television viewing, box cre sampling, and/or direct inspect ion by divers.

The objectives would be:

1) study the bathymetry and available geological data at a scale and level

3) using remote-sensing techniques, systematically survey high-probability

Such a program should result in a significant imprcvement in defining

the survey requirements from the standpoints of both efficiency and effectiveness.

in addition, the fiscinating study of the prehistoric archeology of

the outer continental shelf would be advanced.
