ABSTRACT

Three borrow pit locations have been selected as sources for clay that will
be used to cover and reinforce Franklin County Dam which spans Big
Cypress Creek just upstream from the Titus/Franklin County boundary.
Two of the borrow pits are located in formerly farmed fields that have
been planted with coastal bermuda grass. The upper two to three meters of
the third borrow pit was previously mined and was not surveyed. An
intensive pedestrian survey of the other two borrow pits showed that the
upper 15-20 cm of topsoil had eroded away and that the top of the
underlying Bt-horizon was 5 to 30 cm below the present ground surface.
No evidence of historic or prehistoric occupation of the borrow pits was
found. We request that the Texas Historical Commission concur with our
recommendation that clearance be provided for the use of the borrow pit
sites without the need of additional cultural resource investigations. We
further recommend that if buried cultural materials older than 50 years are
encountered, work should stop in that area and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The Franklin County Water District is proposing to reinforce the downstream side of the
existing Franklin County Dam which spans the floodplain of Big Cypress Creek and
creates Cypress Springs Lake. The dam is situated just upstream from the Titus/Franklin
county boundary (Figure1). Reinforcing the dam will involve placing a thick layer of clay
on the present dam slope extending from the top of the embankment down to the existing
water level of Lake Bob Sandlin which abuts the toe of the Franklin County Dam. The
clay will be spread on the existing dam surface which was created when this earthen dam
was constructed more than thirty-five years ago. Installation of clay on the dam should
have no impact upon cultural resources which were recorded upstream before the dam
and lake were built. Three nearby borrow pit locations have been selected as the source of
the needed clay. An archaeological survey at that time (Hsu, Sciscenti, and Skinner 1969)
recorded seventeen prehistoric sites, most of which were found to be situated on the
creek-side edge of the upland at the elevation of 380’ msl. Subsequent survey of the Lake
Bob Sandlin area recorded sites at the elevation of 337’msl downstream from the Cypress
Springs Lake dam (Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1978; TASA 2007). Additional survey of the lake
edge was conducted by The University of Texas at Austin in the late-1970s and
subsequent survey has been done in conjunction with development around the lake edge
(Nelson and Perttula 2003, 2006; Todd 2007). As indicated above, archaeological sites,
principally prehistoric in age, have been recorded on elevations in the two lake areas but
primarily on ridges and terraces associated with the interface of the floodplain and the
adjacent upland. Only one site, 41FK48, has been recorded in the immediate vicinity of
the borrow pits. The site was recorded in 1975 and TASA lists no subsequent updates of
the site or any testing.
On January 29 and 30, 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the two unexcavated borrow pit sites. The archaeological survey
was conducted through Freese & Nichols, Inc. in Fort Worth which is doing the
environmental permitting. The scope of the project included a records review, a field
survey during which sites found were to be recorded and during which shovel testing was
to be carried out, and a final report.
The archaeological survey was done because the Franklin County Water District a
political subdivision of the State of Texas and the Texas Antiquities Code applies to such
agencies. This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for short reports
adopted by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.).

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The survey area is located in the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas (Diamond,
Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). Major timber trees are pine, oak, hickory, and sweet
gum. Other hardwood associations are found in low, wet bottomlands. Understory
vegetation includes green briar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, crape myrtle, dogwood, and
many other species.
The underlying geology is the undivided Wilcox Group which consists of silty and sandy
clay that contain ironstone deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1966).The Carrizo
Sand covers the upland to the south of the Big Cypress Creek valley. Quaternary
alluvium is confined to the Big Cypress Creek valley and its major tributaries on the
north and along Brushy Creek to the south. The terrain is gently rolling and the ridges
and valleys are rounded.
The soil association in the immediate project area is classified as the Bowie-CuthbertKirvin Soil Association which consists of gently sloping to steep, moderately well
drained and well drained sandy and loamy soils in timberlands (Roberts 1990: General
Soil Map). The specific soils in the study area consist of Bowie fine sandy loam with 2-5
percent slopes on the uplands where the borrow pits are located and Cuthbert fine sandy
loam with 8-25 percent slopes from the edge of Lake Bob Sandlin upslope to the edge of
the upland (Roberts 1990:Sheet 42). Bowie soils have a thin [4” thick] dark brown fine
sandy loam that grades into a yellowish brown E-horizon that averages seven inches thick
and rests on top of a yellowish brown (10YR5/4) sandy clay loam that is the Bt1 soil
(Roberts 1990:81). Mottles of red (2.5YR5/8) occur in the Bt1 horizon and increase in
abundance with depth. The southwestern borrow pit site is mapped by the Soil
Conservation Service as Udorthents soils where “The soil material has been stripped from
these areas to a depth of 2 to 20 feet. In most areas, none of the original soil remains
(Roberts 1990:49).” Consequently, this borrow pit is not likely to have any potential for
containing archaeological site deposits.

PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

Cultural resources studies have primarily been the result of lake construction, lignite
mining and community development. Archaeological investigations in the Cypress Creek
basin have been carried out at Lake O' The Pines, Lake Cypress Springs, Lake
Monticello, Lake Swanano, and Lake Bob Sandlin and have been summarized by
Thurmond (1990). The following culture history is derived from these sources.
The earliest occupation appears to have been by 10,000 B.C., based on the presence of
fluted Clovis and Folsom dart points. These and other finely crafted projectiles have been
recovered in numerous places but always on the surface of the ground or in mixed
contexts. They have yet to be discovered in a primary context in northeast Texas.
Aboriginal occupation continued through the successive centuries but the evidence is
scattered and more teasing than substantive before A.D. 1.
By about A.D. 700, pottery and arrow points were added to the Native American's set of
tools. These technological changes coincided with a gradual increase in population size.
Prehistoric Caddoan peoples are first recognized about A.D. 800. Some of these early
Caddoans occupied large villages which were located on major drainages, but small
dispersed settlements were also present throughout the region. The villages occasionally
contained low earthen mounds and usually consisted of several individual houses. The
economy was based on foods secured by hunting and gathering, although farming was
probably practiced by A. D. 1000.
About A.D. 1300, a shift in site location away from the major drainages and into the
headwaters of smaller tributaries resulted in the rearrangement of people into small but
numerous hamlets scattered throughout the upper Cypress Creek Watershed (Perttula
1995:342). Major villages continue to be located on the banks of the Red River in Texas
and Louisiana during this period. Farming was certainly important during this period,
and these people are recognized in the historic period.
In his evaluation of site locations in the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin, Thurmond (1990:
Figure 30 and 31) indicates a low density of prehistoric sites in upland areas and he goes
on to say (1990:220) that:
Again, archeological surveys in the Cypress basin have concentrated on
stream valleys in general, and particularly on the valleys of major
watercourses. Only during the Lake Monticello project were upland areas
surveyed, and even then not very intensively. Despite these biases, the
frequent occurrence of sites along smaller streams is indicated. One must
suspect that the occurrence of sites in upland areas may be higher than the
present data would indicate.

No doubt, occupation in the uplands, or collection of upland resources, may have left
some evidence in the upland areas (Perttula 1995:337). However, evidence of the
utilization of these areas has been poorly recorded although numerous surveys have been
conducted in these areas.
Native American groups were pushed out of the northeast Texas area by the mid-1800s
and Franklin County was organized soon after. The early settlers were largely individual
farmers who held small property holdings and supported themselves on a grain and
livestock economy. These subsistence farmers grew corn and vegetables at first and
cotton and wheat became more prominent over time. Commercial cotton production
began in the 1830s and cotton was shipped to the Gulf Coast through Jefferson until rail
lines replaced the water travel after the Civil War.
Previous Investigations
An archaeological survey at that time (Hsu, Sciscenti, and Skinner 1969) recorded
seventeen prehistoric sites, most of which were found to be situated on the creek-side
edge of the upland at the elevation of 380’ msl. Subsequent survey of the Lake Bob
Sandlin area recorded sites at the elevation of 337’msl downstream from the Cypress
Springs Lake dam (Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1978; TASA 2007). Additional survey of the lake
edge was conducted by The University of Texas at Austin in the late-1970s and
subsequent survey has been done in conjunction with development around the lake edge
(Nelson and Perttula 2003, 2006; Todd 2007). As indicated above, archaeological sites,
principally prehistoric in age, have been recorded on elevations in the two lake areas but
primarily on ridges and terraces associated with the interface of the floodplain and the
adjacent upland. Only one site, 41FK48, has been recorded in the immediate vicinity of
the borrow pits. The site was recorded in 1975 and TASA lists no subsequent updates of
the site or any testing.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Although reinforcing the dam should have no impact on known or unknown
archaeological sites, the areas of the three borrow pits have the potential of containing
preserved prehistoric archaeological site deposits. This needs to be tempered with the
realization that parts of these areas has been cleared as farmland in the past and
timber/brush removal as well as discing and plowing are likely to have disturbed
prehistoric sites deposits that have been buried by sand that has naturally moved
downslope (Roberts 1990:Sheet 42). Furthermore, site deposits are likely to be shallow
due to the natural A-horizon sandy loam that overlies the clay subsoil that is present less
than nine to eleven inches below the surface. This offers the potential of uncovering
burial shafts, midden deposits, outside pits and hearths, as well as house post holes that
were dug into the subsoil as has been shown in areas immediately surrounding Lake Bob
Sandlin (see Nelson and Perttula 2006 and Sullivan 1978). The western borrow pit
largely coincides with an existing pit mapped by the Soil Conservation Service.
With regard to prehistoric occupation of the area within the two undisturbed borrow pits,
it is predicted that Late Archaic or Caddoan residential sites may be present and would be
found to be located on the ends and crests of the ridges which overlook the Big Cypress
Creek floodplain or that overlook intermittent tributaries which drain into the creek.
Settings such as these are present in each of the borrow pits.
As this was a rural part of Franklin County when the dam was built and when Lake Bob
Sandlin was built, and since there were no significant roadways through the immediate
area until after the lakes were created and also because these areas were used as farmland
in the first half of the 1900s, it is postulated that historic residential sites will not be found
within the borrow pit sites. However, trash could have been dumped in these areas and
early 1900s or late 1800s residences could have been built in the area. Therefore survey
will need to consider these possibilities although timber clearing and field and pasture
creation are likely to have destroyed ephemeral evidence of occupation.
After conducting the records search, the pedestrian survey of each borrow pit area will be
done using parallel transects spaced 30-40 m apart. Particular attention will be given to
eroded areas and to slopes. The Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) recommends one
shovel tests per every two acres for survey areas over ten acres. Notes were taken of the
vegetation, terrain, soil and other relevant information as were photographs. No deep
testing was done due to the shallow depth to the subsoil.

RESULTS
Survey began with a pedestrian survey of each of the borrow pit sites and then the second
day the survey was conducted in further detail and shovel testing was conducted
primarily in those areas where it was expected that site deposits would occur. The
following discussion first describes the northern borrow pit site and then the slightly
larger central borrow pit site (Figure 2). Notes and a photograph of the southwestern
borrow pit conclude this description. Shovel tests are discussed specifically in the text
and their locations are plotted on Figure 8. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the
apparent lack of archaeology.

The northern borrow pit is situated on the crest and eastern slope of a north-south ridge
that overlooks the Big Cypress Creek floodplain. Site 41FK48 is reported to be located
near the edge of Lake Bob Sandlin northwest of the borrow pit but in a settling
significantly lower than the ridge that is encompassed by the borrow pit. The entire
borrow pit area, all 7 acres, has been planted in coastal bermuda grass and is used either
as a hay pasture [the northern part] or as a pasture where horses are kept (Figure 3). At
present, two horses are grazing the grass that is included in a rectangular area that
encompasses almost all of the borrow pit. The fenced pasture is roughly rectangular and
the northern fence spans the northern edge of the borrow pit leaving the northern
triangular area unfenced and where the majority of the shovel tests were placed on the
crest and slopes overlooking the creek. This northern triangular area is mowed almost as
short as the grazed pasture where the horses are kept. Ground visibility in the borrow pit
area averaged from ten to twenty percent and was augmented by several dozen rodent
burrows that are located on the ridge crest both north and south of the southern fence. No
artifacts were observed in any of the eroded areas within the borrow pit and this is an
important factor when it is pointed out that the several large red oak and one sweet gum
trees located in the borrow pit show the tops of their root spread for a distance of two to
three or more meters from the trunk base. No artifacts were found in these eroded areas
but small pieces of iron sandstone were found in these eroded areas and the field surface
around the root spread average 15-20 cm below the level of the top of the root spread.
This is a clear indication that 15-20 cm of topsoil has eroded away, probably due to
twentieth century farming. Because the small sandstone pieces are present, it is logical to
expect that artifacts in the form of lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, and pottery fragments

would also have been retained in these eroded areas where they would have been visible
during the survey.
Shovel tests 1-7 were excavated within the northern borrow pit area Table 1). A brown to
dark brown sandy loam A-horizon was present from the surface to depths that ranged
from 5 to 31 cm below the surface. This topsoil was loose and moist and in one unit had a
dark organic stain that extended to 11 cm. The humus layer has apparently eroded away
from the surface of the other six shovel tests. In all but one shovel test [#4] this sandy
loam rested on a red compact clay Bt-horizon that shovel testing showed was at least 10
to 15 cm thick and which augering indicated is part of the natural subsoil. While this
subsoil does not match with that described by the Soil Conservation Service, it is
apparent that it is undisturbed subsoil and that 15-20 cm or possibly more of the topsoil
has been eroded away. Because of these conditions, deep testing was not conducted and
was not warranted.
The central borrow pit area also coincides with a presently harvested coastal bermuda
field where dozens of rolled bails are present (Figures 4-7). The field is not grazed by
horses or by cows. The bails are from the most recent cutting and have been left in place
where they were bailed. The field is defined by a county road on the north and a private
road to the west. A constructed stock tank forms the eastern edge of the pit area and the

land to the south is largely overgrown with sweet gum trees that are twenty to thirty years
old. Three ridges overlook the stock tank and shovel testing was focused on these ridges.
Surface visibility was limited by the grass cover and a thin layer of water was resting on
field surface in the eastern half. This was an indication that the clay content in the top soil
was higher than in the northern borrow pit and/or that the clay subsoil was shallower and
that drainage was not as fast in the central borrow pit area. Like the northern borrow pit
site, no artifacts were noted on the surface and there is more sloping surface on the end
and sides of the three ridges. Also like the northern borrow pit area, the trees in central
borrow pit have exposed root balls and the surrounding pasture has been eroded to a
depth of 10 to 15 cm below the top of the tree roots. The A-horizon is slightly thinner
than in the northern borrow pit and the top of the Bt-horizon was encountered as
shallowly as 5 cm but more commonly between 11 and 15 cm and excavation was
extended to depths of 30-45 cm below the surface. No cultural materials were found in
either the A- or the Bt-horizons and deep testing in this upland setting was determined to
be unnecessary.
No shovel testing was done in the southwestern borrow pit site since the topsoil was
removed when it was first quarried. Pines are growing in part of this previously cleared
area (Figure 9) and there is no potential of finding sites in the exposed Wilcox Formation
sediments.

Figure 9.

In summary, no evidence of historic or prehistoric occupation in the three borrow pit sites
was found on the ground surface or buried in the shallow A-horizon soils that overlie the

sterile Bt-horizon. While it is apparent that erosion has removed up to twenty cm of the
topsoil based on the exposed tree roots, this same setting provides evidence that artifacts
should have been retained on the surface of the tree roots had they be present. The
absence of historic residences had been predicted during the development of the research
design and thus is confirmed by the survey. The absence of prehistoric sites is more of a
dilemma since sites have been found at similar elevation during survey of the Cypress
Springs Lake area. Likewise, sites have been found on both the north and south sides of
Lake Bob Sandlin as well as along the tributaries that flow into Lake Monticello. The
lack of sites in the two surveyed areas is attributed to the distance to a regular water
source and the presence of lower elevations that were closer to reliable water sources
without having to climb to the top of the ridges where the borrow pits are located.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and that the Franklin County
Water District be allowed to use the proposed borrow pit sites. It is our conclusion that
prehistoric site deposits will not be found during removal of the topsoil prior to
excavation of the clay subsoil. We further recommend that if buried cultural materials
older than 50 years are encountered, work should stop in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. Work should not
continue until discussions with the Texas Historical Commission have been concluded.
