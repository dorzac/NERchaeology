ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey on 24.28 hectares (60 acres) of property proposed for Egret Bay project in Galveston
County, Texas.
Field research activities included intensive pedestrian survey augmented by
mechanical deep testing. Intensive pedestrian survey investigations were conducted from
June 27 to June 29, 2005 and consisted of walkover, photo-documentation, and shovel testing
within the project area. Mechanical deep testing was conducted between September 9 and
12, 2005. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 71 shovel tests, and 5 test
trenches, in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas.
During this investigation, cultural materials associated with one previously
unrecorded prehistoric archaeological site were observed within the project area. Site
41GV157 is a subsurface site, consisting of a light scatter of 14 chert flakes recovered at
depths of 10 to 35 centimeters (3.9 to 13.78 inches) from the A/AB horizons of an Edna loam
soil. The site is approximately 0.1 hectares (0.3 acres) in size and situated at the confluence
of a small unnamed stream and Robinsons Bayou.
Many of the artifacts show signs of water abrasion and appear to be in secondary
context and mixed with alluvial gravels. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered during
survey. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that the site does not have the potential to yield
information important to an understanding of prehistory in the area, and is not eligible for
inclusion on the National Register. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further
archaeological work be required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
Artifacts will be temporarily stored at the Houston office of HRA Gray & Pape.
Following the completion of this project, it is anticipated that all artifacts will be returned to
the landowners.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of
Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) to perform an intensive cultural resources survey on
24.28 hectares (60 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a marina along
Robinson Bayou and a residential development in Galveston County, Texas (Figure 1).
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the project would
affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within
the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE).
All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the
Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA])
guidelines.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area is situated in a heavily wooded tract of land that is bounded to
the north by an unnamed canal, to the west by Egret Bay Boulevard, to the south by a
property line, and to the east by Robinson Bayou. The property is bisected by a pipeline
that runs east/west from the juncture of the unnamed canal and Egret Bay Boulevard to
the property line near Robinson Bayou; a two-track gravel road is situated in the western
half of the tract. Current plans call for the construction of a marina along Robinson
Bayou and a residential development situated adjacent to Egret Bay Boulevard.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT
This report is organized into seven numbered chapters. Chapter I provides an
overview of the project. Chapter II presents an overview of the environmental setting
and geomorphology of the project areas. Chapter III presents a discussion of the cultural
context associated with the region. Chapter IV discusses the results of previous
archaeological and architectural surveys near the project areas. Chapter V presents the
research design and field methods developed for this survey. The results of research and
survey activities are presented in Chapter VI. Chapter VII presents the investigation
summary and conclusions.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological
characteristics found in Galveston County. This is followed by discussions of soil
morphology, climate, and floral and faunal species typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain
is characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The
Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far
west as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological
characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Galveston
County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea
level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and
subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s
rivers. Galveston County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and
unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Pleistocene to the Holocene
(Crenwelge et al. 1988:101; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott
2001; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human
occupation in modern-day Galveston County include the Beaumont Formation, generally
believed to predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called “Deweyville”
terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These
terraces date to between one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are
characterized as consisting “of up to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the
presence of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of
fluvial action and discharge markedly greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16).
Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in
the Galveston County area by alluvial or eolian factors, or potentially, marshy
environments.
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these “Deweyville” formations are completely buried by
Holocene sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces
that are situated between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have
been relatively elevated and dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by
aggrading overbank deposits (Abbot 2001: 16). Given their physical characteristics, the
“Deweyville” terraces may have been attractive loci for human occupation during the

4

Holocene. While primary “Deweyville” deposits have a low potential for archaeological
remains, the age of these formations are not clearly established. Therefore, the possibility
for buried archaeological remains exists within portions of the “Deweyville” formation
(Abbot 2001: 106).

SOILS
The vicinity of proposed project area contains soils mapped as consisting entirely
of Edna fine sandy loam (Ed). Descriptions are taken from Crenwelge et al. (1988:16,
82-83,sheet 2). Edna fine sandy loam (Ed) consists of nearly level, poorly drained,
nonsaline, loamy soil with a clayey subsoil that is typically found in association with
uplands. This soil typically exhibits A-Btg1-Btg2-BC horizonation. The A-horizon is
typically composed of dark gray fine sandy loam that extends to a depth of approximately
20.32 centimeters (8 inches) below the surface. This is underlain by a subsoil composed
of two moderately dense to dense clay Btg horizons that extend to a depth of 1.54 meters
(60 inches). The upper Btg horizon consists of gray clay to a depth of 66.04 centimeters
(26 inches), while the lowest, which is 48.26 centimeters (19 inches) thick, is composed
of light gray clay. The underlying BC horizon consists of light brownish gray clay
(Crenwelge et al. 1988:82-83; SSS NRCS USDA 2005).
Crenwelge, et al. (1988:102-103) in their discussion of the origin of Galveston
County soils, indicate that Edna soils in northern Galveston County typically top relict
meander ridges associated with deltaic facies of the late Pleistocene paleo-Brazos River,
which is locally represented by the Beaumont formation. They also note that the
“loamy surfaces [of Edna soils underlain by clayey substrates]... can be the result
of Pleistocene age crevasse splays or breakthroughs of floodwaters from meander
ridges, or they can be the result of subsequent wind and sheet flow transport from
the higher, more loamy areas (Crenwelge, et al. 1988:102).”
Aronow (2005) also discusses the Edna series in the context of the development
of undrained depressions, or “bagols” (Holland, et al. 1952:62-64, cited in Aronow
2005:13) in ridge and swale, and pimple mound-intermound topography. Bagols are
shallow, undrained depressions, filled with silty and loamy materials. They occur 15 to
62 centimeters (6 to 24 inches) below surface on soils capping Pleistocene age Lissie,
Willis, and Beaumont formation surfaces. Aronow (2005:12) notes that bagols are
widely distributed on the Lissie and Willis surfaces but are only common on sandy and
loamy soils on meander ridges in the Beaumont formation.
In the Edna series these undrained depressions can range in size from 15 to 30
centimeters (6 to 12 inches) and be as small as 3 to 6 meters (10 to 20 feet) in width
(Geib and Bushnell 1928:1452, cited in Aronow 2005:12-13). Bagols as large as 50 (164
feet) to 250 meters (820 feet) in diameter or maximum length have been reported
elsewhere (Aronow 2005:12). According to Aronow (2005:12-13) bagols were common
features of the land surface prior to the early 1900s and many are visible on older contour

5

maps of Harris and surrounding counties. Many bagols were obliterated by historic and
modern land alteration activities associated with agricultural practices. Their origin in
the study region as elsewhere is poorly understood, but as with pimple mounds, it appears
to be a function of a mixture of fluvial and eolian processes acting on Pleistocene age
Beaumont landscapes (Aronow 2005:12-13).
In this pedogenic context the probability of detecting deep subsurface cultural
materials in the Edna Btg and BC horizons is exteremely low. This is because the dense
clayey subsoil horizons of the Edna series in Galveston County apparently formed by
weathering of Beaumont formation sediments of Pleistocene age. It is also highly likely
that near-surface Holocene-age loamy soil horizons developed in bagols may contain
cultural materials, but that such materials are likely to be in secondary context, derived
from local weathering of higher landscape surfaces by wind and sheet flow processes.

CLIMATE
Galveston County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Summers are hot and humid;
winters are warm and only occasionally experience incursions of polar air from the
north.. The average daily temperature in the summer is 83 degrees (Fahrenheit) with an
average winter temperature of 47 degrees (Fahrenheit). Rainfall is highest in the summer
and early fall with an average yearly total of 100.9 centimeters (39.73 inches) (Crenwelge
et al. 1988).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Present-day Galveston County is located near the western edge of the
Austroriparian biotic province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods
subregion of the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from
pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the
area may have been populated by vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather
environment. Climactic fluxuation during the Holocene would eventually result in a
gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple,
and pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually
transition to an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time
would include currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller
game, as well as bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American
alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a
diverse collection of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern
land alteration activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the

6

removal of native plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak,
pecan, various elms, cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle,
dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses
(Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel,
opossum, raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles
including the Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species.
Black bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The upper Texas coast is viewed by many researchers as a buffer zone between
cultural regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as
being an interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along
similar lines, both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic
archaeological record of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to
literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture
found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74) states, “it loosely connotes activities by
populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the southeastern
Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric archaeology of Southeast Texas
represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Researchers have identified six archaeological time periods associated with
Native Americans in what Perttula (2004:figure 1.1) calls the southeast Texas
archeological region, which includes Galveston County (Hall 1981; Patterson 1995;
Perttula, ed. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). In general, these include the Paleoindian,
Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1995) chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,0008000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle
Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and
the Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a
Southeast Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D.
400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750).
Perttula (2004:table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004:figure 6.1.1) provide a recent chronology for
the Upper Texas Coast that is also applicable to the Project area and includes Early
Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-6000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500-200 B.C.);
Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 7001250), Final Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Early Historic (A.D. 1700-1800) periods.

8

All of the chronologies developed by these researchers are based primarily on
changes in projectile point technologies, and the introduction of pottery to the region.
Despite their differences, it is also generally recognized by all these researchers that a
broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods up to
and during early European contact in southeast Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
The Island of Galveston, for which the county is named, was first encountered by
Europeans when Juan de Grijavla made landfall on the island in 1519. Various early
explorers knew the island as Isla de Malado, the “Isle of Misfortune” or the Isla de
Culebras, the “Isle of Snakes.” It is thought that the Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca, as a member of the Narvárez expedition in 1528, was shipwrecked on
the island. In 1685, the French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, sought
to challenge the Spanish for control of the area. He is credited with naming the island
“San Louis” in honor of Louis XIV of France. In 1783, José Antonio de Evia, a Spanish
navigator, surveyed the waters near the island and named the bay Galvezton after Viceroy
Bernardo de Gálvez. The island was known as San Luis for a time, but by 1820 had
become known as Galveston Island (Daniels 2005; McComb 1986).
The year 1815 marked the beginning of the Anglo-American presence in the area.
Henry Perry and Warren D. C. Hall, former members of the Gutiérrez-Magee expedition,
made landfall on the peninsula north of the island with three ships and 200 men. Perry
named the point for Simón Bolívar, who had commissioned him to disrupt Spanish
commerce in the Gulf. In 1817, Laffite established a fort on the island he named
Campeche, after a town on the Yucatan peninsula. The fort was destroyed by a storm a
year later, but by 1819 the settlement had a population between 1,000 to 2,000 people
(Daniels 2005).
Under Spanish rule population growth continued at a slow pace. After the Texas
revolution, an increase in the flow of commerce through the port consolidated the island’s
importance as a finance and trade hub. The port shipped cotton and cottonseed oil, as
well as cattle, sugar, and other locally produced commodities (McComb 1986).
Galveston County was founded in 1838 from portions of Harrisburg, Liberty, and
Brazoria counties. When Texas joined the union Galveston was the largest city in the
state. By the Civil War, however, the city of Houston had begun to overshadow
Galveston as a port of entry for shipping and as a manufacturing center. By 1880, the
county of Galveston had population of approximately 24,100 and the city was still the
largest in the state (Kleiner 2005).
The hurricane of 1900 dramatically altered the course of development in the
county. It was the most costly natural disaster in terms of lives lost in U.S. history and
resulted in the deaths of between 10,000 and 12,000 people on the island. In spite of this,
the county continued to flourish until the Great Depression. This decline lasted until the

9

1970’s when preservation efforts were undertaken to revitalize historic portions of the
island (McComb 1986).
Much of the current commercial activity in the county is associated with the
petrochemical industry, although tourism, medical services, and waterborne commerce
are also important to the area (Kleiner 2005).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A brief overview of selected research projects conducted in close proximity to the
study area is presented below. The results of the background investigation regarding the
presence of cultural resources near the current project area are presented in Chapter VI.
The University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, assessed potential flood control impacts to cultural resources located along
Clear Creek (McGuff and Cox 1973). The survey identified 76 prehistoric and 2 historic
sites. It was determined that 51 prehistoric and 1 historic site could be adversely affected
by proposed flood control modifications. The prehistoric sites were situated within two
specific loci and as such were deemed to represent a type of site density not previously
observed in the area. Recommendations were made for the avoidance of these resources
and plans for the mitigation of these sites were proposed in the event avoidance was not
possible.
Moore Archaeological Consulting (Mahoney and Moore 1998) conducted a data
recovery at site 41HR817 on Clear Creek. This site was originally identified and
recorded based upon prehistoric lithic material observed during a cultural resource survey
for a proposed detention basin. Six backhoe trenches and five 1 x 1 m (3 x 3 feet) test
units were excavated. These revealed no intact significant cultural deposits, therefore, no
further cultural resources investigations were recommended for this site.
Moore Archeological Consulting (Beck et al. 2000) conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey of a 60-acre tract within the impact area of a proposed Clear Creek
Independent School District facility in northern Galveston County, Texas. The entire
study area was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey and 48 systematically placed
shovel tests were excavated. No previously unidentified cultural resources were located
during this survey. No further cultural resource investigations were recommended.
Excavations were conducted by Prewitt and Associates (Hines 1993) in a portion
of site 41GV53, situated on a knoll along a meander bend in Clear Creek, in Galveston
County, Texas. Field efforts concentrated on the documentation of the profiles of six
backhoe trenches and the recovery of human remains from four burial features located in
the uppermost Ceramic-period components of a shell midden.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This cultural resources survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess effects
to cultural resources impacted by construction activities initiated by this project.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The project area is situated on 24.28 hectares (60 acres) of land proposed for the
construction of a marina along Robinson Bayou. Activities associated with this undertaking
will consist of the construction of a marina facility. The archaeological survey project area
is defined as all property within the proposed project boundaries.
A key factor in creating a strategy for sampling a project area is in developing a
predictive model whereby testing can be concentrated most efficiently in areas with the
greatest potential for containing intact cultural resources. These models are based on soil
and topographic characteristics, including variations in elevation, distance to existing or
remnant water sources, and plant communities. Generally, these include areas located near
existing watercourses. These models serve as heuristic devices that assists researchers in
devising sampling strategies best suited for collecting data in given environmental settings.
The predictive model developed for this project area, as well as the results of previous
studies, indicated that the entire area held a low potential for containing intact cultural
resources.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site file
research was performed in order to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites
within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of the project areas, and all recorded historic structures
eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent to the project APE. Site file research was used
to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey, and additional documentary
research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development and
history of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research
then was used to prepare an overview history of the area, and provided an understanding
of the contextual framework of Galveston County’s prehistory and history.

METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and

12

historic, within the defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the
collection of data needed in order to determine whether additional investigations would
be required to evaluate the potential eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for
inclusion on the NRHP or as a state designated landmark.
Archaeological methods employed during this survey consisted of pedestrian
survey augmented by systematic shovel testing. In areas where surface visibility allowed
for an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a
surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at the location
of each planned shovel test.
Shovel tests were placed at intervals that ranged between 30 to 200 meters (98.43
to 656.2 feet). Shovel testing intervals were decreased in areas deemed to possess a high
probability for cultural resources. Areas of moderate to low probability were sampled at
a lower frequency. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing standing water
Linear transects were utilized to facilitate survey activities within the limits of the
entire project area. These transects were spaced at 30 meter (98.43 foot) intervals. Shovel
testing was performed on all transects situated within high and moderate probability
areas. In low probability areas, shovel testing was performed on alternating transects
only; pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted on those transects not sampled by shovel
testing.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) into the underlying substratum
or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through
1
/4-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (1994) soil color charts. Additional information concerning
soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each excavation.
At the recommendation of the THC deep testing was also conducted in the project
area. Deep testing was conducted in order to provide data on the presence or absence of
deeply buried cultural deposits within the project area. Five trenches were excavated in
the project area. The trenches measured 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) by 1 meter (3.28 feet) and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 1.82 meters (6.0 feet), which is the approximate
depth of the water table.
Every trench excavated to depths of 120 centimeters (4 feet) or greater was
evaluated by a Competent Person and classified as OSHA Class A, B or C. This was
done to determine if trenches could be safely entered for inspection. Samples of backfill
from trenches were either hand screened if sandy or loamy, or hand sifted if clay. During
excavation, the walls and floors of the trenches were monitored for signs of artifacts and
features after each approximately 10-centimeter (4-inch) “slice” of the backhoe’s bladed
bucket. The floor and walls of trenches were cleaned with shovels and trowels, and
inspected for the presence of changes in soil color or texture potentially related to the
presence of cultural features. One wall of each trench was profiled.

CURATION
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored at the
Houston office of HRA Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is
anticipated that all artifacts will be provided to the landowners. If curation in a state
repository is required, artifacts will be prepared for curation according to guidelines
specified by the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology
and Historic Preservation (1983).
At the completion of fieldwork, the artifacts were appropriately cleaned and
allowed to dry. After identification, each unique artifact or group were placed in 4 mil
plastic reclosable bags. Identification tags made from acid-free paper were placed with
the artifacts for future identification. Each tag contains the title of the final report, the
HRA Gray & Pape project number, an individual artifact number, full provenience
information, entire artifact description, processing date, and count.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No previously recorded sites or National Register properties are located within the
project APE. No newly identified archaeological sites were encountered during survey.
The results of the site file research are discussed in the following section, followed by a
discussion of the results of the cultural resources field investigation.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all
recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all
recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the
project’s APE.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
Site file research indicated that 10 previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area (Table 1). Of these, 3
are prehistoric campsites, 5 are prehistoric middens, 1 is a sandy pimple mound, and 1 is
an historic home site.
Site 41GV10, also known as Spanish Moss Site, is a large Rangia shell midden
and campsite. The presence of two pimple mounds and a stratified shell midden make
this a site of particular interest. The site “appears to contain a high potential for
establishing a close relationship through chronological controls of (humate dates, shell
dating, diagnostics) the deposits in the shell midden and pimple mounds (Bailey 1987a).”
A total of three previous investigations have been conducted, using shovel tests, profile
excavations, backhoe tests, auger tests, and test pits. A variety of ceramic sherds and
faunal remains were found, most at depths of less than 20 centimeters (8 inches). The
Rangia shell midden can be found at a depth of 30 to 92 centimeters (1 to 3 feet),
beginning 8 to 13 centimeters (3 to 5 inches) below the surface. Radiocarbon dating
conducted in 1968 by Hester and Corbin (1968) dates this site to roughly 500 BC (+/- 70)
and AD 1210 (+/- 70), dating its occupation to the Late Archaic and Late Ceramic time
periods. The site is severely threatened by erosion, and previous investigators have
suggested mitigation and further testing (Hester and Corbin 1968; Howard et al. 1983;
Bailey 1987a).
Site 41GV19 is a Prehistoric-Ceramic Rangia midden containing two shell lenses
at depths of 1 to 5 centimeters (0.4 to 5 inches) and 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches).

No prehistoric artifacts were found. A variety of ceramic sherds and faunal
remains were noted at unspecified depths (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1984).
Site 41GV53 is a stratified shell midden similar to Site 41GV10. Based on C-14
dating, the site’s occupation has been dated to the pre-ceramic and late prehistoric time
periods (Bailey 1987b). Though the site has been greatly disturbed by the construction of
FM 270, it still yields an impressive amount of artifacts (approximately 2424), including
both lithics and ceramics. Test pits and backhoe trench excavations also recovered
preserved bone, burned shell, clay, and concretions at depths ranging from 10 to 90
centimeters (4 to 35 inches). Mitigation and protection have been recommended by
previous investigators (Bailey 1987b; Mercado-Allinger and Howard 1983; Hudson and
McGuff 1973).
Site 41GV76 is an undisturbed Ceramic site of great significance. In a previous
investigation of this pimple mound, a single shovel test yielded sherds, bone, and Rangia
shell 30 to 45 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) below the surface. “Avoidance is highly
recommended for this site because of its high information yield potential, seemingly from
its apparent intactness, and the uncommon composition (Rangia shell layer) (MercadoAllinger et al. 1983).
Site 41GV77 is a sandy pimple mound with unspecified temporal affiliation. No
information is available for this site.

16

Site 41GV78 is a shell midden of unknown temporal affiliation. A pedestrian
survey in 1984 by Joe Denton yielded no cultural materials. The midden itself was
observed in a road cut and is roughly 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the surface.
Denton notes the possibility that this could be residual from the construction of FM 270
and has only tentatively classified it as a shell midden (Denton 1984).
Site 41GV82 is an aboriginal habitation or campsite (Late Prehistoric) containing
Historic materials. The site, which includes a Rangia shell midden, is very clearly visible
along the shoreline of Clear Creek. Shovel tests yielded aboriginal ceramics and faunal
remains, as well as historic glass, ceramics, crockery, and brick fragments at depths up to
15 centimeters (6 inches). Further testing has been suggested to determine the
significance of this site (Good 1985).
Site 41GV91 is a Late Ceramic campsite/shell midden. Hand excavation and
mechanical trench testing yielded ceramic sherds, chipped stone artifacts (including
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points), faunal remains, historic artifacts, and concretions.
These artifacts were located at 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) below the surface. A
thin shell layer is noted between 20 and 35 centimeters (8 and 14 inches). This site has
been determined ineligible for NRHP (Stokes 1986; Kibler 1992).
Site 41GV100 is an open campsite of unspecified temporal affiliation.
additional information is available for this site.

No

Site 41GV149 is a Historic home built in 1913. The W.G. and Helen Hall Home
occupies ten acres of land and is owned by the City of League City. Walter and Helen
Hall were significant figures in League City’s history. They were prominent bank
owners who greatly influenced public policy during the New Deal era and the Civil
Rights movement. Because this home has been altered significantly as recently as the
1980s, it is likely that this site is ineligible for NRHP. None of these sites are within the
proposed project area (McWilliams 2004).
Is should also be noted that most of the prehistoric sites previously detected near
the project area including 41GV10, 41GV76, 41GV77, 41GV82, 41GV91 and 41GV100
(see Figure 1) were detected in surface or near-surface contexts along Clear Creek.
Depths of cultural materials at these sites varied between 0 and 0.46 meters (0 and 18.11
inches). Several others including 41GV53 (see below) and 41GV78 were detected in and
near marshes associated with the Clear Creek drainage system (see Figure 1). These sites
were also shallow with depths of cultural materials ranging between 10 and 90
centimeters (4 and 36 inches). Site 41GV53 had the deepest cultural resources of all of
the sites within the study radius, at depths up to 90 centimeters (36 inches) depth. No
sites previously detected in Edna series soils (see Crenwelge, et al. 1988:sheet 2) were
deeper than half a meter, (19 inches) which is to be expected given the dense nature and
Pleistocene age of the clayey substrates of Edna soils in Galveston County (c.f.
Crenwelge, et al. 1988:102-103).

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Intensive pedestrian survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact
that construction processes might have on cultural resources located within the proposed
commercial development construction area. The project area was divided into 2 survey
areas (Area A and Area B) to facilitate data collection (Figure 2).

SURVEY AREA A
Survey Area A covered approximately 8.1 hectares (20 acres). It encompassed all
of the area between the pipeline and Robinson Bayou (Plate 1). A total of 36 shovel tests
were excavated along 15 survey transects. A typical shovel test, as represented by Shovel
Test IB1, displayed a soil profile consisting of a surface layer of gray (10YR 5/1) fine
sand underlain by a stratum of gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand with yellowish brown (10Y
5/6) sandy clay. This was followed by a layer of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay
mottled with gray (10YR 5/1) clay (see Figure 2). All shovel tests were negative for
cultural material.
SURVEY AREA B
Survey Area B covered approximately 16.19 hectares (40 acres). It encompassed
all of the area between the pipeline and Egret Bay Boulevard (Plate 2). A total of 19
shovel tests were excavated along 10 survey transects. Shovel tests profiles observed in
the area were the same as those seen in Area A (see Figure 2). All shovel tests placed
along transects were negative for cultural material.

RESULTS OF DEEP TESTING
Deep testing consisted of the excavation of five trenches in the western portion of
Area A, which lies closest to Robinson Bayou (see Figure 2). The purpose of excavating
all 5 trenches was to detect deeply buried cultural materials and to determine the depth at
which pre-Holocene sediments of the Beaumont formation underlay the Edna series soils
mapped in the project area (cf. Crenwelge, et al. 1988:16,82-83,sheet 2; SSS NRCS
USDA 2005). Three trenches (Trenches 1, 2, and 4) were placed on the tread of the
terrace along the left bank of Robinson Bayou. Two others (Trenches 1 and 5) were
placed west of Robinson Bayou along the left and right banks of an unnamed tributary
drainage that dissects the terrace landform along the west bank of Robinson Bayou.
The area around all five of the trenches was covered in live oak with a dense
understory of yaupon and grasses. The dense understory was cleared with a backhoe
prior to excavation of the trenches. The clearing process was monitored by an
archaeologist, and the entire surface of the cleared areas around trenches was inspected
for artifacts using close interval pedestrian survey methods.

DEEP TEST TRENCH 1
Deep Test Trench 1 was oriented east-west and was placed approximately 25
meters (82 feet) west of Robinson Bayou near the northeast edge of the APE in Area A
(see Figure 2). The trench was approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1-meter (3.0
feet) wide. It was excavated to a depth of 1.82 meters (6.0 feet), which was 62centimeters (2.0 feet) into the Pleistocene alluvium underlying the soils (Figure 3). The
trench was classified as OSHA Class A for safety purposes and entered for inspection.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile.
The soil strata in the trench profile are very similar in structure and composition
to the description of the type section for Edna fine sandy loam (Ed) soils (cf. Crenwelge,
et al. 1988:82-83; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The main difference is that the BC horizon
is sandier than is typical for the County type section for this soil series, and likely formed
in a sandier facies of the Beaumont formation.

DEEP TEST TRENCH 2
Deep Test Trench 2 was oriented east-west and was placed approximately 25
meters (82 feet) west of Robinson Bayou near the summit of the nose slope formed at the
convergence of the left bank of the unnamed tributary stream and the left bank of
Robinson Bayou at the confluence of the two streams (see Figure 2). The trench was
approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1 meter (3 feet) wide. It was excavated to a
depth of 1.01 meters (3.1 feet), which reached the surface of the Pleistocene alluvium
underlying the soils (see Figure 3). The trench was classified as OSHA Class A for
safety purposes and entered for inspection. Samples of backfill were hand sifted, and the
soil was monitored for signs of artifacts and features after each thin 10-centimeter (4inch) “slice” of the backhoe’s bladed bucket.
No evidence of cultural features was identified during trenching; however,
cultural materials were detected during trench wall scraping for profiling and column
sampling to assess soil structure. A single piece of chert debitage was discovered at the
base of the A-horizon at a depth of 22 centimeters (8 inches). Due to the discovery of
debitage, the column was expanded into a shovel test labeled Shovel Test 0N0W (see
Figure 3), and the process of site delineation was started (see Figure 2). The site
(41GV157) is described in a separate section below.
The soil strata in the trench profile are very similar in structure and composition
to the description of the type section for Edna fine sandy loam (Ed) soils, and unlike
Trench 1, the Edna BC-horizon observed in this trench was more typical for the
Galveston County type section for this soil series. (cf. Crenwelge, et al. 1988:82-83).

DEEP TEST TRENCH 3
Deep Test Trench 3 was oriented east-west and was placed approximately 35
meters (115 feet) north of the unnamed tributary of Robinson Bayou and approximately
100 meters (328.1 feet) west of the eastern APE boundary in Area A (see Figure 2). The
trench was approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1 meter (3 feet) wide. It was
excavated to a depth of 0.65 meters (2.1 feet) (see Figure 3). The trench was less than 1.2
meters (4 feet) deep and did not need to be classified for safety purposes prior to entry for
inspection.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile.
The upper soil strata in the trench profile and the surrounding area around Trench
3 (see Figure 3) appear to represent A and Bw-horizons, respectively, that developed on a
sand sheet. The Bw-horizon is mottled as the Edna Btg2 (cf. Crenwelge, et al. 1988:8283) and may represent a sandier (swale) setting of Beaumont parent material. The 2BC
horizon observed in Trench 3 is similar in all respects to the Edna BC-horizon (cf.
Crenwelge, et al. 1988:16,82-83,102-103; SSS NRCS USDA 2005) observed in Trench
2, and proved highly difficult to excavate, even with the backhoe’s a bladed bucket.

DEEP TEST TRENCH 4
Deep Test Trench 4 was oriented east-west and was placed approximately 25
meters (82 feet) west of Robinson Bayou near the summit of the nose slope formed at the
convergence of the right bank of the unnamed tributary stream and the left bank of
Robinson Bayou at the confluence of the two streams (see Figure 2). The trench was
approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1 meter (3 feet) wide. It was excavated to a
depth of 1.80 meters (6.1 feet) (see Figure 3). The trench was classified as OSHA Class
C for safety purposes and not entered for inspection after it reached 120 centimeters (4
feet) in depth.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile.
The A, Btg1 and Btg2-horizons observed in the trench profile are very similar in
structure and composition to the description of the type section for Edna fine sandy loam
(Ed) soils. However, the underlying 2C-horizon observed in this trench was more typical

23

of some Edna series pedons reported outside Galveston County for this soil series (cf.
SSS NRCS USDA 2005). It most likely represents Pleistocene alluvium in a Beaumont
landscape paleochannel, and was very uniform in texture, very friable, wet, and prone to
collapse, hence the OSHA Class C rating for the trench.

DEEP TEST TRENCH 5
Deep Test Trench 5 was oriented north-south and was placed approximately 100
meters (328 feet) west of Robinson Bayou near the summit of a low ridge in ridge and
swale topography near the southeast boundary of the project. The trench was
approximately 5 meters (16 feet) long, and 1 meter (3 feet) wide. It was excavated to a
depth of 1.05 meters (3.1 feet) (see Figure 3). The trench was classified as OSHA Class
C for safety purposes and not entered for inspection after it reached 120 centimeters (4
feet) in depth.
No prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were encountered during
archaeological investigations in the trench, nor was any evidence of cultural features
identified during trenching or in the trench profile.
The A-horizon observed in the trench profile across the unit, and underlying soil
strata along the northern half of the trench, are very similar in structure and composition
to the description of the type section for Edna fine sandy loam (Ed) soils in Galveston
County (cf. Crenwelge, et al. 1988:82-83). However, the southern half of the trench
profile along all three trench walls revealed portions of what appears to be the edge of a
wedge-shaped bagol, thickening to the south. The bagol appears to have been originally
filled with uniform fine silt loam sediment classified as a Bt horizon. The Bt-horizon
exhibits many characteristics of Edna Bt-horizons including 5% FeO mottles (cf.
Crenwelge, et al. 1988:16,82-83; SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The BC horizon lining the
base of the bagol was composed of ferruginous clay that was penetrated with the bladed
bucket of the Backhoe to reveal a lower Edna Btg2-horizon. Immediately under the
Btg2-horizon throughout the trench was a very hard Edna BC-horizon similar to that
enconuntered in Trench 2. The BC-horizon proved highly difficult to excavate, even
with the backhoe’s bladed bucket, and limited the depth of trench excavation to
approximately 105 centimeters (41 inches).

NEWLY IDENTIFIED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
41GV157 (Figure 4) is a prehistoric site of unknown age measuring
approximately 35 x 35 meters (115 x 115 feet). The site was identified on the basis of
subsurface remains detected during preparation of the north sidewall of Trench 2 for soil
analysis and profiling. The discovery of a single flake of chert in the north sidewall of
Trench 2 at a depth of 22 centimeters (8.7 inches), led to the excavation of Shovel Test
0N0W which was placed into the north central sidewall of the trench. A series of 16
radial shovel tests were excavated around this shovel test to delineate the site.

41GV157 was not detected during shovel testing along Transects I and II in Area A,
because the shovel tests along these transects (which helped delineate the site as if they
were negative radial) straddled the site boundary (see Figure 2).
The site is situated on the tread of a low terrace along the left bank of Robinson’s
Bayou north of its confluence with an unnamed tributary stream (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
The eastern and southern boundaries of the site are formed by the sloping banks of the
two streams, which form a riser to the terrace and exhibit greater than 20% slope. The
sloping banks appear to be frequently flooded, as is evident from flotsam (plastic bottles
and styrofoam) littering the wooded surface of the stream banks. The north and west
boundaries of the site were identified on the basis of the excavation of two consecutive
negative shovel tests in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests (see Figure 4).
No cultural features were detected in association with the site, and it appears to be
restricted to a depth of 15 to 35 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) below surface. Artifacts
were only recovered from loamy portions of the basal A/AB horizon of the Edna fine
sandy loam. Artifacts were recovered from six of the 16 radial shovel tests excavated to
delineate the site boundary, and included a total of 14 chert flakes (Table 2).

Many of these artifacts were mixed with fine to medium gravels in the shovel
tests, and nearly all of the artifacts exhibited signs of abrasion. This was most likely from
being rolled in sandy sediment. For example, three chert flakes, a naturally fractured
medium pebble, and a water worn tabular natural chert flake were found at approximately
the same level in the AB-horizon in Shovel Test 0N0W. Abrasion of artifacts and
association with natural gravels may indicate that the artifacts are in a secondary context,
derived from alluvial or other erosional processes.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on 24.28 hectares (60 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a
marina in Galveston County, Texas. Property associated with this project has been
heavily impacted by activities associated with pipeline, transmission line, and canal
construction.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current project area.
Previously recorded archaeological sites were not identified within the project area.
However, 10 previously identified archaeological sites (41GV10, 41GV19, 41GV53,
41GV76, 41GV77, 41GV78, 41GV82, 41GV91, 41GV100, 41GV149) were recorded
within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. These resources are not located within
the current project’s APE, and will not be affected by construction.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, shovel testing and
photo-documentation. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 71 shovel
tests in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 15 to 100
centimeters (5.9 to 39.37 inches). In addition, a series of five test trenches were
excavated in the eastern portions of the project area along Robinson’s Bayou and a
tributary. The test trenches supported evidence from other archaeological sites in the
region, and from County soil reports (cf. Crenwelge et al. 1988) that indicate the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in Edna series soils in Galveston County is close to the
surface, and accessible by conventional shovel testing methods.
During this investigation, cultural remains (41GV157) were located within the
project area. However, these consisted of a light lithic scatter composed solely of 14
chert flakes scattered over a 1,225 square meter (13,190 square foot) area. These artifacts
are water worn and in many instances were mixed with natural gravels of approximately
the same size. This suggests that they are in secondary context, possibly derived from
erosion of archaeological sites upstream.
Because of lack of integrity and the low number of artifacts, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion on the National Register. No further
work is recommended at this site.
