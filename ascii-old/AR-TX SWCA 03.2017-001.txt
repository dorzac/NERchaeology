Road, Harris County, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of the Harris County Engineering Department, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of proposed improvements along West Road from Katy
Hockley Cutoff to Peek Road, in western Harris County, Texas. The project consists of the widening,
reconfiguration, and new construction of roadway between the intersection of Katy Hockley and Katy
Hockley Cutoff roads, east to an intersection with Peek Road (“project area”). The entire project area
encompasses approximately 43.3 acres. Construction impacts are expected to be limited to a 100-foot-wide
corridor centered on the existing road network, and will likely extend to a depth of 1 and 3 feet below the
surface.
As designed, the majority of the proposed project area crosses through a Harris County-owned tract that
has been previously surveyed and permitted in association with the proposed John Paul’s Landing Park. As
such, SWCA prepared a scope of work for the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Galveston District to conduct an archaeological survey of two areas along
the proposed alignment, a total of approximately 7.7 acres (“survey area”) that was not previously surveyed
for cultural resources.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit
(USACE File No. SWG-2016-01018) in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325,
Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007)
and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and
its implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. As the project area is owned by a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7869.
The background review did not identify any previously recorded cultural resources within or immediately
adjacent to the project area. The current investigation, including the excavation of a total of 35 shovel tests,
did not find any cultural resources within the survey area.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C; Section 106 of the NHPA; 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1); and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties
within the proposed project area. As no such properties were identified, SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigation of the project area, and that the project be allowed to proceed. Records
associated with this project will be curated with the University of Texas at Austin - Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Harris County Engineering Department, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of proposed improvements along West Road from Katy
Hockley Cutoff to Peek Road project (“project”). The goal of the work was to locate all prehistoric and
historic archaeological sites in the investigated project area, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries
as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) for any site recorded.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit (USACE File No. SWG-2016-01018) in accordance with 33 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures
for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated
April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
(16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. As the project area is
owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying
Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 7869.
SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review in addition to an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing to identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within those portions of the project area that have not been
previously surveyed for cultural resources. All investigations were conducted in accordance with the
standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) minimum
archaeological survey standards for such projects.
Todd L. Butler served as Principal Investigator and Project Manager. The report was prepared by Todd
McLeod. Todd McLeod and Jordan Daem conducted the field survey on December 28, 2016. Geographic
information systems (GIS) support was provided and report graphics were prepared by GIS Specialist
Colleen Kennedy.

Project Area Description
The project area is within and directly adjacent to the right-of-way of Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley
Cutoff roads, or along an unnamed road running between Katy Hockley Road and State Highway 99. The
project and survey areas are depicted on the Warren Lake, Texas U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5minute topographic quadrangle map (Figure 1).
The entire project area encompasses approximately 43.3 acres. The proposed construction activities consist
of the widening, reconfiguration, and new construction of roadway between the intersection of Katy
Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff roads, east to an intersection with Peek Road. Construction impacts will
be limited to a 100-foot-wide corridor centered on the existing road network, and will likely extend between
1 and 3 feet below the surface.
As designed, the majority of the proposed project area crosses through a Harris County-owned tract that
has been previously surveyed and permitted in association with the proposed John Paul’s Landing Park. As
such, SWCA prepared a scope of work for the THC and the USACE Galveston District to conduct an
archaeological survey of two areas along the proposed alignment, a total of approximately 7.7 acres
(“survey area”) that was not previously surveyed for cultural resources.

Road, Harris County, Texas

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Located in western Harris County, the proposed project area is surrounded by generally rural land. The area
southwest of the intersection of Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff roads has been converted into a
large recreational area with trails, baseball diamonds, and cricket pitches. Some mining activity has
occurred in the tracts north of the project area, but the area is generally covered by pasture land, row crop,
and rice agricultural land.

Physiographic Region
The project area is located in western Harris County within the coastal plains of the Northern Humid Gulf
Coastal Prairies ecotone (Griffith et al. 2007). This region consists of a relatively flat strip of land generally
50- to 90-miles wide, adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. The principal distinguishing characteristics of the
area are its relatively flat topography and mainly grassland potential natural vegetation. Soils are typically
wet because of poor drainage that results from clay subsoils and low relief. A high percentage of the region
is utilized as cropland for rice, grain sorghum, cotton, and soybeans (Griffith et al. 2007). In addition, urban
and industrial land uses are expanding in the region and oil and gas production is very common.

Geology
According to the Geological Atlas of Texas (Barnes 1982), the study area is situated within the Pleistoceneaged Lissie Formation. The Lissie Formation is composed mostly of clays, sands, and silts derived from
fine-grained alluvial deposits, including meander belts, over bank deposits, and channel deposits. In
general, the surface topography is nearly level, although the surface is sometimes pockmarked by shallow
depressions and small, natural pimple mounds (Barnes 1982). Stream channels may be entrenched up to
several meters below the surrounding ground surface (USGS 2016).

Houston PALM
According to Abbott’s (2001) Houston PALM, a guide to archaeological potential related to
geomorphology in the Harris County area, the project area is located in Map Unit 4. Briefly, Map Unit 4 is
characterized by stable, Pleistocene landforms or landscapes heavily impacted by urban development.
Abbott argues that these areas have little potential for deeply buried cultural deposits or intact surface
deposits and that no archaeological survey is necessary in these areas (Abbott 2001:156). According to the
Houston PALM, the mapped soils in the project area have a low potential for intact or deeply buried
archaeological sites (Abbott 2001).

Soils
Soil survey data obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Web Soil Survey (NRCS
2016) for Harris County was used to identify soils within the project area. According to the NRCS, the
project area is situated wholly upon Katy series soils. Katy soils are very deep, moderately well drained,
moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments on coastal prairies. Slope ranges
from 0 to 3 percent (NRCS 2016).

Flora and Fauna
The historical vegetation of the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies consisted primarily of tallgrass
grasslands spotted with oak mottes. The dominant grassland species were a mixture of little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum
plicatulum), gulf muhly (Muhlenbergia capillaris), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).
The northern portion of the region intermingles with the vegetation of bordering regions consisting of post
oak (Quercus stellata) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). From the floodplain forests in the north, the riparian
vegetation transitions southward to be dominated by pecan (Carya illinoensis), sugar hackberry (Celtis
laevigata), ash (Fraxinus spp.), southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia)
(Griffith et al. 2007).
The faunal diversity of the region is described by Griffith et al. (2007) to have historically included bison
(Bison bison), pronghorn (Antilocarpa americano), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Red
wolves (Canis rufus) and a wide variety of birds and waterfowl, including the Attwater’s prairie chicken
(Tympanuchus cupido attwateri), were common.

METHODOLOGY
Background Review
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review of the
proposed project area, as well as a 1-mile radius around the project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed
the corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), a restricted online database, for any previously recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric sites
located in or near the project area. Site files, relevant maps, NRHP properties, State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL) listings, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys were
also examined. Listings on TASA are limited to projects under purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas
or the NHPA of 1966. Therefore, all work conducted in the area may not be available. The Texas Historic
Sites Overlay (Foster et al. 2006), aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology Maps, and the NRCS
Web Soil Survey were also examined for historical and environmental information related to the project
area.

Field Methods
The scope of the current field effort was targeted to investigate segments of the project area that had not
been previously surveyed for the presence of cultural resources. The archaeological investigation of the
survey area was designed to be of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible,
significance of any cultural resources located within these areas. As a result, an intensive pedestrian survey
with systematic shovel testing was conducted within these segments of the overall project area.
The survey met all THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects. The field survey
consisted of two archaeologists walking one transect within a 100-foot-wide survey corridor.
During the survey, the archaeologists examined the ground surface and eroded profiles for cultural
resources. This examination included pedestrian survey with shovel testing within the survey area. THC
survey standards call for transect intervals of 100 feet (30 m) with a minimum of 16 shovel tests excavated
per mile along each transect. Shovel test units were excavated at 50-m intervals throughout the survey area.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth, to culturally
sterile deposits, or to the anticipated depth of disturbance for the project, whichever came first. The matrix
was screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted using a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver, and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms.

RESULTS
Background Review
The background review identified five previously conducted surveys within 1 mile of the project area, two
of which are located within or immediately adjacent to (within 100 feet) the current project area (Figure 2;
Table 1). Four of the five projects were conducted for the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD).
The fifth project surveyed the right-of-way for the newly constructed Grand Parkway (State Highway 99).
Projects were conducted for a number of different purposes, including transportation, recreation, and
drainage. A single archaeological site was identified as the result of the cultural resources survey projects
(41HR1002, see below), and consequently, one of the five surveys was conducted in order to evaluate the
eligibility of that site for the NRHP.

Only one previously recorded cultural resource has been recorded within a 1-mile radius of the proposed
project area (see Figure 2). Site 41HR1002 was identified during cultural resources survey of the proposed
John Paul’s Landing Park, conducted in 2005 (Garcia-Herreros and Pokluda 2007). The site was initially
identified through the presence of a small number of pieces of chert debitage along with a possible charcoal
lens beneath the plow zone of the site. During testing, four test units were placed within the site, excavating
down to a depth of 60 to 70 cmbs, recovering a total of 29 pieces of chert debitage. No features were
identified during testing, and the site was eventually determined to be not eligible for the NRHP (GarciaHerreros and Pokluda 2007; THC 2016). The site is approximately 0.99 mile from the proposed project
area and would not be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
A review of historical maps and aerial imagery indicated that the proposed project area was largely rural
until the late twentieth century. Based on USGS topographic maps dating back to 1915 and aerial
photographs dating to 1944, no historic structures were located within the immediate footprint of the project
area (USGS 1915; Nationwide Environmental Title Research [NETR] 2016; Google Earth 2016). The
nearest recorded structure on the 1915 USGS map was 0.54 mile west of the project area.
Aerial photographs of the project area, dating to 1944, appear to show the project area covered in
agricultural fields (NETR 2016). Based on the faint lines that cross the fields, these appear to be rice fields,
the cultivation of which results in significant ground disturbance. The 1953 and 1964 aerial photographs of
the area show the area continued to be rural without new construction (NETR 2016).

A 1970 aerial photograph and 1971 topographic map of the project area show at least three new structures
in the surrounding area, but do not show any structures within the footprint of the project area (USGS 1971;
NETR 2016). The structures include a house located approximately 0.22 mile west of the intersection of
Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff roads. At least two unoccupied ancillary structures were also built
approximately 50 feet south of the southern boundary of the proposed John Paul’s Landing Park, 0.48 mile
east of the intersection of Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff roads. A 1989 aerial photograph of the
project area shows that these same structures had been removed/destroyed sometime between 1981 and
1989 (Google Earth 2016; NETR 2016). These structures were located outside the proposed project area
and would not be impacted by the proposed undertaking.

Field Investigation
An intensive archaeological investigation was conducted within the survey area on December 28, 2016.
The investigation was conducted in two separate locales which were situated outside of areas previously
surveyed for cultural materials. These two locales were named Segment A and Segment B.
In total, 35 shovel tests were excavated. Four additional shovel tests were attempted, but could not be
excavated as a result of extensive disturbances. The results for shovel tests are presented in Appendix A.
No cultural resources were identified during the completion of the current investigation. A discussion of
the field investigation follows.

Segment A
Segment A is comprised of the area surrounding the intersection of Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff
Roads. This accounted for 6.511 acres, or approximately 84 percent of the total surveyed area (Figure 3).
In addition, this section was subdivided into four separate quadrants (NW, NE, SE, and SW) of the road
intersection. Each quadrant differed in terms of the general environment, such as vegetation and/or soils.
Observations and the results collected within Segment A are presented below.
The northwest quadrant of Segment A (Figure 4) is located on the north side of Katy Hockley Road and on
the western side of Katy Hockley Cutoff Road. The environment consisted of an overgrown pasture that
now contains very tall pasture grasses and scrub/shrub overgrowth. Soils were relatively deep fine sandy
loams over a sandy clay substrate. Nine shovel tests were excavated within this area; all were negative for
cultural materials.
The northeast quadrant of Segment A (Figure 5) is located on the north side of Katy Hockley Road and on
the eastern side of Katy Hockley Cutoff Road. Since space was limited for shovel testing outside of road
right-of-way, a single transect of shovel tests was positioned just east of the property boundary. As a result,
the majority of the excavated shovel tests in this locale were situated in either a drainage ditch or on a
pushed up berm adjacent to the ditch. A telephone pole right-of-way intersected this area, as well. A very
high degree of disturbances associated from road and utility line construction was observed in the excavated
shovel test units. Four shovel tests were excavated in the northeast quadrant; all were negative for cultural
materials.
The southeast quadrant of Segment A (Figure 6.) is located on the south side of Katy Hockley Road and on
the eastern side of Katy Hockley Cutoff Road. This parcel of land was being utilized as a cattle pasture, and
therefore, the environment was primarily very tall pasture grasses and dense scrub shrub tree species along
the fenced property boundary. Soils were observed to be moderately deep fine sandy loams over a sandy
clay substrate. A substantial amount of surface water from pasture runoff was also observed in the area.
Nine shovel tests were excavated within this area; all were negative for cultural materials.

Figure 6. Overview of Segment A, near Shovel Test 13, facing west.

The southwest quadrant of Segment A (Figure 7) is located on the south side of Katy Hockley Road and on
the western side of Katy Hockley Cutoff Road. This parcel of land has been developed into Paul D. Rushing
Park. The vegetation was primarily very well-manicured San Augustine grass, as well as a row of mature
oak trees along Katy Hockley Road. The survey area in this quadrant did not extend much past the roadside
drainage ditch, which also contains a telephone pole right-of-way. In general, the soils consisted of a very
disturbed fine sandy loam/sandy clay mixture. Nine shovel tests were recorded in this quadrant; all were
negative for cultural materials.
No cultural materials or features were identified on the surface of Segment A. In total, 32 shovel tests were
recorded within Segment A and all were negative for cultural materials.

Segment B
Segment B is situated on the south side of an unnamed road running between Katy Hockley Road and State
Highway 99, approximately 1.8 miles east of the intersection of Katy Hockley and Katy Hockley Cutoff
Roads (Figure 8 and Figure 9). This segment is comprised of 1.2 acres and accounts for approximately 16
percent of the total area surveyed for this project. The vast majority of this segment runs along the south
side of a fenced property boundary. The survey area is primarily located between the fence and an east/west
running drainage ditch. In addition, there was a low spot containing a large area of standing water on the
eastern end of the segment. Vegetation observed at this location was primarily pasture grass species. Soils
were mostly fine sandy loams over a mottled sandy clay substrate. Standing water in the vicinity contributed
to saturated soils observed in the shovel tests.
No cultural materials were identified on the surface in Segment B. In total, 7 shovel tests were recorded
within Segment B; all were negative for cultural materials.

A small portion of Segment B extended north across the existing haul road, currently being used by heavy
equipment trucks to transport gravel or backfill (Figure 10). As a result, one shovel test was located in an extremely
disturbed context adjacent to the haul road and, therefore, not excavated.

Intensive Archaeological Survey of Proposed Improvements along West Road from Katy Hockley Cutoff to Peek
Road, Harris County, Texas

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of the Harris County Engineering Department, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of proposed improvements along West Road from Katy Hockley Cutoff to Peek Road, in western
Harris County, Texas. SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review of the
entire project area and intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of approximately 7.7 acres of project
area not previously surveyed.
The background review did not identify any previously recorded cultural resources within or immediately
adjacent to the project area. The current investigation, including the excavation of a total of 35 shovel tests,
did not find any cultural resources within the survey area.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C; Section 106 of the NHPA; 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1); and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties
within the proposed project area. As no such properties were identified, SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigation of the project area, and that the project be allowed to proceed.
