ABSTRACT
In October and December 2017, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey of 38 acres split between 13 small tracts of land on privately
owned properties in northwest Starr County, Texas. The areas surveyed are where roads may
be constructed through potentially jurisdictional ephemeral drainages in support of ranching
and hunting operations. The survey resulted in the identification of nine previously unrecorded
Native American archeological sites characterized by sparse to abundant scatters of chipped
stone artifacts, occasional ground or battered stone artifacts, and occasional burned rocks.
The sites consist of two open campsites and associated lithic procurement localities (41SR448
and 41SR455), four lithic procurement localities that might have been used occasionally as
campsites (41SR447, 41SR449, 41SR452, and 41SR454), and three lithic procurement localities
with no evidence of sustained human habitation (41SR450, 41SR451, and 41SR453). Temporally
diagnostic artifacts identified at 41SR448 and 41SR455 date from the Middle to Late Archaic
periods, and possible tool preforms observed at 41SR451 and 41SR454 may indicate the presence
of Early to Middle Archaic components at those sites. No temporally diagnostic artifacts
were identified at the five other sites. All nine sites lack the capacity to yield important new
information and are considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
under Criterion D.
A total of five temporally or functionally diagnostic chipped stone artifacts and one
ground stone artifact were collected from 41SR448, 41SR454, and 41SR455. These will either
be returned to the property owner upon notification and request or will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin pending landowner
consent. The records generated by the project are curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a Phase I archeological survey conducted
for Energy Renewal Partners, L.L.C., on private property in northwest Starr County,
Texas, about 32 km southeast of the city of Zapata. The 38 acres surveyed are split
between 13 small tracts of land on tributaries east and west of U.S. Highway 83,
along and south of the Starr–Zapata County line (Figure 1). The specific survey
areas range from 2.6 to 4.7 acres in size. The project area is on a gently undulating
upland plain and encompasses segments of small-order intermittent tributaries and
shallow valleys characterized by nearly level to gently sloping surfaces. The areas
surveyed are where roads may be constructed through potentially jurisdictional
ephemeral drainages in support of ranching and hunting operations. The work was
done as part of documentation for compliance with a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Nationwide Permit.
Fieldwork done on October 24–26 and December 11–13, 2017, resulted in
the identification and documentation of nine new Native American archeological
sites consisting of two open campsites and associated lithic procurement localities
(41SR448 and 41SR455), four lithic procurement localities that might have been
used occasionally as campsites (41SR447, 41SR449, 41SR452, and 41SR454), and
three lithic procurement localities with no evidence of sustained human habitation
(41SR450, 41SR451, and 41SR453). Middle to Late Archaic bifaces were recovered
or observed at 41SR448 and 41SR455, and possible preforms of a specific diagnostic
tool type that dates broadly from the late Paleoindian to Middle Archaic periods
were observed at 41SR451 and 41SR454; no temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed at the other sites. The character and condition of the archeological deposits
at these nine sites indicate they have little to no potential to yield important
information, and all are considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. This project did not have a component entailing documentation of
non-archeological historic resources (i.e., buildings, structures, or objects), and no
such resources were identified in the project survey areas.
Specific construction plans are not yet available, but it is anticipated that
no excavation will take place as part of the proposed road crossings. Disturbances
to drainages resulting in fill will be minimized to the extent practical, and all
disturbance areas will be less than 0.1 acre. For the purposes of this investigation,
the horizontal area of potential effects consists of 38 acres split between 13 survey
areas that encompass 21 proposed crossing locations.
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Starr County is near the south end of the West Gulf Coastal Plain section
of the Coastal Plains physiographic province of the United States (Fenneman 1938,
1946). The county is on the Rio Grande embayment, a broad structural feature in
the southern portion of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain where the bedrock geology is
composed of stacked and tilted beds of Tertiary and Quaternary deposits that dip
southeast and become progressively younger toward the Gulf (Baker 1995; Fisher
et al. 1970; Trowbridge 1932). The primary geologic deposits mapped across Starr

County date from the middle Eocene to Pliocene epochs. These older sediments
are overlain by discrete to broad lag deposits of Rio Grande and Uvalde gravels,
Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits, bands of Holocene alluvium along primary
and secondary tributaries, and Holocene sand dune and sand sheet deposits in the
northeast part of the county (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976). The project area
is in northwest Starr County, along a north-south interface between two Tertiaryage geologic deposits: older Yegua Formation deposits on the west and undivided
Jackson Group deposits on the east. The Yegua Formation is composed of mostly
well-laminated, bentonitic sandy clay with minor beds of fine-grained quartzitic
sandstone, some concretionary limestone beds, and lenses of fossilized oyster shell.
Lignite lentils, beds of fine-grained chert, volcanic ash, slicified tuff, and silicified
wood may also be present. Undivided Jackson Group deposits in and around the
project area are part of an ancient strandplain-barrier bar system derived from the
southwestward drift of sands from the Fayette fluvial-delta system once centered
on the central and eastern Texas portions of the Gulf Basin (Fisher et al. 1970).
Jackson Group deposits are composed of sandy, calcareous clay with fine- to coarsegrained, sometimes fossiliferous sandstones, abundant silicified wood, some beds of
white volcanic ash, and common dark limestone concretions (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1976; U.S. Geological Survey 2017a, 2017b). Thin bands of much younger
Holocene alluvium are mapped along a tributary of Arroyo del Chiquita in Survey
Area 2 (crossings EC-08, RC-06 and RC-13) and along Del Puerto Creek in Survey
Area 3 (crossings EC-11, EC-12, and RC-09).
The project area is on the southwestern edge of a long narrow topographic
subdivision described as the Aguilares Plain by Trowbridge (1932:21). Most of the
plain is bordered by the Rio Grande breaks on the west and the Bordas scarp on the
east. The breaks of the Rio Grande encompass an irregular, 1–15-mile-wide strip of
land east of the river that is dissected by the valleys of its tributaries. The typically
north-south Bordas scarp or cuesta is a series of table-like hills on the western edge
of the Goliad Formation that separates the Aguilares and Hebbronville Plains. The
scarp slopes steeply westward from its crest, which stands 60 to 70 ft above the
Aguilares Plain.
The Aguilares Plain is characterized by gently undulating surfaces that
slope southward and eastward to the Gulf, and topographic relief seldom varies by
as much as 100 ft within a square mile. Surfaces are broken by shallow, sometimes
wide upland valleys formed by the upper reaches of intermittent tributaries that are
topographically distinct from the dissected tributary valleys that cross the breaks
to the west. All of the tributaries on the Aguilares Plain drain into the Rio Grande
(Trowbridge 1932).
Surface elevations on the properties that encompass the survey areas vary
from ca. 370 to 550 ft, with the highest elevations along a northwest-southeast rise
about 3.6 km northeast of U.S. Highway 83 that may mark the interface between
the Yegua and Jackson Group formations. All of the tributaries observed during
survey were dry, and all that are mapped on topographic quadrangles are depicted
as intermittent. Investigated streams include the upper reaches Del Puerto Creek
and tributaries of the following: Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita (n = 3), Arroyo la Minita

4

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
(n = 3), Los Barrosos Creek (n = 4), Saramente Creek (n = 1), and Medio Creek (n =
1). The tributaries of Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita and Medio Creek drain to the north
or west; all of the other listed streams drain to the south or east (U.S. Geological
Survey 1965a, 1965b, 1993). The closest point along the Rio Grande (now under
Falcon Reservoir) is about 6.5 km west of the project area, and the closest point
along the reservoir is about 3 km to the west-southwest.
The following soils are mapped within the various survey areas: Catarina
clay association with 0–5 percent slopes, Copita fine sandy loam with 0–3 percent
slopes, Montell clay with 0–3 percent slopes, Ramadero loam, and Viboras clay
(SoilWeb 2017). Catarina clay is mapped across all of Survey Areas 3, 5, 11, and 13
and small portions of Survey Areas 6, 7, and 9. Montell clay is mapped across all
of Survey Area 8 and most of Survey Areas 2, 6, and 7. Ramadero loam is mapped
across Survey Area 4 and almost all of Survey Areas 1 and 10. Copita fine sandy
loam is mapped across the majority of Survey Area 9 and small segments of Survey
Areas 1 and 10. Viboras clay is mapped across Survey Area 12 and along the east
side of Survey Area 2. Catarina and Montell series soils are very deep, moderately
well-drained, slow to very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.
These nearly level to gently sloping soils are found on broad low ridges and valley
sides and floors. Both soils will shrink and crack when dry. Ramadero series soils
are very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alkaline
loamy alluvium. Nearly level Ramadero soils are found in long, narrow, shallow
valleys that serve as drainages for adjoining smooth upland plains. Copita and
Viboras series soils are moderately deep, well-drained, and moderately to very slowly
permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy or clayey residuum derived from
sandstone, siltstone, or shale. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on the
side slopes of low hills or on valley floors and sides (SoilWeb 2017; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2017).
The project area is in the Texas-Tamaulipan Thornscrub subregion of
the Southern Texas Plains ecological region. Commonly referred to as the “brush
country,” this portion of south Texas is characterized by gently rolling or irregular
plains cut by arroyos and streams and covered with a distinctive, low-growing thorn
woodland and thorn shrubland. Three centuries of livestock grazing, fire suppression,
and droughts have changed once open, grass-covered prairies with only occasional
trees or bushes to the woody shrub- and small tree-dominated landscape that now
characterizes the region (Figure 2). Most of this area is utilized as range land for
beef cattle, and in some instances, to raise exotic game species for hunting. Ranching
income is commonly supplemented with hunting leases. Important native game
species include white-tailed deer, Northern bobwhite quail, wild turkey, dove species,
and javelina. Cultivated land is minimal in this ecological subregion (Allison and
Rechenthin 1956; Griffith et al. 2004).
The Mesquite-Blackbrush Brush floral community is mapped in and around
almost all of the project area, and a narrow segment of land is depicted as Other
Native and/or Introduced Grasses (Frye et al. 1984). Vegetation in the former
community is dominated by drought-tolerant, mostly small-leaved, and typically
thorny small trees and shrubs, especially legume species. The primary woody species

is honey mesquite. Suitable conditions will maintain moderate to dense canopy and
understory trees and shrubs such as allthorn, anacahuita, brasil, colima, coyotillo,
desert yaupon, goatbush granjeno, guayacan, huisache, kidneywood, lotebush,
Texas ebony, Texas paloverde, Texas persimmon, and whitebrush. Yucca, prickly
pear, tasajillo, and other species of cacti are common to abundant in some areas.
Xerophytic brush species, such as blackbrush, guajillo, and ceniza, are typical on the
rocky, gravelly ridges and uplands. Representative forbs and mid-to-short grasses
include knotweed leafflower, two-leaved senna, dogweed, coldenia, mat euphorbia,
cane bluestem, silver bluestem, multiflowered false rhodesgrass, sideoats grama,
hairy grama, pink pappusgrass, purple three-awn, slim tridens, hairy tridens,
bristlegrasses, lovegrasses, and tobosa. Mixed native or introduced grasses and
forbs are typical in areas cleared of shrubland and woodland vegetation (McMahan
et al.1984; Griffith et al. 2004).
Blair (1950:102–104) characterizes the biota of south Texas as Tamaulipan,
which is home to at least 61 species of mammals, 36 species of snakes, 19 lizards,
2 land turtles, 3 urodeles, and 19 anurans. He also separates the four counties of
the lower Rio Grande Valley (Cameron, Willacy, Hidalgo, and Starr) into a distinct
biotic province identified as the Matamoran District (Blair 1950:103). This district
provides important feeding, nesting, and cover habitats for many species of native
and migratory birds. Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie (1988:6–9) describe 11 distinct biotic

5

communities in this district according to localized variation in flora, fauna, and
climactic topographic patterns. The upland thornscrub and thorn woodland that
characterizes the project area is crossed by intermittent drainage ways that foster
riparian-like strips of dense brush known as “ramaderos” providing important
nesting and feeding habitat and safe travel corridors to riparian habitats along the
Rio Grande. Some wildlife species commonly found in ramaderos include whitetailed deer, Harris hawk, plain chachalaca, white-winged dove, reticulate collared
lizard, and northern cat-eyed snake (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:8). Other animal
species found in the area include mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, striped
skunk, black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, Northern bobwhite quail, scaled
quail, western diamondback rattlesnake, and Texas indigo snake. Collared peccary
(or javelina) and feral pig have been present in varying numbers since the early
Historic period (McCulloch et al. 2003).
The climate of Starr County is classified as warm-temperate subtropical
steppe with hot summers and mild winters. Average daily maximum temperatures
vary from 71°F in January to 100°F in August, and average daily minimum
temperatures range from 46°F to 74°F degrees over the same period. Freezing
temperatures do not occur every year, and the average annual growing season is
305 days. The average annual rainfall is 17 inches, and most of this falls unevenly
in thunderstorms that peak from late May to early June. Occasional tropical
disturbances can produce heavy rains early in the fall (Thompson et al. 1972:56-57).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND PREVIOUSLY
DOCUMENTED SITES
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas in
October and December 2017 revealed seven professional archeological surveys, one
avocational archeological investigation, and 19 previously recorded archeological
sites within 3 km of the project area (Tables 1 and 2). In 1950, Alex D. Krieger and
Jack T. Hughes conducted archeological survey and performed test excavations in
Starr and Zapata Counties in advance of the planned construction of the Falcon
Dam and Reservoir. Labeled the First Falcon Archeological Project, this work was
performed under a cooperative agreement between the National Park Service and
the University of Texas at Austin. Fieldwork resulted in the identification of 55
archeological sites, of which 23 were recommended for testing and 12 for extensive
excavations (Hartle and Stephenson 1951:1). Some of the sites are within the 3-km
review area. In 1968, a private landowner inspected and collected artifacts at 5
undocumented sites along Del Puerto Creek, southeast of the project area. The
information gathered at that time was used to document the sites on State of Texas
Archeological Site Forms in 1985. Four archeological surveys were conducted for
the energy industry in 1994, 1996, 1997, and 2013, and two transportation-related
surveys were completed in 2003 and 2005. The 1994 survey, by Archaeological
Consultants, Inc., for the Tejas Gas Corporation, documented 5 new sites just north
of the project area. In 1996, personnel with Archaeology Consultants, Inc., conducted
a reconnaissance survey of 28,175 acres of private and public land around Falcon
Reservoir in support of a seismic survey conducted by Seismic Assistance, Inc.

7

This survey was divided into nine separate project areas distributed north-south
across Zapata County and into northern Starr County. The southernmost project
area (named Coastal) overlapped the current project area, but survey in this larger
tract was relegated to land well west of U.S. Highway 83 (McCulloch et al. 2003).
Archaeology Consultants, Inc., documented 353 new sites and revisited 60 previously
recorded sites during this survey. Four sites are within 3 km of the project area. The
Archeological Sites Atlas provides minimal information about the 1997 survey, but
it appears to have been conducted along a proposed subsurface utility alignment.
No sites are shown along the depicted survey alignment. In 2013, a Perennial
Environmental employee recorded one site at a proposed Kinder Morgan plant site
on Pipeline Drive, about 365 m northeast of Survey Area 11. Personnel with Blanton
and Associates, Inc., surveyed nearly 2,500 acres along the U.S. Highway 83 corridor
in Starr and Zapata Counties for the Texas Department of Transportation in 2003
and 2005. These projects documented 51 new archeological sites and revisited 10
previously recorded sites, all outside the review area (Meadows et al. 2005; Young
et al. 2007).
The 19 previously recorded sites within 3 km of the project area are on both
sides of the Starr–Zapata County line. Four are recommended as potentially eligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, two are recommended as
ineligible, and the eligibility status of the remaining 13 is either undetermined or
unknown (see Table 2). The sites are in the shallow upland valleys of Arroyo Medio,
Del Puerto Creek, and tributaries of Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita and on gently sloping
surfaces overlooking these drainages. These sites are classified as open campsites (n =
15), lithic scatters (n = 3), and historic structural remains (n = 1). Most of the Native
American sites are described as sparse surface to near-surface scatters of artifacts,
with the archeological deposits at those sites in the Arroyo Medio valley (and closer
to the Rio Grande) appearing to be denser than those at upland sites farther to
the east. Multicomponent site 41SR174 consists of a surface scatter of prehistoric
artifacts and late-nineteenth/early-twentieth-century artifacts attributed to a ranch
hand camp. Single-component historic site 41ZP680 consists of late-nineteenth/earlytwentieth-century structural remains and other debris associated with the Reforma
Ranch. Native American components at 11 sites are entirely composed of chipped
stone artifacts or chipped stone artifacts and burned chert (41SR174, 41SR175,
41SR402, 41ZP163–41ZP166, 41ZP670, and 41ZP677–41ZP679); projectile points
were found at 41SR174, 41SR175, and 41ZP163. Two of the Native American sites
consist of a projectile point, lithic debitage, and a mussel shell (41ZP167) or a bone
pendant (41SR176). Site 41SR173 consisted of a projectile point and a stone hearth.
Three of the Native American sites are composed of chipped stone artifacts, burned
rocks, and mussel shells (41SR48, 41ZP42, and 41ZP43), and another consists of
chipped stone artifacts, burned rocks, bones, and snail shells (41SR172); one or more
projectile points were identified at each of these.
Temporal component designations at the 10 Native American sites with
projectile points range from possible Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric, with Archaic
components listed at all of them (see Table 2). Late Archaic sites 41SR173 and 41ZP43
are the only clearly single-component sites in this group. The multicomponent

prehistoric sites include a possible Paleoindian component at site 41SR174; a
general Archaic component at 41SR48 and 41SR174; Early, Middle, and Late Archaic
components at 41SR172, 41ZP163, 41ZP167, and 41ZP42; and Late Prehistoric
components at 41SR172, 41SR175, 41SR176, 41ZP163, and 41ZP167. Components
are generally listed as spanning from various times in the Archaic period to the
Late Prehistoric period at 41SR176, 41ZP163, and 41ZP167. The age of the Native
American component at 41ZP677 is listed as prehistoric, and the ages of three other
site components (41ZP670, 41ZP678, and 41ZP679) are unknown but probably
prehistoric (McCulloch et al. 2003). The ages of the Native American components
at four sites (41SR402 and 41ZP164–41ZP166) are unknown.
PREHISTORIC ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Native Americans have occupied the south Texas region for at least 12,000
years, leaving abundant archeological remains that are often difficult to interpret
since the most common site types are often palimpsests of repetitive, brief occupations
on nonaggrading landforms. Little substantive archeological investigation was
done in this region before the late 1960s, and as a result, the prehistoric cultural
chronology is less refined than are those in adjacent regions (Hester 2004). The
prehistoric chronology is separated into the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Protohistoric periods, and this framework has been summarized by Hall et
al. (1986), Black (1989), and Hester (1995, 2004). These syntheses are built on
investigations conducted at a variety of site types, including open occupation sites or
camp sites on alluvial terraces and upland landforms, lithic procurement/reduction
localities, burned rock middens, shell middens, clay dune sites, rock shelters, rock art
sites, artifact caches, and cemeteries and isolated burials (Boyd et al. 1997; Brown
1985, 1996; Campbell 1947; Dockall and Black 2018; Hall et al. 1982, 1986; Hartle
and Stephenson 1951; Hester 1975, 1978a, 1986, 1989; Highley 1986; Highley et al.
1977, 1978; Kelly and Graves 1980; Kotter 1980; Mitchell et al. 1984; Nunley and
Hester 1975; Prewitt 1974; Quigg and Cordova 2000; Ricklis et al. 2012; Scott 1982;
Smith 1986; Story 1968; Taylor and Highley 1995).
Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,200–8500 b.p.)
The Paleoindian period is marked by a gradual warming trend at the end of the
Pleistocene Wisconsinan glaciation that culminated in a shift from late Pleistocene
to Holocene floral and faunal environments. This time period has frequently been
characterized as having low-density populations of small, highly mobile bands
of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna, but there is
considerable evidence from work conducted at sites in and adjacent to south Texas to
suggest a wider array of subsistence strategies was utilized. For instance, excavations
at the Berger Bluff site (41GD30) approximately 300 km northeast of the project
area in Goliad County revealed faunal resource utilization that would otherwise
be characterized as Holocene in a buried deposit that dates to ca. 9500 b.p. (Brown
1987, 1996). Accurate understanding of this time period is hindered by a scarcity of
recognizable and isolable components and an absence of dates from unquestionable
contexts. In addition to the Berger Bluff site, other buried primary-context

14

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
Paleodindian components have been identified or are suspected at the Richard Beene
site (41BX831) in Bexar County and the Johnston-Heller site (41VT15) in Victoria
County (Birmingham and Hester 1976; Thoms and Mandel 1992). Identification
of Paleoindian remains is typically dependent on the presence of known projectile
point styles, other diagnostic tool forms, and distinctive reduction technologies.
Fluted Clovis and Folsom points represent the early Paleoindian period together
with polyhedral blade cores and prismatic blades (Clovis techno-cultural complex)
and large bifacial cores and ultrathin bifaces (Folsom techno-cultural complex). The
later Paleoindian period is represented by a progression of unfluted lanceolate and
early stemmed point styles, including Plainview, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, Wilson,
Angostura, and Scottsbluff (Hester 2004). Isolated projectile points recovered in the
immediate vicinity of the project area demonstrate a Paleoindian presence. According
to Hester (2004), a Clovis point fragment was recovered at a site on Southern Island
on the Mexican side of Falcon Reservoir, and numerous other Paleoindian points
were reportedly collected at the same site. Another Clovis point was recovered in
Arroyo Morteros, about 2 miles south of Falcon Dam, and a reworked Clovis point
was recovered somewhere north of the town of Zapata. Folsom point fragments
have been found near Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita and along the shoreline of Falcon
Reservoir, west of the town of Zapata (McCulloch et al. 2003).
Archaic Period (8500–1300 b.p.)
This long period of time is typically separated into the Early (8500–4500
(4500–2400 b.p.), and Late (2400–1300 b.p.) subperiods. Each of these
subdivisions is represented by different projectile point styles and other tool forms
and, in some instances, specific subsistence strategies and/or types of archeological
sites (Turner et al. 2011). The dates for these periods and the corresponding projectile
point sequences are primarily based on research conducted in surrounding regions.
Regional themes in the Archaic include the emergence of a triangular tool type
tradition, the widespread use of distally beveled tools (which is a carryover from
the late Paleoindian period), and the development of subregionalized but poorly
understood mortuary complexes (Black 1989).
b.p.), Middle

The transition between the Paleoindian and Archaic periods is poorly
understood and difficult to precisely define chronologically. Transition to the broadspectrum hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies and settlement adaptations that
typify Archaic life ways likely began during the latter part of the Paleoindian period.
This transition coincides with a gradual technological shift from lanceolate projectile
points to stemmed points that also begins late in the Paleoindian period, with some
later lanceolate forms such as Golondrina and Angostura persisting into the Early
Archaic period (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins et al. 1998; Hester 1977; Johnson 1964).
Sites with known Early Archaic components are present throughout south Texas,
but few of these components have been excavated (Quigg and Cordova 2000; Scott
1982), and subsistence data are scarce for this period of time. Many Early Archaic
sites are on high terraces overlooking tributaries or on other upland locations, but
buried alluvial sites have also been identified. Early Archaic settlement patterns
and population densities are unclear due to sampling bias, but widespread artifact
distributions and low site counts are at least suggestive of a sparse population

15

organized in a series of small, highly-mobile, far-ranging bands operating during
a period of increasing aridity (Black 1989; McKinney 1981; Story 1985). Early
burials at Buckeye Knoll (41VT98) and the Morhiss Mound site (41VT1) indicate
the dead were interred in cemeteries in at least some instances (Dockall and Black
2018; Ricklis et al. 2012). A regionally specific triangular dart point style (Abasolo)
coincides with various projectile point styles that are more common in the Lower
Pecos and central Texas. Hester (2004) defines the south Texas Early Archaic as
two broad horizons: early corner-notched and subsequent early basal-notched. The
former is characterized by corner-notched dart points (Martindale-Uvalde-BakerBandy continuum), some forms of the Gower point type, and Guadalupe tools. The
early basal-notched horizon is characterized a suite of tool forms found across much
of south Texas and south and west into Mexico, namely the Bell and Andice point
types of the Calf Creek horizon, early triangular bifaces, and large unifacial Clear
Fork tools. These horizons are tentatively dated to approximately ca. 8000–5500
and 5600–5000 b.p. (Hester 2004:136–138).
Although Middle Archaic components are more common than the earlier
archeological remains in this region, this period is not well understood because of
limited excavation and a near-absence of associated radiocarbon dates (Hester 2004).
Consequently, much has to be extrapolated from adjacent regions. Middle Archaic
components occur on a wider range of topographic settings than earlier components,
with inland sites identified in upland, alluvial, and tributary settings and sites found
along estuary bays in the Coastal Bend (Black 1989:49). Lithic procurement sites
are very common on upland landforms and high alluvial terraces mantled with Rio
Grande or Uvalde gravels, and these same localities were undoubtedly important in
earlier periods (Davis 1992; Hester 1975; Warren 1986). Available evidence suggests
the Middle Archaic period is characterized by increasing population densities and
concomitant mobility/territorial restrictions, which is supported by the appearance
or continued use of cemeteries at Loma Sandia (41LK28), Buckeye Knoll (41VT98),
and Morhiss Mound (41VT1) (Dockall and Black 2018; Ricklis et al. 2012; Taylor and
Highley 1995). Recovery of a variety of legumes and nuts from various tree species
and a demonstrated increase in the number of formal hearths, earth ovens, and
burned rock concentrations at investigated Middle Archaic components at Choke
Canyon sites suggest an increased reliance on plant resources and an intensification
of plant processing methodologies (Hall et al. 1986; Scott 1982). This is also reflected
by the increasing prevalence of ground stone artifacts like manos and metates (Black
1989). Triangular dart point forms (Abasolo and Tortugas) dominate projectile
point assemblages that also include stemmed point styles found in south Texas and
adjacent regions. Distally beveled tool forms persist. Clear Fork tools from this period
are smaller than earlier variants and can be unifacial or bifacial forms. Distally
beveled Nueces tools and large perforators (many likely reworked projectile points)
are other distinctive Middle Archaic tool forms (Turner et al. 2011:225, 237, and 239).
The Late Archaic period is better known than its antecedents because more
components have been investigated and published (Hester 2004). Late Archaic
components are very common across most of south Texas and are found in myriad
topographic settings. Campsites are typically situated along tributaries, and evidence

16

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
indicates lithic procurement localities continued to be intensively utilized during
this period (Hester 1975; Highley 1986). An obvious increase in site density reflects
continued population growth, and increased population density suggests Late
Archaic cemeteries like Loma Sandia were increasingly territory specific (Black
1989). Isolated burials that date to (or may date to) the Late Archaic have also been
documented (Hester 1989; Huebner et al. 1996; McGraw 1983; and Mitchell et al.
1984). Subsistence data show continued intensification in the exploitation of plant
resources at inland sites, with a trend toward the exploitation of small mammals,
reptiles, fish, and mollusks over larger prey animals such as deer. The preponderance
of hearths, earth ovens, extensive deposits of burned rocks, and ground stone artifacts
at many Late Archaic sites may be largely derived from plant processing, but there
is evidence to suggest that at least some burned rock features were used for cooking
mussels and other faunal resources (Brown et al. 1982). Late Archaic components in
the Coastal Bend indicate the exploitation of a variety of small mammals, fish, and
shellfish, with a suggested focus on marine resources obtained in estuary bays. Black
(1989:51) suggests Late Archaic subsistence strategies were more “collector-gatherer
than hunter-gatherer in nature.” The Tortugas projectile point style continues into
the Late Archaic. Subsequent triangular dart point styles (Matamoros and Catán)
that date later in the period may represent continua of earlier triangular point
styles (Turner et al. 2011). Lozenge-shaped Desmuke points are geographically
restricted to south Texas. Stemmed dart point styles include Shumla, Ensor, Frio,
Ellis, Fairland, and Marcos. The Matamoros, Catán, Ensor, and Frio points styles
date to the latter part of the Late Archaic and sometimes appear in early Late
Prehistoric components (Hester 2004). Another distinct Late Archaic tool form is
the small, triangular, distally beveled Olmos biface (Turner et al. 2011:238).
Late Prehistoric Period (1300–ca. 400 b.p.)
The final prehistoric period in south Texas is well represented in the
archeological record and extensively studied and reported (Black 1989; Hester
2004). This period of seemingly rapid cultural change is marked by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics and the adoption of new adaptive strategies.
The transition between old and new technologies in the earlier part of the period is
imprecise, as indicated by the continued presence of some small Late Archaic dart
point styles in some Late Prehistoric contexts. Some of these carryovers may have
been used as dart points, while others were small enough to have been used on
arrows, and there is evidence to support the notion that some of the Late Archaic
point styles were initially scaled down for use with the bow and arrow system prior
to the adoption of later arrow point styles (Creel et al. 1979). Black (1989) applied a
previously defined central Texas cultural sequence to south Texas because of parallels
in the presence and sequence of diagnostic arrow point styles in the two regions. This
two-phase sequence consists of the Austin horizon (ca. 1300–750/800 b.p.) and the
Toyah horizon (750/800–ca. 400 b.p.). In south Texas, the Austin horizon reflects a
certain degree of cultural and economic continuity underlying the adoption of new
technologies. The Toyah horizon appears to be characterized by cultural diffusion
and differential adoption of traits and subsistence strategies largely associated
with bison hunting that entered the region from central Texas (Black 1989; Hester

17

2004; Johnson 1987). The Austin horizon is marked by two expanding-stem arrow
point styles (Edwards and Scallorn), triangular Fresno points, and ovate Padre
points along the coast. Limestone or sandstone arrow shaft straighteners appear
with the introduction of the bow and arrow in the region. Toyah horizon components
are marked by contracting-stemmed Perdiz arrow points, small end scrapers, flake
knives, perforators, bone-tempered pottery (Leon Plain) and ceramic figurines, and
possibly pipes, shell ornaments, tubular bird bone beads, and spatulate objects
fashioned from bison bone fragments (Hester 2004:146). The temporal division
between these two horizons is inexact, as evidenced by the documented co-occurrence
of Scallorn and Perdiz points and bone-tempered ceramics in the same component
(Hall et al. 1986), or the presence of ceramics in pre-Toyah horizon deposits (Creel
et al. 1979). Other Late Prehistoric south Texas arrow point styles include the Starr
point (which is undated) and side-notched Caracara points that appear to be coeval
with the Toyah horizon but are not considered diagnostic of it (Boyd et al. 1997;
Turner et al. 2011:183).
Centered far south of the project area but considered noteworthy is a cultural
pattern known as the Brownsville Complex, which dates from ca. 1000 b.p. and
later, and is known for its sophisticated shell-working industry and indications of
interaction with Huastec groups on the Mexican coast (Black 1989; Hester 2004).
While this complex was traditionally believed to be confined to the Rio Grande
delta, recent evidence indicates this cultural pattern extends onto portions of
the Hebbronville Plain (Ricklis 2004; Riggs 2011). Brownsville complex shell
assemblages are characterized by edge-flaked Sunray Venus clam shells, conch
adzes, columella gouges, and various ornamental bead and pendant forms made
from conch body sections. The lithic assemblage consists of triangular unstemmed
arrow points (Matamoros, Fresno, Starr, and Cameron), small circular unifaces,
and bifacial pin-like drills (Black 1989; Ricklis 2004:178). Pottery is uncommon in
the delta area, but interactions with Huastecan groups to the south are based on
the recovery of small amounts of Huastec ceramics in mortuary and nonmortuary
contexts (Anderson 1932; Mason 1935).
Late Prehistoric period sites are very common across south Texas, and even
when the high visibility bias created by recent deposition and distinctive artifact
types is taken into account, the number of Late Prehistoric sites suggest relatively
high population densities. Inland site distribution is typically water-proximate, with
sites commonly found within 50 m of tributaries and other water sources such as
deflation troughs and resacas (González et al. 2014; Hall et al. 1987; Mallouf et al.
1977; Prewitt 1974). The frequency of more-isolated upland sites appears to decline
during the Late Prehistoric period. Coastal sites occur on waterways above bays,
around bays, and on barrier islands. The use of cemeteries continues in the Late
Prehistoric. Burials dating to this period have been documented at a cemetery at
Southern Island on the Mexican side of Falcon Reservoir and at other locations
around the reservoir (Boyd et al. 1997). Subsistence data gathered at inland sites
demonstrate an intensification of faunal exploitation, and some site components
have yielded a diverse array of taxa. While bison have traditionally been touted as
an important constituent of Toyah horizon subsistence strategies, investigation has

18

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
shown that bison remains are either absent or minimally represented in many Late
Prehistoric components, while deer is often the most-common artiodactyl in faunal
assemblages (Hester 1978b; Hester and Hill 1975; Steele 1986a, 1986b; Steele and
Hunter 1986). Subsistence data from sites along the coast and on the Rio Grande
delta also exhibit substantial faunal diversity (Black 1989; Story 1968).
METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The Phase I archeological survey conformed with the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.
The following sections describe the methods used in the various stages of this
investigation.
Prefield Review and Field Preparation
In addition to consulting pertinent geology and soils maps and review of
information available on the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas,
prefield investigations included examination of available topographic quadrangles
(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1938, 1956; U.S. Geological Survey 1965a, 1965b,
1993), modern and historic aerial imagery accessed through the NETR Online
web viewer, Google Earth satellite imagery, and relevant information available on
the Texas General Land Office online land lease map viewer and the Texas State
Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas Online. The Atlas review indicated that
prehistoric sites could be expected on nearly level to gently sloping surfaces adjacent
to and in the vicinity of tributaries and on top of and along the footslopes of elevated
topographic features. Aside from the perennial Rio Grande west of the project area,
local water sources now appear be to limited to lower-order intermittent tributaries
that probably serve as short-lived water catchments during rainy periods. However,
some of these tributaries may have served as more-reliable water sources prior to
environmental changes spurred by historic overgrazing, the spread of mesquite and
other brushy vegetation, and lowering of the water table through twentieth-century
deep well irrigation (Hester 2004). Springs also may have served as upland water
sources prior to recent landscape modification and environmental degradation, but
Brune (1981:408) notes that springs probably were never very common in Starr
County due to minimal topographic relief and the presence of impervious shale
under much of the area. Prefield review suggested that prehistoric sites could be
present in any of the survey areas since all are centered on drainages, and the
suite of variables presented by each (i.e., stream size, character of the surrounding
landscape, presence of particular plant resources, proximity to lithic sources) may
have made one stream more attractive or advantageous to habitation than others
on a seasonal basis (McCulloch et al. 2003:156). Holocene alluvium mapped along
Del Puerto Creek and an Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita tributary suggested subsurface
archeological deposits could be present in Survey Areas 2 and 3. In general, however,
the age of the subsurface geology, characteristics of mapped soils, and size orders
of the area tributaries indicated any prehistoric archeological deposits in the
project area likely would be at or near the modern surface and thus susceptible to
occupational overprinting, surface degradation, and other disturbance.

19

Review of available historic topographic quadrangles revealed occupied and
abandoned ranch compounds, occasional lone structures, and scattered check dams
and water wells in the vicinity of the project area (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1938,
1956). A north-south United Gas System pipeline depicted on the 1956 quadrangle
runs through roughly the center of the general project area, passing just west of
Survey Area 11. These maps and historic and modern aerial and satellite imagery
show a myriad of fence lines, dirt roads, two-track roads, and subsurface utility
alignments across the same area. Prominent among these are a well-maintained
gravel road (Pipeline Drive) and adjacent 100–160-ft-wide subsurface utility corridor
that follow the county line about 3.9 mile northeast of U.S. Highway 83. Four active
oil and gas facilities are along the same stretch of corridor. Check dams and other
water impoundment features, stock pens and tanks, deer blinds and feeders, and
tracts recently cleared of brushy vegetation are also visible on modern satellite
imagery. Recent disturbance identified within the 13 survey areas prior to the field
investigation included broad-area vegetation clearance, specifically root plowing, and
the installation or creation of gravel roads, dirt two-track roads, senderos, fences,
and hunting sight-lines.
Although available resources showed what appear to be two occupied ranch
compounds and occasional groups of fewer structures that might be ranch residences,
stations, or hunting camps on the properties that encompass the project survey areas,
evidence of development is limited and is primarily tied to the ranching and oil and
gas industries. The project area was once isolated from major roadways. Construction
of the nearest stretch of U.S. Highway 83 roughly coincides with the construction
of the Falcon Dam and Reservoir in the early 1950s (Dowell and Breeding 1967).
Prior to its realignment around Falcon Reservoir, U.S. Highway 83 was at least 1.7
miles southwest of the project area, and the largest nearby roadway, Loma Blanca
Road, was at least 1.3 miles to the southeast. The previous isolation of the project
area and the absence of clearly reliable sources of water within it suggested that
the potential for historic archeological sites was low.
The survey effort was designed to investigate 21 proposed tributary crossings
in 13 locations designated as Survey Areas 1–13 (see Figure 1). No U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional determinations had been made for these crossings
prior to the fieldwork, and no estimates were provided regarding the potential
dimensions of USACE jurisdictional boundaries at these locations. Consequently,
each of these crossings was treated as if it was under USACE jurisdiction, and
crossing points were centered in an arbitrary 100-m-diameter circle and the circle
was enclosed in a rectilinear survey area. Each crossing in a closely spaced group
of crossings (as in Survey Area 3) was surrounded by a 100-m-diameter circle, and
the area covered by the overlapping circles was encompassed by a rectangle. The
creation of Survey Area 9 varied slightly from this approach since the associated
crossing is on the north edge of right-of-entry-accessible property.
The rectilinear survey areas were loosely aligned according to the path of
the associated tributary. This approach enabled archeologists to investigate both
up and downstream of each crossing and survey roughly equidistant segments of
land on either side, since impacts will extend well beyond the channel itself. This

20

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
methodology resulted in 13 survey areas that ranged from 2.6 to 4.7 acres in size,
resulting in an average of 2.9 acres. All but 2 of these areas were less than 3 acres in
size. Field maps produced for each of these areas showed the survey area boundary
and associated crossing points on a ghosted aerial image.
Proposed crossing points and the four corners of each of the 13 survey
areas were uploaded onto Garmin Etrex GPS units carried by the field crew to
allow them to pinpoint the survey areas and crossing locations and orient survey
investigations. Key gate locations and corresponding access codes were marked and
listed on downloaded and printed Google Earth satellite imagery. Key road and twotrack intersections, cattle guards, and other features were likewise marked on the
same sheets, and corresponding UTM coordinates were sometimes listed. Mileage
distances (in tenths of a mile) and headings also were listed for some predetermined
routes to aid in navigation.
Field Survey
A team of two archeologists completed pedestrian survey of the 38 acres
split into 13 survey tracts that encompassed 21 proposed stream crossings on
October 24–26 and December 11–13, 2017. This survey required approximately
11 person-days of effort. Daily survey rates were low in part because the field
effort was tailored to investigate a limited number of small survey areas, but this
approach allowed for more-intensive shovel testing/investigation in some areas
over others. Field survey was also slowed by the identification and documentation
of Native American archeological sites at 9 of 13 survey areas. The logistics of
driving to and moving between the widely dispersed survey areas on generally
well-vegetated range land with few notable landmarks also took time. Although the
most widely separated of the survey areas are only about 8 miles apart in a straight
line and good roads provided easy access to the full northeast-southwest length of
the general project area, departures off of this main thoroughfare were slowed by
having to correctly navigate a litany of gravel and two-track roads and by opening
and closing a multitude of gates. Some access routes chosen during prefield review
proved difficult to safely traverse by truck or were impassible, typically because of
washout and sometimes because of encroaching vegetation. In various instances,
these conditions either slowed driving considerably, required backtracking to find
a different route, or required walking the remaining distance to the survey area. It
sometimes took more than an hour to move between one survey area and another.
The crew walked over survey areas on either side of tributary channels in
transects where this was practical. Transects typically paralleled channel alignments
and were spaced approximately 30 m apart or less. This systematic approach was
often hampered or prevented by thick stands of brushy vegetation or extensive
areas of dense prickly pear, and such areas were covered by nonsystematic survey.
Densely vegetated stream channels were investigated in a similar manner (Figure
3). Survey included careful visual inspection of bare to sparsely vegetated upland
surfaces, exposed stream banks and cut banks, animal backdirt piles, two-track
roads, berms around water-retention features, vegetation-free corridors, and other
disturbances (Figure 4). Shovel tests were excavated in most of the survey areas

21

despite generally good to excellent ground surface visibility (30–100 percent) on
landforms that have little to no potential for buried archeological deposits because
all of the survey areas are along tributaries and Holocene alluvium is mapped
across two of them (Areas 2 and 3). In addition, the recent discovery (at 41SR242)
of a prehistoric archeological deposit 60 cm below the surface of an apparent stable
to degrading upland landform roughly 30 km to the southeast of the project area
(Abbott et al. 2017) suggests that surface survey alone can be an inadequate means
of searching for prehistoric archeological deposits in parts of the region.

A total of 75 shovel tests were excavated during the field effort, for a testing
density of 2.0/acre in the 38-acre project area and exceeding the shovel testing
requirements of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Survey Standards
for Texas. Shovel tests were excavated in every survey parcel except Survey Areas 6
and 7, and if the combined acreage of these areas is deducted from the total survey
acreage, then the testing density is 2.3/acre across 33 acres. Judgmental shovel test
excavation resulted in 3–12 tests in 11 survey areas, for an average of 7 per tested
area. A total of 33 shovel tests were excavated at seven of nine new Native American
sites (41SR447–41SR449 and 41SR452–41SR455) to assess local sediments and the
potential for subsurface deposits. Three tests excavated at site 41SR449 recovered
sparse artifacts to a maximum depth of 30 cm below the surface, and one test each

23

at 41SR452, 41SR453, and 41SR455 recovered single artifacts from 10 to 20 cm
below the surface. None of the other tests placed on documented sites recovered
subsurface artifacts. These results, combined with other observations, support the
argument that the archeological deposits at the nine newly documented sites are
largely restricted to the modern surface.
Shovel tests excavated on transects were typically spaced evenly to cover
the full length of the survey area, which resulted in spacing that varied from
approximately 40 to 70 m. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and
excavated in arbitrary 20-cm levels when sediments allowed. Tests were excavated
to subsurface clays, clayey sediments, or sediments with increasing amounts of
secondary carbonate when possible. Test depths ranging from 23 to 70 cm below the
surface amounted to an average depth of 41 cm. Removed sediments were screened
through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted through with a trowel when
too difficult to screen efficiently. All sediments excavated were carefully inspected
for archeological materials. Each shovel test was assigned a unique number, and a
Shovel Test Record Form was used to record brief sediment descriptions, test depth,
the presence/absence of artifacts, and artifact counts and identification.
Survey crew members recorded each shovel test location with a handheld
Garmin Etrex GPS unit and plotted each test on survey map sheets. The Garmin
points and tracks were uploaded to Google Earth daily to check shovel test
distribution and survey area coverage. All GPS data were post-processed using
differential correction through the Pathfinder Office program to ensure submeter
accuracy in horizontal location information. GPS data were converted to shape
files for displaying shovel test locations and other spatial information within a
geographic information system (GIS) environment. This enabled the collected spatial
information to be overlaid onto digitized, georeferenced topographic maps and aerial
photographs showing the survey area boundaries. Photographic documentation of
ground conditions in each survey area complements the verbal descriptions kept
by the project archeologist in a daily journal. The archeological sites were also
photographed, and temporary site forms were used to record pertinent information
about them in the field. This information was used to complete and submit State of
Texas Archeological Site Forms to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of
the University of Texas at Austin.
Artifact Analysis and Curation
Five chipped stone artifacts and one ground stone artifact collected during
survey were assigned a field sack number by provenience and recorded in site-specific
field sack logs. These artifacts were returned to the Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
laboratory for cleaning, analysis, and lot number assignment and were described
according to raw material type, artifact type, technological attributes, and breakage
patterns. The collected artifacts will either be returned to the property owner upon
notification and request, or they will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin pending landowner consent. All
of the paper records and photographs generated by this survey are curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

SURVEY RESULTS
The 13 survey areas are in shallow valleys on nearly level to gently undulating
uplands in the southwest portion of the Aguilares Plain. This survey identified nine
previously unrecorded Native American archeological sites (41SR447–41SR455)
in Survey Areas 2, 3, 5–8, and 11–13 (Table 3). Three isolated surface finds were
documented but not recorded as archeological sites. The isolated finds consist of
two chert flakes observed next to Survey Area 1 and a burned rock observed in
Survey Area 4.

Survey Area Descriptions
Survey Area 1 (Proposed Crossings EC-03a, RC-03a,
RC-04, and RC-05)
Survey Area 1 encompasses 3.0 acres of nearly level to gently sloping valley
floor on the upper reaches of a small tributary of Arroyo la Minita, about 0.8 km
southeast of an occupied ranch compound. Surface elevations range slightly above
and below an average of 420 ft above mean sea level. Mapped soils primarily consist
of Ramadero loam with a segment of Copita fine sandy loam with 0–3 percent slopes
depicted on higher ground in the east corner of the survey area (SoilWeb 2017). The
poorly to well-defined tributary channel in the east half of this area is 1–2 m wide

25

and ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 m deep north to south. Surface sediments encountered
across most of the investigated area suggest flanking terrain is subject to periodic
surface flows that are not restricted to the channel cut. Vegetation across most of
the area consists of a light to moderate cover of young mesquite, huisache, and other
thorny trees with a sparse to moderate understory of smaller trees, woody shrubs,
forbs, and grasses. Occasional older mesquites, Texas ebony, and other thorny legume
tree species are present along the tributary channel; some of these are as much
as 0.6 m in diameter and 7.5 m tall. Prickly pear cactus is scattered throughout
the area. Sparse scattered mesquites, prickly pears, forbs, and short grasses in the
eastern portion of the area suggest recent vegetation clearing. Surface visibility is
typically 60 percent of higher.
Topographic maps, aerial photographs, and Google Earth satellite imagery
indicate this area has been repeatedly cleared of woody and brushy vegetation
since at least the early 1960s (NETR Online 2017; U.S. Geological Survey 1965b).
A 15–20-m-wide open corridor extends northeast-southwest across the northwest
half. A dirt two-track road extends northeast-southwest through the center.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated on a series of northwest-southeast
transects for a testing density of 4.0/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 35 to
60 cm with an average of 46 cm. No artifacts were identified in these tests. Two
chert flakes observed on the surface northeast of the area are considered isolates
since no other artifacts were found.
Survey Area 2 (Proposed Crossings EC-08, RC-06, and RC-13)
Survey Area 2 encompasses 2.8 acres of very gently sloping upland terrain
on a north-draining tributary of Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita. The survey area is
approximately 55 m southeast of Pipeline Drive and about 7.7 km northeast of U.S.
Highway 83. A modern check dam and the remains of a historic one are 0.1 and
0.2 km south of the survey area (NETR Online 2017; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
1956). Surface elevations range slightly above and below an average of 380 ft above
mean sea level. Most of the area is mapped as Montell clay with 0–3 percent slopes,
and a small segment of Viboras clay is depicted along its east edge (SoilWeb 2017).
The well-defined tributary channel that meanders through the center has created
steep cut banks in places, is as much as 4 m wide, and is typically about 1 m deep
(see Figure 4a). Vegetation away from the channel consists of a light to moderate
cover of grasses and forbs with scattered prickly pears, tasajillos, thorny shrubs, and
occasional very young mesquite trees. Large expanses of unvegetated ground are
common, particularly east of the tributary. Denser vegetation along the tributary
channel consists of a thicker cover of grasses and forbs, larger trees (e.g., mesquite,
huisache, and granjeno), thorny shrubs, tasajillos, and prickly pears. Google Earth
satellite imagery indicates woody and brushy vegetation east and west of the
tributary vegetation belt was cleared once in the early 1990s and again in ca. 2005.
An abandoned dirt two-track road cuts across the northwest corner.
Survey identified a sparse surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts and
burned rocks across the entirety of the survey area outside the tributary channel,

26

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
and 11 shovel tests were excavated on a series of north-south transects for a testing
density of 3.9/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 30 to 45 cm with an average of
34 cm. Chipped stone artifacts were recovered below the surface in three of these
tests (see 41SR449 description below).
Survey Area 3 (Proposed Crossings EC-11, EC-12, and RC-09)
Survey Area 3 encompasses 4.7 acres around a group of three crossings on
the upper reaches of Del Puerto Creek. The survey area is 3.3 km east-northeast of
Survey Area 2 and about 0.6 km southeast of Pipeline Drive. Surface elevations in
this segment of nearly level to gently sloping valley floor range from 410 to 415 ft.
Surface sediments are mapped as Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent
slopes. The well-defined tributary channel that meanders through Survey Area
3 is 1.5–2.5 m wide and 1.0–1.3 m deep. Area vegetation is composed of common
prickly pears and scattered to dense stands of tasajillo, with scattered mesquite,
huisache, granjeno, blackbrush, and guajillo and a moderate to dense cover of
grasses and forbs. Vegetation is densest along and in the tributary channel, and
large stretches of unvegetated ground are common on surfaces to either side of
this riparian-like vegetation belt. Google Earth satellite imagery indicates woody
and brushy vegetation was thinned or cleared from areas that flank the tributary
vegetation belt at least once in the 1990s and again in ca. 2005 (see Figure 3a). A
dirt two-track road crosses the southern side, and an abandoned sendero or twotrack crosses the northern part.
Survey identified a scatter of chipped stone artifacts and burned rocks across
most of the survey area outside the tributary channel (see site 41SR448 description
below). Nine shovel tests were excavated in and adjacent to Survey Area 3 (both
inside and outside the delineated site area) for a shovel test density of 1.9/acre. The
depths of these tests ranged from 30 to 45 cm with an average of 35 cm. No artifacts
were identified in these tests.
Survey Area 4 (Proposed Crossing RC-04 and RC-09)
Survey Area 4 encompasses 2.7 acres of nearly level valley floor on a small
tributary of Arroyo la Minita. The tract is just southwest of a group of stock pens and
a large water-retention feature and is 2.3 km east-southeast of an occupied ranch
compound. Surface elevations range from approximately 450 to 460 ft above mean
sea level. Ramadero loam is mapped across the area (SoilWeb 2017). The well-defined,
south-draining tributary channel in the center is approximately 3 m wide and 1 m
deep. Vegetation is characterized by a scattered to moderate-density overstory
and mid-story of young mesquites, huisaches, other small thorny trees, and woody
shrubs with scattered Texas persimmon, prickly pear, and Spanish dagger. Denser
vegetation along the tributary includes larger, older mesquite trees. The vegetation
belt along the tributary is flanked by linear vegetation breaks characterized by little
to no vegetation and stretches of exposed ground. Short to moderate-length grasses
are typically fairly sparse to light in coverage across the area, with denser stands
in places west of the tributary. Google Earth satellite imagery indicates that much
of the woody and brushy vegetation outside the vegetation belt along the tributary

27

was cleared in the last 30–40 years and probably occasionally thinned since that
time. Few other disturbances were identified in this area aside from a gravel ranch
road that passes through its northeast corner.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated on a series of north-south transects, for
a testing density of 4.4/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 38 to 70 cm with an
average of 46 cm. No artifacts were identified in these tests. A lone piece of burned
rock was observed on the surface west of Shovel Test DB26.
Survey Area 5 (Proposed Crossing EC-07)
Survey Area 5 encompasses 2.7 acres of nearly level to gently sloping valley
floor along a tributary of Saramente Creek, about 2.2 km east-northeast of Survey
Area 4. It is about 0.1 km southeast of an earthen check dam that stretches across
an adjacent tributary and is about 0.2 km southwest of a group of stock pens.
Surface elevations range slightly above and below an average of 400 ft above mean
sea level. Surface soils are mapped as Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent
slopes (SoilWeb 2017). The poorly defined tributary channel that drains from west
to southeast through the center of this area is approximately 1.5 m wide and
ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 m deep. Area vegetation consists of abundant prickly pear
with scattered young mesquite, huisache, granjeno, blackbrush, guajillo, and woody
shrubs. The densest vegetation belt comprised of trees and other plants follows the
stream channel. Grasses and forbs are densest along the tributary and become
increasingly sparse and scattered away from it. Spanish dagger is scattered on
slightly higher terrain away from the drainage. Most of the area is characterized by
large stretches of exposed ground surrounding scattered concentrations of thorny
and spiny vegetation.
A 1964 aerial image indicates this area was root plowed shortly before that
time (NETR Online 2017). Google Earth satellite imagery indicates all of the survey
area was cleared of woody and brushy vegetation shortly before 1995, and areas
north and south of the reestablished tributary vegetation belt were cleared again
in about 2005. An old dirt two-track road trends northwest-southeast across the
center, and another extends southwest off of the first in the northwest quadrant.
Three shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area 5 for a testing density
of 1.1/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 30 to 46 cm with an average of 37 cm.
No subsurface artifacts were recovered in these tests. Shovel test excavation was
restricted in Survey Area 5 because it encompasses a degrading landform with
a sparse lag deposit of surface gravels and chipped stone artifacts. In addition,
carbonates were encountered as threads and coatings on ped faces within 2 cm of
the surface in the two shovel tests in or adjacent to a surface artifact scatter. The
delineated site area extends across the southwest quadrant of the survey area and
beyond it to the south and west (see site 41SR447 description below).
Survey Area 6 (Proposed Crossing RC-12)
Survey Area 6 encompasses 2.6 acres on a Los Barrosos Creek tributary,
ca. 1.8 km northwest of Survey Area 5. It includes segments of two northwest-

28

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
southeast gravel-covered ridges, sloped pediments along the toes of these landforms,
and a narrow, nearly level valley floor that is 20 to 40 m wide. Dense lag gravels
representing multiple lithologies armor the surfaces of the ridges and adjacent
pediments, and these gravels are dispersed in the tributary channel and adjacent
erosion cuts at the base of the valley. The survey area has an average surface
elevation of 425 ft above mean sea level. Most of it is mapped as Montell clay with 0–3
percent slopes, with a segment of Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent slopes
along its east edge (SoilWeb 2017). The ill-defined tributary channel varies from a
0.5-m-wide, 0.3-m-deep swale to a 5–10-m-wide braided wash that is no more than
0.3 m deep. Vegetation on the ridges and underlying pediments consists of a sparse
to moderate cover of low grasses, forbs, and woody shrubs with widely scattered
prickly pears and small mesquites, blackbrush, and guajillo. Denser vegetation along
the tributary consists of short and medium-length grasses, granjeno, huisache, and
slightly older and larger mesquites.
The character of the vegetation attests to relatively recent clearance on either
side of the tributary vegetation belt. Aerial imagery indicates vegetation has been
repeatedly thinned or removed from the valley floor and adjacent pediments since
at least 1964 (NETR Online 2017). A fence line and adjacent dirt two-track roads
trend northeast-southwest through the center, and several dirt two-track roads cut
across parts of the south half.
No shovel tests were excavated in this area since the extensive surface
lag gravel deposit indicated surfaces are stable to degrading and any deposition
is attributable to colluvial processes. Survey identified a broad surface scatter of
lithic artifacts among the lag gravels. The scatter extended across the survey area
and beyond (see site 41SR450 description below).
Survey Area 7 (Proposed Crossing RC-11)
Survey Area 7 encompasses 2.6 acres of nearly flat upland terrain on a Los
Barrosos Creek tributary, 0.5 km west-southwest of Survey Area 6. Flat and nearly
flat surfaces adjacent to the tributary are covered with sparse to moderate-density
deposit of surficial and shallowly buried lag gravels representing multiple lithologies
(see Figure 3c). Surface elevations outside the tributary channel vary from ca. 420
to 425 ft above mean sea level. Almost all of the area is mapped as Montell clay
with 0–3 percent slopes; a very small segment of Catarina clay association with 0–5
percent slopes is at the southwest corner (SoilWeb 2017). The investigated channel
segment is anastomized with at least two sizable channel cuts and smaller channels
and head-cutting extending off of these. Some of the smaller channels and gullies are
likely derived from focused erosion along livestock trails. The largest channel cuts
are broad (3–5 m wide), relatively shallow (0.4–0.8 m), and sandy floored. Gravels
are visible at the tops of cut banks on some channel segments and are scattered
along channel floors. Vegetation typically consists of a sparse to moderate cover of
low grasses ad forbs, scattered prickly pears and tasajillos, occasional agaves, and
a light to dense cover of woody thorny shrubs and young mesquites, blackbrush,
guajillo, and huisache. Ceniza is common across the slightly more-elevated north half
of the survey area. Denser vegetation along and in the tributary channel consists of

29

short to medium-length grasses, slightly older and larger mesquites and huisache,
granjeno, and other thorny tree species. Tree and thorny shrub cover is thinnest in
the southwest portion of the survey area, which overlaps part of a recently cleared
tract.
Google Earth satellite imagery suggests the tract was root plowed shortly
before 1995. Satellite and aerial imagery indicates the parcel was consistently kept
free of woody and brushy vegetation from that date up until about 2010, with slow
regrowth in the time since (NETR Online 2017). A fence line and adjacent dirt
two-track roads trend northeast-southwest through the center (see Figure 4c), and
another fence line and an adjacent sendero/dirt two-track road cross the southwest
quadrant at a diagonal.
No shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area 7 because the lag gravel
deposit indicates a stable to degrading landform. Survey identified a broad scatter
of lithic artifacts among these gravels. The scatter extends across the area and
beyond (see site 41SR451 description below).
Survey Area 8 (Proposed Crossing RC-15)
About 560 m northeast of Survey Area 7, Survey Area 8 encompasses
2.7 acres on the floor of a broad, shallow upland valley formed by low ridges to the
east and west and southeastern-draining intermittent tributaries of Los Barrosos
Creek. Surfaces slope very gradually toward the tributary and dip slightly to the
southeast. The flat to gently sloping surfaces are covered with a sparse to moderatedensity deposit of surficial and shallowly buried lag gravels representing multiple
lithologies. Elevations outside the tributary channels vary from ca. 420 to 425 ft
above mean sea level. The area is mapped as Montell clay with 0–3 percent slopes
(SoilWeb 2017). The investigated tributary segment is poorly defined and consists
of a meandering main channel and five smaller secondary channels dispersed
across a 40–50-m-wide area. The primary channel is a narrow (1–2 m), shallow
(0.3–0.8 m) parabolic cut. Secondary channels are no more than a meter in width
and are 0.5–0.8 m deep. Vegetation consists of a mosaic of light to dense scrub
(mesquite, blackbrush, granjeno, various species of thorny shrubs, and occasional
Spanish dagger), perforated by open areas covered with short grasses, forbs, and
low-growing succulents. Prickly pear, tasajillo, and other species of cacti are scattered
throughout. Thicker vegetation along and in the main tributary channel consists
of a moderate to dense cover of short and medium-length grasses and forbs, thorny
shrubs, blackbrush, and young mesquite trees with scattered prickly pear and
Spanish dagger. In general, vegetation north of the fence line and gravel roadways
that divide the survey area is denser and older than it is to the south because most
of the north half encompasses less-often-cleared riparian vegetation belts along
drainage channels.
Google Earth satellite imagery indicates vegetation was at least thinned
across the south half and west corner of the survey area in about 2005. A fence line
and adjacent dirt two-track roads trend northeast-southwest through the center, and
another sendero/dirt two-track road cuts across its west corner. A 12–18-m-wide open

30

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
corridor extends northeast-southwest across the survey area, passing just south of
the proposed crossing location. The corridor parallels the alignments of the existing
roads to its north. Google Earth satellite imagery indicates an earthen dam and
stock tank were constructed on the tributary channel about 70 m northwest of the
survey area between 1995 and 2002. Surfaces in the north half of the survey area
were extensively pockmarked and rutted by cattle traffic after recent wet weather.
Four shovel tests were excavated in or immediately adjacent to Survey Area
8 for a testing density of 1.5/acre. Shovel Tests DB40 and JD32 were placed within
a sparse to moderate-density surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts in the west
quadrant and northwest portion of the survey area. Shovel test depths ranged
from 23 to 40 cm with an average of 32 cm. No subsurface artifacts were recovered.
Shovel test excavation was restricted in this area because clay is at or just below
surfaces blanketed by lag gravels, which suggested a stable to degrading landform.
The artifact scatter extended northwest beyond the survey area (see site 41SR454
description below).
Survey Area 9 (Proposed Crossing RC-02)
Survey Area 9 encompasses 2.6 acres of land on the south side of the Starr–
Zapata County line, about 2.3 km southwest of U.S. Highway 83. The proposed road
crossing is just south of the county line, and the irregular shape of the survey area
is a result of tributary orientation and the fact that right of entry was restricted to
property on the Starr County side of the line. The survey area includes nearly level to
very gently sloping surfaces on the floor of a shallow valley of an intermittent Medio
Creek tributary. Surfaces slope gently toward the tributary and dip gradually to the
northwest. Elevations vary from about 375 to 380 ft above mean sea level. Most of
the area is mapped as Copita fine sandy loam with 0–3 percent slopes, with a small
segment of Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent slopes across the southwest
corner (SoilWeb 2017). The investigated tributary segment is a poorly defined braided
or anastomosing network of narrow (less than 1 m), shallow (0.5 m or less) channels
that cut through a 50–70-m-wide belt of dense riparian vegetation. Sandy surface
sediments sheltered by this line of vegetation were damp at the time of investigation.
Small vegetation rafts are present on the upstream sides of small trees and shrubs
in this area, and larger trees have created sand traps. Cattle trails crisscross this
area, and some are slightly entrenched and others have become further channelized
by surface flow. The vegetation belt consists of an overstory of larger trees dispersed
among an understory of small trees and woody, thorny shrubs. Observed tree and
shrub species include mesquite, Texas ebony, guajillo, and coyotillo. The presence of
several large mesquite and Texas ebony trees attests to increased water availability
and greater soil moisture retention along this ephemeral stream. The riparian zone
is flanked by moderately dense stands of mesquite, huisache, and gaujillo. Vegetation
beyond that is much more open, consisting of isolated or dispersed groups of small
to medium-sized trees and woody, thorny shrubs (including mesquite, huisache, and
blackbrush), scattered prickly pear, and occasional Spanish dagger. Surface visibility
ranged from 15 to 90 percent.

31

The north edge of the survey area was impacted by a dirt two-track road
that ran adjacent to the existing property fence line at least as early as 1964 (NETR
Online 2017). This track was obscured by the creation of a prominent ca. 20-m-wide
corridor along the property fence line, possibly a subsurface utility alignment (though
no signs were observed) or a sendero. First visible on 1995 satellite imagery, this
wide cut was recleared in ca. 2005 and is still discernible on the ground today. The
current gravel road runs along the south edge of this corridor, and another gravel
road turns to the southeast on the west edge of the survey area. The most-recent
roadbeds are composed of imported gravels, and the road that follows the county
line crosses the tributary on a 0.5–0.8-m-thick fill section. Aerial and satellite
images indicate that the riparian vegetation belt was extensively thinned and
vegetation was cleared from adjacent areas prior to 1995, and the cleared areas
have been maintained since that time (NETR Online 2017). Some surfaces in open
areas southwest of the tributary are hummocky due to previous vegetation clearing.
A linear pile of mechanically pushed tree trunks and vegetation debris, unmilled
fence posts, a few pieces of milled lumber, and fence wire is present on the edge of
a previously cleared area on the northeast edge of the survey area.
Three shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area 9 (two west of the tributary
and one east), for a testing density of 1.2/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 50
to 70 cm with an average of 57 cm. No artifacts were identified in these tests, and
none were observed on the surface.
Survey Area 10 (Proposed Crossing RC-03)
Survey Area 10 encompasses 2.8 acres of gently sloping valley floor along a
small intermittent tributary of Arroyo la Minita, about 0.9 km east of U.S. Highway
83 and 1.1 km south-southwest of an occupied ranch compound. Surfaces slope
gently toward the tributary and gradually dip to the south. Elevations vary from
approximately 415 to 420 ft above mean sea level. Mapped soils primarily consist
of Ramadero loam with a segment of Copita fine sandy loam with 0–3 percent
slopes along the east edge (SoilWeb 2017). The ephemeral tributary channel that
trends through the center consists of at least two poorly defined channel cuts in
sandy sediments that are typically 1 m or less in width and less than 0.3 m deep.
The south-draining channels pass through a 50–70-m-wide belt of dense vegetation
with 20–35-m-wide belts of damp surface sediments on either side of the tributary.
Vegetation east of the riparian vegetation belt is open and characterized by sparse
short grasses and forbs with scattered sparse to moderately dense woody and
thorny shrub species, blackbrush and gaujillo, occasional mesquites and Texas
ebony, and scattered ceniza, prickly pear, and Spanish dagger. Aside from some
larger Texas ebony trees, most of the tree, shrub, and cacti species are small and
relatively young, which suggests previous selective vegetation clearing east of the
tributary. The same plant species are present west of the riparian vegetation belt,
but the area is characterized by denser vegetation overall, with larger specimens
of the referenced tree, shrub, yucca, and cacti species. Additional species observed
on the west side include persimmon and granjeno trees and occasional creosote.
Dense vegetation along and in the tributary is composed of thicker and typically

32

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
larger stands of many of the previously listed tree and woody, thorny shrub species.
Surface visibility varies from approximately 20 to 80 percent.
The survey area and surrounding property were root plowed shortly before a
1964 aerial image was taken, and that effort included the tributary and vegetation
along it. The tributary vegetation belt was reestablished by 1995, but areas adjacent
to this were still relatively free of woody and brushy vegetation, which suggests
they were periodically thinned (NETR Online 2017). Relatively sparse vegetation
cover on either side of the tributary in a 2008 satellite image may be the result of
selective thinning or drought loss. An east-west two-track road was cut across the
southeast quadrant of the survey area in ca. 2000.
Six shovel tests were excavated along two north-south transects, for a
testing density of 2.1/acre. Shovel test depths in this area ranged from 50 to 70 cm
with an average of 59 cm. No artifacts were identified in these tests, and none were
observed on the surface.
Survey Area 11 (Proposed Crossing RC-08)
Survey Area 11 encompasses 2.8 acres on the floor of a shallow upland valley
of an Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita tributary. The survey area is about 0.5 km southeast
of Pipeline Drive, ca. 0.4 km south-southwest of a Kinder Morgan Plant, about
1.7 km northwest Survey Area 7, and about 5.6 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway
83. Elevations vary from a few feet above and below 420 ft above mean sea level. The
survey area is mapped as Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent slopes. Flat to
very gently sloping surfaces are covered with small common lag gravels representing
multiple lithologies. The investigated tributary segment is a 0.7–1.0-m-wide swale no
more than 0.3 m deep. This ephemeral drainage passes through a thick vegetation
belt composed primarily of mesquite, blackbrush, and other woody thorny shrubs;
granjeno; and some Texas ebony, scattered prickly pear, and occasional Spanish dagger.
Vegetation adjacent to the tributary vegetation belt is characterized by a moderately
thick to dense growth of young mesquite, blackbrush, granjeno, guajillo, woody thorny
shrubs, prickly pear, and widely scattered Spanish dagger with sparse grasses and
forbs in the open areas that punctuate these thickets. Short grasses and prickly pear
are more abundant across slightly higher terrain in the southeast corner.
A 1964 aerial image indicates a northeast-southwest dirt two-track road once
cut across the northwest portion of the survey area (NETR Online 2017). Google
Earth satellite imagery indicates vegetation was cleared or at least thinned in
parts of the area east of the tributary in 1995 and again in about 2005. Vegetation
also has been cleared in an east-west 10–15-m-wide corridor across the south half.
The investigation identified a surface and near-surface scatter of chipped
stone artifacts across the entirety of the survey area. Six shovel tests were excavated,
three east and three west of the tributary, for a testing density of 2.1/acre. Shovel
test depths ranged from 25 to 55 cm with an average of 36 cm. Clay was present at
the surface or exposed only centimeters below it in all of these tests, and a small
chipped stone artifact was recovered below the surface in one (see site 41SR453
description below).

33

Survey Area 12 (Proposed Crossing RC-18)
Survey Area 12 encompasses 2.8 acres of nearly level to gently sloping
upland terrain on a northwestern-draining tributary of Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita.
It is between Survey Areas 2 and 3, about 0.2 km southeast of Pipeline Drive, and
approximately 9.8 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83. Elevations vary from
about 395 to 405 ft above mean sea level, and sediments are mapped as Viboras
clay (SoilWeb 2017). Surfaces are covered with common to abundant lag gravels
representing multiple lithologies. The entrenched tributary that meanders across
the center has created cut banks in places, is 2–5 m wide, and is as much as 1.3 m
deep. Vegetation south of the tributary is fairly open, with dense short grasses and
forbs, scattered tasajillo, prickly pear, young mesquites and blackbrush and other
woody thorny shrubs. Vegetation on stabilized surfaces north of the tributary is
denser, with abundant prickly pear, tasajillo, young mesquite and blackbrush, and
other thorny scrub. Short and medium-length grasses and forbs are common to
abundant north of the tributary, with occasional scattered yucca. Large expanses
of unvegetated or sparsely vegetated ground are common along eroded surfaces on
either side of the tributary (see Figure 4d). Vegetation along and in the tributary
channel consists of dense medium-length grasses and a wider variety of tree and
thorny shrub species, including huisache, granjeno, and coyotillo in addition to
mesquite and blackbrush.
A 1964 aerial image indicates much of the sizeable vegetation (trees, shrubs)
along the tributary channel and on adjacent surfaces was cleared in parts of the
area shortly before that time. One large cut bank is visible along the tributary, and
surface erosion is also apparent. The same image and later satellite imagery indicate
portions had been impacted by the creation and use of at least one two-track road
and possibly fence installation. Areas on either side of the tributary corridor were
again cleared of visible vegetation in 1995 and 2005 (NETR Online 2017).
The investigation identified a broad surface and near-surface scatter of
chipped stone artifacts that extends beyond the limits of the area. Six shovel tests
were excavated, three north and three south of the tributary, for a testing density
of 2.1/acre. Shovel test depths ranged from 30 to 37 cm with an average of 35 cm.
Clay was present at the surface or exposed only centimeters below it in all of these
tests, and a shallowly buried tested gravel was recovered in one (see site 41SR452
description below).
Survey Area 13 (Proposed Crossing EC-20)
Survey Area 13 encompasses 2.9 acres stretched across parts of adjacent
upland interfluves and a northeastern-draining tributary of Los Barrosos Creek.
It is between Survey Areas 5, 6, and 7 and is 2.8 km southeast of Pipeline Drive,
3.2 km west-northwest of Loma Blanca Road, and 6.1 km east-northeast of U.S.
Highway 83. Elevations outside the tributary channel vary from about 410 to 415 ft
above mean sea level, and the sediments are mapped as Catarina clay association
with 0–5 percent slopes (SoilWeb 2017). The very gently sloping to flat surfaces are
mantled with common lag gravels representing multiple lithologies. The investigated

34

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
tributary segment grades from a 4–5-m-wide swale less than 0.5 m deep choked
with thorny scrub in the southwest portion of the survey area to a 3–6-m-wide,
approximately 1-m deep channel in the central and northeastern parts. Banks along
entrenched portions vary from steep walled to gently sloping, and adjacent flats or
benches have been impacted by bank erosion, head-cutting gullies, and livestock
traffic. The latter is exacerbating channel entrenchment. In general, vegetation
varies from scattered thickets to more-extensive, moderate to dense cover of woody,
thorny scrub (e.g., blackbrush and granjeno) mixed with scattered but common
mesquite, prickly pear, and widely scattered Spanish dagger. Interspersed open
areas support sparse, short bunch grasses, forbs, and a low-growing succulent. The
dense vegetation along and in the shallow, more-ephemeral channel segment in
the southwest part is almost impenetrable. Vegetation along and in the entrenched
channel consists of scattered to moderately dense mesquites, granjeno, blackbrush,
and other thorny tree and shrub species.
Historic and modern aerial photographs and Google Earth satellite imagery
from 1964 to the present indicate most of the area has always been moderately to
densely vegetated. A previously cleared, northwest-southeast alignment that passes
through the center corresponds with an approximately 5-m-wide, vegetation-free
corridor visible on a 1964 aerial image (NETR Online 2017). This corridor was the
central axis for a series of symmetrical, triangular cleared corridors that extended
roughly 50 m off the centerline to form a repetitive diamond-shaped pattern. These
angular corridors are no longer perceptible on modern satellite imagery. Another
broad, east-west corridor that passes through the center of the area was cleared
between 1964 and 1995 (NETR Online 2017). This alignment probably marks a
former two-track road and possibly a fence line. It runs along the north side of the
entrenched tributary in the central and northeast parts of the survey area. Google
Earth imagery indicates a smaller two-track road that trends east-west across the
north corner of the survey area was cut between 1995 and 2002. This track was
maintained for several years but is now largely overgrown.
Survey identified a surface to near-surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts
that extends across the northern 60 percent of the area north of the drainage and
continues up the interfluve southwest of the survey area. Three shovel tests were
excavated along the northwest edge, for a testing density of 1.0/acre. Shovel test
depths ranged from 25 to 50 with an average of 34 cm. Clay was present at or just
below the surface in these tests, and a shallowly buried tested cobble was recovered
in one (see site 41SR455 description below).
Site Descriptions
The nine new Native American archeological sites documented during this
survey were identified in open range land in Survey Areas 2, 3, 5–8, and 11–13
(Figure 5). Sites 41SR448 and 41SR455 are open campsites associated with lithic
procurement localities. Sites 41SR447, 41SR449, 41SR452, and 41SR454 are lithic
procurement localities that also may have served as campsites. Sites 41SR450,
41SR451, and 41SR453 are lithic procurement localities with no evidence of

35

sustained habitation. Dart point fragments recovered at 41SR448 indicate the
presence Middle and possibly Late Archaic components. Diagnostic bifaces observed
at 41SR455 date to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Possible Clear Fork tool
preforms were observed at 41SR451 and 41SR454. Clear Fork tools date broadly from
the late Paleoindian to Middle Archaic periods, with size and technological variation
providing some clues as to more-precise ages. Larger forms are commonly assigned
to Early Archaic and occasionally late Paleoindian contexts, and smaller forms are
commonly associated with Middle Archaic contexts (Turner et al. 2011:225). The
ages of the five other sites are unknown since no diagnostic artifacts were observed,
but all are likely primarily or completely composed of prehistoric components.
Site 41SR447
Site 41SR447 is a lithic procurement locality and possible open campsite
in the south half of Survey Area 5 (Figure 6). It is 2.3 km west-northwest of Loma
Blanca Road, 4.2 km southeast of Pipeline Drive, 8.4 km east-northeast of U.S.
Highway 83, and 11.7 km east-northeast of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir.
The site is on nearly level to gently sloping terrain on the south side of a tributary
of Saramente Creek. Surfaces dip very gradually from southwest to northeast,
toward the tributary. Elevations vary from about 400 to 405 ft, with the terrain
rising noticeably to the southwest. Soils are mapped as Catarina clay association
with 0–5 percent slopes (SoilWeb 2017), and surface sediments are fine silt loam
over silty clay. Area vegetation is noted above in the description of Survey Area 5.
Surface visibility is 60–80 percent.
Site 41SR447 is a sparse artifact scatter consisting primarily of debitage
and cores on stable to degrading surfaces. An early-stage rhyolite biface, a middleto late-stage silicified wood biface fragment, and a burned caliche cobble were also
observed. The chipped stone assemblage is indicative of early-stage core reduction
and biface manufacture. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed during
surface inspection, but the burned caliche fragment suggests thermal features may
have been present prior to recent disturbance. Silicified wood is common across the
site. Other observed lithic material types include chert, rhyolite, and one piece of
chalcedony.
The delineated site area includes the southwest quadrant of Survey Area 5
and extends beyond it to the south and west, encompassing 5,787 m2 with maximum
dimensions of 65x115 m. This area is likely part of a larger, diffuse artifact scatter
that extends upslope to the southwest. Two shovel tests in and adjacent to the
delineated site area (DB7 and DB8) revealed 2–3 cm of fine loose silt loam above
well-consolidated silt loam that grades to silty clay by 15–20 cm below the surface.
Small gravels and Rabdotus shell fragments were present in both tests, and
carbonate threads and coatings on ped faces were common below the thin layer of
surface sediment. Occasional carbonate nodules were present in the basal portions
of these tests, which extended to 36 and 46 cm below the surface. No artifacts were
recovered in these tests. The absence of subsurface artifacts and the ancient age
and geomorphological character of the landform support the contention that the
archeological deposit is restricted to the modern surface.

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
Site 41SR447 is on stable to degrading surfaces primarily impacted by
water-derived erosion and eolian deflation. Other natural disturbances include
animal burrowing, near-surface root growth, and stock grazing. Natural surface
degradation has been exacerbated by historic overgrazing and repetitive vegetation
control/clearing efforts. The site area was root plowed in the early 1960s (NETR
Online 2017), and Google Earth satellite imagery indicates vegetation was cleared
as recently as about 2005. A dirt two-track road cuts across the northwest portion
of the documented site area.
Site 41SR448
Site 41SR448 is an open campsite and associated lithic procurement locality
on Del Puerto Creek that extends across most of Survey Area 3 and beyond (Figure
7). It is 1–2 km northwest of five previously documented sites along the same
tributary: four prehistoric sites (41SR172, 41SR173, 41SR175, and 41SR176) and
one multicomponent prehistoric/historic site (41SR174). Site 41SR448 is 2 km
northwest of Loma Blanca Road, 0.6 km southeast of Pipeline Drive, 11.2 km eastnortheast of U.S. Highway 83, and about 16 km northeast of the closest point on
Falcon Reservoir. The delineated site area is on degrading, nearly level to gently
sloping surfaces on either side of the tributary. The floor of this wide shallow tributary
valley dip to the southeast and slope gradually to the creek. Surface elevations vary
from 410 to 415 ft. Soils are mapped as Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent
slopes (SoilWeb 2017), and surface sediments are composed of loose silt and silt
loam over silty clay loam and silty clay. Vegetation has retained discrete remnants
of silt and silt loam surface sediments that stand 20 to 50 cm higher than adjacent
eroded surfaces (see Survey Area 3 above for description of area vegetation). Large
stretches of unvegetated ground are common along the toes of the stabilized soil
remnants. Surfaces close to the tributary channel (particularly on the east side) are
subject to head-cutting erosional gullies. Surface visibility is 25–100 percent and is
typically 40 percent or greater.
Site 41SR448 is a light artifact scatter consisting primarily of lithic debitage,
cores, and widely scattered burned rocks. Other observed materials include tabular
chert gravels, an early-stage biface fragment, a retouched flake, a retouched pebble,
an abraded tabular gravel, and a mano/hammerstone. Three chert dart point
fragments were found on the surface east of the creek. The medial blade-stem
fragment was not collected, but two proximal fragments were gathered for later
examination. No other artifacts were collected from this site, and no features were
identified. Observed lithic material types include cherts, El Sauz chert, agate/
jasper, chalcedony, rhyolite, basalt, sandstone, limestone, tuff, and silicified wood.
Burned rocks are of the last three material types. Many of the observed artifacts
were on the margins of the vegetation-stabilized soil remnants and in the eroded
areas surrounding them. Much of the lithic material is likely derived from abundant
lag gravels on higher terrain 50 to 100 m southwest of the delineated site area, as
artifacts observed across inspected portions of the lag deposit indicate it was utilized
for lithic procurement.

Figure 8

The collected dart points are a
proximal-medial Tortugas point fragment
and the proximal portion of a well-made dart
point that is morphologically similar to the
Kinney type (Figure 8). The Tortugas point
is 38.1 mm long, 29.7 mm wide, and up to
b
8.6 mm wide. It is crudely flaked with a thin
base, an uneven seemingly serrated basal

edge, and lateral edge remnants that suggest

a
point bears an impact fracture scar. The other
Figure 8. Dart point fragments collected at 41SR448.
dart point fragment is only 14.7 mm long by
(a) Tortugas point; (b) probable Kinney point.
28.4 mm wide, with a maximum thickness
of 4.7 mm. This artifact was snapped by a
transverse fracture that may be derived from
thinning or retouch. This thin well-made
point fragment has nearly parallel margins and a slightly concave basal edge. The
Tortugas point type dates from the Middle to Late Archaic periods, and the Kinney
point style dates to the Middle Archaic (Turner et al. 2011).
The extent of the artifact scatter within Survey Area 3 and the investigated
extent of the scatter outside it combined define a site area that encompasses 18,090 m2,
with approximate maximum dimensions of 180x165 m. This is undoubtedly part
of a much larger site. Nine shovel tests were excavated in or close to it. These tests
were 30 to 45 cm deep, for an average 35 cm. Most revealed thin surface layers of
loose silt or silt loam over silty clay loam that graded into well-consolidated silty
clay between 15 and 25 cm below the surface. Surface sediments were thickest in
those tests placed on vegetation-stabilized soil remnants. All of the tests had various
amounts of Rabdotus shells in them; in some instances, shells and shell fragments
were present from the top to bottom. Noticeable insect disturbance was observed in
some tests. Carbonates in the form of threads and coats on ped faces were present
at 4–10 cm in half of the tests. The stabilized surface soil remnants coupled with
the Holocene alluvium depicted along Del Puerto Creek by the Bureau of Economic
Geology (1976) suggests there is some potential for subsurface archeological deposits
along this tributary. However, no subsurface artifacts were recovered in the shovel
tests, which supports the conclusion that the deposit has little to no depth.
Site 41SR448 appears to be part of a larger diffuse upland lithic scatter that
extends up onto a lithic procurement area on higher terrain to the southwest, and the
artifact scatter may well extend northwest and southeast along Del Puerto Creek.
The presence of formal chipped stone tools, ground/battered stone tools, and scattered
burned rock suggests short term habitation. The site is on stable to degrading
surfaces primarily impacted by water-derived erosion and eolian deflation. Other
natural disturbances include insect burrowing, near-surface root growth, and stock
grazing. Natural surface degradation has been aggravated by historic overgrazing
and repetitive vegetation control/clearing efforts. Google Earth satellite imagery
indicates that areas to either side of the tributary vegetation belt are periodically

41

cleared of woody and brushy vegetation. A dirt two-track road crosses the southern
part of the site area, and an abandoned sendero or two-track crosses its north end.
Site 41SR449
Site 41SR449 is a lithic procurement area and possible open campsite
that extends across Survey Area 2 and beyond (Figure 9). It is less than 0.1 km
southeast of Pipeline Drive, 7.7 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83, and 11.2 km
east-southeast of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir. The site is on degrading
nearly level to gently sloping surfaces on either side of an Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita
tributary. The terrain dips very gently to the north and slopes gradually toward the
tributary. Elevations vary from about 375 to 380 ft. Soils are mapped as Montell clay
with 0–3 percent slopes and Viboras clay (SoilWeb 2017). Vegetation has preserved
benches or sediment remnants on both sides of the tributary that stand 20 to 50 cm
higher than adjacent eroded surfaces (see Survey Area 2 above for description of area
vegetation). Gravels weathering out of the top 10–15 cm of these soil remnants are
collecting on surrounding eroded surfaces. Large expanses of unvegetated ground
are common along the toes of these stabilized soil remnants. Fragments of fossilized
shell are common in some areas. Surfaces closest to the tributary channel are subject
to channel meander and erosion via head-cutting gullies. Surface visibility varies
from 40 to 100 percent.
Site 41SR449 is a sparse artifact scatter that is part of a larger diffuse upland
lithic scatter extending beyond Survey Area 2 on both sides of the tributary. The
observed chipped stone assemblage is indicative of material testing and early-stage
core reduction. Concentrations of artifacts and burned rocks are present on eroded
surfaces east and west of the tributary. A 7x6-m lithic scatter centered on Shovel
Test JD12 (west of tributary) is composed of three cores, one hammerstone, and
debitage derived from locally available chert gravels and silicified wood. Another
surface concentration about 10 m to the south consists of debitage and cores derived
from gravels eroding out along the stream bank and includes a discrete scatter of
thermally fractured chert and sandstone cobbles. Finally, a very sparse scatter of
debitage is on the surface east of the tributary between Shovel Tests JD14 and
JD15. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or distinguishable archeological features
were observed. Lithic material consists of surface and near-surface lag gravels
and fragments of silicified wood eroding out of Tertiary geologic deposits. Artifacts
observed consist of debitage, tested pebbles and cobbles, occasional hammerstones,
and occasional scattered burned rocks. Observed lithic material types include chert,
sandstone, quartzite, basalt, and silicified wood. The extent and character of the
deposit suggest this area primarily served as a lithic procurement locality, but the
presence of thermally fractured chert and sandstone also suggests it may have been
used for short-term habitation.
The recorded site area encompasses the 11,331 m2 survey area (minus the
tributary channel) and has maximum dimensions of 110x104 m. Eleven shovel tests
in this area ranged from 30 to 45 cm deep, averaging 34 cm. A flake and a piece of
fire-cracked rock were on the surface in Shovel Test JD13. Five artifacts, a chert core
fragment and four pieces of shatter (3 chert and 1 silicified wood), were recovered

between 0 and 32 cm below the surface in Shovel Tests DB16, JD12, and JD14, but
the archeological deposit appears to be primarily on the modern surface. Shovel
tests were placed on elevated soil remnants, and these typically revealed 3–10 cm
of loose silty or loamy sediments above silty clay loam, silty clay, and sandy clay.
Homogenous clay was exposed between 20 and 35 cm in several tests. Small gravels
and Rabdotus shells were present in varying frequencies in many of the tests, and
carbonates were common at shallow depths in most. The presence of shallow clay,
shallow widespread carbonates, and fossilized shells at the surface suggest the site
is on eroded Tertiary-age deposits. If the Holocene alluvium depicted along this
tributary by the Bureau of Economic Geology (1976) is accurately mapped, then
the thin layers of loamy surface sediments on the stabilized soil remnants may
correspond with these younger deposits. These deposits have little depth, and the
margins of these areas are degrading. All but one of the artifacts recovered during
shovel testing came from the top 20 cm. Shovel test results and the geomorphological
characteristics indicate this archeological deposit is primarily restricted to the
surface, with archeological materials typically extending no more than 20 cm below
it in areas with vegetation-stabilized sediments.
Site 41SR449 is on stable to degrading surfaces primarily impacted by waterderived erosion and eolian deflation. Other natural disturbances include animal
burrowing, near-surface root growth, and stock grazing. Historic overgrazing and
repetitive vegetation control/clearing efforts have exacerbated surface degradation.
Google Earth satellite imagery indicates areas to either side of the tributary
vegetation belt are periodically cleared of woody and brushy vegetation. The mostrecent episode was in about 2005. Site surfaces have also been impacted by the
creation and use of dirt two-track roads.
Site 41SR450
Site 41SR450 is a lithic procurement area that extends across Survey Area
6 and beyond (Figure 10). It is 3.4 km northwest of Loma Blanca Road, 2.2 km
southeast of Pipeline Drive, 6.4 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83, and about
11.3 km east-northeast of Falcon Reservoir. The documented site area includes
abundant surface lag gravel deposits along a narrow valley cut by a Los Barrosos
Creek tributary. The nearly level valley floor dips to the southeast, and adjacent
pediments and flanking ridges slope toward the tributary. Elevations vary from about
418 to 432 ft, with higher terrain to the north, east, and west. Soils are mapped as
Montell clay with 0–3 percent slopes and Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent
slopes (SoilWeb 2017). Surface sediments consist of silty sandy loam. Vegetation is
noted above in the description of Survey Area 6. Surface visibility is 60–80 percent.
Site 41SR450 is a broad surface scatter of common to abundant lithic artifacts
among dense lag gravels. The lag gravels represent multiple lithologies. Observed
material types include rhyolite, basalt, quartzite, chert, and silicified wood and palm
wood. Observed artifacts—hammerstones, tested cobbles, cores, early-stage biface
preforms, and debitage—are related to the procurement and preliminary reduction
of suitable lithic material. The amount of debitage, cores, and biface preforms
observed suggests this source locality was used over a long period of time and for a

variety of purposes such as direct procurement, onsite staging of manufacture, and
preparation of both bifacial and flake cores. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or
archeological features were identified, and no artifacts were collected.
The documented site area is just a small part of a much larger lithic
procurement locality fixed on the surface lag gravel deposits that stretch along the
narrow northwest-southeast ridges that frame the narrow valley. The extent of the
surface artifact scatter within Survey Area 6 and the investigated extent of the
scatter outside of the survey area combined define a site area that encompasses
12,545 m2, with maximum dimensions of 123x102 m.
No shovel tests were excavated because the dense lag gravels indicate
area surfaces are stable to degrading. The geomorphological character of the area,
ancient age of the underlying geological deposit, and nature of site use suggest
the archeological deposit is primarily restricted to the surface. Area surfaces are
primarily impacted by water-derived erosion and eolian deflation. Other natural
disturbances include downslope creep of gravels and artifacts, near-surface root
growth, and stock grazing. Historic overgrazing and repetitive vegetation control/
clearing efforts further degraded area surfaces. The character of the vegetation
attests to relatively recent vegetation clearing on either side of the tributary
vegetation belt. Google Earth satellite imagery indicates woody and brushy
vegetation is periodically thinned or cleared along the channel, and historic aerial
imagery indicates this has been conducted since at least 1964 (NETR Online 2017).
A fence line and adjacent dirt two-track roads cross the central portion of the site,
and several dirt two-track roads cut across its south half.
Site 41SR451
Site 41SR451 is a lithic procurement area that extends across and beyond
Survey Area 7 (Figure 11). It is 0.5 km southwest of 41SR450, 2.2 km southeast of
Pipeline Drive, 5.8 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83, and 10.8 km east-northeast
of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir. The documented site area includes sparse
to moderate-density lag gravels on flat to nearly flat surfaces along a tributary
of Los Barrosos Creek. Gravels are primarily restricted to the modern surface or
shallowly buried within the top 10 cm. Surfaces dip gently to the southeast, with
elevations that range from 420 to 425 ft. Soils are mapped as Montell clay with 0–3
percent slopes and Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent slopes (SoilWeb 2017).
Sediments consist of sandy silt. The vegetation is noted above in the description of
Survey Area 7. Surface visibility is 20–100 percent.
Site 41SR451 is a broad sparse to moderate-density surface scatter of chipped
stone artifacts among lag gravels that represent multiple lithologies. Observed
lithic material types include rhyolite, basalt, quartzite, chert, brecciated chert,
chalcedony, sandstone, and silicified wood. Artifact abundance positively correlates
with lag gravel density, and the densest gravels are on slightly higher terrain in
the north half of the site. Observed artifacts—hammerstones, tested cobbles, cores,
flakes, an early- to middle-stage chert biface that may be a Clear Fork tool preform,
an early-stage rhyolite biface, occasional other biface fragments, and a retouched

flake—are related to the procurement and preliminary reduction of suitable lithic
materials. Large flat broad cortical flakes knocked off the ends or sides of rounded
cobbles are fairly common. These may have been intended for Clear Fork tool and/or
agave knife production. The majority of the cores are not intensively reduced; many
exhibit the removal of only one or two flakes. No unmistakable diagnostic artifacts
were identified, no artifacts were collected, and no archeological features were
observed. If the chert biface is a Clear Fork tool preform, then it is likely indicative
of an Early or Middle Archaic component as no evidence of earlier components was
observed (Turner et al. 2011:225). The extent and character of the archeological
deposit suggest it is derived from repeated nonintensive site use. The delineated
site area encompasses 18,008 m2, with maximum dimensions of 176x156 m. This
site is a small part of a much larger lithic procurement area focused on lag gravels
available on the floor of this wide, shallow upland valley and on higher terrain to
the north, east, and west.
No shovel tests were excavated because the lag gravels indicate area surfaces
are stable to degrading. The geomorphological character of the area, ancient age of
the underlying geological deposit, and nature of site use suggest the archeological
deposit is restricted to the surface. The site is primarily impacted by water-derived
erosion. Other natural disturbances include eolian deflation, animal burrowing,
near-surface root growth, and stock grazing. Historic overgrazing and repetitive
vegetation control/clearing efforts have aggravated natural surface degradation.
Google Earth satellite imagery indicates a tract with very thin vegetation in the
southwest portion of the documented site area was root plowed shortly before 1995,
and satellite and aerial imagery indicates the parcel was consistently kept free of
woody and brushy vegetation for the next 15 years (NETR Online 2017). A fence line
and adjacent dirt two-track roads run through the center of the site area, another
fence line and adjacent sendero/dirt two-track road angle across its south half, and
another partially overgrown two-track road cuts across the northwest quadrant.
Site 41SR452
Site 41SR452 is a lithic procurement area and possible open campsite that
extends across Survey Area 12 and beyond (Figure 12). It is 0.1 km southeast of
Pipeline Drive and between 41SR448 to the northeast and 41SR449 to the southwest.
Site 41SR452 is 9.8 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83 and approximately 13 km
east-southeast of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir. The delineated site area
is on nearly level to gently sloping stable to degrading surfaces on either side of
an intermittent Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita tributary. Surfaces on the floor of this
broad upland swale dip to the west-northwest and slope gently toward the channel.
Elevations vary from 395 to 405 ft. Soils are mapped as Viboras clay (SoilWeb 2017),
and sediments are composed of clay loam, silty clay, and clay. Vegetation-stabilized
benches on either side of the tributary stand 20 to 40 cm higher than water and
wind-eroded surfaces closer to the stream. The eroding margins of these benches
are 20 to 30 m back from the belt of dense vegetation growing along the tributary.
Stabilized surfaces are mantled by common lag gravels and scattered artifacts.
Denser accumulations of gravels and artifacts are present in eroded, sparsely

48

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
vegetated areas along the toes of these benches. Surface gravels and artifacts extend
to the tributary channel on both sides. Gravels on the surface or exposed in bench
sediments on the north side of the tributary are much larger (up to 25 cm) than
those on the south side. Surfaces closest to the tributary channel are subject to
channel meander and head-cutting gullies. The vegetation is consistent with that
described above for Survey Area 12. Surface visibility varies from 10 to 90 percent.
Part of a larger upland lithic scatter, 41SR452 is a moderate to abundant,
surface to near-surface deposit of chipped and battered stone artifacts and occasional
burned rocks scattered among common to abundant surface and shallowly buried
gravels. Material types include chert, jasper, quartzite, basalt, and silicified wood. At
least some of the silicified wood and occasional pieces of dark limestone are eroding
out of Jackson Formation sediments. Observed artifacts include two worn-out and
discarded unifaces, a few retouched flakes and pebbles, early-stage biface failures,
tested gravels, cores, abundant debitage (primary to tertiary), and hammerstones.
Widely scattered burned rocks may be derived from Native American site use. The
chipped stone assemblage is indicative of lithic procurement, material testing,
biface preforming, and production of suitable flake blanks for a variety of tools. The
discarded unifaces are suggestive of retooling. Concentrations of artifacts, large
gravels, and in one instance sizeable pieces of limestone and silicified wood may be
derived from Native American activity, material accumulation on the eroded flats
close to the tributary, or both. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or identifiable
archeological features were observed, and no artifacts were collected. The extent
and character of the deposit suggest that it is derived from repeated short-term
nonintensive use focused on lithic procurement. The presence of burned silicified
wood and limestone (the latter dispersed across an 8–10-m area) suggests the site
may have been used for short-term habitation on occasion.
The delineated site area encompasses 36,385 m2 (minus the entrenched
tributary channel) and has maximum dimensions of 313x145 m. Six shovel tests
ranged from 30 to 37 cm in depth, for an average of 35 cm. Four tests on vegetationstabilized benches revealed 3–15-cm-thick veneers of loose clay loam or clay loam
mixed with variable amounts of clay over very damp to dry, often tacky, moderately
to well-consolidated silty clay or clay. Silty clay or clay was present from the
surface in the other tests. Carbonates were observed in silty clay at 35 cm below
the surface in one test. Gravels and Rabdotus snail shells are common to abundant
on the surface but rare in shovel tests, and subsurface gravels were typically very
small. Several larger gravels ranging from 8 to 15 cm in length were buried in the
upper 20 cm of sediment consisting of mixed clay loam and clay above a clay basal
layer in Shovel Test DB31. A tested gravel was recovered at 0–10 cm below the
surface in the same test, but no other subsurface artifacts were recovered. Shovel
test results and the geomorphological characteristics suggest this archeological
deposit is primarily restricted to the surface, with some shallowly buried artifacts
on vegetation-stabilized benches.
Site 41SR452 is on stable to degrading surfaces primarily impacted by waterderived erosion and eolian deflation. Other natural disturbances include animal
burrowing, near-surface root growth, and stock grazing. Historic overgrazing and

repetitive vegetation control/clearing efforts have exacerbated surface degradation.
Google Earth satellite imagery indicates areas to either side of the tributary
vegetation belt were cleared of woody and brushy vegetation in 1995 and again
in 2005. The site also has been impacted by the creation and use of dirt two-track
roads and possible mid-twentieth-century fence installation (NETR Online 2017).
Site 41SR453
Site 41SR453 is a lithic procurement area that extends across the entirety of
Survey Area 11 and beyond (Figure 13). It is about 0.5 km southeast of Pipeline Drive,
5.5 km east-northeast of U.S. Highway 83, and 10 km east-southeast of the nearest
point on Falcon Reservoir. The delineated site area is about 0.4 km southwest of the
centroid for 41SR402 documented at a nearby Kinder Morgan Plant (see Table 2).
The site is on flat to very gently sloping surfaces on either side of a north-draining
Arroyo del Tigre Chiquita tributary. The ephemeral drainage passes through a wide,
very shallow upland valley formed by a prominent north-south ridge to the west and
much lower but slightly elevated terrain to the east. Surfaces in the documented
site area slope almost imperceptibly toward the tributary and dip very gradually
to the north-northwest. Elevations vary from about 418 to 422 ft above mean sea
level. Soils are mapped as Catarina clay with 0–5 percent slopes. Sediments vary
between silty and sandy clay loam, silty and sandy clay, and clay. The vegetation is
noted above in the description of Survey Area 11. Surface visibility is 0–65 percent.
Part of a larger upland lithic scatter, 41SR453 consists of a broad, very
sparse, surface to near-surface deposit of chipped stone artifacts scattered among
small common surface and near-surface lag gravels. Observed lithic material types
include chert, quartzite, rhyolite, and common tabular pieces of silicified wood. The
observed chipped stone assemblage—debitage, tested gravels, cores, and an earlystage silicified wood biface fragment—is indicative of material procurement, testing,
and early-stage core reduction using locally available lag gravels. The extent and
character of the deposit suggests it is derived from repeated nonintensive use.
The recorded site area encompasses the 11,419-m2 survey area and has
maximum dimensions of 108x106 m. Six shovel tests ranged from 25 to 55 cm in
depth, for an average of 36 cm. A small flake was recovered at 0–20 cm (probably
from the upper 10 cm) in Shovel Test DB32, but the flake may have been produced
during excavation. The tests revealed 10–18 cm of loose to moderately consolidated
mixed silty, loamy and clayey sediments over silty clay or mixed sandy clay and clay
in three tests. Homogenous silty clay or clay was present from the surface in the
other three. Inclusions were rare overall, consisting of occasional Rabdotus shells
and small gravels. The small flake recovered in Shovel Test DB32 may be derived
from digging through a thin lens of small gravels encountered at 10 cm below the
surface in that test. Occasional carbonate filaments were noted in one of the tests
where clay was present from the surface. The presence of exposed or shallow clays
and the frequency of tabular fragments of silicified wood suggest the documented
portion of 41SR453 is on the exposed, eroded contact of a Tertiary-age geologic
deposit. The geomorphological characteristics and the shovel test results suggest this
archeological deposit is primarily if not completely relegated to the modern surface.

52

Archeological Survey of 38 acres, Starr County, Texas
Site 41SR453 is on stable to degrading surfaces primarily impacted by
water-derived erosion and eolian deflation. Other natural disturbances include
near-surface root growth and stock grazing. Historic overgrazing and repetitive
vegetation control/clearing efforts have exacerbated surface degradation. A 1964
aerial image indicates the northwest portion of the site was impacted by the creation
and use of a dirt two-track road (NETR Online 2017), and Google Earth satellite
imagery indicates woody and brushy vegetation east of the tributary was cleared or
at least thinned in 1995 and ca. 2005. The site was further disturbed by clearing of
a 10–15-m-wide access corridor across the south half of the documented site area.
Site 41SR454
Site 41SR454 is a lithic procurement locality and possible open campsite
identified along the northwest edge of Survey Area 8 (Figure 14). It is about 0.6 km
northeast of 41SR450, 2.2 km southeast of Pipeline Drive, 7 km east-northeast of
U.S. Highway 83, and 12 km east-northeast of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir.
The documented site area extends northwest of Survey Area 8 along a mapped
tributary of Los Barrosos Creek, just above its juncture with an unmapped drainage
that borders the east side of the site. A northwest-southeast sendero/dirt two-track
road serves as the arbitrary west site boundary. The site area encompasses sparse to
moderate-density lag gravels on flat to gently sloping surfaces on the floor of a broad
shallow upland tributary valley. The gravels are primarily on the modern surface
or shallowly buried within the top 10 cm. Surfaces slope very gradually toward
tributaries, dipping slightly to the east and southeast. Elevations range from about
420 to 425 ft. Soils are mapped as Montell clay with 0–3 percent slopes (SoilWeb
2017). Sediments consist of clay loam or silty clay. The vegetation is consistent with
that described above for Survey Area 8. Surface visibility is 10–70 percent.
Site 41SR454 is a broad low-density surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts
among lag gravels of multiple lithologies. Observed material types include various
cherts, rhyolite, sandstone, and silicified wood and palm wood. Observed artifacts
include a possible silicified palm wood Clear Fork tool preform, early-stage biface
fragments, a rhyolite flake knife and other flake tools, and cores. Widely scattered
burned rocks may reflect Native American use. The chipped stone assemblage is
primarily derived from lithic material testing and procurement but also includes
examples of early-stage biface and perhaps uniface manufacture and the production
of informal flake tools. The presence of large flake tools (which might be agave
knives) and scattered burned rocks suggests short-term habitation and local floral
resource procurement. No unmistakable diagnostic artifacts were identified, and no
archeological features were observed. If the palm wood artifact is a Clear Fork tool
preform, then it is likely indicative of an Early or Middle Archaic component as no
evidence of earlier components was observed (Turner et al. 2011:225). The extent
and character of the deposit suggest it is derived from repeated nonintensive use.
The possible preform and rhyolite flake knife were collected for later
examination. The former is a rectilinear tabular piece of palm wood with maximum
dimensions of 93x47x23 mm. Invasive flaking along the margin removed most of the
cortex on one face. The wide possible bit end exhibits some bifacial flake removal

but is dominated by a prominent 45–50º angle that trends downward from the
unifacially flaked face. The flake knife is derived from an oval gravel and retains a
cortical surface on its proximal end. Battering on this margin suggests the gravel
may have been used as a hammerstone. The dorsal surface is scarred by flake
removal, and variable oxidation between some of these scars suggests the flake may
have been removed from a much older tested gravel or core. The distal end and one
side margin exhibit unifacial retouch that extends onto the dorsal surface. Some
marginal crushing is apparent, but no polish is evident. The flake is 69 mm long
and 64 mm wide and has a maximum thickness of 21 mm.
The delineated site area encompasses 7,305 m2, and has approximate
maximum dimensions of 135x84 m. This is undoubtedly part of a much larger
site area. Shovel Tests DB40 and JD32 were excavated to depth of 30 and 40 cm.
The former revealed 5 cm of loose granular clay loam above mixed, moderately
consolidated, tacky clay loam and clay that graded to well-consolidated tacky clay
by 12–15 cm below the surface. The central zone of sediment contained occasional
fine to small gravels and Rabdotus shell fragments. Shovel Test JD32 revealed
damp tacky clay with carbonate nodules and filaments, a few small gravels, and a
few Rabdotus shells from top to bottom. No artifacts were recovered in these tests.
The geomorphological characteristics of area surfaces, ancient age of the
underlying geologic deposit, nature of site use, and shovel test results suggest this
archeological deposit is primarily if not completely relegated to the modern surface.
The site has been impacted by water-derived surface erosion, eolian deflation, nearsurface root growth, and livestock traffic. Surface degradation has been exacerbated
by previous vegetation control/clearing efforts, historic overgrazing, and continued
stock grazing. Activities associated with fence installation, dirt and gravel road
construction, and the creation of a sendero/dirt two-track road have further impacted
parts of the site surface. Construction of water impoundment features on the
tributary just above 41SR454 probably impacted undocumented parts of the site.
Site 41SR455
Site 41SR455 is an open campsite and associated lithic procurement area
that extends across the northwestern 60 percent of Survey Area 13 and beyond
(Figure 15). It is 2.8 km southeast of Pipeline Drive, 5.9 km east-northeast of U.S.
Highway 83, and 11 km east-northeast of the nearest point on Falcon Reservoir.
Site 41SR451 is 0.4 km to the northwest. Site 41SR455 is on sloping to nearly level
surfaces on the south half of a broad northeast-southwest interfluve that divides
intermittent tributaries of Los Barrosos Creek. The north edge runs along or close to
the interfluve crest; the south edge of the site is bordered by mapped and unmapped,
easterly flowing, wet-weather drainages. In general, surfaces dip from southwest
to northeast along the interfluve toward flatter terrain in the eastern third of the
site and to the southeast from the interfluve crest to flats or benches along the
drainages that serve as the southern site boundary. Elevations vary from about 410
to 425 ft. Soils are mapped as Catarina clay association with 0–5 percent slopes
(SoilWeb 2017), and sediments are composed of silty clay loam or sandy silt above
silty clay. Surfaces are blanketed by common to abundant surface and near-surface

lag gravels, which are densest in the higher west half of the site. Interfluve and
bench surfaces have been impacted by sheetwash, surface rilling, and downslope
creep. Surfaces along the drainages have been affected by bank erosion and headcutting gullies. Vegetation across the lower eastern third of the site is consistent
with that described above for Survey Area 13. Vegetation on elevated portions of the
interfluve consists of scattered but moderately dense ceniza and blackbrush with
some granjeno, guajillo, and Texas ebony; scattered young mesquite, prickly pear,
and tasajillo; and occasional Spanish dagger and other yucca species. Open areas
support sparse short bunch grasses and forbs. Surface visibility varies from 0 to 95
percent and is typically greater than 30 percent.
The documented site is likely a portion of a larger site area that may extend
across the entire landform framed by the Los Barrosos Creek tributaries. It is a
common to abundant, surface to near-surface deposit of chipped stone artifacts with
occasional ground/battered stones and burned rocks scattered among lag gravels.
Artifacts and gravels are most abundant on the higher parts of the landform in the
west half of the site. Local material types include various cherts (including black
chert), jasper, rhyolite, basalt, occasional chalcedony (or very white chert), tabular
silicified wood, and limestone and fossiliferous limestone. At least some of the
silicified wood and limestone is likely eroding out of Jackson Formation sediments.
Observed artifacts include an adze-like Olmos biface (chert), a proximal-medial biface
fragment (chert), a mid-to-late stage proximal biface fragment (jasper), late-stage
and resharpened biface fragments, primary to tertiary flakes, early-to-late-stage
cores, tested gravels, hammerstones, and a pendant plummet fragment (quartzite).
Scattered burned limestone and fossiliferous limestone along the interfluve crest in
the west half may be derived from Native American use. No identifiable archeological
features were observed. The chipped stone assemblage indicates material testing,
selection, and tool manufacture. The presence of formal chipped stone tools, laterstage and resharpened chipped stone tool fragments, the pecked and abraded
plummet fragment, and scattered burned rocks suggests the interfluve served as a
campsite. The Olmos biface is a small, trianglar, bifacially worked, beveled-edge tool
form that dates to the latter part of the Late Archaic period. The proximal-medial
biface fragment shows an affinity to the Kinney point style, which dates to the Middle
Archaic period (Turner et al. 2011). The presence of these tool forms suggests the
deposit is derived from repeated short-term use over time.
The proximal-medial biface fragment and plummet fragment were collected
for later examination (Figure 16). The former was fashioned from heat-treated chert,
used, and eventually truncated by a bending fracture. The remaining part is a narrow
triangle with a slightly concave basal margin and pronounced, alternately beveled
lateral edges that taper inward gradually from the base. It is 43.0 mm long, 25.6 mm
wide at the base with a maximum blade width of 24.5 mm, and 5.8 mm thick with
a lenticular cross section. Edge angles range from 37 to 45º. This biface fragment is
morphologically and technologically very similar to the Group 4 Kinney bifaces from
the Anthon site (41UV60) in Uvalde County. The width and thickness of the collected
specimen fall within (or are closely similar to) the range of variation exhibited by
that artifact group (Goode 2002:Table1). According to Goode (2002:40, 47), Group

4 specimens fall at the end of a linear sequence of use, rejuventation, and reuse
characterized by changes to overall shape and size loss throughout the sequence.
The five Group 4 specimens in the Anthon study are long narrow triangles with flat
to lenticular cross sections and concave to straight basal margins. These specimens
have convex, alternately beveled blade edges that recurve to sharp twisted tips.
These bifaces were used as knives, the thinner and flatter cross sections allowing
for repeated resharpening until edge angles exceeded 60–70º, at which point they
became ineffective as cutting tools and may have been repurposed as skinning tools
(Goode 2002:43, 47–48).
The quartzite pendant plummet fragment is an elongated teardrop-shaped
artifact with an oval cross section. Peck marks are discernible on portions of this
abraded, well-smoothed, and partially polished artifact. Broken proximally, the
remaining artifact is 85.9 mm long and has a maximum width and thickness of
28.8 and 24.1 mm. Pecked, ground, and polished ornamental artifacts like this
specimen have been recovered at sites across south Texas but are under-reported
in the literature when compared to other regions of the state (Hester et al. 1978;
Mitchell 1975).
The delineated site area encompasses 34,184 m 2 and has maximum
dimensions of 409x109 m. Three shovel tests excavated on low flat terrain in the
eastern third ranged from 25 to 50 cm deep, averaging 34 cm. These tests revealed
3–10 cm of dry loose silty clay loam or sandy silt over damp moderately to wellconsolidated tacky silty clay. A tested chert cobble was recovered at 0–10 cm in Shovel
Test DB41, but no other inclusions were observed. This test and the geomorphological
characteristics of the landform suggest this archeological deposit is primarily
restricted to the modern surface.
Site 41SR455 is on stable to degrading surfaces primarily affected by
water-derived surface erosion, downslope creep, and eolian deflation. Other natural
disturbances include near-surface root growth, feral pig rooting, and stock grazing.
Historic and modern aerial photographs (NETR Online 2017) and Google Earth

satellite imagery indicate the site has been moderately to densely vegetated since
at least the mid-1960s, but parts have been impacted by vegetation clearing along
numerous property partition and access alignments and possible utility alignments.
The site has been further disturbed by vehicle traffic along dirt two-track roads, and
the south edge was impacted by fence installation and removal. Historic overgrazing,
continued stock grazing, and previous vegetation clearing efforts have exacerbated
natural degradation in the site area.
ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This survey resulted in the documentation of nine previously unrecorded
Native American archeological sites. All are on terrain formed by Tertiary-age
undivided Jackson Group deposits or on narrow bands of Holocene alluvium
inset into those deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976), owing in part to the
ubiquitous presence of useable lag gravels. Two are open campsites associated with
lithic procurement localities (41SR448, and 41SR455), four are lithic procurement
localities that might have been used occasionally as campsites (41SR447, 41SR449,
41SR452, and 41SR454), and three are lithic procurement localities with no
indication of sustained human habitation (41SR450, 41SR451, and 41SR453). Based
on the characteristics summarized below, all are judged to lack the capacity to yield
important information and are considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D.
All of these sites are on stable to degrading landforms. Seven are on the
exposed and weathered contacts of Tertiary-age geologic deposits. Holocene alluvium
is mapped along the tributaries that pass through 41SR448 and 41SR449, but shovel
testing suggests these deposits are thin if present at all. Varying densities of surface
and near-surface lag gravels are present at all of these sites, and the archeological
deposits are primarily restricted to the surface and composed of sparse to abundant
scatters of chipped stone artifacts. Assemblage abundance and variability at
41SR448 and 41SR455 are suggestive of repeated short-term habitation. The other
site assemblages primarily indicate lithic material procurement and early-stage
reduction. Hammerstones were observed at six sites (41SR448–41SR452 and
41SR455), and ground/abraded artifacts were found at two (41SR448 and 41SR455).
Isolated to occasional pieces of burned rocks potentially derived from Native
American use were observed at six sites (41SR447–41SR449, 41SR452, 41SR454,
and 41SR455), but no archeological features were identified. Middle to Late Archaic
period dart point fragments were recovered at 41SR448, and diagnostic bifaces that
date to the Middle and Late Archaic periods were observed or collected at 41SR455.
Possible Clear Fork tool preforms at 41SR451 and 41SR454 may indicate Early to
Middle Archaic components at those sites. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
identified at the five other sites.
The character of the assemblages and the geomorphological characteristics
of the associated landforms (including ubiquitous lag gravels) suggest that the
archeological deposits are palimpsests of repeated short-term use throughout
prehistory. All of these sites have been disturbed to varying degrees by water and
wind-derived erosion, livestock grazing, near-surface root growth, and periodic

59

vegetation clearing. Historic overgrazing, continued stock grazing, and vegetation
removal have exacerbated natural surface degradation processes. Given the limited
artifact variability and uncertain depositional history, the degraded conditions of
the surfaces on which they sit, the paucity of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and
the apparent absence of prehistoric features, the remaining archeological deposits
cannot be interpreted in any meaningful way. While identification of these sites builds
on existing site distribution data useful in a gross sense for understanding Native
American landscape utilization in the Southern Texas Plains ecological region, the
aforementioned limiting factors indicate the archeological deposits at these nine
sites do not retain integrity or significance. No further work is recommended at
these sites.
