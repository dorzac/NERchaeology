PREHISTORIC SOCIAL BOUNDARIES:
AN ARCHEOLOGICAL MODEL AND TEST
I. NED WOODALL

ABSTRACT
Using a series of late prehistoric Caddoan sites along the Neches River of
Texas, an attempt is made to detect the location of ancient social boundaries. The model assumes that there is less social interaction between
autonomous sociopolitical groups than within such groups. Thus
measurements of intersite ceramic variability through space will reveal a
disproportionate increase when such a boundary is crossed. The use of
Pearson product-moment statistic r, comparing geographic distance with
ceramic variability, suggests the presence of a boundary in the area under
study. This boundary probably marks the division between two tribes of
the Caddoan Hasinai confederacy.

INTRODUCTION

The definition of prehistoric sociocultural units comparable to
those of the ethnographer has been a difficult task for the archeologist. Recent studies by Hill (1967), Longacre (1964), Deetz
(1965) and others have focused on one aspect of this problem, pointing out archeological evidence for particular post-marital residence
patterns and the detection of kin groups, most notably extended
matrilocal families. This paper suggests a method for defining a
more inclusive sociopolitical unit, the tribe, through the analysis of
artifact attributes, their variation and distribution. More precisely, I
have attempted to determine the location of those emic boundaries
to social intercourse that allow the anthropologist to distinguish the
more or less distinct social and cultural units commonly referred to
as "tribes" (Service 1971).
The area under investigation lies in the upper Neches River basin
of northeast Texas, part of the much larger Caddoan region. The
Neches flows through territory occupied, in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, by the historic Hasinai confederacy, a loose
political and religious union composed of ten tribes (Swanton
1942:7-16). The late prehistoric occupation is marked by numerous
sites grouped into the Titus and Frankston’foci of the Fulton Aspect.
It is with these sites -- believed to date between A.D. 1200-1500 -that this analysis is concerned.
In 1957 construction of a small dam on the Neches to create Lake
Palestine prompted an archeological survey of the area (Johnson

102

1961). Data obtained from this reconnaissance was used to determine if in the territory covered by the survey, measuring approximately 25 km. north-south and 10 km. east-west, there was to
be found the patterning of artifact attributes which satisfies the archeological model of tribal boundaries.

FORMULATION OF THE MODEL
In dealing with a tribal organization, such distinguishing or
defining measures as the extent of pan-tribal sodalities (e.g., clans
or age-grade societies) or linguistic differences cannot be detected
with present archeological methods. The use of endogamy as a
defining criterion for a social unit appears to be more useful from
the standpoint of the archeologist, however. The Deetz and Longacre
studies already mentioned have demonstrated the possibility of
finding residence and, inferentially, marriage patterns revealed in
the archeological record, and further expansion of this sort of
analysis is the basis of the present approach. For the purpose of
delineating the social limits of a particular tribe I shall use the
smallest endogamous group present in an area. The geographical size
of the area would vary with the economic system of the tribes
present; it would be much larger for the highly mobile Plains Indian
than for the largely sedentary eastern horticulturalists such as the
Caddo. Also, our criterion of endogamy will hold only for societies
at the tribal level of sociopolitical integration.
To find the smallest’endogamous unit in a band society would
lead to the inclusion of numerous groups having little or no political
commonality; also in a stratified society such as a chiefdom, the
smallest endogamous unit may be a class of individuals within the
society. Hence the definition proposed here is not designed to reveal
the presence or absence of tribal level society. Other means for this
are available, e.g., the presence of ascribed status in the archeological record (Binford 1962). What I am offering is a definition
which will allow the archeologist to divide a continuum of artifact
types and sites into meaningful social units when he already is
relatively certain he is dealing with tribal societies. In the absence
of any contrary evidence in the archeological record, and with the
positive indications supplied by the historical record, I believe this
assumption can be made for the late prehistoric Caddo in the
Neches basin. Once the archeologist working in the Caddoan area
moves back into the period of large-scale mound construction, mass
burials suggestive of retainer sacrifice, and sites on the size scale of

PREHISTORIC SOCIAL BOUNDARIES

103

George C. Davis or Spiro, then he will find it necessary to demonstrate that he is dealing with a particular level of sociocultural integration and alter his model accordingly.
To determine more precisely what to expect of a social group such
as a tribe in regard to its archeological evidence, consider some of
the implications of a matrilocal tribal society with a dispersed settlement pattern. First of all, if women are the potters, and a girl is
taught the craft by her female relatives, the archeologist would expect village microtraditions to develop. The presence of several
generations of potters would produce an intellectual inbreeding of
design motifs, vessel shapes and possibly other attributes which
work to distinguish wares of a particular lineage in comparison with
others. This phenomenon has been demonstrated for the Southwest
(Longacre 1964: Hill 1967).
In the case of small hamlets, Caddo males would be likely to
marry outside their own village of orientation in order to keep the
incest taboo. If the men learn flint-knapping from male relatives in
their youth, then any microtraditions in stone thus produced would
be expected to have a more dispersed pattern than those of the
women. Hence the smallest areal distribution of male-created
microtraditions would coincide with tribal boundaries, assuming
that the tribe represents a random breeding population, i.e., that any
male was likely to be selected as a mate as any other male. Unfortunately, stone tools and flakes are exceedingly rare in the collections used in the following analysis, but this part of the model can
be expected to have an expanded application once sufficient
amounts of these materials are systematically collected.
Although a single tribe can be expected to embrace several
ceramic microtraditions (the number being a factor of the number
of matrilineages present), the tribe as a whole will also circumscribe
a number of ceramic modes which, when plotted on a distribution
map, should conform to the social (i.e., endogamous) boundaries.
This is predicated on the assumption that the tribes comprising the
confederacy were formed in a situation of relative isolation, either
cultural or geographical, and that there was, and remained, more interaction on a social basis within the tribe than between tribes.
Longacre (1964:157-8) has suggested a correlation between levels of
ceramic analysis (type-variety-lineage style) and levels of
sociopolitical interaction (tribe-village-lineage). Hill (1966:21) has
inferred that social distance between residential areas within a
single site may be suggested by the "tightness" of clustering of
stylistic traits in each of the areas. That there is a clear-cut relation-

104

ship between attribute combinations and social units in the Caddoan area is yet to be demonstrated; students in the area have long
been warned, wisely I believe/against attributing any social reality
to the McKern taxonomic units which are composed almost entirely
of pottery types. On the other hand, in at least one situation it has
been demonstrated that "social demography and social organization
are reflected in the material cultural system" (Longacre 1964:158).
Indeed, the anthropologist who believes that patterned behavior
must manifest itself in a patterning of the results of that behavior
(the artifacts), and that a particular behavior pattern is largely controlled by socially contracted norms, cannot avoid the implication
that such a social unit as a tribe will leave a record of its distinctiveness in the archeological record. This is true provided the norms
are sufficiently diverse from tribe to tribe so as to produce a
discernible artifact variation. From Spanish and French sources,
which state that there were religious and linguistic differences
within the Hasinai confederacy, this can be assumed.
For a cogent and objective analysis of microtraditions, both
within and between sites, certain statistical methods will be
necessary. Since this analysis is designed to detect social units
larger than the minimum residence groups (the family), betweensite comparisons will be of initial concern.
The first step requires a sherd-by-sherd examination during
which a table of the smallest analytical units, the modes (after Rouse
1965:92), will be composed. This table lists every mode present, the
sites at which it is found, and its percentile representation at that
site as well as its frequency.
Once the relative frequency (i.e., percentages) of each mode in a
site is known, all sites can be compared using the RobinsonBrainerd seriation technique (Robinson 1951). It must be understood
that while this technique was originally devised for chronological
ordering of deposits, actually it simply measures the degree of
similarity between artifact assemblages. Whether the measured differences are due to time, "social distance," or some other factor,
such as functional variation, must be determined another way. In
this instance all variation is assumed to be due to social distance,
since the sites are believed to be contemporaneous as judged by
their resident ceramic types.
Now, what sort of sociocultural implications can be derived from
the above measurements? If we are operating on the assumption of
differential social interaction within a confederacy, i.e., that there is
more interaction within a tribe than between tribes, then it follows

PREHISTORIC SOCIAL BOUNDARIES

105

that if pottery design is at least a crude index to this interaction, we
can expect less radical shift in the computed coefficient of similarity
between sites of a single tribe than between sites formed by
populations of two different tribes. The degree of this variation is
dependent on innumerable factors, among them geographical
distance, linguistic similarities, common cultural traditions, etc. All

of these factors, however, are assumed to operate to a lesser extent
within a tribe than between tribes, thereby accounting for the
assumption above, i.e., that there is less variation within a tribe than
between two tribes. (Fig. 1).
Moving now to the particular sites used (Fig. 2), seven were
chosen from the 40-odd found by Johnson’s survey of Lake Palestine
(Johnson 1961).

In addition, two sites found by the WPA crews in the 1930’s in
this same area were included (Cook and Snow sites). Each site
collection displayed at least 100 occurrences of the selected ceramic
modes. The first part of the analysis was concerned with the method
of decoration, i.e., is there a discernible, significant variation in the
method of decoration within the area? In fact this analysis was intended to act as a pilot project which would suggest the feasibility or
possibility of success of a more detailed study. Toward this end 22
modes of ceramic decoration method were listed, these being
chosen by shuffling through all the sherds heaped together with no
regard at that point to individual site location. The 22 modes found
occurring within the combined samples are as follows:

22. Incising, overhanging lines

The qualifiers small, medium, and large or narrow and wide are not
as subjective as they might appear. The narrow lines found on incised sherds are deep slits, probably made with a flint flake. Often
these lines have been re-closed at spots as the potter manipulated
file still-wet vessel. The medium lines are those most commonly
found; apparently they were formed by dragging a small twig
through the wet clay, as often there is a brushed effect within the
line probably caused by fraying wood. The wide incised lines are
comparable in breadth to the "trailing" found on certain Caddoan
types. Little difficulty was experienced separating the incised
sherds into three categories. The same can be said for the punctated
sherds; in this case "large" refers to the tool used for punctation and
includes those larger than the diameter of an ordinary lead pencil.
Again there was little difficulty, most of the punctations being
decisively larger or smaller than the total number of modes from
that site. The sites used, and the mode totals, are as follows:

Following the previously described steps, the resultant coefficients
of agreement were arranged in an ordered matrix as shown in Table
1. If one examines the above order, and then checks the site
distribution map (Fig. 2), he will find an apparent coincidence of
site association. More precisely, the ordering of the sites by
similarities in the method of decoration and by geographical
distance is shown in Table 2.

If we consider the foregoing arrangement of sites as an ordinal
scale in which each column ranks the sites -- the first by artifact
similarity and the other by distance from an imaginary point lying
south of the Cook Site -- the correlation between the two can be
measured by Kendall’s tau. This is a statistical measure of the
degree to which pairs in the proper order exceed in number those in
the reverse order (Blalock 1960:321). Assigning the values 1, 2, 3, etc.
respectively, to sites, proceeding from the southern to the northernmost, i.e., from Cook (Rank 1) to SM 91 (Rank 9), the following
computation of tau results:

tau

S
1/2N (N-l)

where S is a measure of differences in order occurring betwe.en the
two arrangements, and N is the number of cases. In this instance tau
is calculated as .67. A null hypothesis of independence between the
two rankings can be tested by

Z

S
"V/1/18 N (N-l)

or Z = 2.5,
(2N~5)

significant at the .01 level.
The closeness of the two arrangements tends to verify the earlier
assumption that the detected variation would be due to social
distance rather than time. If time were the main factor underlying
the variation, then there would be no explanation for the horizontal
seriation other than an unequal rate of diffusion, unlikely within
such a small area. Rather one would expect similar sites from both
the northern and southern ends of the area, and also dissimilar sites
at either end -- in other words, the distribution of similar sites
would be geographically random. Even more interesting than the
relative positioning of the sites in a rank-order scale is the
correlation between geographical distance intervening between
every possible site pair and their shared coefficient of agreement.
The Kendall’s tau test above shows only that a positive relationship
exists between these two values; the degree of correlation can be
indexed by another statistic, the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient r.
In order to prevent a negative correlation, the coefficient of
agreement will be converted so as to yield smaller numbers as the
similarity between

sites increases; this is done by simply

110

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

subtracting each of the indices in Table 1 from 200. Geographical
distance will be measured in airline kilometers between each of the
compared sites. The raw data of the calculations are shown in Table
3. The computed correlation coefficient r of .43 suggests a rather
strong relationship between geographical distance and ceramic
decoration methods. The r, converted to the F statistic for the
analysis of variance test yields the quantity 7.72, easily significant to
the .01 level. That is, less than one trial out of 100 would yield by
chance alone such a correlation between distance and changes in
decoration method, with no real correlation existing in the universe,
i.e., among all the late prehistoric sites now or ever present in the
area. If the aberrant Site 41 SM 91 is disregarded, the correlation
arises to an amazing .75, significant at the .001 level of significance.
In the preceding discussion I have equated social distance with
geographical distance, seemingly legitimate if we conceive of interacting social groups such as tribes to be spatially segregated from
similarly conceived units. Thus one would expect a correlation between social interaction (already assumed to be reflected in artifact
similarities) and geographical distance, but one would not expect
this correlation ever to be perfect. The reason can be explained by
the following example: imagine two segregated tribes making quite
different pottery but living in contiguous areas, each occupying 40
square kilometers of a territory, say, 4 km. wide and 20 km. long.
There would occur a positive correlation between distance and artifact similarity since one group lives in the southern half and the
other in the northern half of the territory. The correlation would
become very weak, however, in regard to those specific sites occurring near the mutual boundary, since these would be quite close
geographically but different in regard to ceramics. Assuming we
had an equal number of sites on either side of the boundary and the
sites within each of the two tribal territories were randomly
distributed we would not expect a correlation approaching 1.0.
Given such a case, the archeologist would re-examine his data,
especially the ordered matrix, to see if any sites seemed to cluster-i.e., ’whether there occurs a radical shift in the coefficients of
agreement that might indicate a social boundary had been crossed.
At this stage of analyzing the Neches River sites there is an intimation of such a cluster, namely sites SM 89, SM 87, and SM 90.
These three have coefficients of agreement of 157, 168, and 179; the
next most similar site, HE 22, is some 19 units below 157. There is
then a shift of some 19 units, while within this group of three sites,
and within the remaining group of six (Snow, Cook, CE 39, SM 82,

SM 91, and HE 22), there is a smoother continuum of change in
decoration methods from site to site.
It has been assumed that the higher degree of social interaction
taking place within a tribe would result in greater artifact
similarities. Social interaction is abetted by tribal endogamy, with
intra-tribal artifact variation occurring among women’s products
because of matrilocal microtraditions. If one takes then a synchronic view of a region encompassing two or more sedentary
tribes, beginning at a site farthest removed from the common
boundary between the two and moving toward it, one will expect
change in the artifacts increasing as does distance from the original
site (due at least in part to the matrilocal microtraditions). In
crossing the boundary, however, there will be a disproportionate increase in the continuum of change as measured by the coefficient of
agreement. After the boundary is crossed, the continuum will
decrease its slope, our concern being entirely with sites of the
second tribe. This model can be expressed diagrammatically as
Figure la. For a graphic presentation of this continuum of change
among the sites involved in the present study, see Figure lb and
compare the actual with the ideal.

TESTING THE MODEL: ANALYSIS OF DESIGN MOTIF
Because of the small size of the average individual potsherd it was
seldom possible to see a complete design motif or even a whole
element of that motif. In one sense this may have had a beneficial
influence on the study; it forced attention to miniscule variations
which may have been a result of unconscious adherence on the part
of the potter to modes of decoration learned early in her career.
These are presumably inviolate to change despite widespread diffusion of total design motifs and methods which comprise the archeologists’ types of Caddoan ceramics. Longacre, for a similar
reason, isolated certain design elements which he hoped would be
"nonconsciously selected based upon learning patterns within the
social frame" (1964:163).
Of course it was not known initially which, if any, of the observed
variations would be significant for the purpose at hand, i.e.,
delimiting the range and extent of social interaction. Consequently
the sherds were classified several times, each time with a different
criterion as the basis for the categories. Most of these classifications
ended with a random distribution -- the resultant categories coincided not at all with a geographical affinity of the contributing sites,

113

PREHISTORIC SOCIAL BOUNDARIES

or the specimens from several sites would be about equally divided
between the groups. However, there were a few classifications that
did yield a set of categories, the components of which were
segregated geographically as well as stylistically. As will be pointed
out in the following pages, the separation was largely in agreement
with that discovered in the analysis of modes of decoration method.
Each time the distribution of a particular design element was
analyzed, the contributing sites were re-arranged and gerrymandered in order to get the highest possible chi-square. In every case it
was found that the most marked variation coincided with the findings of the analysis of method of decoration, i.e., northern sites (SM
90, 87, and 89) vs. Southern (HE 22, SM 82, CE 39, Snow, Cook). Site
SM 91 consistently was more similar in design elements to the
northern sites and was included with them in the chi-square tables.

STRAIGHT PARALLEL LINES
An example of the classification based on mode of design
element involved sherds marked solely with straight parallel lines.
There are 63 such specimens, some engraved and some incised,
some "sloppy" and some neatly executed, and of a variety of
thicknesses. A separation of these on the basis of the space between
the lines was found to be most fruitful, however. Sherds which were
decorated with straight parallel lines spaced less than 6.0 mm. apart
were separated from those with more widely spaced lines; in the
case of sets of such lines it was the intervening space within the set

rather than between sets that was the determinant. Of course any
two sherds which appeared to be of the same vessel were counted as
one. The resulting groups were tested for statistical significance by
chi-square as shown in Table 4. The computed chi-square is
significant at the .01 level -- we would expect such a distribution of
stylistic traits in question to occur by chance only once in every
hundred times the samples were drawn.
HACHURING
A prominent, easily recognized design is the use of sets of parallel
lines intersecting and crossing, creating a hachured or diamonds effect. Twenty-eight such sherds were present, and it was clear even
when the initial classification was in progress that this design was
over-represented in the northern sites. Again, both engraved and incised specimens were used, but are lumped together in the chisquare test (Table 5). The computed chi-square of 5.2 is significant
at the .05 level.

FILLED AREAS
There are 36 sherds in the collection exhibiting zones of short
straight or curved lines circumscribed by either two parallel lines
(resulting in a ladder-like element) or two converging lines (the
filled triangle). Separating these specimens into ladder-like or
triangular elements gave the following contingency table (Table 6).
The computed chi-square value of 6.4 is significant at the .02 level.

CONCENTRIC LINES
Twenty sherds show gently curving concentric lines spaced at
various widths and occasionally intersecting a second set of similar
lines. Within the category no significant differences between sites
could be detected, but the occurrence of the design element was
predominantly in the southern sites. If chi-square is calculated
using as the categories sherds with concentric lines and sherds
without such lines (as was done for hachured sherds), the results
are as shown in Table 7. The chi-square is significant at the .10
level.

SMOOTHING AND POLISHING
The separation of those sherds categorized as highly smoothed or
polished provides one of the most marked difference between the
northern and southern sites. The terms highly smoothed (low burnish) and polished (high burnish) are relative ones, relative only to
the remainder of sherds in the sample at hand. All except one, a
punctated-incised specimen, are decorated by engraving. When
examined under a magnifying glass, all the sherds revealed small
pits or depressions with a matte finish; these are spots unreached by
the polishing stone, and indicate that the sheen thus imparted was
not a natural result of using certain clays (Shepard 1954:122). Small
sherds did not always present such evidence, but were included in
the sample under the assumption that the evidence was missing due
to vagaries of breakage.
Making the analysis of this category less convincing than it might
be is the fact that sherds from two of the southern sites, Cook and
Snow, may have been buried until their recovery by the WPA field
crew -- the notes fail to clear this detail. If they were buried it is not
known how this will affect the preservation of the surface finish.
Because the high percentage of lustrous sherds at these two sites
might be due to differential preservation, two chi-square tests were
conducted, the first using the Cook and Snow artifacts, the second
excluding them. The results are shown in Tables 8 and 9. The chisquare of Table 8 is significant at the .01 level. Now excluding the
two sites Cook and Snow, the contingency table appears as shown
in Table 9. The value of chi-square is significant at the .33 level.

OTHER DECORATION MODES
A few of those modes of decoration which did not prove to have a
significantly distinct variation in their geographical distribution
should be mentioned. Using three such modes involving punctation,
three nonexclusive categories were set up and tested by chi-square:
free punctation, linear punctation, and zoned punctation. None of
these had a restricted occurrence, nor did the combination of any
two or all three categories. In fact this was not wholly unexpected
and served in one way to bolster the suggestion that differences
found significant in previous chi-square tests were products of
social distance. To explain, the use of punctation -- particularly
zoned punctation -- is generally conceded to be more typical of
early Caddoan sites (Gibson Aspect) than late sites. Such types as
Weches Fingernail Impressed, Pennington Punctated-Incised, and
Crockett Curvilinear Incised all exhibit zoned punctation, and are
considered indicative of the earlier part of the Caddoan time span. If
the punctated sherds in the present sample -- or even some few of
them -- belong to an earlier time period than that of the remaining
decorated sherds, one would not expect a distribution of
microtraditions congruent with the later wares.
Other modes investigated but deemed random in their
distribution include ticked lines, excised pendant triangles, and random incisions or "slashes". In all three of these at least part of the
difficulty is likely a result of the small sample size; as one’s

118

categories of microtraditions become more detailed, the size of each
diminishes proportionally. Hence an extremely large initial sample
would be required before any statistically viable conclusions could
be reached regarding the occurrence of, say, "large excised pendant
triangles." The absence of such a large sample was one of the
liabilities of this study, and hopefully will be borne in mind in
future reservoir survey work.

Site 41

SM

91

In the analysis of modes of decoration method it will be recalled
that SM 91 allied itself with the southern group of sites, even though
it lies on the northern edge of the area surveyed. On the other hand,
in regard to design modes it agreed nicely with the northern sites,
and attempts to include it among the southern group only reduced
the resultant chi-square values. A study of percentages of decoration
methods from each site reveals that SM 91 acquires its similarity to
the southern group by its high percentage of brushed sherds and
low percentages of medium line incised and narrow-line engraving.
Although one source of explanation would be an inter-group
marriage (and violation of the uxorilocal residence rules), this does
not account for the adoption of the "northern" design elements. In
other words, if SM 91 is different in the one regard, it should be different in both. The deviation of SM 91 from the regularities found
among the other sites explains the sharp downturn of the line
marking degree of artifact change in Figure lb. The most convenient
explanation is, of .course, sampling error, but in light of the
relatively large size of the SM 91 collection (191 specimens), it was
retained. Such anomalies can operate only as a stimulus and guide
for further research.

CONCLUSIONS
In the previous pages I have implied, and now make explicit, a
belief that at least two distinct social groups were present in the
area of Blackburn Crossing Reservoir. The nature of these groups
cannot, at this stage of research, be determined. According to the
various journals and other documents pertaining to early contact
with the Caddo, the groups which were most distinct to the
Europeans were the tribe and the confederacy. Certainly the two
groups detected archeologically are not confederacies, but they may

PI~HISTORIC SOCIAL BOUNDARIES

119

be tribes. They may also be extended matrilocal kin groups -- either
would yield the patterning of pottery modes described, although the
latter should be included within a larger aggregate, the tribe, the
boundaries of which might come to light with a more widespread
survey and analysis in the region involved. Until more detailed
analyses designed to reveal prehistoric social groups have been conducted on numerous sites throughout the Caddoan area, it is impossible to evaluate a single such analysis. Simply, one knows, or
strongly suspects, that the two groups of sites were different, but until a more complete pattern of such differences is revealed, the
isolated instance cannot be evaluated in terms of the usual
ethnographic units such as kin group or tribe. While it appears that
the area chosen for study includes a boundary of some sort, the size
and range of the two groups on either side remains unknown. This
is unfortunate because size -- i.e., geographical extent -- alone
would provide a clue as to the nature of the social group. Judging by
the occurrence of the southern series of sites, occupying an area at
least 20 km. in length, a single extended kin group seems much less
likely than a tribe.
