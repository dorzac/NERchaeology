ABSTRACT
A Phase I archeological assessment of 122 acres in central Colorado County,
Texas was performed in July 1998 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of
Bryan, Texas. This is a federal project regulated by the Economic Development
Association (EDA). The area examined is the site of a proposed industrial park complex
(120 acres) and water treatment plant (2 acres) and is part of a previously recorded
historic farmstead (41CD57) dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No historic
artifacts were found in the project area, and no evidence of prehistoric utilization of the
area, save one exhausted core, was encountered. The core is considered an isolated
find, and the area was not recorded as a prehistoric site. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
This report documents the results of a Phase I archaeological survey of 122
acres in central Colorado County, Texas (Figure 1). This project is federally funded by
the Economic Development Association (EDA); therefore, an antiquities permit from the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission was not required. The
Principal Investigator for this project is William E. Moore. The project number assigned
by BVRA is 98-06. It is the intention of the City of Columbus in cooperation with
Raymond K. Vann & Associates to construct an industrial park and water treatment
plant on this site. Originally, the route of the connecting sewer line was to be examined;
however, it traverses the Colorado County Agricultural Complex (74.9 acres), a 74.9
acre tract not supported by federal funding. Therefore, it was decided that the sewer
line route (yet to be determined) would not be examined during this project.
The project area is located in one of the original Texas counties (created in 1836
and organized in 1837), and the presence of a previously recorded historic site
(41CD57) in the vicinity (Figure 2) suggested that the project area is likely to contain
significant archeological sites. Therefore, a Phase I survey was required by the Division
of Archeology of the Texas Historical Commission. In order to satisfy this requirement,
the City of Columbus contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to
perform the cultural resources survey. The project area is depicted on the Columbus,
Texas 7.5' topographic quadrangle dated 1957 and photorevised in 1981, number 2996314 (Figure 2). The Highway 71 bypass that forms the eastern boundary of the project
area was constructed after the photorevision of the topographic map; therefore, it is not
shown on the 1981 version.
The site of the industrial park is bounded on the north by the Colorado County
Agricultural Complex, on the south by the Southern Pacific Railroad, on the east by the
State Highway 71 bypass, and on the west by a railroad spur and private land (Figure
3). The proposed water treatment plant is bounded on the north by land owned by the
City of Columbus on the south by the Colorado County Agricultural Complex, on the
east by the State Highway 71 bypass, and on the west by private land (Figure 3).
No soils book was available for Colorado County at the time of this survey. All
soil data was taken from Munsell readings obtained from soils excavated through
backhoe trenching. Environmental data for the region may be found in Archeology in
the Central and Southern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (MercadoAllinger et al. 1996) published by the Office of the State Archeologist and the
Department of Antiquities Protection. According to this document (Mercado-Allinger et
al. 1996:25), Colorado County is located in the Upland Prairies and Woods. The county
varies in elevation from 150 to 400 feet above mean sea level, is level to rolling, and is
drained by the Colorado River and numerous creeks. The interested researcher is
referred to this well-researched document for additional information regarding the
archaeology of Colorado County and vicinity.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Colorado County is located in the Central and Southern Planning Region as
defined by the Office of the State Archeologist and the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). This region is divided into smaller units, and
Colorado County (based on this division) belongs to the Central Coastal Plains
Archeological Region (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:Figure 1.1.4). It is only one county
removed from the Southern Coastal Corridor Archeological Region to the south and one
county removed from the Central Coastal Plains Archeological Region to the north.
Colorado County contains significant sites dating from the Archaic through Late
Prehistoric and historic times. As of 1996, however, no sites in Colorado County were
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:17) or
designated as State Archeological Landmarks (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:20).
Researchers are encouraged to consult the planning document (Mercado-Allinger et al.
1996) for more detailed information regarding Colorado County and its relationship to
this part of Texas.
According to a statistical overview prepared by the Office of the State
Archeologist (Biesaart et al. 1985), there were only 60 sites recorded in the county in
1985. At that time, the number of sites in the county represented .30% of the total for
Texas and 5.60% of the region. In 1985, 1 site in Colorado County was listed as
Paleoindian, 1 as Late Archaic, 5 as General Archaic, and 2 as Late Prehistoric. The
majority of the prehistoric sites in the county experienced some form of disturbance
such as erosion, construction, and vandalism. One site (number not given) was
excavated, 12 were tested by hand, and 51 were surface collected. A variety of
prehistoric site types have been identified in the county to include sites with subsistence
related features (shell middens), social/ceremonial related features (burials), and
technology related features (stone tool manufacturing areas).
A background check at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, Texas by the Principal Investigator revealed that one potentially significant
historic site (41CD57) had been recorded just to the north of the current project area.
Site 41CD57 is located on a sandy terrace overlooking the Colorado River to the north.
It was identified by Damon Crawford while surveying proposed right-of-way for State
Highway 71. Mr. Crawford described 41CD57 as a house site dating to the middle
1800s in fair condition; it was recommended for "conservation or investigation."

FIELD METHODS

Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin were checked
for the presence of previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. Although
no sites were found in the project area, one historic site (41CD57) had been recorded
just to the north of the proposed industrial park complex (Figure 2) and a prehistoric site
(41CD83) is to the east.
The field survey was conducted on July 1-2, 1998 with William E. Moore acting
as Principal Investigator with assistance from William J. Weaver. The project area was
sparsely wooded with oaks the major trees present. The open areas were covered with
pasture grass. Surface visibility was estimated at less than 10% in the 120 acre tract
and 30% in the 2 acre tract, making subsurface testing necessary. First, the two areas
were examined using the pedestrian method in an attempt to identify surface indications
of any archaeological sites that might be present. During the pedestrian survey all
exposed surface areas were carefully examined, and five shovel probes were
excavated. The probes were dug to clay when possible. However, due to the recent
drought, the sandy soils were too hard in most places to dig manually. Shovel probes
were not screened.
Following the pedestrian survey it was determined that the 120 acre industrial
complex site was low probability in terms of containing archaeological sites. The two
acre wastewater treatment plant site was considered to be a high probability area.
Because of the hard soils, it was decided that backhoe trenching (following a discussion
with Mark Denton of the Division of Archeology) would be the best method to examine
the subsurface. Nineteen backhoe trenches (BT) were excavated randomly throughout
the 120 acre industrial complex site, and six backhoe trenches were excavated on the
highest point of the landform on the two acre site of the proposed wastewater treatment
plant. The walls of each trench were scraped with a shovel and carefully examined for
cultural materials and features. At selected trenches, samples of the back dirt were
screened. The trenches were measured and noted in the field journal and on a log
(Appendix I). Profiles were drawn of five selected backhoe trenches (Appendix II).
Virtually all of the 120 acre industrial complex site had been disturbed by
clearing, as evidenced by numerous wind throws and a hummocky ground surface.
Other forms of disturbance consisted of underground gas lines, above ground utility
poles, and agricultural activities. The two acre wastewater treatment plant site was
cleared and covered with pasture grass except for a few large oaks. In addition to the
field survey, additional information regarding site 41CD57 was obtained by visiting the
Nesbitt Memorial Library where Archivist Bill Stein made deed records and other
documents available for this study. Mr. Stein also contacted Barbara L. Jordan, the
Great Granddaughter of Louis Herman August Schulenberg, the primary resident of the
farmstead recorded at TARL as 41CD57. Mrs. Jordan met with the Principal
Investigator at the library and brought photographs of the house and outbuildings and
other papers documenting the family history of this property.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The archival search at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory revealed no
previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area. One historic site (41CD57)
had been recorded just to the north of the current project area in the 74.9 acre Colorado
County Agricultural Complex tract. This site was recorded by Daymond Crawford of the
Texas Highway Department in 1973 as a historic house site dating to the middle 1800s.
The size of the site was stated on the single page site form (TARL site files) as 500 x
500 feet, the area containing the house and out buildings. No surface collection was
made and no shovel tests or other methods of excavation were conducted. The house
was photographed, but no site map was made. The site was recommended for
"conservation or investigation." One previously recorded prehistoric site (41CD83) had
been recorded approximately 600 meters to the east of the eastern boundary of the
current project area. This site is described as a lithic scatter and is not considered
significant.
In addition to checking the site records at TARL, the Principal Investigator met
with Bill Stein, Archivist at the Nesbitt Memorial Library and Barbara L. Jordan, Great
Granddaughter of Louis Herman August Schulenberg, the primary resident of historic
site 41CD57. At this meeting it was learned that the house at 41CD57 was constructed
in 1880, and there were three outbuildings - one shed and a barn. The original owner of
the house is not known; however (according to Mrs. Jordan), C. S. Muckleroy sold it
with 393 acres to Louis Herman August Schulenberg in 1888 (Deed Records, Volume 5,
page 177). The Schulenbergs were the last residents to live in the house. Mr.
Schulenberg died in 1908 and his wife, Anna, died in 1957. The house burned in 1985.
According to the Deed Records, the house was part of the W. B. Dewees survey
(Abstract 18, Tract 72). In 1936, 40 acres were in cultivation, 351 acres were in
pasture, 1 acre was reserved for a garden, and 1 acre was reserved for a house. The
primary cash crop was cotton with 156 acres devoted to feed corn. Forty acres are
described as bottom land which flooded occasionally. Other documents and
photographs of the Schulenberg estate are in the possession of Mrs. Jordan of
Columbus, Texas. The Nesbitt Memorial Library contains an excellent collection of
Texana and materials related to Colorado County including a two volume county history
(Colorado County Historical Commission 1986).
No evidence of historic site 41CD57 was found in the site of the proposed
industrial park. Likewise, no evidence of a historic site was found at the two acre site of
the proposed wastewater treatment plant. According to Mrs. Jordan (personal
communication, July 2, 1998), a "tenant shack" and well was once present in this area.
The survey crew observed the well, which is outside the project area in the Colorado
County Agricultural Complex tract, but no evidence of the structure was found. Since
this site is outside the project area, no systematic attempt was made to identify the
location of the structure.

7

No evidence of a prehistoric site was found in the project area. However, a
single core was found in the back dirt of Backhoe Trench 5 which was excavated on a
small rise about 300 meters south of the northern boundary of the project area. An
examination of a sample of the back dirt and scrapings of the wall with a shovel failed to
produce additional artifacts. Since this specimen was recovered by the backhoe
bucket, its exact vertical provenience is not known. Gravels are numerous along this
part of the Colorado River, and scattered surface finds of various kinds of stone tools
are common. Therefore, this artifact is classified in this report as an isolated find. An
additional backhoe trench (BT 6) was excavated on the same rise, but no cultural
materials were found. The core was not collected for curation.
Along an eroded slope to the north and outside the project area, two prehistoric
artifacts were observed on the surface. They are a unifacial scraper and a primary
cortex flake. The specimens were noted in the field journal and not collected.
The 120 acre industrial park site is classified as a low probability area for
prehistoric site occurrence. It is, however, part of historic site 41CD57 and was
probably part of the 351 acres devoted to pasture by the Schulenberg family. The two
acre wastewater treatment site is on a sandy ridge overlooking the Colorado River
floodplain to the north. At the time of the field survey it was viewed as a high probability
area for prehistoric site occurrence. However, six backhoe trenches and a thorough
surface inspection failed to locate the presence of prehistoric artifacts. This landform
was also considered a likely area for a historic site, but none was found. It should be
noted, however, that the site of the well and probable location of the tenant shack is not
very far to the south of the proposed wastewater treatment site. In summary, there is
no evidence of significant archaeological sites or features within the project area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No artifactual evidence of historic site 41CD57 was found in the 122 acre project
area. It is believed that the 19 backhoe trenches and 5 shovel probes adequately
assessed the tract. Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Columbus, Texas be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Should, however, evidence of any
site, prehistoric or historic, be encountered during construction all work must cease until
the situation can be resolved by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission,
in consultation with the City of Columbus and Brazos Valley Research Associates.
