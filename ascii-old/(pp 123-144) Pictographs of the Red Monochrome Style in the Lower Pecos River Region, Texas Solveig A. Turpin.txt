Pictographs of the Red Monochrome Style
in the Lower Pecos River Region, Texas
Solveig A. Turpin

ABSTRACT
The Red Monochrome pictographs are the latest of three prehistoric
rock-art styles defined in the Lower Pecos River region of Southwest Texas.
Twenty-three possible examples of this style are described and compared
with pictographs at similar sites in the Big Bend region to the west. Long
acknowledged as intrusive into the region after A.D. 600, this pictograph
style is only one trait in a complex that defines the Late Prehistoric period in
the Lower Pecos region. The adoption of the bow and arrow and the appearance of feature types such as crescent-shaped burned rock middens, cairns,
and circular stone structure outlines suggest the infusion of a fully formed
culture system. Parallels with both the material culture of the Southern
Plains and the pictographs of the Big Bend point to an origin with nomadic
hunters and gatherers analogous to the documented movements of the inhabitants of the Southern Plains during protohistoric and historic times.

INTRODUCTION

The Red Monochrome pictogaphs are the latest of three major prehistoric
rock-art styles defined in the Lower Pecos region of Southwest Texas (Figure 1).
This area, which encompasses the lower reaches of both the Pecos and Devils
rivers and their confluences with the Rio Grande, holds one of the largest and
most diverse bodies of Native American rock art. The dominant regional form is
the Archaic-age polychrome Pecos River style wall art (Kirkland 1937, 1938,
1939; Jackson 1938; Graham and Davis 1958; Gebhard 1960, 1965; Grieder
1965, 1966a, b; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Turpin 1982). Although often
overshadowed by the more elaborate polychrome Pecos River style panels, pictographs of the Red Monochrome style, when placed in their cultural context, are
one of a complex of traits that defines the Late Prehistoric period in the Lower
Pecos region. The Red Linear style is the third of the regions’s prehistoric rockart styles (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Gebhard 1960, 1965; Parsons n.d.;
Grieder 1966a; Turpin 1984).
The Red Monochrome panels are composed of frontally posed, crude, but
realistic life-sized human figures, arranged in horizontal bands, armed with bows
and arrows, and accompanied by naturalistic animals of many species (Figure 2).

encloses three sites.

The humans stand with legs spread, arms raised, and fingers clearly detailed, like
victims of a modern-day holdup (Kirkland and Newcomb t967:81). Occasionally, the fingers and toes are so exaggerated and the bodies so flexed that the
images are lizardlike in appearance (Gebhard 1965:36) (Figure 3). Handprints,
both negative and positive, are a frequently occurring motif. Large, enigmatic,
geometric forms often are found in panels otherwise composed of humans and
beasts. Terrestrial animals and birds are shown in profile; aquatic animals such as
catfish and turtles are in plan view as they are normally seen in nature. The presence of the bow and arrow (Figure 2, b) dates this style to the Late Prehistoric
period, after A.D. 600.

Although monochrome human figures abound in the aboriginal rock art of
North America, a few traits distinguish the Red Monochrome style from the
many miscellaneous pictographs. A single line perpendicular to the crown of the
head is presumed to be a feather ornament (Figure 3), although to modern viewers it more closely resembles a lightning rod (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:81).
Rounded protruberances on the sides of the heads have been variously called ears
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:81), caps or curled hair (Lowrance 1982a: 65),
and buns. Since the heads are usually solid circles of color with no other features
delineated, these distinctive protrusions must mirror real characteristics. Male
nudity is apparent in the display of male genitals, but no female genitalia are
detectable. Clothed figures appear to be wearing long skirts or tunics. An apparent preoccupation with hands and feet results in disproportionately large fingers
and toes, with each digit clearly drawn. Handprints are common signatures of
preliterate art, but the emphasis on prints in the Red Monochrome style is carried
to the extreme in one case (site 41VV327) where turkey tracks are shown following behind the bird.

THE SITES
Twenty-three sites with possible Red Monochrome affiliation are known; 21
of these have been formally recorded. Many of these sites consist primarily
of panels in other art styles with only minor Red Monochrome components.
Omitted from this count are sites with figures that may belong in the Late Prehistoric period but are either too badly deteriorated or too aberrant to be classifed
as Red Monochrome. For example, one site described by House and Hester
(1971) has elements of both Red Monochrome and Pecos River styles, but the
figures conform to neither of these styles.
Of seven sites located by Graham and Davis (1958) during their survey that
preceded the construction of the Amistad Dam, six had been copied or photographed by Kirkland or Jackson in the 1930s. Parsons’s (n.d.) rock-art survey for
the Texas Memorial Museum and Texas Historical Commission found seven sites
with Red Monochrome figures previously documented to some degree by one or
the other of these pioneers in Texas rock-art studies (Table 1). Four new sites on
the Devils River were recorded during Parsons’s and later surveys (Parsons n.d.;
Dibble and Prewitt 1967). Three sites were added to the sample in 1984 and 1985
during an intensive survey by the University of Texas under a grant from the Kelberg Foundation. One of these sites, 41VV699, the Turkey Bluff site, was mentioned but not visited by Jackson (1938:Site 94). Another site on the Devils
River, reported to Jackson (1938:Site 97) by local informants, has been located
but remains unrecorded. It too has as a central figure a turkey, a common motif in
Red Monochrome art. One site, INAH 203, is on the Mexican side of the Rio
Grande, and only a few photographs are available for study.
Site 41VV52
Site 41VV52, at the upper end of the Devils River arm of Lake Amistad
(Figure 1), was recorded by Graham and Davis (n.d.; 1958). These surveyors

suggested that 41VV52 might be Jackson’s site 101 (1938 : 239), a pictograph site
plotted on his Map V, but not further documented or described. One human figure with straight arms, bent legs, fingers and toes detailed, a single-feather headdress, and buns around the ears (Figure 4, a) is flanked by two large teardropshaped animals, probably bison. Their darker color suggests that they may not be
contemporary with the human. Other bison pictographs along this stretch of the
Devils River, such as those at 41VV343 and 41VV400, are demonstrably historic (slides on file at the Texas Memorial Museum). Faded red and yellow discs
of various sizes and a red conical geometric form appear to be older than the
human and animal figures.
Site 41VV72, Seminole Watering Hole
Site 41VV72, Seminole Watering Hole, is above a permanent spring-fed
pool just south of US 90, in Seminole Canyon. The location of this site and
41VV78 prompted Kirkland (1938 : 20) to name the Red Monochrome pictographs
the Val Verde Flooded Shelter style. In addition to being damaged by floodscouring because of its position low in the canyon, the site has been profoundly
vandalized due to its proximity to the now-abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad
right-of-way. Lichen growing down from the roof of the shelter also has obliterated many of the figures, so Kirkland’s copies of this site are virtually all that
remain of one of the largest Red Monochrome panels (Figure 2, a). In his water
color copies are more than 60 human figures, large and small, that once decorated these walls. Deer, rabbits, dogs, and a panther are discernible among the
many animals. The bow and arrow, long garments, male genitals, the singlefeather headdress, geometric forms, and innumerable handprints--all traits of
the Red Monochrome style--are illustrated. Using Kirkland’s reproductions as a
guide, one can still detect a very few complete figures, most notably the prone
figure riddled with projectiles. Three of the discernible figures have faded to a
yellow that Kirkland thought was stain from an oily binder (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 : 83).
Site 4/VV78
Site 41VV78, the largest and best-preserved Red Monochrome panel, is
above a spring-fed pool low in the wall of a tributary of the Rio Grande, a situation similar to that of 41VV72. This site was also copied by Kirkland (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967:Plates 47-49), probably with more accuracy than he was
able to attain at 41VV72. A turkey, rabbit, catfish, deer, turtle, and dog are
clearly drawn (Figure 2, b). The human figures, in their characteristic frontal
posture, are either armed with bows and arrows or riddled with projectiles, implying considerable hostility. Negative handprints, outspread fingers, elbow ornaments, single feathers, and buns on the sides of the heads are easily discerned.
One large deer is shown in X-ray style, the only example of this technique as yet
found in the Lower Pecos region. (The X-ray style is known at many European
Paleolithic rock-art sites.) Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:84) interprets the outstretched tongue as a heart line, a common motif in North American

art, citing Schaafsma’s suggestion that this trait is an Athapaskan import, either
developed or adopted from Plains groups. Remnants of Pecos River and Red Linear art are still visible at the upstream end of the shelter, but the superimposed
Red Monochrome clearly is later than the Pecos River style.

Site 41VV77, Vaquero Shelter
Site 41VV77, Vaquero shelter, has an outstanding example of historic Native American art: a panel complete with a mission building, horsemen, longhorn cattle, and costumed Spaniard (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:Plate 64).
Shadowy remnants of both Pecos River and Red Monochrome figures are now
extremely difficult to decipher (Gebhard 1965:36).
Site 41VV89
Site 41VV89, just above the mouth of the Pecos, was investigated by Jackson (1938:Site 70) and Woolsey (1936), so a photographic record is preserved
in the files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Kirkland’s copies
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 : Plate 4-1) are listed as Pecos River site 1. Called
Wolf or Coyote Cave for its dominant pictograph--a pair of canines with bristling tails--this site also has minor motifs: a human figure, a round geometric
design, and stenciled negative handprints.

Site 41VV97
Site 41VV97 consists primarily of Pecos River style pictographs (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967:Plate 31), but at its base is one possible Red Monochrome
human figure. This figure is a standing torso with upraised arms, outspread fingers, and a single-feather headdress.
Site 41VV123
Site 41VV 123, above the mouth of the Pecos River, was recorded by Graham
and Davis (1958) and was summarily described by them as a few human figures,
badly deteriorated and intentionally defaced. Of five Red Monochrome humans
there, only three are still clearly discernable. One figure lacks hands and feet but
has remnants of the characteristic protrusions about the ears. Another elongated
human resembles the pictographs at 41VV327 on the Devils River more than it
does its companions at this site. A fourth figure, completely eradicated, has been
scratched from the wall.

Site 41VV201, Red Linear Site
Site 41VV201, the Red Linear site, is the type site for the Red Linear style,
a miniature monochrome art form tentatively dated to the Late Archaic period
(Turpin 1984). The larger, paler figures and a series of tally marks at this site
were considered by Gebhard (1965:36) to be superimposed Red Monochromes.
Site 41VV226, Kirkland Camp
Site 41VV226, Kirkland Camp, has a few pale red handprints at the base of
a Pecos River style panel. Newcomb included this site in his discussion of the
Red Monochrome style (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 : 89, Plate 46-2), but only
these handprints conform to the characteristics of this later style.

Site 41VV233, Lewis Canyon
Lewis Canyon, is most noted for its intricate petroglyphs. Adjacent pictographs, site 41VV233 include a human male with upstretched arms and bent
legs, his body impaled by projectiles. His headdress, as copied by Kirkland
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 :Plate 29-4), is unusual; it has two prongs that are
more like horns than feathers.
Site 41VV238
Site 41VV238, adjacent to 41VV89, was copied by Kirkland (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967:Plate 51), described by Jackson (1938:Site 67), and photographed by Woolsey (1936). Eleven prints of right hands and l0 prints of left
hands surround a small dog (Figure 5, b). All of the handprints are small, evidently of children (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:91). Two human figures, another dog, and two geometric designs complete this panel.
Site 41VV239
Site 41VV239, on the lower Pecos River, depicts a phallic, feather-headdressed human pierced by projectiles (Figures 3 and 4, d). The emphasis on fingers and feet characteristic of Red Monochrome art is expressed in both this and
the adjacent figure (Figure 3). The larger figure (Figure 4, d) has only four toes
on one foot, but whether this was intended to depict a real characteristic is not
known. Kirkland copied this panel with the aid of binoculars (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 : Plate 34) from the opposite rim of the canyon, which accounts for
inaccuracies in his reproduction (Figures 3 and 4, d).

Site 41VV241, Pandale Crossing
Site 41VV241, Pandale Crossing can be considered Red Monochrome only
on the basis of a few red handprints (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 : 95). Most of
the pictographs are geometric, painted over the older handprints. Of some interest to the discussion that follows on the cultural implications of the Red Monochrome style is a large segment of a ceramic vessel recovered from the midden
fill at this site, one of the few instances where pottery has been found in a Lower
Pecos rock-shelter (Stewart 1965).
Site 41VV243
Site 41VV243, photographed by Jackson (1938:Site 65) and copied by
Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967 :Plate 36), has Red Monochrome figures
superimposed on a larger Pecos River style panel. Among these small human
figures is one with a single-feather headdress (Figure 4, f) and another with genitals and the buns or protruberances around the ears (Figure 4, e). A solid handprint completes the traits typical of Red Monochrome art at this site. Jackson
(1938: 170) likened these Red Monochrome additions to Mescalero or other
Apache art.

Site 41VV317
Site 41VV317, on the Devils River, was recorded during a survey of the
river prior to impoundment of Amistad Reservoir (Dibble and Prewitt 1967 :Figure 9) and was further documented by Grieder (1966a). The site is now inundated and undoubtedly dissolved away. Among the crude anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and geometric figures was one doglike animal (Figure 5, d) with mouth
and ears similar to those of 41VV238. Beneath this red dog was another quadruped, apparently a bear, painted in black. This animal and a turkey, also found
at a site on the Devils River, corroborate Graham and Davis’s (1958:80) and
Gebhard’s (1965:48) statements that both black and red figures are found in this

134

style. Two of the three human figures at this site wore single feathers and had
rounded protrusions of the head (Figure 4, f).
Site 41VV320
Site 41VV320, on the Devils River, is included as a Red Monochrome site
purely on the basis of about 30 positive right and left handprints impressed on an
overhang above a long red streamer. Some of the handprints are child sized.
Site 41VV327
Site 41VV327 is a large Red Monochrome panel overlain by historic pictographs. This site is east of the Devils River and adjacent to other historic rockart sites. All of the pictographs are red, but the earlier Red Monochromes are
paler and have deteriorated more than have the obviously historic figures. The
extremely elongated bodies of the older humans are unusual (Figure 6) and are
seen in only one other recorded site (41VV123) on the Pecos River. The characteristic method of depicting the human beings with fingers, toes, single-feather
headdress, and buns about the ears (figure 4, g, h); a naturalistic turkey complete
with three-toed tracks, a dog, turtles, and a geometric star with a blank circle at
its center clearly belongs to the Red Monochrome style. The later artists took
advantage of the stick-em-up posture of one figure and added a man with rifle
leveled at this target (Figure 6). Two other men with firearms take aim at the
adjacent Red Monochrome dog.
41VV699, Turkey Bluff Site
Site 41VV699, the Turkey Bluff site, is under a shallow overhang high
above the Devils River. A large but typical Red Monochrome dog appears to
be chasing a solid black turkey. Both are bullet pocked, obviously targets for
riflemen shooting from the river. Jackson (1938:Site 94) had been told that a
shelter in this location had pictographs, but the site was not formally recorded
until 1985.

41VV700
Site 41VV700 is a complex of five overhangs near 41VV699. All three
Lower Pecos prehistoric styles are represented, each in a separate alcove. The
Red Monochrome panel consists of 11 yellow right handprints outlining a natural
seep fault line near the base of the cliff face. One yellow and two red crosses are
at the side of the seep.
41VV701
Site 41VV701, also recorded in 1985, depicts a line of six small red animals. At least five of them are classic Red Monochrome dogs, apparently chasing
a deer whose tracks trail behind its rear hooves. One of the three blocky red
shapes is the remnant of a Red Monochrome human much like the central charac-

ter at 41VV52 (Figure 4, a). This male figure now lacks a head; the appendages
are short and stubby, but the fingers and toes are clearly detailed.
INAH203
Site INAH203, a large panel, lies up a tributary on the Mexican side of the
Rio Grande (Dibble n.d.). This site bears the Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa
e Historia (INAH) number 203. The photographs available for study show one
human figure armed with a bow and arrow, the arrow pointing at a naturalistic
rabbit. The man’s posture is more fluid than is normal for Red Monochrome figures, but his characteristic buns about the ears (Figure 4, i) and his companion
animals clearly belong to this style. The site is said to include at least four or five
such humans in addition to the realistic rabbit, a dog (Figure 5, d), and a turkey.
Tardy Draw
Tardy Draw, an unnumbered site, is stylistically aligned with the Red Monochrome panels at 41VV72 and 41VV78 by Newcomb (Kirldand and Newcomb
1967: 89). This site consists largely of geometric engravings and painted handprints. According to Newcomb, the engraved arrowpoint forms--probably Perdiz points of Late Prehistoric age, postdating A.D.900--are related to those seen
in Red Monochrome panels. A second petroglyph site with similar geometric
designs, Kirkland’s Pecos River site 7 (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: Plate 51-2),
is probably site 41VV321, now inundated by Amistad Reservoir.
Unrecorded Site
Jackson (1938:Site 97) mentioris a site high on the Devils River that he
did not visit, describing the most outstanding pictograph as a turkey, a common
animal in Red Monochrome art. This site has been located but has not been
recorded.
INTERPRETATION OF THE RED MONOCHROME STYLE
Interpretations of the meaning of Red Monochrome art have been as straightforward as the pictographs themselves. Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb
1967:88) considers the style representational--an attempt to portray humans
and animals as they were. And, since his premise is apparently justified, the
characteristics that distinguish this style from miscellaneous red figures at other
sites can be confidently considered to mirror real attributes. The larger Red
Monochrome panels seem much like group portraits that show idiosyncratic
qualities of the individuals (Figure 2, b).
The animals that can be identified are deer, turkey, turtle, catfish, rabbit,
canine, and feline, all known archeologically throughout the Lower Pecos Archaic and seen in the region today. The rarity of vegetation in the panels and the
realism with which the menagerie is depicted suggest that a special relationship
between man and animal transcended simple dietary needs. Two of the most
common central figures are dogs, the earliest domesticated animal, and turkeys,

Turpin--Red Monochrome Pictographs

birds of some ceremonial importance in the prehistoric greater Southwest. This
identification between man and beast implies a set of social values, but the specific connotations are not apparent in the pictographs. Never in the available
sample is a large or ferocious animal hunted or slain. In the two pictographs
where a hunter aims his arrow at an animal, the target is a rabbit, indicating that
hunting magic is not an overt function of Red Monochrome art. The notable absence of the economically important horse and bison suggests that neither was of
central concern to the artists at the time the panels were painted. This fact, together with the absence of any other European influence and the incorporation of
Red Monochrome figures into apparent later historic compositions, clearly indicates a prehistoric age.
Hostility is depicted in several upright and prone human figures that are
riddled with projectiles. The penetrating lances are generally longer than the arrows, perhaps an artistic convention to emphasize their power or perhaps an illustration of the type of weapon that preceded the bow. Although this trait could
reflect warfare attendant upon the intrusion of foreigners into the region, the injured figures bear many of the characteristics of the group as a whole. One has a
single-feather headdress, two have buns about the ears, two have long garments,
and two are unadorned. Two wounded figures carry simple bows, but none carry
recurved bows. It may be that the Red Monochrome artists were commemorating
internal animosities or losses at the hands of their enemies, rather than a successful battle.

CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RED MONOCHROME STYLE
Strong parallels among the sites in methods of depicting human figures and
animals, together with the many handprints, indicate an internal cohesion interpreted as reflecting a brief time span for the Red Monochrome style (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967:89). Compared to the Pecos River style pictographs, the
Red Monochrome figures are rare. However, the far-ranging distribution of the
sites (Figure 1) suggests that the groups who painted the Red Monochrome pictographs traversed the entire length and breadth of the region.
The Red Monochrome style has long been considered intrusive into the
Lower Pecos region (Kirkland 1937: 113). Its divergence from classic Pecos
River form and content (Jackson 1938:226) and the lack of an internal evolution
of style suggest that it was introduced in fully developed form (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967 : 89). Gebhard (1965 : 36) saw a similarity to more western modes
of depicting human figures in protohistoric and historic times. Outside of the
Lower Pecos region, the Red Monochrome style most closely resembles some
monochrome figures in the Big Bend region to the west (Jackson 1938: 167;
Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:Plate 82; Lowrance 1982a:66, 117). As long ago
as 1938, Jackson (1938: 170) noted a resemblance between the more recent
pictographs at 41VV243 and the picture-writing of Mescalero or other Apache
groups.

138

Texas Archeological Society

Lowrance (1982a:66) presents a case for Jumanos as painters of the Big
Bend figures. She points out that the hair styles of the Jumanos (Newcomb
1969:237; Hammond and Rey 1966: 160, 161), would be shown correctly in
two-dimensional representation by the rounded protrusions of the Red Monochrome figures. In addition, she notes that the nude males, feather headdresses,
men with hair cut short and curled to resemble caps, and women attired in skirts,
bodices, and cloaks described for the Jumano are apparent among the Red Monochrome figures of the Lower Pecos region.
The comparisons drawn by Lowrance (1982b: Plate CCLXXXX) are based
on the small sample of Red Monochrome sites described by Jackson (1938) and
Kirkland and Newcomb (1967). The less publicized sites documented in the files
of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas at
Austin and the Texas Memorial Museum provide more examples of the shared
motifs. The unusual buns, or protruberances, around the ears are found at 41VV52
(Figure 4, a), 41VV78 (Figure 4, b, c), 41VV123, 41VV239 (Figure 4, d),
41VV317 (Figure 4, f), and 41VV327 (Figure 4, g, h) in Val Verde County,
INAH203 (Figure 4, i) in Mexico, and Payne Canyon (Figure 4, 1), Agua Fria
(Figure 4, j), and Bear Creek shelter (Figure 4, k) in Brewster County (Lowrance
1982a:66, 117). A fourth site in Brewster County with black monochrome humans has been reported to the writer by John Green of E1 Paso. The differences in
style found in all attributes except these protrusions reinforces their importance
and suggests that the protrusions constitute a defining characteristic of the people.
Parallel modes of illustrating the mouth and ears of a small doglike animal are
found at 41VV78 (Figure 5, a) near the Rio Grande, 41 VV238 (Figure 5, b) on the
Pecos River, 41VV317 (Figure 5, d), 41 VV699, and 41VV701, high on the Devils
River, INAH203 (Figure 5, e) in Mexico, and Agua Fria shelter (Figure 5, c) in
Brewster County (Jackson 1938:Figure 112). This commonality in motifs and
attributes suggests a sharing of iconographic tradition between the Big Bend and
Lower Pecos regions during the Late Prehistoric period. In addition, Kirkland
(1937) saw similarities between the Lower Pecos pictographs and the pictographs
he copied at Paint Rock in Concho County, Texas, and Meyers Springs in Terrell
County, Texas, similarities also evidenced by Jackson’s grouping of attributes
from these sites (1932: 146-157, 269, Plates CCLXIX, CCLXX). Newcomb
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 122) considered the Indian Water Hole, near
Meyers Springs in Terrell County, chronologically equivalent to the Lower Pecos
Monochrome style.
So little is known of the Jumano (Newcomb 1969 : 225-245) that attributing
the Red Monochrome style to them does little to increase knowledge of the cultural context of the pictographs. We know that some members of the Jumano led
a far-ranging Plains existence at the time of contact, traveling between their
settlements on the upper Rio Grande and the Caddo region to the east (Newcomb
1969: 239, John 1975). The first Spaniards to cross the lower Pecos--Gaspar
Castafio de Sosa’s expedition from Monclova, Mexico to the Pecos pueblos-encountered a group of bison hunters near present-day Sheffield, on the Pecos
River in Crockett County (Schroeder and Matson 1965:51; Hammond and Rey

Turpin--Red Monochrome Pictographs

139

1966:256); both sets of translators identify these people as Jumanos. The next
group encountered by the Spaniards may have been Apaches (Schroeder and
Matson 1965:50-56).
Additional evidence for mobility during the protohistoric period is found in
historic documentation of travels by allied Indian bands from along the Rio
Grande below La Junta, together with groups from northern Mexico, to the
mouth of the Pecos River for communal winter bison hunts (Griffen 1969, John
1975). The tribal identity of these people is beyond our grasp today, but from
these accounts it is apparent that nomadic hunting groups ranged into the Lower
Pecos region in protohistoric times. The lack of knowledge of archeological sites
south of the Rio Grande precludes any present attempt to trace the hunters into
northern Mexico. It seems unlikely, however, that groups accustomed to winter
bison hunts would omit such an important animal from their iconographic repertoire. So the Red Monochrome panels probably were painted before the appearance of bison on the margins of the Southern Plains in protohistoric and historic
times (Griffen 1969).
The relative frequency of recorded Red Monochrome sites, which seems to
favor a Lower Pecos heartland, is probably a function of past interpretive work.
The Amistad Reservoir District has been surveyed for pictographs and studied far
more intensely than have any adjacent areas. Virtually nothing is known of the
extent of Lower Pecos rock art in the region south of the Rio Grande, and there
are fewer surface exposures suitable for painting to the north, east, and west. The
long tradition of wall painting in the Lower Pecos region seems to have prompted
imitation; every known intrusive group, including the European settlers, has
added to the rock art, often in the same locations as their predecessors. For this
reason, no continuous or widespread distribution of any of these art styles should
be expected. Whether for lack of study or for scarcity of paintable surfaces, the
sample from which the regional distribution of pictograph styles has been determined is not sufficiently large to be used for density or frequency projections for
Red Monochrome art.
Within the Lower Pecos sample, the choice of locations for Red Monochrome panels clearly favors exposed overhangs rather than the deep, longinhabited shelters preferred by artists of the Pecos River style. Although Red
Monochrome figures are occasionally superimposed on earlier, deteriorated,
Pecos River style panels, one has yet to be found in a true sheltered environment.
Of the sites for which information is available, only 4tVV72, 41VV78, and
41VV320 include concentrated cultural deposits, and in all three cases these are
not typical rock-shelter deposits, but are burned-rock and chert accumulations
adjacent to permanent water sources. At least 13 of the sites are under shallow
overhangs with barren or sloping floors, high on cliff faces overlooking major
rivers or tributaries. This notable tendency to select open, barren, rock surfaces
may reflect a trend away from sheltered habitation toward open camps. On the
other hand, the Red Monochrome panels may have been painted by members of
intrusive groups who avoided the confinement of sheltered sites or sites recently
or currently occupied by established residents of the region.

Other evidence suggests that the Red Monochrome style was only one of a
complex of cultural traits introduced into the Lower Pecos region during the Late
Prehistoric period. The traditional time marker of this period, the adoption of the
bow and arrow, is signaled by the advent of arrowpoints in shelter deposits dated
to A.D. 600 (Dibble 1974). Here they are comingled with dart points characteristic of the later phases of the Late Archaic period. These same dart points are the
most common types found in ring- or crescent-shaped burned rock middens, giving rise to the assumption that these features are Late Archaic phenomena. However, radiocarbon dates obtained from charcoal found in these middens are later
than A.D. 700 (Luke 1983), and within the Late Prehistoric period as defined
here. The morphology of crescent middens is most often explained by comparing
them with ethnohistoric descriptions of Apache baking ovens.
Adjacent to some burned rock middens are circles of paired stones thought
to be remnants of supports for vegetation- or hide-covered huts. These remnants,
the first evidence for this type of open upland camp, may signal a different settlement preference and may account in part for the sparseness of Late Prehistoric
cultural deposits in many shelters. A second feature type--piled rocks that
probably functioned as burial cairns--has been assigned to the Late Prehistoric
period on the basis of only one excavation (Turpin 1982). However, the occurrence of both rings and cairns at several sites suggests a common cultural
affiliation.
Finally, a distinctive artifact assemblage that includes small stemmed and
triangular arrowpoints, steeply beveled end scrapers, and plain brown ceramics
found on the later, larger, stone-circle sites has strong parallels with sites on the
margins of the Southern Plains. The pottery has been informally named Abilene
Brown (Word n.d.), an indication of its concentration in that area. A few sherds
of this same type, found at the Lipan Apache mission of San Lorenzo de la Cruz
(Tunnell and Newcomb 1969), are evidence for the late date of this ceramic type.
When the Red Monochrome art is viewed in this framework of late prehistoric culture change, its introduction into the Lower Pecos region by nomads
who traveled the margins of the Southern Plains becomes more plausible. The
upland types of features--cairns and rings--are more common to the north and
west. The late artifact types have broad affinities with the tool kit of the Southern
Plains, and the morphology of crescent middens is explained by recorded Apache
practices. Although the Red Monochrome style probably predates the historically documented advent of the Apaches in the Lower Pecos region, the archeological remains strongly suggest earlier analogous intrusions, sometime after
A.D. 600.
It is difficult to coordinate the dates of emergence of the various cultural
traits in the Lower Pecos region. The sites are all surface sites, datable only by
their characteristic artifacts. Until the culture history of the Late Prehistoric period is refined, the cultural processes that effected these changes will remain elusive. It may be reasonable to assume that changes such as the adoption of new
weaponry (e.g., the bow and arrow) or a variation on an established method of
food processing that resulted in the formation of crescent middens took place by

the slow process of diffusion. However, when these traits can be seen in conjunction with changes in mortuary practices, settlement preference, structures, and
art styles, it becomes plausible to consider an infusion of a cultural system carried by an intrusive group. Whether those incursions were sporadic or regular,
their effect on the resident population, their origins, and precisely when they occurred are research problems for the future.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This summary of the Red Monochrome style owes its very being to the work of several pioneers in Texas rock-art studies, most notably A.T. Jackson, Forrest Kirkland,
W. W. Newcomb, Jr., Terence Grieder, and Miriam A. Lowrance. Mrs. Lowrance’s presentation of the evidence for contact between the Lower Pecos and Big Bend regions is the
basis for this further corroboration of that possibility. David S. Dibble kindly loaned his
photographs of INAH203. Terence Grieder, of the Department of Art, The University of
Texas at Austin, provided copies of his original documentation of 4tVV317. The Texas
Memorial Museum granted permission to examine, copy, and reproduce past documentation of Red Monochrome sites. Herbert H. Eling, Jr., prepared the photographs, and Carol
R. Fabac drafted the map. I owe special thanks to David G. Robinson, who produced the
line drawings from often obscure past documentation. Draft versions of the manuscript
have been revised after many happy hours of debate with David Robinson and Lee Bement, my coworkers in the field. Ronald W. Ralph prompted me to expand the discussion
of the distribution of sites in the Lower Pecos region. W. W. Newcomb and Miriam A.
Lowrance were kind enough to read an early draft.
