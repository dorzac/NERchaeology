The proximi ty to the Car i bbean and
tropical North Atlantic makes the
northWest coast of the Gulf of Mexico
particularly vulnerable to hurricanes and
tropical storms. Of the 152 hurricanes
which have made landfall in the U. S. in
this century, 51 have crossed the TexasLouisiana coast. Because of their
frequency, the shallowness of the Gulf
continental shelf and the extremely gentle
gradient of the adjacent coastal plain,
hur r icanes have had a profound ef f ect on
the geologic evolution of this coast. The
landfall of Hurr icane Allen in south
Texas, as recently as August 1980, permits
us to assess first hand on this field trip
what the specific hurricane effects are
and how they differ between high-profile
and low-profile barrier shorelines.

The northwest coast of the Gulf of
Mexico has for many decades provided an
ideal field laboratqry for the study of
coastal and shallow marine sedimentary
processes, depositional environments and

environments ranges from North America's
largest delta, the Mississippi River
delta, to the world's longest barrier
island, Padre Island. A number of
classical papers have been written about
the sedimentology, stratigraphy and
morphology of the region; act i ve current
research continues on all aspects of both
surface and subsurface geology of the Gulf
Coast Basin.
By including such a large section of the
Gulf Coas t in one trip gu ide, we hope to
demonstrate how both sedimentary processes
and depositional sequences change as we
move west away from the strongly
fluvially-dominated Louisiana coast, to
the strongly wave-dominated coast of south
Texas.

Rapid industrialization and population
increase along the Gulf Coast have caused
a number of severe regional environmental
geologic problems. The subsidence of the
Mississippi River deltaic plain, coupled
with the construction of levees which have
cut off the supply of flood-sediment to
the marsh, has caused dramatic land loss
in south Louisiana.
Ground-water
withdrawal in the Houston area has
accelerated local land subsidence there,
and diverse shoreline stabilization
structures, including the famed Galveston
seawall, have al tered the natural
equilibrium beaches, most often in
undesirable ways. Solutions to most of
these problems undoubtedly exist. Their
identification and implementation,
however, require both a detailed
understanding of the geological processes
at work and a long-range assessment which

Wi thin the Whole region the pattern of
Holocene coastal development has been one
of del taic headland retreat (Rio Grande,
Brazos-cblorado, Trinity and the abandoned
Mississippi delta lobes) and interdeltaic

headlands are everywhere characterized by
low-profile, rapidly-transgressive
beaches. The prograding interdeltaic
shores have bui 1t a predominantly muddy

The use of depos i ti onal epi sodes (time
units),
positional sequences (rock

and follow the sequences (Frazier, 1974)
is now widely accepted and forms the basis
for establishing stratigraphic frameworks
within basins and correlations among other
basins.
More recently these basic
concepts of genetic stratigraphy led to
the principles and techniques of seismic
stratigraphy (Vail et al., 1977).

The absolute ages of coastal plain
deposi ts and the correlative eustatic
cycles responsible for their formation are
still uncertain, mainly because the number
and ages of Pleistocene sea level changes
are not precisely known. Recent stUdies
incorporating biostratigraphic, seismic
stratigraphic, and geochemical evidence
indicate that: (1) eustatic cycles were
more numerous than previously thought, and
(2) as many as four cycles occurred during
the past 100,000 years (Beard et al.,
1982). At present planktonic assemblages,
carbon isotopes, and seismic sequences are
being used to elucidate the late Quaternary history of the GUlf ebast basin.

mented for each of the major clastic
wedges in the Gulf Coast Basin. The
occurrence of lnrge expnnsion faults along
prograding shelf margins and the
ition of exceptionally thick deltaic and
strandline sequences across those faults
have promoted the development of
abnormally high pore- essure gradients
and thermal gradients in deeply buried
aquifers. The feasibility of locating and
producing geothermal energy and entrained

topic of Gulf ebast research since 1974.

Most of the coastal environments visited
on this field trip formed after sea level
reached its present position about 3,000
years ago (Fig. 2-1). Since then the
position of deltaic promontories and
interdeltaic bights have been relatively
stable, but the configuration of the Gulf
shoreline has retreated and advanced
considerable distances within those areas.
The distribution of present coastal
landforms reflects the post-stillstand
changes in shoreline position. During the
Modern the Louisiana coastline has
advanced as much as 160 kID in response to
deposition of major lobes of the
Mississippi delta. The Chenier Plain that
fronts the southwestern Louisiana and
southeast Texas coasts has prograded an
average distance of 30 km. To the west,
however, shoreline changes were markedly
different for several reasons. First, the
continental drainage area of the
Mississippi River minimized the effect of
climatic changes whereas the smaller Texas
coastal plain rivers were gradually
reduced in size as rainfall decreased.
Second, the reductions in discharge and
sediment supply of these underfit streams
(Dury, 1965) were substantial;
consequently major rivers that had
previously prograded across the inner
shelf were unabl€ to maintain their
position.
The natural decrease in
sediment supply led to erosion of the
Brazos-Colorado and Rio Grande del tas
which has caused shorel ine retreat of 16

to 20 km. Sand eroded from those del tas
and the inner shelf was transported by
longshore currents into adjacent
interdeltaic bights. These zones of
littoral drift convergence were the sites
of incipient development of the Texas
barrier islands. Individual lobes of the
Mississippi delta were also subject to
erosional retreat after abandonment,
however, concurrent progradation of a new
lobe invariably occurred.
Prior to sea level stillstand, the
barriers were retreating landward but they
have been prograding from 1.5 to 3 km over
the last 3,500 years in response to the
large volumes of sand which were der i ved
from erosion of adjacent deltaic
headlands. As the deltaic headlands
retreated and subsided, transgressive and
morphologically low-profile washover
barriers (Fig. 2-4) formed on the delta
margins; principally by beach-ridge
drowning and lagoonal extension (Morton,
1979). These processes are probably still
7

•

operating today but at rates too slow to
be detected by historical monitoring
techniques (comparison of features on maps
and aerial photographs).
Realignment of the shoreline along the
Texas coast gave rise to an orderly
spatial arrangement of coastal landforms
(Morton, 1979). The landforms, which
grade laterally from one into another, and
their respective positions are as follows:
transgressive beaches formed along the
delta apexes, transgressive barriers
formed along the del ta margins, and high
profile regressive barriers (Fig. 2-4)
formed within the adjacent embayments.
Although this pattern of erosion and
deposition is best demonstrated along the
Texas coast, it is also repeated on a
smaller scale in Louisiana. For example,
the shoreline segment between Bayou
Lafourche and Grand Isle in Louisiana
contains the three pr imary landforms and
is analogous to the Brazos delta-Follets
Island-Galveston Island sequence visited
in stops 7 through 10. In fact, the sandbody geometries of Grand Isle (Conatser,
1971) and Galveston Island (Bernard et
ale, 1970) are remarkably similar.

The bays and sounds located landward of
the Louisiana barriers were formed chiefly
by subsidence of the underlying delta
plains, whereas in Texas the bays and, in
part, the lagoons owe their origins to
former entrenched valleys. The morphology
and sedimentary sequence of the Texas bays
records the balance between sediment
supply and sea~level rise. Most of the
bays are only partially filled and bayhead
deltas are relatively inactive because of
the natural and man-induced decreases in
discharge and sediment supply. The bay
fill is characterized by a sedimentary
sequence that can be subdivided, from
oldest to
t, into three uni ts:
0) regress ve alluvial sands, (2)
transgressive fluvial sands overlain by
deltaic muds, and (3) bay-estuarine muds.
Near stream mouths and other sediment
sources the bay-estuarine muds may be
overlain by modern regressive sands and
muds of fluvial-deltaic and bay margin
origin.

transgression continue locally along parts
of the Louisiana and Texas coast. The
southeastern and central Louisiana coasts
are prograding under the influences of the
Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers,
respectively. Elsewhere in coastal
Louisiana shoreline erosion is widespread
owing to subsidence of abandoned delta
lobes and subsequent formation of barrier
islands, primarily transgressive barriers.
The attendant submergence of the
Mississippi
Ita plain is presently
causing a rapid decrease in Louisiana
wetlands acreage and associated marine
resources (Gagliano et al., 1981).
Land losses in Texas are less severe
than in Louisiana because much of the
Texas coast is in an aggradational phase.
Even where land is being lost along
retreating deltaic headlands (BrazosColorado and Rio Grande), subsidence and
accompanying loss of the delta plain is
minor. In fact, the deltas and alluvial

pattern was like at that time.
The thickness of Holocene valley fill in
south Louisiana directly affects modern
geological processes. The valley fill has
a potential for more compactional
subsidence than an adjacent sediment
column which encounters the Prairie
Formation at shallow depth. The essential
disappearance of the Bayou Teche levees to
the east of Morgan City is consistent with
an accelerated rate of subsidence along
the axis of the Holocene valley fill.
A regional geologic map of the Louisiana
coastal plain immediately to the west of
the Mississippi Trench shows the extensive
outcrops of the Prairie Formation (Fig. 27), beginning on the western outskirts of
the town of Franklin. The Prairie surface
is an alluvial plain which still bears
remarkably distinct meander scars of
ancestral courses both of the Mississippi
and Red Rivers.
The present Louisiana coast consists
entirely of Holocene components of the
Mississippi River delta system. This
delta is the Holocene
ter where
sediment enters and infills the Gulf COast
Geosyncline. Once intI'
ced to the
marine current field, some of t
s i
ments move along the shore and across the
adjacent continental shelf. Coarsegrained barrier-forming sand of
Mississippi origin is limited to the
Louisiana coast, whereas the mud fraction
is a major sediment source for both the
Louisiana and Texas shelves. Prevailing
westward currents prevent the river sediments from having any significant
10

Th r e e ma j 0 r sub d i vis ion s 0 f the
isiana coastal plain are recognized:
the active deltas, the abandoned deltas
and the del ta margin Chenier Plain. The
two former are here combined in a
discussion of the delta plain. The
juxtaposition of these environments
reflects the process of periodic switching
of the major river channel and the
attendant cycles of sedimentation within
the delta complex (Scruton, 1960; Cbleman
and Gagliano, 1964). The constructional
phase of active delta growth is
characterized by rapid progradation of the
local shoreline and the formation of a
thick wedge of terrigenous clastics. At
present there are two active deltas: the
Modern Mississippi Delta (birdfoot delta)
and the Atchafalaya Del ta (Fig. 2-8).
After about a thousand years of active
del ta growth, a major channel swi tch
occurs in response to hydraul ic gradient
advantages.
The old del ta lobe then
changes into its destructional phase
characterized by shoreline retreat,
development of flanking barriers and the
deposition of thin units of laterally
homogenous fine sediments. Concurrent
subs idence wi 11 gradually lower the old
del ta lobe sufficiently to make ita
potential site for a new episode of active
del ta growth, i.e. the star t of a new
cycle. As a consequence, the deltaic fill
consists of a series of stacked imbricate
sedimentary bodies (depositional
sequences); each body representing one
deltaic cycle (depositional episode).
Rapid deposition of sediment is the most
fundamental
tribute which distinguishes
ta
ilding from other types of mar ine
regression. At the Modern Mississippi
Delta the regressive development is

by the daily average
discharge of 1-1.5 mi 11 ion tons of
sediment; of this about 2 per cent is fine
sand, 98 per cent is silt and clay
(Scruton, 1960). There is a rapid seaward
decrease in grain size away from the river
mouth as a result of settling
fractionation of particles through the
water column. Sands and coarse silts are
deposited on the river mouth bars. As

these advance seaward, elongate bar finger
sands develop (Fi sk, 1961). Compact ion of
underlying muds permit the bar fingers to
attain a thickness in excess of 70 m.
The development of this pattern of
extensional "birdfoot" bar fingers is
possible because the Mississippi Delta is
perhaps the most strongly fluviallydominated delta of all major deltas in the
world.
The fluvial dominance is a
consequence of both the moderate wave
energy in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Mexico
and the very gentle nearshore profile off
the Mississippi Delta built by a rapid
influx of large quantities of fine
sediments. The shallow delta front
provides very effective attenuation of the
waves before they reach the shoreline
(Wright and
eman, 1973)

extensional bar finger distributaries,
inter-distributary bays are being infilled
with fine-grained organic-rich sediments
and coarser, broadly lenticular sandy silt
units, the crevasse splays. The crevasse
splays and attendant bay fills, formed by
flood breaching of the distributary
levees, represent scaled-down versions of
the major deltaic cycles, both in space
and time. Typicall y, maj or crevasse
splays remain active subdeltas for about a
century. ~evasse splay subdeltas forming
over the last 200 years account for most
of the subaerial extent of the Modern
Mississippi Delta (Coleman and Gagliano,
1964).
Seaward of the distributary mouths, the
loading of bar finger sand and silt upon
delta front clayey silts cause a
differential sediment loading with
consequent folding, diapiric intrusion,

Concurrent with the development of

and thrust faulting of the clay into and
through the accumulating sands of the
river mouth bar. The resulting "mudlump"
islands may rise to elevations of 10
m above sea level, and expose prodel ta and
and shelf clays thrust to the surface from
depths in excess of 100 m (Morgan et al.,
1968).
Submarine landslides play an important
role on the delta front and pro-delta
slope. Collapse depressions, elongate
flow slides, mudflow gullies and
overlapping mudflow lobes cover virtually
the entire submarine delta.
Many
instabilities are continually active.
Seafloor mapping with side-scan sonar
techniques and precision navigation
demonstrate that many mudflow lobes move
downslope at rates of 1 km per year.
Moreover, it is probable that large-scale
surges are part of the dynamics of mud
transport. Triggering of the initial
instability results from the action of
external stress from cyclic loading by
storm waves or localized rapid sediment
infl ux, combined wi th a reduct ion in
sediment strength through the internal
generation of biogenic methane gas (Prior
and Coleman, 1978). Once ini t iated, the
instabilities may expand through upslope
and lateral retrogressive flow sliding,
and downslope loading-induced substrate
failures. In an area as heavily covered
with offshore petroleum production
facilities as the Louisiana shelf and

slope, these submarine landslides
constitute one of the major natural
hazards.
A second active delta is currently
i Iding at the mout.h of the Atchafalaya
River. The Atchafalaya Delta emerged as a
subaerial feature after the large 1973
flood and cont inues to grow (van Heerden
and Roberts, 1980; van Heerden, 1982).
The submarine delta front presently
extends to the shell reefs at the entrance
to Atchafalaya Bay •. Prodelta muds of
Atchafalaya origin overlie some
Maringouin-age inner shelf shoals and
migrate westward as mudbanks along the
Chenier Plain shoreline (chapter 5). Were
it not for the Army Corps of Engineers'
flood control structure at the Old River
site, the Mississippi River would at
present probably have switched its entire
discharge to the Atchafalaya course.

The abandoned lobe rapidly becomes
eroding headland with barrier spits and
extending downdrift. The lobe has
the first stage in a sequence of
rier evolution (Penland et al., 1981;
land and Boyd, 1982). On the present
isiana coast the Caminada-Moreau
headland with the flanking barriers of
eaminada spit and Grand Isle to the east,
and Timbalier Islands to the west,
represent a stage 1 barrier complex. The
barr iers occupy the former margin of the

Erosion is rapid at the headland,
in excess of 10 m per year on the Caminada
coast.
With i reasing age of the abandoned

consequence of subsidence.
Marine
incursion of the back barrier marshes
causes the development of a shore-parallel
lagoon, and deeper bur i al of the old
distributary mouth bars removes the active
coarse-grained sediment source. As a
consequence, at this barrier stage (stage
2) the waves rework a finite sediment
volume. The subaerial islands decrease in
size as the sand moves seaward onto an
inner shelf sand sheet and landward, by
overwash, into a gradually deepening
lagoon. The Isles Dernieres on the flanks
of a delta complex of Early Lafourche age,
and the Chandeleur Islands, on the margin
of the st. Bernard delta represent two
examples of stage 2 barriers. The change
in morphology of Lake Pelto behind the

delta. This is the beginning of a new
cycle of active delta sedimentation in
this region.
Louisiana examples indicate that models
for barrier genesis should consider the
regional geologic history. As here
described, stage 1 is dominated by a
Gilbert (1885) mode of recurved spit
growth, and perhaps a deBeaumont (1845)
mode of vert ical bar accret ion.
The
transition from stage 1 to stage 2, on the
other hand, is a clear example of Hoyt's
(1967) concept of mainland beach ridge
detachment. Multiple causality (Schwartz,
1971) is truly valid for these barriers.
The Chenier Plain
The Chenier Plain ("chenier" comes from
the French word for oak: chene, indicating
the characteristic vegetation of the
ridges) extends from the western end of
Vermilion Bay to the east flank of the
Pleistocene Trinity delta in Texas, a
distance of about 200 km (Fig. 2-11). The
plain consists of a seaward-thickening
Holocene wedge of largely muddy sediments
wi th a set of essentially shore-parallel
ridges of she 11 hash and sand on the
surface and in the shallow subsurface
(Fig. 2-12). Stratigraphically, one can
clearly recognize a basal onlapping
sequence of inner shelf muds, associated

Because of subsidence of the source, the
subaerial delta flank barrier is
ultimately destroyed. The remaining
vestige of the barrier will be a submarine
sand shoal. Such shoals, of Teche and

overlain by an offlap sequence of
alternating or coalescing chenier ridges
and inter-ridge mudflat and marsh
deposits. The entire
is
about 7 to 8 m thick at the present
shoreline (Fig. 2-12).
It is generally accepted that this
sequence of ridges and coas tal marsh
reflects changes in the location of the
main point of Mississippi River discharge
(Russell, 1940; Byrne et aZ., 1959; Gould
and McFarlan, 1959). This classical

periods of easterly river debouchment, the
coastal marshes were supposed to have been
reworked by wave action into transgressive
beaches (chenier ridges). This concept
appears to be of general validity. For
example,
the oldest ridge in the complex
(Fig. 2-11) dates back to 2,800 years
B.P., which corresponds to the time when
the Mississippi River abandoned its Teche
course in favor of the much more easterly
St. Bernard lobe (Fig. 2-9). Simi lar
correlations can be seen in the younger
ridge sets as well. However, this simple
model does not explain the multiplicity of
ridges nor the fact that most ridge
systems do not correlate with known
Mississippi River channel avulsions.

The dictum that lithe present is the I(ey
to geological processes,
processes
provide the key to the past" appears
particularly well supported by the Olenier
Plain problem. AB mentioned elsewhere the
Atchafalaya River presently supplies large
amounts of mud to the western Louisiana
coast. AB a consequence, many segments of
the Chenier Plain coast are presently
prograding. The
ttern of mudflat
growth, however, is not a simple uniform
ogradation in front of the preexisting
beach. The
tern
progradation is, in
part, controlled by wave refraction across
inner shelf shoals, and in part by the
dynamics of coastwise mud transport. The
documented existence of multiple,
migrating accretionary zones may reflect
the formation of extensive coastal
mudbanks of a type similar to those on the
Surinam coast (Wells and Coleman, 1981).
14

The concept that mudflats prograde during
periods of abundant sediment supply, while
ridges form in response to local shoreline
retreat appears still valid. The pulses
sedimentation, however, may reflect the
passage of individual mudbanks rather than
I
scale fluctuations in the position
of the ul t imate sediment source (the
Amazon River for Surinam, the Mississippi
Ri ver here).
Further growth of the Atchafalaya delta
and consequent continued high rates of mud
influx to the Chenier Plain region appear
all but certain. A dissertation study by
Paul Kemp (Cbastal Studies Institute, LSU)
is currently in progress to monitor the
nature of mudflat progradation and the
hydrodynamics of mud transport. A
detailed review about what has recently
happened to the modern coastline of the
Chenier Plain is presented in chapter 5 in
this guidebook.

shoreline, Holocene marsh deposits only
about a meter thick overlie the
Pleistocene fluvial-deltaic sediments.
The shoreline west of Sabine Pass is
receding rapidly and the coastal highway
(State 87) is frequently closed due to
flooding and undermining of the pavement
(Fig. 2-14); these condi t ions are simi lar
to those found between Holly Beach and
Peveto Beach, Louisiana. This same road
was relocated in 1930 because its
predecessor was destroyed by shoreline
erosion.
In addition to old pavement
cropping out on the beach, other signs of
erosion include:
(1) a narrow steep
beach, (2) high concentrations of shell,
rock fragments and caliche nodules, and
(3) absence of or poorly developed dunes.
Unequivocal field evidence of beach

Lack of an adequate sand supply is a
major cause of these erosional conditions.
Between Sabine Pass and High Island, the
stiff delta-plain muds and adjacent
overwash terrace composed of sand and
shell form a steep beach. The coarse

the Pleistocene muds occurs mainly as a

"dunes" are artificially maintained by
washover sand that is graded onto the back
beach by the Highway Department in order
to protect the road. Long-term beach
erosion along this stretch ranges from 1.5
to 7.5 m/yr with rates generally
decreasing westward. In fact, west of
Rollover Pass on Bolivar Peninsula the

encompasses nearly 7,800 km 2• Both the
area and the rate of subsidence have
markedly increased during the last 30
years (Brown et al., 1974). Maximum subsidence on the order of 3 m was recorded
in the Baytown area where numerous homes
have been destroyed or abandoned because
the sites are presently bay bottom or salt
marsh. Thi s encroachment of Galveston Bay
led to the removal of many homes as part
of a salvage operation sponsored by the
neers.
A local subsidence district was formed
to monitor and perhaps control the
pumping. Although district regulations

consumption with surface supplies, the

withdrawal; primarily
water production, including
fines, is less costly than

c factors
not taken into account include the value
of land lost and the cost of increased

elevations.
The area of subsidence is bowl-shaped in
plan view but detailed leveling surveys
indicate that losses in ground elevation

are abrupt rather than gradual as depicted
by regional maps (Kreitler, 1976). The
most noticeable changes in ground level
coincide with fault traces projected from
the subsurface or fault scarps that are
exposed at the surface (Fig. 2-17).
COstly repairs are periodically necessary
to correct fault-damaged runways at Hobby
Airport and Ellington Air Force Base (Fig.
2-13). Moreover, Interstate 45 has been
patched several times where it crosses an
active fault. Fault damage is not limited
to paved surfaces.
In fact, large
apartment complexes, homes, and industrial
sites have also been damaged by vertical
displacement at the ground surface.
Faults are common in the Gulf Coast
basin but their recent activation in
certain areas appears to be caused by
human activities. For example, many of
the active faults occur in areas where

there has been a large decl ine (>30 m) in
the potentiometric surface and where
subsidence has been greater than 0.3 m
(Brown et al., 1974).

Ingleside Barrier Strandplain
The Ingleside barrier-strandplain (Figs.
2-18 and 2-19) represents a broad (16 km)
strike-aligned sand body that was
deposited under wave-dominated marine
conditions perhaps as much as 120,000
years ago (Winker, 1979). The sand was
supplied by the high-sinuousity rivers
that meandered across the coastal plain
and debouched into the Gulf, 8 to 25 km
inland from the present-day shoreline
(Fig. 2-20) Accret i on-f i dge topography
which surficially delineates the
strandplain, extends unbroken for nearly
160 km along the central Texas coast. The
strandplain has been variously named the

The Ingleside sand attains a maximum

(Fig. 2-19). It also thins seaward but
its downdip limit is uncertain; it has
been encountered in borings beneath
modern-day barriers including Matagorda,
San Jose, and North Padre Islands. The
nearshore marine deposits are typically
coarse- to fine-grained, yellow to brown

interfingers with brown mud. They overlie
hard, blue to gray, sandy clay with

are clean, well-sorted gravel-sized
deposits composed of shell, caliche
nodules, and rock fragments. These clean
gravels are interpreted as relict beach
deposits because of their similarity to
modern transgressive beaches such as
Sargent Beach. Relict sediments are
exposed at the seafloor or underlie a thin
veneer of shelf mud along the upper coast
and offshore from the Brazos~lorado and
Rio Grande deltas (Morton and Winker,
1979).

Wi thin the coastal bight formed by the
and Rio Grande deltas, the
inner shelf sediments show textural
grading in a seaward direction. Shoreface
sands extend up to several kilometers
offshore from the barriers and grade into
shel f muds (Fig. 2-21). The decrease in
grain size is also accompanied by a
general increase in bioturbat ion that
contributes to the sediment heterogeniety.

actual mechanisms involved in their
deposi tion remain unclear. Judging from
nearshore current data for recent storms,
large-scale bottom flows produced or
augmented by wind forcing are the most
likely explanation (Morton, 1981).
Highest current veloci ties on the shelf,
on the order of 2 m/sec, are recorded

shoreface (Figs. 2-22 and 2-23) are formed
by storm-related processes. Both proximal
and distal storm deposits are recognized
in cores taken off Matagorda Island (Fig.
2-22). Proximal deposits are composed
mostly of sands; overlying and associated
muds are subordinate in comparison to
total storm bed thickness. Vertical grain
size changes within these beds reflect
sediment composition. The basal shell and
rock fragment gravel grades upward into
very fine quartz sand which, in turn,
grades into clay-rich mUd. In ancient
rocks the proximal (shoreface) sands
typically exhibit hummocky crossstratification but because unconsolidated
sands are difficult to core and because
core width is limited, this large-scale
structure has not been recognized in
modern shelf sands.
The number and thickness of sand layers
and the total thickness of storm beds
decreases between proximal and distal
deposits. Parallel laminations and smallscale ripple cross laminations are the
most common stratification types found in
the fine sand layers. Overlying mud
layers can be extensively bioturbated or
homogenous. (Figs. 2-22 and 2-23).

The chenier ridges display a typical

Chenier composition and size varies
according to the nature and amount of
local material which was available at the
time of ridge formation. The front ridge
of this complex can be traced for more

Pecan Island complex adjacent to here is
about 210 m wide and has a biconvex shape

the chenier ridge below sea level, as well
as its depositional level, is attributed
to compaction and displacement of the
underlying mud by sand loading. As much

Pit

This pit is located wi thin a nested set
of younger chenier ridges ranging in age
probably from 600 to 400
rs. These
ridges are also considerably sandier than
most areas farther landward or to the
east. The primary sedimentary structures
seen in the walls correspond to those
typically found associated with modern
small back-beach washovers (Fig. 3-9). A
local surf-clam (Mulinia) and fragments of
crassotrea and Rangia shells dominate the
coarser shell-hash layers. In most of the
older ridges such coarse shell-hash

dominates the entire sequence. The
exposure in these pit walls will depend on
the water level. The pit is generally the
best one available within the Chenier
Plain complex.
The town of Cameron is located on a
broad fan of landward-recurving chenier
ridges which extend towards Calcasieu
Lake. This geometry, together wi th subsurface core data, suggests that the ridge
complex here was di rect ly respons i ble for
the formation of Calcasieu Lake through
the process of spit enclosure of an
earlier embayment of the GUlf of Mexico.
The 1.5 m mean elevation of the town
makes Cameron one of Louisiana's most
vulnerable towns during hurricane surges.
Th e tow n was I a r gel y des t roy e d by
Hurricane Audrey in 1957. More than 520
people lost their lives within Cameron
Parish during that storm. Cameron was
barely rebuilt when Hurricane Carla again
inflicted heavy damage in the fall of
1961. Evidence of the effects of these
two hurricanes is seen throughout the area
in the form of abandoned house foundations
and extensive, now-vegetated, washover
lobes of sand landward of the road. The
latter features are particularly
noteworthy on the west side of the

public Works. Although the stablization
was done in accordance wi th recommended
modern designs, including the use of
filtercloth for sand retention underneath
the gobi-blocks, the structure quickly
failed. Monitoring of the structure
indicates that the toe was the first to
fail; this was followed by rotational
failures progressing landward because of
lack of toe support. Already by the fall
of 1978 many of the gobi~blocks along the
edge of the pavement had been displaced.
Tropical storms in 1979 and Hurricane
Allen in 1980 caused further deterioration
of the structure. At present, the
structure has no significant stabilizing
influence on this road. Current plans
call for attempted stabilization of this
coastal segment through the construction
of a T-groin field and subsequent sand
nourishment. The sand is expected to be
found in shallow nearshore waters and
pumped ashore by a hydraulic dredge. The
project is one of a total of five
different coastal pilot projects proposed
for the Louisiana coast to be funded out
of the Coastal Enhancement Trust Fund,
established by the Louisiana Legislature
in the fall of 1981. The general plans
for this particular project are shown in

oldest permanent development on a Texas

that the port entrance to Galveston was
the first tidal inlet on the Texas Coast
to be greatly modified by dredging and
jetty construction. The Galveston Harbor
entrance (Fig. 3-11) serves as a good
example of modi! ications that have allowed

depleted, the north jetty beach has been
supplied by updrift erosion whereas
sediment transported by the counter
current around the south jetty has helped
maintain East Beach on Galveston Island.

A common misconception is that tidal
inlets in the northwestern GUlf of Mexico
have poorly developed tidal deltas,
especially ebb~tidal deltas
Although
this misconception is understandable (ebb
deltas were removed to deepen navigation
channels) is it not supported by
historical data including bathymetric
maps. In its natural state, Bolivar Roads
was a relatively stable inlet wi th
distinct ebb and floor channels and
corresponding shoals (Fig. 3-1tA). Unlike
other sand bodies formed in wave-dominated microtidal environments (Nummedal et
al., 1977), the ebb delta of Bolivar Roads
was extensive and consisted of wave-sorted
sand and shelly sand deposited as bars on
a broad shoal 12 to 18 m thick. Ebb
currents generated by the low astronomical
tide (tide range: <0.5 m) were undoubtedly
augmented by the large tidal prism and
fresh-water inflow (San Jacinto and
Trinity Rivers) of the Galveston Bay
system.
Efforts to increase water depths,
stabilize the channel, and reduce maintenance dredging were initiated in 1875
when wooden gabions were placed on brush
mattresses along the channel margins.
These structures eventually failed and
were replaced by the grani te blocks that
today extend nearly 11 km into the Gulf.
Major changes in the shorel ine and nearshore bathymetry accompanied and followed
jetty construction. The greatest changes
occurred rapidly. For example, between
1882 and 1930 the shoreline along the
north jetty accreted 335 m while the soutn
jetty shoreline reached a near equilibrium
it ion that it presently maintains. A
broad sand flat with elevations only about
a meter above sea level was created as the
shorel ine accreted, but after the shore~
line reached an equilibrium position,
fore isl
dunes formed and were
equently st lilized by
tat ion.
These foredunes B.re comparable n size to
those removed in the late 1800s to provide
fill and a higher grade for the city.

(R. A. Morton)

During the late 1800s the eastern end of
Galveston Island grew rapidly in response
to increased trade and port activities.
This residential and commercial development was accompanied by the removal of
sand dunes up to 4.5 m high that provided
the only natural storm protect ion. As a
consequence, the extreme hurricane of 1900
that struck Galveston claimed more than
600 lives and destroyed more than 2,600
homes when a 6-m storm surge swept over
the island. The local people responded by
initiating construction of the famous
Galveston seawell (Fig. 3-12), a pilesupported concrete wall wi th an embankment
that stretches for more than 16 km along
the island's Gulf shore. The seawall cost
more than 15 million dollars and another 6
million dollars was spent to raise and
grade the city (Davis, 1952). These costs
were borne by Galveston County and the
Federal Government.

1915 storm was responsible for removing
most of the beach sand seaward of the
seawall and scouring the upper shoreface
to depths of 1.2 m below the riprap toe
(Davis, 1952). The beach erosion and
attendant sheet pile exposure and riprap
settlement prompted the construction of 13
groins, each 150 m long and spaced 450 m
apart.
The groin field, which was
finished in 1939, traps enough sand below
mean low t ide to protect the seawall toe
but not enough sand for a recreational
beach. The mass i ve gravi ty-type seawall
is curved near the base and vertical at
the top (Fig. 3-12) to reduce wave runup
and minimize overtopping. The road pavement serves as a splash apron and protects
the underlying sandfill from erosion.
Minimum thickness of the seawall is 1.5 m
~~~~~~~except for the westernmost segment which
is 1 m thick.
The seawall effectively reflects much of
the energy from storm waves that break on
or near the seawall. As a resul t, strong
currents flow seaward from the seawall toe
and the beach sand is lost to the longshore currents or deposi ted on the lower
shoreface below normal wave base. Lack of
sequential data preclude estimates of
beach eros i on along the cent ral reach of
the seawall, however, eros ion rates have
nearly doubled along the westernmost
segment. The Gulf shoreline immediately
adjacent to the western end of the seawall
is retreating more than 3 m per year and
the wide sand beach that formerly existed
seaward of the seawall has been lost to
erosion (Morton, 1974). Because of the
high rates of erosion and loss of
recreational beach, the COrps of Engineers
has recommended a beach nourishment
project for this area.

S10P 9. Follets Island
(K. A. IIIIorton)

Most of the features that typify lowprofile, transgl'essive barriers (Fig. 2-4)
are found on Follets Island. The barrier
is narrow «1,000 m), surface elevations
are low «1.5 m), and the foredunes are
low and discontinuous. Furthermore,
sho['el ine el'osion is prevalent along the
island. Rates of erosion generally
decrease westward toward the Brazos River
and range from 0.5 to 3 m/yr. These high
rates of retreat prevent the development
of large foredunes and as a consequence
the island is frequently washed over during tropical cyclones. Overwash occurs as
sheet flooding rather than as confined
flow through individual washover channels
that are characteristic of some other
transgressive barriers.
A transect of the island from bay to
Gulf shoreline encounters salt-water
marsh, vegetated barrier flat, dunes, and
beach subenvironments (Fig. 3-14). The
back-barrier marshes and associated tidal
creeks are the most extensive
subenvironment. They are composed of
burrowed and root mottled sandy and shelly
muds that are covered with salt-tolerant
plants such as Spartina alterniflora,
Battis maritima and Salicornia SPa The
barrier flat is a narrow strip of shelly
sand wi th elevations slightly higher than
the marsh. On Follets Island the barrier

greatest subsidence has occurred where
conditions are just the opposite.

Until its diversion in 1929, the mouth
of the Brazos River served as the entrance
to Freeport Ha.rbor.
But recurring
siltation from frequent floods made it
extremely difficult to maintain a
navigable channel where this relatively
sha.llow, low-gradient river emptied into
the Gulf (Fig. 2-13). From the late 1800s
to the early 1900s, numerous attempts were

made to improve the harbor entrance; these
modifications caused significant shoreline
changes and some of the most serious'
coastal erosion problems clearly caused by
human activities.

In fact the economic losses attendant with
beach erosion and destroyed homes have
been so great that the COrps of Engineers
has recommended a beach nourishment
project for Surfside.

The first major changes accompanied
jetty construction which began in 1881 and
was completed in 1896. The shorel ine
accreted rapidly following jetty construction (Fig. 3-16) and continued to accrete
until the diversion channel was opened.
The highest rate of shoreline accretion
occurred west of the river mouth and in
the direction of predominant longshore
currents (Morton and Pieper, 1975). Maximum outbuilding between 1881 and 1930 was
1,860 m or an average of about 37 m/yr.
Erosion rates in the same area (Fig. 3-16)
were even more spectacular once the riverine discharge and sediment supply were
eliminated. For example, the shoreline
adjacent to the west jetty retreated 1,435 Figura 3-17. BaBch house being

considerably less (7.5-10 m/yr), although
they are extremely high by most coastal
standards.
S'RP 11. New Brazos Del ta
The recent erosion is in sharp contrast
to the long-term changes which show a net
gain for the area since 1853 (Fig. 3-16).
Unfortunately, the landowners who built
seaward of the 1850s shoreline are not
aided by the net accretion (Fig. 3-17).

and the diversion channel was completed in
1929. Since that time the Brazos River
has constructed an extensive subaqueous
platform and subaerial del ta (Fig. 3-18)
that is continually modified by daily
coastal processes and storms.
Shoreline changes attendant with delta
progradation (Fig. 3-16) have been impressive. Between 1930 and 1957 the beach
east of the Brazos River (Bryan Beach)
advanced gulfward more than 1.5 km whi Ie
at the same time maximum accretion
(1,075 m) occurred just west of the river
mouth. Rates of delta progradation during
this period varied between 60 and 75 m/yr
(Morton and Pieper, 1975). Since that
time the Bryan Beach area has undergone
extensive erosion (18 m/yr), while the
western shoreline has continued to grow
seaward with a shift in maximum delta
growth toward the west or in the direction
of littoral drift.

probably continues to be significant in
causing westward migration of the delta.
The ultimate fate of the new delta is
uncertain but it may be entering 8 longterm erosional history because. the two
most important sediment sources have been
essentially depleted.'
Although naturally-occurring, wavedominated deltas are absent in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, the new Brazos
delta (Fig. 3-19) embodies many of the
properties that are attributed to intensive marine reworking. The delta exhibits
an upward-coarsening sequence of textures
beginning with shelf and prodelta muds and
ending wi th shoreface and beach ridge
sands that are products of winnowing by
waves. On closer examination the SP
curves and grain-size analysis (Bernard et
al., 1970) show upward coarsening in the
lower progradational facies followed by
upward-fining aggradational sediments
deposited in natural levee, marsh, and
back-bar subenvironments. Ponds and
swales between the beach ridges also trap

These remarkable shoreline changes were
caused by rapid local changes in sediment
supply. The three major sediment sources
for outbuliding of the new Brazos delta
were:
(1) normal fluvial sediment
transport, (2) bank erosion of the
diversion channel, and (3) erosion of the
old Brazos delta. Although the Brazos
River
the highest continuous discharge
and silt load of any Texas river, its
cont i
tion of fluvial sediment was
probably minor considering that the mixed~
load river was unable to build a

jetty construction.

sediment contributed by cross~sectional
adjustment of the diversion

Another important factor in building the

the delta margin a thin, upward-coarsening
sequence overlies the fine-grained deltaplain deposits where transgressive beach

detri tus wi th bay species (Crassotrea
virginica, Rangia cuneata, and Mercenaria
sp.) being most abundant in certain areas.
This mixed shell assemblage is typical of
many Gulf beaches because the bay-estuary
species are eroded from Holocene deltaplain muds as the shoreline retreats.
Sargent Beach is far removed from major
sediment sources (river mouths) and human
activities that directly influence
shoreline changes. For that reason it is
significant that the area has experienced
the highest short-term (12 m/yr) and longterm (4.3 m/yr) rates of erosion (Figs. 321 and 3-22) along the Texas coast (Morton
and Pieper, 1975). Since the mid-1800s
the beach has retreated more than 520 m.

The new Brazos del ta is a small
geological feature, and yet it contains
nearly 56 million m of sand. Naturallyoccurring, wave-dominated deltas are
substantially larger and their sand
volumes are greater by several orders of
magnitude.

Cbmmon delta-plain deposits (levee, marsh)

contrast, interdistributary-bay sediments

Distributary channels are floored by fine
sand and silty sand that grade up into mud
as the channel becomes abandoned; channelfill deposits are usually between 3 and
4.5 m thick. The channels are narrow and
stablilized by the high mud content of the

This southeast-facing beach connects the
south tip of the Key Allegro recurved spit
to the mainland shore of Aransas Bay (Fig.
2-18). The sandy beach is located behind
a shallow-water platform characterized by
a series of shore-parallel sandy bars
(Fig. 3-28). The platform extends into
the bay to a d th of about 1.5 to 2 m.
At this point there is a sudden increase
in water depth to about 3 m or more.
Precision bathymetric profiles across this
platform into deeper water demonstrate
that the bar morphology is confined to the

Hurricane Allen flattened the Rockport

landfall a new set of bars began to emerge
wi th morphology and spacing commensurate
with those that had been there before.
Extensive box coring through this bar

This pass is the natural tidal entrance
for Aransas Bay to the north.
As
demonstrated by Price (1963) natural tidal
. passes along the south Texas coast are all
located at the southeast corner of their
corresponding lagoon-bay systems. This
location appears to be the equilibrium
position for tidal passes maintained by
strong ebb currents during "northers".
These winds, which are associated with
frontal passage, typically occur on a
five-day cycle during the winter season.
Based on the analysis of the wind-field
associated with Hurricane Allen (see
chapter 4), it appears that lagoonal
currents induced by wind stress from a
tropical storm system during hurricane
approach and landfall, also would favor a
tidal pass location in the southeast
corner of the lagoon.
The reasoning
applied to Aransas Pass would appear to
explain Brazos Santiago Pass as the stormmaintained equilibrium outlet for South
Laguna Madre, Corpus Christi Pass as the
outlet for un'pus OIristi Bay, Cedar Bayou
as the outlet for San Antonio Bay, and,
perhaps, Pass cavallo as the natural outlet for Matagorda Bay (see Fig. 2-3).

natural barrier against significant water
exchange with either Corpus Christi Bay or
Redfish Bay. The natural tidal pass for
Corpus Christi Bay at this time was the
inlet complex at the south end of Mustang
lsi and (F i g. 3 - 31) •
Th i s will be
discussed in greater detail at stop 16.
.

The morphology of the Aransas Bay
shoreline clearly demonstrates the strong
influence of northerly winds. At stop 14
we visited a beach at the south margin of
Key Allegro. The natural core of thls key
was a recurved sand spit formed in
response to wave-induced littoral drift
towards the south. At the southern end of
the bay one encounters two spit-complexes.
Mud Island on the east side and the
Traylor "Islands" blocking the entrance to
Redfish Bay on the west side (Fig. 3-30).
The spit morphology suggests their equilibrium shape with respect to southwarddi rected net longshore transport.
Shamrock Island, on .the Col'PUS Olristi Bay
side of Mustang Island, is a recurved spi t
complex of coarse bay~derived shells which
documents the continued southward longshore transport on the eastern shore of
this bay.

In its natural configuration Aransas
Pass was not stable. Historical maps
reviewed by Price and
rker (1979)
indicate a
ive southward mi
ion
of the main channel. The data actually
suggest a cyclic displacement of the pass,
with slow southward migration followed by
a sudden reestablishment of the channel at
a more northerly location. Figure 3-32
indicates that one such "avulsion" might
have occurred between the years 1720 and
1833. Such sudden updr i ft tidal channel
shifts are very corrunon and well documented
along the east coast of the Uhited States
(Fi tzGerald and Hayes, 1980). A recent
dram at ice x amp leo f s u c h c han n e I
displacement was the breaching of the spit
which connected the east jetty at Moriches
Inlet, Long Island, to the mainland at
Westhampton Beach. This breach occurred
during a storm in late January of 198~.
Prior to the actual breach event this spit
had been subject to bay shore erosion
through the seaward migration of a tidal
channel cutbank. Similar erosion from
currents in Lydia Ann Channel could easily
set the stage for a breaching here at the
south end of San Jose Island.
The western Gulf of Mexico is subject to
strong southeasterly winds during the
summer and a combination of northerfy and
south-southeasterly winter winds (Fig. 333). As a consequence, the longshore
sediment transport pattern along the Texas
coast is characterized by a regional
westward transport everywhere north of the
27th parallel (Fi.g. 3-34). South of this,
the net annual transport is northward,
causing a convergence zone at central
Padre Island (Lohse, 1955).
Transport rates along the shorel ine of'
Mustang Island have
calcul
on a series of visual wave observations
performed on this beach (1.6 km south of
jetty) on a daily basis between September
1972 and June 1975. The measurements were

part of the Littoral Environment Observation (LEO) program conducted by the
(bastal Engineering Research center. The
resul ts demonstrate that typical summer
wave conditions (May to September) are
characterized by small, short-period waves
arriving from the southeast, thus producing longshore currents and net-sediment
transport to the north. During the
remainder of the year, waves from due east
prevail, with longer periods and larger
heights. These induce southward longshore
currents and sediment transport. Following calculation procedures outlined in the
U.S. Army, Coastal Engineering Research
Center (1975), Watson and Behrens (1976)
found that the annual mean gross transport
rate on this beach is 550,000 m with a
small net southward transport of about
50,000 m. Net transport varied greatly
from one year to the next but was always
directed southward.

The latest in a long series of hurricane
breachings and storm-surge sediment
deposition events in this area occurred
during Hurricane Allen, on August 10th,
1980. Both Newport Pass and Corpus
Christi Pass were breached by Allen,
Packery channel remained closed. Both of
the opened passes remained active for
about one year.

Figure 3-37. Foredune erosion at the "Lost Colony"
after Hurricane ALLen. Photo was taken on August
15, 1980 w five
after hurricane LandfaLL

Today this barrier stretch has low
elevations, and the dunes are low and
discontinuous. Flooding is frequent and
. overwash occurs during hurricanes and even
for strong northers. The three passes are
reopened periodically by storm surges but
they close within a relatively short
period of times, usually a few months to a
few years. The area poses problems for
storm evacuation of Mustang Island because
the bridge approaches are easily eroded.
The detailed Holocene stratigraphy
beneath this area is complex due to the
multiple episodes of channel migration,
abandonmen t, and r eac t i vat ion. McGowen
(Morton and McGowen, 1980) described the
sediments encountered by shallow borings
near Packery Channel and interpreted the
depositional events recorded by the
sediment textures, composition, and fauna
(Fig. 3-41). Channel-fill deposits, which
account for the bulk of Holocene sediments
in the area, are identified by multiple
upward-fining cycles. Each cycle begins
with a scoured base which is overlain by a
shell gravel lag that grades upward into
fine sand and shelly sand. Channel
abandonment was accompanied by deposition
of bay mud and muddy sand containing bay
mollusks. Similar bay and lagoon deposits
occur along the landward margin of the
inlet. Together these Holocene deposi ts
are 6 to 7 m thick
are in eros ional
contact with underlying Pleistocene sands
of barrier strandplain origin (Ingleside
Sand) •

The storm tide elevation during Allen
was not particularly high in this area.
Figure 3-42 shows that the Gulf tide
peaked at about 150 cm at the South Jetty
at Port Aransas whereas it reached about
230 cm on the gauge at Corpus Christi.
This difference probably reflects the
effect of wind-driven water

into the

narrow upper part of Corpus Christi Bay
where the ci ty gauge is located. Corpus
Christi Pass itself, however, would have
been entirely under water at a tide of
1 m The relative elevations of the Gulf
and" Bay waters depicted in Figure 3-42
suggest that the flood surge during August
9th was followed by a slack period later
in the day and an ebbing surge on the
10th. Because of the remoteness of both
gauges from the Pass, it is impossible. to
infer anything about the relatIve
strengths of the currents from these
records. Mapping of surface morphology
after the storm from aerial and ground
surveys, however, clearly demonstrates
that the flood event was the dominant one.

The Allen deposits are relatively thin,

Because the bulk of the deposit was

The largest barrier islands along the
Texas Coast are high-profile regressive
barriers (Fig. 2-4). Typically, they are
5 to 8 km wide and encompass vast areas
with elevations greater than 3 m. The
foredunes are high, continuous and well
vegetated, and prevent storm overwash
except where the foredune r i age has been
breached by blowouts or eliminated by
inlet migration. The subenvironments of
high-profile ba.rriers are composed
predominately of sand; sediments composed
of shell material or clay are minor or
absent.

The dunes are stabilized by salt-tolerant

only the dunes on Padre Island are much
taller. The beach width (75 m) and slope
(1.5 degrees) are also different from
those found on Follets Island (Fig. 3-15).

The shoreline along North Padre is
relatively stable as shown by the net
accretion (15 to 40 m) recorded since the
late 1800s. However, during the past
decade the beach along Mustang and other
segments of Padre Island has entered an
erosional cycle.
Dickinson et al., (1972) reported that a
Pleistocene shell bed beneath North Padre
Island was overlain by more than 18 m of
sand which they implied was associated
with the extant barriers. It appears,
however, that approxinlately the uppermost
10 to 12 m of sand are attributable to
North Padre Island whereas the lowermost
sand section is probably of Pleistocene
age, and most likely stratigraphically
equivalent to the Ingleside strandplain.
Similar sand thicknesses are found beneath
San Jose Island and central Padre Island
where only a change in color from gray
sand to tan or brown sand marks the
boundary between Holocene and Pleistocene
sediments.

Because user demand is substantially less

)

One unfortunate aspect of beaches along
the Gulf coast of Texas is the prevalence
of a substance known as "beach tar".
Beach tar is an all inclusive term applied
to a variety of different hydrocarbonder i ved depos i t8 found along shorel ines.
The SUbstance may be soft and gummy, or
quite indurated; and be composed almost
entirely of oil or mixed with varying
amounts of sand and shell. It occurs in
forms ranging from thin pancake-like blobs
to large chunks, and even to tar "mats" up
to tens of meters in length. Padre Island
is not exempt from the occurrence of beach
tar, and in fact often has more than its
share.

-iiii;j

The source of tar on Texas beaches has
long been a subject of debate for
scientists and coastal residents.
Certainly some of the tar is natural,
originating in hydrocarbon seeps which are
known to occur in the oil-rich Gulf of
Mexico and along the coasts of Texas and
Mexico. Most of the tar, however, owes
its existence to oil released into the
marine environment by human activities.
The origin of beach tar can be ascertained
by several methods, such as analysis by
gas chromatography and/or mass
spectroscopy to identify characteristic
organic compounds, or by analysis of trace
metals in the tar which might be
attributed to a particular type of crude
oiL In order to facilitate comparisons
with tar, different crude oils can be
artificially "weathered" to stimulate
degradation in the marine environment.

By far the best known oil spi 11 that has
affected Padre Island began on June 3,
1979, when the exploratory well Ixtoc #1
blew out in the Gulf of Campeche (Fig. 346) offshore of CUidad carmen, Mexico. In
the early days of the blowout the output
was in the range of 30,000-50,000 barrels
of oil per day. As the first efforts to
cap the well failed, it became apparent
that the Gulf of Mexico was to experience
an oil spill of appalling magnitude.
Continued attempts to stop the blowout
were unsuccessful. By the time a second
relief well managed to shut off the flow
in late March of 1980, over 3.3 billion
barrels of oil had been released, making
Ixtoc the largest oil spill in history
(Woods and Hannah, 1981).

The first Ixtoc oil drifted ashore as
tar balls on Padre Island in early August
1979.
Impact continued into early
September, with oil being found as mousse
and tar balls of various sizes. Gulf
waters showed a fairly constant oil
sheen. After September 2, 1979, no new
oil that could be definitely attributed to
Ixtoc same ashore, although the waters
still shone with oil. Deposition of new
sand and wave reworking covered much of
the tar. Beaches of high publ ic use were
cleared both by heavy machinery and hand,
while local businesses dependent on the
tourist trade searched for someone to pay
compensation. A tropical depression
associated with HUrricane Frederic removed
over 90 per cent of the tar along the
shoreline (Gunlach, et al., 1981).

Prevai ling Gulf currents moved the oi 1
north and west, threatening the northern
Mexican coast as well as the beaches of
south Texas. As the first effects of the
spill were felt along Mexican beaches,
plans were being made to protect the Texas
coastline as best as possible. The Coast
Guard headed up a major effort involving
many government agenc i es, uni vel'S i ti es,
and private interest~. Booms and skimmers
were deployed in tidal inlets, such as
Aransas Pass and Brazos Santiago Pass,
prevent floating oil from entering the
ecologically vulnerable bays and
estuaries. Cedar Bayou, a narrow pass

Other than the uns ightl y mess, the
effects of the spill on Padre Island were
difficul t to assess. Al though the Coast
Guard was unable to prevent oil landfall,
the booms and skimmers were successful in
keeping most of the oil out of the
vulnerable estuaries.
Shore bird
populat ions declined along Gulf beaches,
due mainly to birds avoiding the oiled
areas (Chapman, 1981). Populations of
infauna declined after oil impact, but
57

researchers were unwilling to
unequivocably attribute the die-off to
Ixtoc oil (Kindiger, 1981; Thebeau at al.,
1981). Most of the oi 1 that came a~hore
as mousse was washed off the relatIvely
impermeable fine sand beaches of Padre; :
only in the coarser mixed shell and sa~d
areas of Big and Little Shell beaches dId
oil percolate into the sediment to any
great extent (Gundlach et al., 1981)'.
Aiter removal of much of the tar balls by
the tropical depression, more tar balls
carne ashore and the existence of the tar
mats was discovered. These mats survived
the impact of Hurricane Allen in 1980,
although changed in numbers and position.
The extent and location of the mats are
not known at present, due to the lack of a
monitoring progrrun.
Today many south Texas residents and
visitors to Padre and Mustang Islands see
large concentrat ions of beach tar on the
sand::;, which they attribute to the Ixtoc
spill. Some may be, but their origin is
problematic since smaller oil spills are a
not infrequent occurrence. The beach tar
probl ern in sou th Texas is exacerbated by
two conditions: (1) the existence of a
large refinery complex in Cbrpus Christi,
and thus frequent tanker traffic, and (2)
the fact that prevailing currents in the
western GUlf of Mexico tend to converge on
Padre Island. Thus, any oil which escapes
from the tankers ends up as tar balls on
Padre Island. The practice of tankers
flushing their holds after discharging
their cargoes has long been suspected, but
is virtually impossible to detect. Other
than Ixtoc, no other spill of any
magni tude has affected Padre Island as a
result of offshore drilling. Although
beach tar is a natural occurrence along
Texas beaches, in its current unpleasant
and ever-increasing quantities, it
represents one example of an undesirable
side effect of an economically beneficial
petroleum industry.
History
(J. R. Suter)

Padre Island

The earliest known human inhabitants of
Padre Island were small groups of nomadic
Indians. The best known and most numerous
of these were the Karankawas (or

Carancahuas), tribes of which survived
along the Texas coasta'l plain and barr ier
islands as hunters, fishers, and
gatherers.
Descriptions of the appearance, habits,
and lives of the Karankawas are far from
appealing, but European observers were
rarely sympathet ic.
The "Kronks"
apparently wintered on the mainland and
spent summers on Padre Island in makeshift
huts, living on a diet of fish, shellfish,
birds and eggs, supplemented by game as
well as fruits, nuts and berries. To
repel mosquitoes and biting flies, the
Indians smeared themselves with a mixture
of animal and fish oil whose strong odor
made almost an unfavorably an impression
on early explorers as the Kronks ritual
cannibal ism, and the feroci ty wi th which
they resisted the encroachment of
c i viI i z at ion.
Th e Ka ran k a was we r e
eventually oblitered by the mid 1800s,
leaving no known descendents.
Spaniards were the first Europeans to
di scover Padre Island ("Isla Blanca"). In
1519 Alfonso de Pineda mapped the coast of
the Gulf of Mexico from Tampico, Mexico,
to the strai ts of Florida. Among the many
places his voyage discovered were the Bay
of Corpus Christi, Padre Island, and the
Rio Grande River. A large Spanish
treasure fleet bound for Cuba out of
Veracruz was scattered by a hurricane in
1554, with three ships eventually running
aground off southern Padre Island. The
surviving mariners and passengers
disembarked onto the sands of Padre Island
and headed south for Mexico, only to find
themselves pursued by vengeful Karankawas.
Only one survi vor of the "FI ight of Three
Hundred" reached Tampico.
Another
castaway cleverly remained with the
beached ships (and their supplies),
correctly reasoning that a search would be
mounted for the mi S8 ing treasure. He was
rescued three months later by a salvage
expedition.
So efficient at these
operations were the colonial Spaniards
that very little precious metal was ever
discovered at the shipwrecks by modern
archaeologists.
Early Spanish efforts to colonize south
Texas were generally unsuccessful and
their presence in the region was an effort

58

to counter the territorial designs of
England and France. In the mid to late
1700s, Spanish colonists established
themselves as ranchers as far north as the
Nueces River. In 1800, a priest named
Padre Balle (from whom Padre Island got
its name) obtained a royal Spanish land
grant to the island and began ranching
operations. His family ranched the island
until the 1840s but sold out and/or were
driven off by land-hungry Texans.
Descendants of Padre Balle press claims to
Padre Island to this day.
When Texas was annexed by the United
States in 1845, Amer ica chose to support
the Texan claim to the Rio Grande River as
the border with Mexico, while the Mexicans
maintained their choice of the Nueces
River. General Zachary Taylor occupied
the disputed region, camping for a time in
Corpus Christi before moving south to what
became Brownsvi 11 e. OUr ing the Mexican
War, supplies were moved to the American
Army through Port Isabel by way of Brazos
Santiago Pass.
At the end of the
conflict, the Rio Grande border was
secured and Padre Island was offically a
part of the Uhited States.

1863. The Confederates retook the ci ty,
but fighting in the Padre Island area did
not end until the last battle of the Civil
War was fought at Los Palmitos, 34 days
after Lee's surrender at Appomattox.
The hungry soldiers of the Civil War
wiped out the Padre Island cattle herds;
but during the ensuing Reconstruction,
large herds of horses and cattle wandered
freely on the coastal plain.
To
capitilize on this resource, hide
tallow factories were set up. One such
packery was built at the north end of
Padre Island and the inlet between Padre
and Mustang Islands thus acquired its name
of Packery channel. By the late 1800s,
however, cattle drives, railroads, and
fenced ranges drove the packeries out of
business.
.A1~other Irishman, Patrick F. Dunn, began
bUYlng Padre Island acreage in 1879, and
eventually owned most of the island. On
Padre Island, the Gulf and Laguna Madre
formed natural fences, and free roaming
herds were rounded up sou th to nor th and

1926, the same time the dredging of a
deep-water port for COrpus Christi through
Aransas Pass caused the closing of the
inlet separating Mustang and Padre
Islands.

Significant· American settlement and
exploitation of south Texas and Padre
Island dates from the wartime boom and
gold rush business of the 1850s. Shallow
draft steamboats were driven up the Rio
Grande to Laredo by enterprising captains

The drive to establish a Park on the
island began in the 1930s. The Texas
state Legislature passed a bill
authorizing acquisition of Padre Island as
a State Park. Governor James Allred vetoed
the bill since the State already claimed
to own that part of Padre Island, which
was not covered in the original Balle land
grant. Long drawn-out suits over title
ensued, not settled until 1945, with land
rights going to private interests.

It was not until 1954 that the National
Park Service recommended Padre Island as
one of the first National Seashores. By
the time the seashore was es tabli shed in
1962, both the northern and southern tips
of the island were connected to the
mainland by causeways, and development had
begun.

Today, Padre Island is a study in
contrasts. The relative wildness of the
stretches of the National Seashore are
juxtaposed with the condominia and hotels
of the developments.

hydrocarbons continues (private owners
still have mineral rights), and cattle

Hopefully, as much as possible of the
island will be left in a natural state,
closely resembling that seen by the first
actors in the island's rich and varied
past.

would expect warmer temperatures to
increase the likelihood of hurricane

generation. The question is, have the
temperature fluctuations over the last
century been of great enough magnitude to
have a noticeable effect on tropical storm
production? A preliminary analysis has
yielded an affirmative answer to this
question. The number of Atlantic tropical
storms per year (data from Neumann et aZ.,
1978) was correlated with the mean annual
temperature fluctuations within the global
low-Iati tutde bel t (23.5° N to 23.5° S)
(data from Hansen at aZ., 1981)
A
distinct positive correlation was found to
exist. the total range in 5-year-smoothed
mean annual temperatures within this lowlatitude belt was 0.6° C, a figure significantly less than that for the total
global average. The average annual number
of hurricanes more -than doubled over this
temperature range. It is also qui te evident, when one looks at statistics for the
U.S. as a whole, that hurricane landfalls
have been much more frequent during the
last 50 (warmer) years than during the
previous 50.

pared for a significant increase in
hurricane landfalls and storm tide inundation levels

As the hurricane system moves across the
sea, it is accompanied by a super-elevated
water surface both because of the reduced
local atmospheric pressure, creating what
is known as the "inverse barometer
effect", and the wind stress imparted to
the water surface.
As the hurricane
approaches land the water level along the
shore will rise in response to this
"surge" Prior to the actual arrival of
the hurricane surge, water levels may
already have risen up to a meter from the
effects of
iad forerunners
the hurricane storm waves. The wind distribution in a hurricane is generally
asymmetrical wi th the most intense winds
occurring to the right of the storm track
because of the vectorial addition of the
circulatory storm winds and the forward
movement of the storm system (Fig. 4~6).
Th ere suI tan t s tor m sur g e i s a l so
asymmetric with peak surge always recorded
some tens of kilometers to the right of
the point of landfall. The maximum wave
energy is transmitted directly forward in
the direction of movement of the storm
(Fig. 4-6).

A total of 15 hurricanes have struck the
Louisiana-Texas coast since 1957 (Fig. 44). This rate is about the same as the
average for the century. Seven of these
were major, with a central pressure of
less than 950 mb at the time of landfall.

Using Jelesnianski's (1972) SPLASH II
model, as recommended by the' National
Academy of Sciences (1975), the Texas
Coastal and Marine Council (1978) has
calculated the expected open coast surge
distribution for the design hurricane
along the Texas and extreme western
Louisiana coasts. Per definition, the
des i gn hur r i cane is one wh i ch has a central pressure index with a recurrence
interval of 100 years. Based on studies
of hurricane climatology, it is found that
the design hurricane generally decreases
in intensity from south Texas northward to
the western Louisiana coast (Table 4-4).
Th i sis con sis ten t wit h the hu r ric an e
landfall frequencies depicted in Figure 43. The radius of maximum winds is set at
22 km for all of them and the forward
speed of motion is 14 kt. Figure 4-8
depicts the location of the calculation
points and the resultant storm surge distribution. The storm surge distribution
curve along the coast shows a local high

and 4), 'a decrease farther northward tor t Arans.as

local shelf shoaling factor. The rapid
increase in the shoaling factor to the
east of Galveston (Fig. 4-7) is responsible for the steep upturn in the predicted
storm curve towards the Louisiana border.
It should be pointed out that the storm
surge is not equivalent to the actual
elevation of the water surface during a
hurricane landfall.· The storm surge constitutes only one compon~nt of the actual
observed "storm tide", the water elevation
recorded at a tide or surge gauge. In
addition to the surge, the actual water
level reflects the fore-runner elevation
( t yp i call y up t 0 one m), t he s t age 0 f t he
astronomical tide at the time of landfall
(between +0.3 and -0.3 m relative to mean
sea level along the Gulf Coast), and the
wave set-up. To estimate actual storm
tide elevation for the design hurricane
along the northwest Gulf COast, therefore,
one should probably add about 1 m (3 ft)
to the elevations in Figure 4-8 in the
case of landfall during astronomical high

Both distributions show an asymmetry in
storm tide elevations along the coast with
respect tothe point of landfall of the

eye. The peak tide is invariably recorded
some tens of kilometers to the right of
(to the north and east of) the point of
hurricane landfall. Furthermore, the tide
elevation as a function of distance
declines much more rapidly south of (to
the left of) the point of landfall than to
the north (or east). Actual recorded tide
elevations fall within a broad range
because of local effects at the gauge
location. In plots of this nature (Hayes,
1967; Nummedal et al , 1980), it is
commonly found that tide gauges located on
the open coast fall near the lowet"
boundary of the distribution whereas those
at lagoon and bay locations generally
cover a wide range. In nearly all cases,
the maximum storm tide elevation recorded
during anyone storm is found in a bay.
Local funneling of the storm tide and wind
stress on the shallow bay water bodies are
responsible for this degree of scatter in
mainland tide elevations.
The Hurricane Carla storm tide attained
an elevation of nearly 7 m at Port Lavaca
in the upper part of Matagorda Bay. This
is the highest storm tide recorded along
the northwest Gulf Coast in recent

Carla is evident from Figure 4-9, which
shows that storm tides in excess of 1 m
were observed along the entire coast from
the Mississippi Del ta to the Rio Grande.
Hurricane Allen, which began as a major
hurricane in the Caribbean had decayed at
the time of landfall and consequently
produced a much smaller storm tide both in
terms of maximum height (3 m at South
Padre Island) and lateral

Environmental effects of hurricanes,
such as property damage, extensive flooding and short-term shoreline erosion are
functions of wind intensity, rainfall,
wave heights and the storm tide. Effects
directly attributable to the storm tide
are generally the most severe. Long-term
geological effects, with a distinct
imprint in the stratigraphic record,
appear to be directly controlled by the
storm tide. Storm tide elevations, their
recurrence intervals, and the stratigraphy
and morphology of the local coastline are,
therefore, factors of great interest in
studies of the geological effects of major
storms •

An example of the areal extent of storm
tide inundation is shown in Figure 4-11.
HUrricane Audrey, which made landfall in
Cameron Parish, Louisiana, in June of
1957, had a central pressure of 945 mb
(Table 3-3) making it slightly smaller
than the design hurricane for this section
of coast (Table 4-4). The tidal inundation along the Louisiana coastline from
this storm was extensive, largely due to
the extremely low relief. The peak open
coast storm tide reached 3.6 m at the
entrance to the Calcasieu Ship Channel;
inland tides varied from that elevation to
about 1.1 m in the region of Terrebonne
Bay. These tides were able to inundate a
total of 12,000 square ki lometers of the
coastal plain, extending as far inland as
Lake Charles and Mo~gan City.

effects are widespread and include a
distinct coarse layer of Crassostrea
virginica shell hash in cores obtained
from the Atchafalaya Del ta (van Heerden,
1982). The coastal plain relief in the
area of Audrey's landfall is not significantly di fferent from that elsewhere along
the northwest Gulf Coast. Extensive
coastal plain flooding is to be expected
for all major hurricanes in this region.
Harris (1963) presents a map of the inundation which accompanied HUrricane carla.

The storm tide data for Audrey presents
an opportunity to assess the predictive
value of the Texas design hurricane model.
According to that model the open coast
surge elevation at the point of Audrey's
landfall (pt. 13, Fig. 4-8) for a 100-year
hurricane should be 5.7 m. The measured
storm tide was only about 3.6 m. Even
though Audrey was smaller than the design
hurricane, the cbmparison suggests that
the model resul ts may be somewhat high. A
similar comparison for Carla, which had
meteorological characteristics close to
those for the Texas design hurricane,
gives better
reement. The obser
maximum open coast storm tide was 4.4. m as
Hurricane Audrey caused enormous damage compared to a predicted surge hei t of
and the loss of more than 520 lives in 4.0 m (Fig. 4-8). As discussed above, the

Advocate, May 23, 1982). The geological higher than the surge.

Hurricane Allen ..
Mos t of the hurr i cane ef feet s observed
on this trip were caused by Hurricane
Allen which made landfall near Brazos
Santiago Pass at the southern tip of Padre
Island at midnight on August 10th, 1980
(Fig. 4-12). During its early life in the
caribbean Sea, HUrricane Allen attained a
central pressure of 899 mb, making it the
second strongest Atlantic hurricane on
record. After a somewhat erratic path
through the Caribbean, which fortunately
took it around the most heavily inhabited
islands, Allen nearly stalled in its forward path southeast of Brownsville,
greatly reducing its intens ity before
making landfall. A central pressure of
945 mb was recorded shor tl y before I and-

fall (Taylor and staff, 1981). After
landfall the decaying storm continued on a
northwesterly path through south Texas.
Detailed documentation of process variables and morphologi·c response to the
landfall of Hurricane Allen provides the
basis for a geological effects model. In
general, the process sequence followed the
stages outlined earlier by Price (1956),
Hayes (1967), and McGowen et al., (1970).
Nummedal et oZ. (1980) appli ed the same
model to the landfall of Hurr icane
Frederic on the Alabama coast in 1979.
This model separates the various geological processes in their chronological
sequence of occurrence: storm approach,
landfall, and aftermath. It is generally
quite useful in terms of the sedimentological and stratigraphic stUdies to
further separate the effects of stormsurge flood and ebb during landfall
(Hayes, 1967; Nummedal et al., 1980).

I

Continuously-recording water-level
gauges on the open Gulf Coast of South
Padre Island (Cameron Pier) and in South
Laguna Madre (GIWW Marker) yielded qui te
informative time-series data for the
region in the immediate vicinity of
hurricane landfall. Synoptic charts from
the U.S. Weather Bureau and wind records
from airports in the area provided
supplementary informat ion. As much as two
days prior to landfall (August 8, 1980),
one could detect the effects of the
hurricane forerunner in the form of a 40cm water level super-elevation (Fig. 413). The forerunner rise in the Gulf and
the lagoon were essentially in-phase.
During August 9th there was a continuous
and rapid rise in both Gulf and lagoon
water levels. Lagoonal water, however,
rose nearly 14 hours behind the Gulf. In
fact, during the early phase of Gulf rise,
the lagoonal water was dropping (August 9,
o - 2 a.m.). This is consistent wi th the
expected response to southward-di rected
cyclonic winds across a lagoon with its
outlet (Brazos Santiago Pass) at the
southern end. Once the Gulf water level
exceeded 1 m, extensive washover of South
Padre Island began. This appears to have
contributed to a rise in a lagoonal water
level. Peak water level in South Laguna
Madre occurred at the time of landfall,

1959) with a roughness factor, n = .03.
This particular value for the n-factor
agrees wi th Chow's (1959) recommended
value for shallow sandy streams, and is
also the average value determined from a
number of tidal-cycle current velocity
measurements in the Corpus Christi Fish
Pass by Watson and Behrens (1976). The
simulation assumes that the entire water
elevation differential corresponds to the
drop across the barrier, The water level
in the lagoon is assumed horizontal •
Velocities are
to increase during
rising storm tide. They peak at 55 cm/s
in the early morning of August the 9th.
This simulated velocity peak probably
corresponds to the moment of most active
transfer of Gulf water into Laguna Madre,
Ebb velocit ies generally are much smaller,
they reach a peak of 46 cmls for a short
time in the morning of August the 10th.
Flow regime two refers to confined flow
in a hypothetical 2 m deep hurr icane
channel. Assumpt ions are the same as in
case 1. Use of the same roughness factor
and hydraulic slope for a deeper flow
yields higher current velocities. A
strong flood-tide would have persisted
throughout the rise, the velocity peaking
at 1.92 m/s. Maximum simulated ebb
attained a veloci ty of 1.62 mls for a
short time during the declining stage of
the surge.

a picture of a modern shoreline that is
undergoing erosion and transgression,
that is dynamically stable at the
Mississippi River delta front and is
locally progradational in the vicinity of
the Atchafalaya River mouth.

Modern man has acquired a very unstable
inheritance in the coastal plain of south
Louisiana, a landscape that expands and
contracts in area at rates almost
unequaled anywhere else in the world. The

During the final asymptotic stage of
post-glacial rise in sea level some 5,000
years ago, the chenier plain began to
prograde rapidly, and eventually a wedge
of recent sediments 6-8 m thick was
deposited to a width of 24 km, thus
placing the shoreline roughly where we see
it today (Fig. 5-1). Pulses of sediment
from the Mississippi River, transported by
coast-parallel currents, were responsible
for the various stages of progradation.
At times when the Mississippi River
introduced sediment in the vicinity of the
present chenier plain, the shoreline
shi fted seaward; during periods when its
course took the discharge farther east,
sediment influx to the chenier plain was
low and wave attack was able to slow or
halt the advance (Gould and McFarlan,
1959). Chenies formed during these latter
periods and now stand as "islands" in the
marsh.

Atchafalaya Basin to the north became
essentially sediment filled and sediment
began bypassing these basin-lakes for
areas to the south. In the early 1950s
Morgan et ale (1953) documented the
occurrence of mud peposition along
approximately 50 km of coast from Marsh
Island to Rollover Bayou which, in places,
formed broad mudflats up to 2 m thick.
Nearly 30 years have passed since Morgan
et ale (1953) first described these
coastal mudflats and tied their origin to
the Atchafalaya River, to the east.
Whereas our understanding of the basic
processes for delivering sediments to the
eastern margin of the chenier plain (Fig.
5-1) has remained the same, our ability to
monitor these processes has improved
significantly. Ready access to satellite
imagery, color infrared photography, and
digi tal current-meter data now allows us
to monitor shoreline changes remotely and
the processes that govern their behavior.
In the following paragraphs we report our
initial findings with respect to the
following questions: 1) What is the
present status of the chenier plain
relative to the cycle of land building and
land loss? 2) What connection exists
between the developing Atchafalaya River
delta and chenier plain sedimentation? and
3) What is the future for land building in
Louisiana's western coastal parishes?

Development of the chenier plain
according to the broad-brush model
presented above might be expected to produce a modern shoreline either uniform in
character or at least gradational from
east to west. In fact, the coastline from
Marsh Island to the Texas border shows as
much variability as any in Louisiana.

the Mississippi River down the Atchafalaya

converted to transport per year, the
volume of sediment moving in the
Atchafalaya mud stream is 53 x 106 m3 ,
almost half of the volume of sediment that
leaves Atchafalaya Bay. Evidence for an
int imate connect ion between Atchafalaya
delta development and chenier plain sedimentation can be found in the good time
correlat ion betwen subaqueous del taic
sedimentation in the bay and the first
appearance of mudflats near Chenier au

1973-75 correlated well with a renewal of
mudflat development after a period of
erosion in the 1960s.

Direction, however, does not fully reverse
as a resul t of tidal effects, but instead
is dominated by river flow to the south
from Atchafalaya Bay and flow to the west
from the westerly drift component of
coastal waters. In Atchafalaya Bay
current speeds are substantially higher,
reaching values of 40-80 cm/sec. Rise and
fall in current speed is coincident wi th
tidal period in the bay. Direction of
flow is oriented down the navigation
channel and does not change with stage of
the tide.
Residual currents computed from these
records are shown in Figure 5-6. The
overall pattern is that of strong flow
down the axi s of the navigation channel,
spreading and reduction in speed on
reaching the GUlf of Mexico, then deflection to the west on the inner shelf.

shelf farther to the west (longi tude
93 30 1 ) also indicates residual flows to
the west (Crout and Bruni tel', 1981).
First-order approximations of the sediment mass transported in the Atchafalaya
mud stream have been made by taking the
product of average suspensate concentration, cross-sectional area of the mud
stream, and average drift speed of
currents (Fig. 5-6). Cbnversion to volume

We have established that the chenier
plain coast is a downdrift recipient of
renewed deltaic sedimentation, but that
the rate of growth is today insufficient
to stop the historic trend of shoreline
retreat. There is localized instantaneous
progradation in the form of ephemeral and
unvegetated mudflats. Because the major
effect of subtidal muds is to attenuate
incoming wave energy, conditions are being
created that are favorable for further
sedimentation (Wells and Coleman, 1981;
Wells and Roberts, 1981). Formation of
mudflats, then, is the first stage in the
feedback loop between coastal energy and
shoreline response, which eventually leads
to stabilization and progradation. Volume
calculat ions show that more sediment
reaches the chenier plain via the
Atchafalaya mud stream than appears as new
mudflats. For example, if a typical mudflat has a volume of 1 to 2 x 10 6 m3, then
25 to 50
mudflats could form each
year. Since new mudflats have not been
observed to form at this rate, much of the
sediment may be spread across the inner
shelf as a thin veneer over a longshore
distance of perhaps 100 km or more.
The ephemeral nature of these mudflats
suggests that the localized process of
shorel ine progradat ion has just begun to
accelerate (Wells and Kemp, 1981). As a
result, we hypothesize that the initial
stage of coas tal prograda t i on from a neW

sediment pulse is one of transi tory mudflats only. As sedimentation continues,
new mudflats wi 11 appear and merge wi th
existing mudflats. At its peak of
development, the shoreline will become
"choked" wi th fine-grained sediment, mudflats will stabilize and grow seaward, and
new marsh vegetat ion wi 11 become est
lished. The potential for land buildi
by this method should not be underestimated. The entire chenier plain region

con t ac t to the presen t Gul f
This land building took place in not more
than 5,000 years during which the man~
stranded beach ridges tell us that accre~'
tion alternat
with erosion. Thus, a
conservative estimate of the land-building
potential afforded by mudflat
ion is
on the order of 5 mlyr, or close to the
rate at which retreat is now occurring.
Accelerated growth of the chenier plain is
expected when the subaerial Atchafalaya
delta outgrows Atchafalaya Bay, allowing a
greater volume of sediments to enter the
dynamic shelf region and become entrained
in the mud stream (Wells et al., in
press). The time scale for widespread
reversal in present coastal erosion along
Louisiana'S chenier plain is 50 to 100
years, providedthat Atchafalaya River
discharge remains relatively constant and
no sediment is artificially diverted away
from the mud stream.

3} The Atchafalaya mud stream transports
more sediment, by an order of magni tude,
to the chenier plain than can be accounted
for in yearly mudflat accretion. Much?f
the sediment may be spread as a thIn
veneer across the inner continental
shelf.
4) Future development of the chenier
plain will be tied intimately to the fate
of Atchafalaya Bay. Accelerated growth of
the chenier plain is expected when
Atchafalaya Bay becomes sed iment f iII ,
thus allowing an even greater volume of
sediments to enter the dynamic shelf
region seaward of the bay.

5) Widespread reversal in the present
erosional trend is expected in 50-100
years.

INTRODUCTION
The chenier plain of southwest Louisiana
represents a modification of the shoreline
since sea level reached its present position, presumably some 5,000 years ago.
Large-scale fluctuations of sea level
caused by stages of continental glaciation
during the Pleistocene Epoch have now been
documented worldwide. In the Gulf of
Mexico, the first evidence for previous
shallow water condi tions along the seaward
edge of the continental shelf was
presented by Carsey (1950). The coral 1ine
patches and carbonate bioherms at the
shelf edge noted by carsey also were discussed by Stetson (1953). Detailed faunal
study of these reefs led Parker and CurrE"
(1956) to conclude that the shelf-edg~
reefs off both Louisiana and Texas were
once in very shallow, if not intertidal,
wELter. The Holocene transgression in the
northwest Gulf of Mexico was discussed by
Curray (1960). He constructed a sea-level
curve and interpreted the paleogeography
of the shelf during the Holocene sea-level
rise. The late ~aternary deposits of the
outer shelf were attributed by Sidner et
01 (1977) to five cold-warm fluctuations
of sea level. They recognized two major
phases of shelf edge outbuilding during
the late Pleistocene, each beginning with
the building of sh~lf margin deltas during
low stands of sea level. Various types of
truncated structures and fluvial features
indicating past erosion on the outer
continental shelf were presented by Roemer
and Bryant (1977).

In 1979 a systematic and topicallyintegrated investigation of the late
'.,"lUaternary deposi ts on the submerged con~
tinental margin was begun using seismic
stratigraphy as the primary study
technique. A set of high-resolution,
seismic reflection profiles spaced in a
4.5 x 4.5 km grid and extending from nearshore onto the upper continental slope has
been used to identify and map ancient
stream channels and deltas, ancient shoreline features, and the distribution of the
Holocene transgressive sediments.

Ancient strewn Systems.
As pointed out by Woodbury et oZ.
(1973), the locus of maximum deposition in
the northwest Gulf of Mexico migrated from
south Texas in the Eocene to south
Louisiana in the Miocene. They showed the
oblong Pleistocene depocenter as lying
beneath and parallel to the present shelf
edge off the south central Lou is i ana
coast.
Four sets of ancient buried stream
channels were recorded on the seismic
profiles (0.5 sec. sweep). The outlines
of both the two youngest sets of streams
and the deltas bui It by them are shown by
Figures 6-1 and 6-2. Stratigraphic
relations of the two sets to each other
and to the sea floor indicate that they
probably bracket the Wisconsinan glacial
stage. See Figure 6~3 for stratigraphic
relations of the two sets of buried
channels and the associated sediments.

The buried stream channels of probable
late Wisconsinan age are more numerous and
more widely distributed than those of
early Wisconsinan (1) age, but the general
orientation of northeast to southwest for
the major streams is similar (Fig .. 6-2).
In contrast, the larger stream channels
are in the eastern half of the mapped
area. The largest set of channels, lying
to the,northeast of the major delta shown,
in th~ southeastern quarter of the map
(Fig. 6-2), is 5.1 km wide and 60 m deep.
Some ot the late Wisconsinan channels
overlie the early Wisconsinan (1) channels
and locally are eroded through the
transgressive sediments, separating the
two sets and into the fill of the early
Wisconsinan (1) channels themselves. For

Ancient Shoreline Features.
The extensive ancient channel systems
that cross the continental shelf and the
shelf-edge deltas that accompany them are
ample evidence that the Gulf of Mexico
shoreline has advanced seaward to the edge
of the continental shelf in the geologic
past. The bioherms, discussed by many
investigators over the past several
decades, confirm shallow-water conditions
at the shelf edge and on the upper continental slope. Other evidence not easily
discernable by bottom sampling and coring,
include a broad wave-cut terrace, erosion~
ally truncated diapiric structures, both
on the continental shelf and on the upper
continental slope, and large submarine
troughs eroded across the shelf edge. The
locations of these features off southwest
