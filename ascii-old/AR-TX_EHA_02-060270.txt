Abstract
The SH 130 roadway runs for 89 miles (143 kilometers) from north of Georgetown, in Williamson
County, Texas, to east of Seguin, in Guadalupe County, Texas. The right of way (ROW) is approximately
530 feet (162 meters) wide and encompasses over 7,200 acres. PBS&J surveyed a total of approximately
6,534 acres (2,666 hectares). A total of 97 archaeological sites were examined in the ROW surveyed by
PBS&J. Most of the survey occurred between October 2001 and May 2003. At the time of the survey,
virtually all of the lands within the ROW were privately owned.
The roadway was divided into three segments, designated Segments A, B, and C. The survey of the three
segments was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Nos. 2691 (Segment A), 2692 (Segment B), and
2693 (Segment C). Segment A begins at Interstate Highway 35 north of Georgetown, in Williamson
County and continues for 28 miles (45 kilometers), terminating at U.S. Highway 290 East, in Travis
County. A total of 2,384 acres (965 hectares) were surveyed in Segment A. Segment B begins at U.S.
Highway 290 East and continues for 32 miles (51 kilometers) to just north of Lockhart, in Caldwell
County. A total of 2,404 acres (973 hectares) were surveyed in Segment B. Segment C begins just north
of Lockhart in Caldwell County and continues for 31 miles (50 kilometers) to just east of Seguin in
Guadalupe County. A total of 1,799 acres (728 hectares) and approximately 24 linear miles
(38.62 kilometers) was surveyed in Segment C. In addition to the site-definition and on-site shovel tests, a
total of 16,772 nonsite shovel tests were excavated. These consist of 10,651 in high probability areas,
4,636 in medium probability areas, and 1,485 in low probability areas.
Ninety-seven archaeological sites were recorded during the survey of the SH 130 roadway. Thirty-four of
the sites were recorded in Segment A. Four of these sites were recommended for further work. National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) testing was performed at three sites (41WM1010, 41WM1013, and
41WM1023). Data recovery was subsequently performed at 41WM1010. At site 41WM1012, trenching at
the site following the pedestrian survey led directly to data recovery.
Thirty-eight sites were recorded in Segment B. Further work was recommended at seven sites. NRHP
testing was performed at six sites (41TV456, 41TV1275, 41TV1278, 41TV1981, 41TV1984, and
41TV1987). Trenching at site 41TV410 led to the discovery of a deeply buried prehistoric component,
which was excavated as part of the pedestrian survey. None of the seven sites recommended for further
work in Segment B received data recovery. Human remains were uncovered at site 41TV150, in Segment
B. The site was originally recorded in 1968 as a surficial prehistoric lithic quarry. When revisited during
the SH 130 intensive archaeological survey, the site was expanded to include historical farmstead and
unmarked cemetery components. The cemetery consisted of a single internment. The burial was
excavated in January 2003 and reinterred at the Onion Creek Memorial Park, in Austin, Texas, in
September 2004. Despite extensive archival and informant research, and mitochondrial DNA testing of
people believed to be potential descendants, the identity of the individual was not established. This work
was performed under Texas Antiquites Committee Permit No. 3305.

One historic cemetery, the Guadalupe-Mendoza Cemetery, is in close proximity to the SH 130 roadway.
Access to the cemetery was not granted to PBS&J during the course of the pedestrian survey. It is
recommended that archival research be conducted to establish the metes and bounds of the cemetery. In
addition, it is recommended that informant interviews be conducted, and mechanical scraping be
performed to ensure that no graves extend into the SH 130 roadway.
Twenty-five sites were recorded in Segment C. NRHP testing has been recommended for two of these
(41CW83 and 41GU83).

Executive Summary
This report documents the result of an intensive archaeological survey of the SH 130 ROW, which
extends for about 89 miles (143 km) from north of Georgetown, in Williamson County, Texas, to east of
Seguin, in Guadalupe County, Texas. The SH 130 right of way encompasses over 7,200 acres, of which
PBS&J surveyed 6,534 acres. The roadway is divided into three segments, designated Segments A, B,
and C. The survey of the segments was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit Nos. 2691 (Segment
A), 2692 (Segment B), and 2693 (Segment C).
Most of the survey occurred between October 2001 and May 2003. A total of 97 archaeological sites were
examined, including 21 previously recorded sites and 76 newly recorded sites. A list of each of the
examined sites within the three surveyed segments of the SH 130 roadway, including the site type, sitespecific recommendations, references, and date of THC concurrence is provided in Appendix D.
The survey assessed only the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) sections of the undertaking.
Additional properties were later assessed and reported on by Hicks and Company. The archaeological
inventory of the FEIS Segment A and nearly all of Segment B has been completed, and Section 106
consultation with the Texas Historic Preservation Officer (TSHPO) and Native American (NA) Tribes has
been completed.
The archaeological inventory of the FEIS Segment C has not been completed due to right-of-entry issues,
and additional survey for the outstanding parcels is required once right-of-entry issues have been
resolved. Additional TSHPO and NA tribal consultation is required for these parcels. Table ES-1 lists
those parcels, as well as the few outstanding parcels in Segment B. The outstanding parcels are also
depicted on 7.5-minute topographic maps in Appendix E.
All of the NRHP eligibility recommendations made to date for the archaeological sites pertain to only the
portions of the sites located within the FEIS right-of-way, and there may still be unevaluated portions of
these sites overlapping out of the investigated area, and additional work may be required to investigate
those portions of the sites if additional right of way is required.
NRHP eligibility testing is still required for archaeological sites 41CW83 and 41GU83. Both sites are
located in Segment C.

INTRODUCTION
In 2001 through 2004, PBS&J conducted a cultural resources pedestrian survey of the State Highway 130
(SH 130) right of way (ROW) in Caldwell, Guadalupe, Travis, and Williamson Counties, Texas, for the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The survey was conducted in three segments (Segments
A–C). Segment A extended for 28 miles (45 kilometers [km]) from the northern terminus of the SH 130
ROW at Interstate Highway 35 (IH 35) north of Georgetown in Williamson County to U.S. Highway 290
East (US 290E) in Travis County. Segment B began at US 290E and continued for 32 miles (51 km) to
just north of Lockhart in Caldwell County. Finally, Segment C traversed 31 miles (50 km) beginning
north of Lockhart and ending just east of Seguin in Guadalupe County. The design with frontage roads
calls for a ROW width of 529 feet (ft) (161 meters [m]). In all, the ROW extends for about 91 miles
(146 km) and encompasses approximately 7,250 acres (2,934 hectares [ha]), of which 6,587 acres
(2,666 ha) were surveyed by PBS&J. Table 1 summarizes data relevant to the pedestrian surveys of
Segments A, B, and C. The route of the SH 130 roadway is shown on Figure 1.
The purpose of the study was to identify archaeological sites or areas in order to make recommendations
for further work to determine National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)/State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) eligibility. The criteria for determining the significance of a cultural resource, in terms of its
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP, are established by the National Park Service (36 CFR, Part 60.6,
Department of the Interior). The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permits 2691, 2692, and
2693.
This document compiles the results presented in earlier interim reports into one comprehensive report.
For Segment A, this includes Interim Reports A-1 (Rogers and Hales 2002), A-2 (Hales and McMurtrie
2002), and A-3 (Dixon, Rogers, Russell, and Hales 2003); for Segment B, Interim Reports B-1 (Rogers
et al. 2002a) and B-2 (Hales, Rogers, and Victor 2003); and for Segment C, Interim Reports C-1 (Rogers
et al. 2002b) and C-2 (Hales, Rogers, Dixon, and Victor 2003). In addition, this report includes the results
of pedestrian surveys of previously inaccessible parcels that were made available for survey after
submittal of the interim reports.
All of the archaeological sites discussed in this report were initially described in the interim reports and
addendum reports, and recommendations for further work were included. All of the site recommendations
were agreed upon by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) during their review of the interim and
addendum reports.

This report is divided into seven chapters. Following this introduction, Chapter 2 presents an overview of
the physical environment along the SH 130 roadway. Chapter 3 addresses the cultural background, which
utilizes an SH 130 Study Corridor to review the prehistoric archaeological record. The chapter also
describes the major developments that occurred during the historic period. Chapter 4 contains the
methods that were applied in completing the investigations. Chapter 5 contains the descriptions of the
archaeological sites that were recorded in the three segments (Segments A, B, and C). Chapter 6 presents
the results of the exploratory geoarchaeological investigations. Conclusions and site-specific
recommendations are provided in Chapter 7. The references cited throughout the document follow
Chapter 7.
Five appendices are provided. Appendix A provides a sample of the standardized letter to landowners of
properties within the SH 130 ROW in which historic archaeological sites were recorded. Appendix B is
provided on a CD and contains the site probability maps, which include shovel test locations within the
ROW of the SH 130 roadway. Appendix C describes limited archaeological investigations carried out at
site 41TV410 in Segment B of the SH 130 roadway. Tables summarizing the 97 sites examined are
provided on a CD as Appendix D. Also on the CD, Appendix E shows all of the oustanding parcels on
7.5-minute topographic maps.

ENVIRONMENTAL OVERVIEW
PHYSIOGRAPHY
The SH 130 ROW lies within two physiographic provinces or natural regions of Texas, as defined in
Johnson (1931): the Black Prairies and the Interior Coastal Prairies. However, a third region, the
Lampasas Cut Plain, lies adjacent to the Black Prairies at the northern end of the ROW. The Balcones
Fault forms the boundary between the two provinces.
The Black Prairies region in Texas occupies a narrow wedge just east of the Balcones fault zone, running
northeast from the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau to the Red River Valley. This region developed
on Cretaceous limestones, shales, marls, and limy clays. It is an area of low relief and poor drainage, and
the streams that drain it flow at gentle gradients. Within the current project area, most of Segments A and
B and a portion of Segment C lie within the Black Prairies region.
The Interior Coastal Prairies region lies between the Coastal Prairies and the Black Prairies. It is
characterized by a landscape that is more closely rolling than that of the Black Prairies and lacks the long,
gentle slopes typically found in that region. Johnson (1931:111) divided the Interior Coastal Prairies into
subregions. Portions of Segments B and C lie within these subregions, which are characterized by being
underlain by light-colored sandy nonlimy sediments and support a wooded vegetation dominated by
hardwoods, particularly post oaks, though these are frequently interspersed with small prairies of limy
soils derived from the Navarro Group. This region of the Interior Coastal Prairies is frequently referred to
as the Post Oak Savanna.
As mentioned above, the Lampasas Cut Plain lies adjacent to the northern end of the SH 130 ROW
(Segment A). This is a triangular-shaped area of rolling hills in central and north-central Texas, situated
between the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. It is an area where thin soils cover bedrock in the uplands, and
moderately deep soils in the valley floors support a mixed riparian woodland. The underlying geology of
the Lampasas Cut Plain includes chert-bearing Cretaceous-aged rocks of the Edwards Group. This chert,
often of high quality, was an important commodity to the prehistoric inhabitants. Streams that cut through
these chert-bearing strata carry it as nodules, transporting it downstream and depositing it in the lowgradient Black Prairies. Two of these streams, the San Gabriel River and Brushy Creek, are crossed by the
SH 130 ROW in Segment A.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

GEOLOGY
From oldest to youngest the surface or near-surface geological units that have been mapped by the Bureau
of Economic Geology (BEG) (1976) along the SH 130 ROW include five Cretaceous units, two Eocene
units, and five Quaternary units.
The Cretaceous-aged units that occur along the ROW, from oldest to youngest, are the (1) Georgetown
Formation, (2) Buda Limestone, (3) Eagle Ford Group, (4) Austin Chalk, and (5) Navarro and Taylor
Groups undivided.
The Georgetown Formation occupies about 700 m of the ROW in Segment A. It is Lower Cretaceous in
age and is composed of fine-grained, argillaceous limestone, shale, and marl. The Buda Limestone occurs
along a narrow, 250-m area adjacent to the Georgetown Formation in Segment A. This strata is massive,
fine-grained, bioclastic, commonly glauconitic, and hard. Strata of the Eagle Ford Group occur along a
narrow, 500-m band in Segment A. It is composed of a thick, dense fossiliferous shale in its upper part,
which grades into a thick gray silty limestone and calcareous siltstone.
The Austin Chalk occurs along a 16.5-km section of the ROW in Segments A and B. It is composed of
alternating beds of chalk and marl.
Approximately 57.5 km of the ROW in Segments B and C has been geologically mapped as Navarro and
Taylor Groups. These groups include the Kemp Clay, Corsicana Marl, Pecan Gap Chalk, Ozan
Formation, Neylandville Formation, and Malbrook Marl undivided. Within this large area is 16.5 km
mapped as Navarro and Taylor Groups undivided and 41 km mapped as Kemp Clay, Corsicana Marl,
Neylandville Formation, and Malbrook Marl undivided. The undivided Navarro and Taylor Groups are
mapped in Segments A and B. It is undivided because the Pecan Gap Chalk is not present and because of
gradations to marl that is similar to that of the Malbrook and Ozan Formations.
Eocene-aged geological units occur along the ROW in Segments B and C in Caldwell and Guadalupe
Counties. These deposits belong to the Midway and Wilcox Groups.
The Midway Group has been divided into the older Kincaid Formation and the younger Wills Point
Formation. While these have not been mapped separately within the project area, they have been divided
elsewhere on the basis of facies and faunas. The Wilcox Group consists of all deposits lying between the
marine silty clays of the Midway Group and the marine, glauconitic, fossiliferous sands of the Claiborne
Group.
Quaternary alluvial deposits that occur within the ROW include the Willis and Leona Formations,
Quaternary High Gravels, Quaternary Terraces, and Quaternary Alluvium. These deposits are important
archaeologically in that they can contain significant sources of lithic raw materials. In addition, some of
the deposits may contain buried archaeological sites, particularly those of Paleoindian and Archaic age.

2: Environmental Overview

The Willis Formation occurs along an approximate 3-km section of the ROW northwest of the town of
Kingsbury, in Segment C. It is the oldest of the Quaternary terraces found along the ROW and is
composed of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Doering (1935) defined the formation and considered it to be
Pleistocene in age. The gravels within the Willis Formation include cobble-sized quartzite and chert as
well as petrified wood. The formation is believed to correlate with the Uvalde Gravels (Barnes 1974).
Soils that developed in the formation belong to the Darst and Burleson series.
Quaternary High Gravel deposits occur along portions of the ROW in Travis and Williamson Counties
totaling about 2.5 km. These deposits contain calcareous and siliceous gravel laid down by ancestral
streams during the Pleistocene. Within the ROW they are capped with clays. Soils of the Burleson series
have developed on Quaternary High Gravel deposits east of Walter E. Long Lake in Travis County, while
Branyon soils developed on them where the ROW crosses U.S. Highway 79 (US 79) in Williamson
County. The siliceous gravels found in these terraces were highly sought by the prehistoric inhabitants of
the area and represented a primary source for lithic raw material away from the chert-rich Cretaceous
units west of the Balcones Fault.
The Leona Formation occurs along about 8.5 km of the ROW, mostly between the Clear Fork of Plum
Creek and northwest of the city of Lockhart. The formation was named by Hill and Vaughan (1898) to
refer to terrace deposits found along the principal streams of Texas. They are composed of red and
reddish gray silt and fine gravel. They range from 3 to 20 m above the floodplain of the Clear Fork of
Plum Creek and extend for approximately 6 km along the ROW. Fossils of extinct horses, camels,
elephants, and freshwater molluscs have been found at depths of 2 to 3 m at site 41GU27, located about
5 km from the ROW. These and other taxa collected elsewhere have been used to date the Leona
Formation to the early Pleistocene (Sellards et al. 1947:795). Soils that developed in the Leona Formation
along the ROW include those of the Branyon, Burleson, and Lewisville series (Ramsey and Bade
1977:74).
Deposits mapped as Quaternary Terraces occupy approximately 19.75 km of the ROW. These are relict
floodplains, abandoned during subsequent degradation by the formative stream. They are most extensive
along the Colorado River, where they occur along a span of about 14 km, occupying over 300 acres. Soils
in this area are Mollisols belonging to the Bergstrom series. The terraces along the Colorado River have
received considerable attention from geomorphologists and sedimentologists in the past, with the most
relevant to the current project study area being those of Weeks (1945), Baker and Penteado-Orellana
(1977), and Blum (1992).
Weeks (1945) traced terraces downstream from Austin. Using topographic maps, he subdivided the
terraces (from oldest to youngest) into the Uvalde, Asylum, Capital, Sixth Street, First Street, Riverview,
and Sand Beach levels. Baker and Penteado-Orellana (1977) utilized remote-sensing imagery and
sedimentological analyses to delineate systematic changes in channel geometry and sediment load for the
Colorado River. One of their locations encompasses the area of the ROW river crossing near Hornsby
Bend, in Travis County (Segment B), where they identified a sequence of Pleistocene and Holocene
440715/060270

channel assemblages that were interpreted as originating from fluvial responses to climatic change. North
of the Colorado River channel, assemblages proximal to the river were believed to be Holocene in age
while those distal to the present-day channel (Stages 6, 6a, and 6b) were thought to be Pleistocene, dating
from 30,000 to 13,000 years before present (B.P.). Deposits south of the river were correlated with
Channel Stages 5 (floodplain) and 7.
Blum (1992) examined several locations south of Austin, including one near the town of Webberville,
within 4 km of the ROW. Blum (1992) established a revised Pleistocene/Holocene alluvial sequence, or
Alloformations, for the Colorado River terraces that were defined on the basis of field-defined, areally
persistent soil-geomorphic and stratigraphic relationships. Chronological control was based on
radiocarbon ages derived from soil humates. Blum defined the main valley fill of the lower Colorado
River as the Columbus Bend Alloformation, which is composed of three members (Figure 2). Based on
radiocarbon dates, the oldest (Member 1) dates to between 13,000 to 5000 B.P., Member 2 from 5000 to
1000 B.P., and Member 3 (the modern depositional system) from about 1000 B.P. to the present. Table 2
shows the correlations of the terrace sequences along the Colorado River as defined by these past
researchers.

Quaternary Terraces have also been mapped in the ROW along the San Gabriel River, and to a much
lesser degree, along the north side of Brushy Creek. Soils that have developed on the Quaternary Terrace
along the San Gabriel River include five Mollisols (Krum, Bergstrom, Austin, Queeny, and Sunev). The
terrace soils along Brushy Creek include three Mollisols (Bergstrom, Krum, and Austin).
Holocene alluvial deposits have been mapped in the modern floodplains of several of the streams crossed
by the SH 130 ROW. These areas total 7.6 km and are most extensive along the Colorado River in
Segment B. As mentioned above, the sediments comprising the modern floodplain of that river in the
vicinity of the ROW are less than 1,000 years old (Blum 1992:192). Soils that occur in the modern
floodplains of the project area include Entisols (Lincoln and Uhland), Inceptisols (Norwood), Mollisols
(Bosque, Frio, and Oakalla), and Vertisols (Tinn and Trinity).

FLORA
Little bluestem is the climax-dominant species within most of the SH 130 roadway (Gould 1975). Other
important species include big bluestem, Indiangrass, switch grass, sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsute), and tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper). Under heavy
grazing Texas wintergrass and buffalogras (Buchloe dactyloides), Texas grama and (Bouteloua
rigideseta). Mesquite has heavily invaded portions of the SH130 roadway, and improved pasture and
agricultural lands are also present in several areas.
Riparian woodlands occur along many of the streams crossed by the SH130 roadway, and include an
overstory of pecan (Carya illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), American elm (Ulmus
americana), hickory (Carya buckleyi), sycamore (Planus occidentalis), osage-orange (Maclura
pomifera), live oak (Quercus virginiana), and Texas red oak (Quercus buckleyi). A few bald cypress
(Taxodium distichum) also occur, principally along Onion Creek and the Colorado River. Common
understory and herbaceous species found in the area may include frostweed (Verbesina virginica),
440715/060270

broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and saw
greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox). Small areas of dense brush occur and consist of giant ragweed (Ambrosia
trifida), giant reed (Arundo donax), privet (Ligustrum sp.), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), interwoven with
poison ivy (Toxicodendrum radicans).

FAUNA
The SH130 roadway lies near the western edge of the Texan biotic province as described by Blair (1950).
This transitional region is recognized as a broad ecotone of grasslands and savannahs situated between the
forests of the Austroriparian province of eastern Texas and the Kansan prairies or Balconian forests of
northern and central Texas. The vertebrate fauna of the Texan biotic province are therefore represented by
a mixture of species from these three provinces and the Tamaulipan brushlands to the south, fauna that
periodically used the grasslands and their streams depending on prevailing climatic regimes.
Archaeological evidence suggests that bison were present in all these biotic provinces during the Early
Paleoindian period circa 8000 B.C. and then became scarce until approximately A.D. 1300 (Johnson and
Goode 1995), after which time they became more prevalent into the early nineteenth century.
Characteristic mammalian species of the riparian woodlands along the SH 130 roadway today include the
common raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginiana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus
niger). Bird species commonly occurring within these habitats may include the belted kingfisher
(Megaceryle alcyon), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus), blue jay
(Cyanocitta cristata), and ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris). Common herpetofauna
occurring within the riparian woodlands include the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), rough green snake
(Opheodrys aestivus), green anole (Anolis carolinensis), and Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceus),
among others. The land turtle (Terrapene ornata) is a grassland species adapted to the Black Prairie.
Aquatic habitats along are limited to the streams crossed by the SH 130 roadway. Faunal species present
in the area today include such fish species as the blackstripe topminnow (Fundulus notatus), mosquitofish
(Gambusia affinis), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides),
Guadalupe bass (Micropterus treculi), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus),
longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), among others. Other
faunal species that may periodically utilize the aquatic habitats include the diamondback water snake
(Nerodia rhombifer), western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorous leucostoma), redstripe ribbon snake
(Thamnophis proximus rubrilineatus), southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), Blanchard’s cricket frog
(Acris crepitans blanchardi), red-eared slider (Pseudemys scripta elegans), American beaver (Castor
canadensis), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), wood duck (Aix sponsa), and various species of
migratory waterfowl and wading birds. Local fauna was therefore exploitable by aboriginal peoples
during much of the year, with only migratory waterfowl and perhaps bison being seasonally available.

3
CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PATTERNS OF PREHISTORIC HUMAN ADAPTATION
Introduction
Large-scale linear projects, such as the SH 130 roadway, are useful mechanisms for studying prehistoric
adaptation to a varied landscape, especially where commonly recognized environmental zones and culture
areas are crossed. When the temporal dimension is included, in this case prehistoric cultural eras and
periods, it may be possible to recognize changes in the patterns of adaptation. For the current study, the
cultural intervals discussed begin with the Paleoindian era and end with the Toyah phase or interval of the
Late Prehistoric period. Historic Indian groups are not included as, by the time they are recorded, most of
them were recent arrivals and their traditional lifeways had already been substantially altered. A
discussion of these native groups is included in the Historic period section of this report.
Archaeologically, the SH 130 roadway lies along the eastern edge of a cultural area traditionally referred
to as the Central Texas Archeological Region (Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). Some researchers regard the
environmental diversity within the area as precluding its usefulness as a cultural concept (Ellis et al.
1995) However, as Collins (2005) notes, correlations between the distributions of environmental variables
across space over time, which result in long-term patterns of adaptation, are best seen at the edges rather
than in the core of a cultural area.
Climatic fluctuations, in particular changes in precipitation, have had a significant impact on prehistoric
lifestyles. Throughout prehistory, intervals of increased or decreased amounts of rainfall have led to
changes in subsistence practices that have left an imprint on the archaeological record. Interrelated with
climate, physiography can also influence cultural behavior in that the landforms and their underlying soils
and geology can to some extent govern the distribution of the plants, animals, and raw materials that
prehistoric people relied upon, and that form the archaeological record. The SH 130 roadway traverses
two physiographic provinces or natural regions of Texas, as defined by Johnson (1931): the Black Prairie
and the Interior Coastal Prairie. In addition, a third region, the Lampasas Cut Plain, lies adjacent to the
Black Prairie at the northern end of the corridor.
A reliable water source represents a primary impetus for human habitation, and throughout prehistory
encampments and their archaeological manifestations are most often found in close proximity to a natural
water source. The current study draws heavily on the archaeological record as it is known from sites
located along the five major streams crossed by the SH 130 roadway; the San Gabriel River, Brushy

440715/060270

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Creek, the Colorado River, Onion Creek, and the San Marcos River. The importance of these streams in
the lives of native peoples is evidenced by the large number of archaeological sites that have been
discovered along them. In addition to being reliable sources of water, the streams provided fish, shellfish,
birds, and reptiles. The riparian environment along the streams supported an array of animal species, and
where grasslands occupied floodplains, such as along the San Gabriel River and the Colorado River,
herds of bison occurred.

The SH 130 Study Corridor
For the following discussions, an SH 130 study corridor has been established, which encompasses an area
about 16 km (10 miles) wide, on either side of the crossing of each of the major streams by the SH 130
ROW. All sites that fall within 1 km (0.6 mile) of each stream bank within this study corridor area were
examined. From north to south, the major streams crossed by the SH 130 roadway are the San Gabriel
River, Brushy Creek, the Colorado River, Onion Creek, and the San Marcos River.
The database for this overview was compiled from an examination of the sites at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), the library of the THC, and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. In the
northern portion of the SH 130 study corridor (along the San Gabriel River, Brushy Creek, and the
Colorado River), the majority of archaeological sites were recorded over the past 30 years during Cultural
Resource Management (CRM) surveys and excavations precipitated by suburban development, public
utilities, airport relocation, academic field schools, reservoir and river surveys, and the construction of
highway infrastructure. Sites recorded in the more rural, southern portions of the SH 130 study corridor,
including the San Marcos River and its tributaries, often reflect the efforts of local archaeological
stewards, academic field schools, and the construction of highway infrastructure. The pattern of site
distribution in the study corridor is also a reflection of survey coverage; the majority of commercial or
residential development and hence CRM-recorded sites in the four counties occur west of the SH 130
project area, while the area to the east of SH 130, has only recently been witnessing a growth in
development and has subsequently received fewer archaeological studies.
The following discussions, presented by cultural period, review trends and patterns of human adaptations
as they are reflected within the 32-km-wide (20-mile-wide) study corridor centered on the SH 130
roadway. The discussions are augmented by site data from the pedestrian survey of the ROW and by
findings presented in relevant technical reports and publications.
Paleoindian Era (ca. 11,000–8800 B.P.)
The Paleoindian era is divided into three components: pre-Clovis, Early Paleoindian, and Late
Paleoindian. The era begins around 11,000 B.P. and extends to about 8800 B.P.
Pre-Clovis is the term given to the earliest peoples on the continent, though there is no direct evidence for
the culture in Central Texas. Many researchers view the widely distributed Clovis artifacts as evidence

440715/060270

16

3: Cultural Background

that an earlier population had been present. Contending sites of pre-Clovis include Meadowcroft Rock
Shelter in Pennsylvania, Monte Verde in South America, and sites in Alberta, Canada, and Nebraska.
The Early Paleoindian period is characterized by the presence of Clovis tools, and is the earliest cultural
period in Central Texas, dating between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. The term Early Paleoindian is given to
materials often associated with extinct megafauna. Clovis and, later, Folsom toolkits are associated with
this cultural horizon. Site types of this time include kill sites, quarries, camps, and burials. Well-made
artifacts, often of exotic materials, include prismatic blades and bifaces. Engraved stone, ivory, and bone
have also been found at these sites. Clovis people appear to have led an adaptive lifestyle at a time when
climatic conditions were going from xeric to mesic (Collins 2005). They possessed the capability of
hunting large game, but did not exclusively rely on it. They traveled great distances, and occupied diverse
environments. Caches of artifacts suggest they returned and reused campsites. Folsom people appear to
have been specialized bison hunters, and their toolkit contains thin bifaces, Folsom points, and small end
scrapers. The climatological evidence suggests that relatively mesic conditions existed in Central Texas
during Folsom time. Folsom period sites are usually found in grassland environments (Collins 1998a:62).
Plainview is a manifestation that is problematical. Its chronological position is uncertain, and the name is
often applied to unfluted points that lack the flaking patterns and thinness found at the type site. True
Plainview points are rare in Central Texas.
At the end of the Paleoindian era, San Patrice and Dalton projectile points were in vogue. The people who
made San Patrice points were general hunters, and the location of the type site is in northwestern
Louisiana. The lifestyle of San Patrice and Dalton peoples was probably more akin to that of the
succeeding Archaic period. Three other point styles, Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall,
also belong to this late subperiod.
San Gabriel River: Currently, only a few archaeological sites with Paleoindian components have been
recorded within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of the San Gabriel River. These sites (41WM35,
41WM133, 41WM165, 41WM267, 41WM419, 41WM832, and 41WM1101) are all multicomponent, and
the Paleoindian evidence recovered at each site consists primarily of diagnostic projectile points. Most are
surface finds from deflated sites. However, two of the sites (41WM35 and 41WM419) occur on terraces
and contain cultural deposits buried at depths of between 1 and 2.5 m. It is uncertain whether the
Paleoindian component at the two sites can be stratigraphically isolated.
Brushy Creek: A possible Clovis point was recorded along Brushy Creek downstream of Rice’s Crossing
at site 41WM956. Projectile points diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian period have also been recorded
west of the SH 130 study corridor from surface contexts at sites 41WM559, 41TV627, and 41TV1221. To
the east, Late Paleoindian artifacts have been found at sites 41WM727 and 41WM958 in the fields near
Rice’s Crossing (Brownlow 2003). A few similar dated remains were found during the 1930s at the
Merrell site (41WM2) on Brushy Creek in Round Rock (Campbell 1948; Laughlin 1935; Rogers 2000).

440715/060270

17

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Along the upper reaches of Brushy Creek, deeply buried cultural deposits and in situ faunal remains were
found at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235). Though the site is a few miles beyond the SH 130 study
corridor, its importance is such that it must be included in any regional analysis. A few artifacts found in
gravels below the base of the Clovis component at Wilson-Leonard may be pre-Clovis. The succeeding
Early Paleoindian period is buried in fluvial deposits dating to between 12,000 and 10,600 B.P. Three
components identify these deposits: an early one attributable to a Clovis complex, an intermediate one
known as the Bone Bed component that aligns with Folsom, Plainview, and Goshen complexes, and a
poorly identified late component. Activities associated with the Early Paleoindian subperiod at the site are
limited to the slaughter of bison and the knapping of chert, though the assemblages demonstrate diversity
in material culture and subsistence behavior (Collins 1998b:159).
Late Paleoindian remains at Wilson-Leonard were more extensive and included the flexed burial of a
young adult female with a shark tooth pendant and ground stone tools. Features from the Late Paleoindian
occupation of the site are restricted to small clusters or rings of burned rock, pits of unknown function,
and associated scatters of stone tools and debitage, with the notable exception of the burial. Among the
types of tools present were projectile points (Golondrina-Barber, Wilson, St. Mary’s Hall, Scottsbluff,
San Patrice, and Angostura), burins, perforators, bifaces, unifaces, hammerstones, Waco sinkers, and
Clear Fork gouges. Faunal remains found include bison, deer, rabbits, hares, turtles, fish, and snakes. The
Late Paleoindian occupations, which were divided into two components, occurred between 9500 and
8400 B.P.
Colorado River: No archaeological sites with Paleoindian components have been recorded within the
SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of the Colorado River. The absence of these early sites largely reflects
the relatively young age of the terrace deposits found there (Blum 1992).
Onion Creek: In the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of Onion Creek, the Paleoindian era is represented
by a single possible Scottsbluff point found in a disturbed context at the Collins site, 41TV40 (Suhm
1955:27–28).
San Marcos River: No Paleoindian sites have been identified within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing
of the San Marcos River. A surface collection made at site 41CW9, located outside the SH 130 study
corridor in a cultivated field near Plum Creek, yielded Dalton, Plainview, and Golondrina points.
Excavations were conducted at site 41CW54, located near the San Marcos River a few miles to the west
of the study corridor. Artifacts dating to the transitional period between the Late Paleoindian and Early
Archaic were found at the site, including Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, Angostura, Hoxie, and Martindale
dart points, Clear Fork gouges, and perforators found in association with the remains of bison, deer, and
freshwater mussels. Hearth features and evidence of cooking with boiling stones was found at the site.
Radiocarbon dates place the occupations at the site at about 8000 to 9000 B.P. (Schroeder 2002).

440715/060270

3: Cultural Background

Early Archaic (8800–6000 B.P.)
The Early Archaic in Central Texas was marked by a change from severely xeric to mesic to mildly xeric
conditions (Collins 2005; Johnson and Goode 1995). Most Early Archaic sites are open campsites, and
they seem to be concentrated in better-watered areas on the eastern and southern edges of the Edwards
Plateau (Johnson 1991). In addition to dart points, woodworking tools (Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces), grinding stones and hammerstones are found at these encampments. Bulb cooking in earth ovens
and large scatters of burned rocks that represent antecedents to the later burned rock middens make their
appearance during the Early Archaic.
San Gabriel River: Three single-component Early Archaic campsites (41WM432, 41WM558, and
41WM596) occur within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of the San Gabriel River. Diagnostic dart
points found at these sites include Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde, and Early Barbed. A burned rock midden was
present at site 41WM432. An additional 13 multicomponent sites located within the study corridor
contain Early Archaic materials.
The Tombstone Bluff site (41WM165) contained evidence of Early Archaic occupations on the San
Gabriel River. Located a few miles east of the study corridor, the site, though deflated, yielded evidence
of a lengthy occupation, with the primary activities including hunting and the manufacturing of stone
tools, the latter being the impetus for the site, as lag gravels were thought to have attracted people to the
location (Prewitt 1982).
There is an Early Archaic component at the Loeve site (41WM133). The component yielded an
Angostura dart point, scrapers, a graver, and other bifacial implements. Features associated with these
artifacts included large and medium-sized basin hearths and a burned clay/charcoal pit. Mussel shells
testify to the consumption of this foodstuff (Prewitt 1982).
The John Ischy site (41WM49) is within the SH 130 study corridor along the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River in the uplands (Lampasas Cut Plain) to the west. Period I of the site equates with the Early
Archaic, and included Baird and Taylor dart points (Prewitt 1981; Sorrow 1969).
Brushy Creek: Two single-component Early Archaic sites are recorded within the SH 130 study corridor
crossing of Brushy Creek. Site 41WM718 is an open campsite that contained Martindale dart points,
bifaces, and cores. Site 41WM778 is also an open campsite that yielded an Andice point, burned rocks,
and mussel shells. In addition to these sites, seven multicomponent sites located within the study corridor
contained Early Archaic artifacts.
At the Wilson-Leonard site, the Early Archaic period is represented by corner-notched and stemmed
points (including, in rough chronological order, Hoxie, Gower, Baker, Bandy, and Thrall types)
presumably hafted on darts and thrown with an atlatl (or throwing stick and weight). Also present is
evidence of the continued use of lanceolate spear points like some Angostura. Stone tools from this period
at Wilson-Leonard include unifacial gouges, knives, and perforators, along with ground stone net sinkers
440715/060270

19

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

and manos indicating a varied subsistence base similar to that of the Late Paleoindian period; no evidence
is present of the local exploitation of bison. Instead, the first use of burned rock ovens and their resulting
middens suggests a new emphasis on the gathering and processing of local plants on Brushy Creek, in
association with the use of small hearths and stone tool manufacturing or maintenance activity areas at the
site.
Colorado River: The Early Archaic period is represented within the SH 130 study corridor in the
Colorado River drainage system where Bell points were recovered at open campsites 41TV435 and
41TV436. The latter site also contained three intact rock-lined hearths. One open campsite near Gilleland
Creek (41TV1320) yielded a single Hoxie point, while in the SH 130 ROW along Decker Creek,
41TV1278 contained an Angostura point, and 41TV1981 contained two Gower points. Martindale and
Gower points were also found along Elm Creek at 41TV1987, also located in the SH 130 ROW.
Onion Creek: No single-component Early Archaic sites have been recorded within the SH 130 study
corridor’s crossing of Onion Creek. Four multicomponent sites, Smith Rockshelter (41TV42), Collins
site, and 41TV1772 contained Early Archaic dart points of the types Angostura, Martindale, and Uvalde.
San Marcos River: No Early Archaic sites have been identified within the SH 130 study corridor’s
crossing of the San Marcos River. However, artifacts dating to this period have been found in close
proximity to the SH 130 ROW on Dry Creek at site 41CW9 and 41CW39 located north of Plum Creek.
Both sites are multicomponent. At site 41CW39, a Uvalde-like dart point was found on the surface of a
man-made terrace. The site was interpreted as a campsite and quarry.
Middle Archaic (6000–4000 B.P.)
The Middle Archaic can be subdivided into three style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and
Nolan-Travis. A shift in lithic technology is apparent with the emergence of Bell-Andice-Calf Creek,
where triangular-shaped bifaces are made by removing long, thin flakes. These artifacts are associated
with bison hunters who may have moved into the area from the southern plains (Johnson and Goode
1995:86). Climatic conditions appear to have been somewhat mesic at the beginning of the Middle
Archaic. By the time that Taylor and Nolan points come into the record, extremely xeric conditions have
returned, and bison are absent from this interval. Burned rock middens debut during this dry period, and
are particularly abundant on the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. Johnson and Goode (1995:87–88)
speculate that the middens were used to process stool and other xerophytes. Middle Archaic period
occupations within the SH 130 study corridor are well represented, and occur within all five major
drainage systems.
San Gabriel River: Three single-component Middle Archaic sites (41WM54, 41WM962, and
41WM1084) have been recorded within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of the San Gabriel River.
These are campsites that occur on the river’s second terrace or on upland landform. Nolan dart points
were recovered at two of the sites. Middle Archaic components occur in an additional 21 multicomponent

440715/060270

20

3: Cultural Background

sites within the study corridor. Excavations at the John Ischy site identified a Middle Archaic component
from Nolan and Bell dart points (Sorrow 1969).
Brushy Creek: One single-component Middle Archaic site (41WM927) has been recorded in the SH 130
study corridor’s crossing of Brushy Creek. The site is an open campsite located on the T2 terrace, along
the middle reaches of Brushy Creek. It yielded a Nolan dart point. Diagnostic Middle Archaic projectile
points have also been found at 12 multicomponent sites within the study corridor.
At the Wilson-Leonard site on Brushy Creek, the Middle Archaic component includes the introduction of
several dart point types including Jetta, Martindale, Uvalde, several expanding-stem points, Travis, Wells,
Bell-Andice, and Nolan). There is little evidence at the site that would suggest a major change occurred in
the local environment during these two millennia (Collins 1998a:64–65). This stasis may have
encouraged the development of cyclical and perhaps specialized plant-processing economies focused on
predictable Edwards Plateau xeric plant communities. Weir (1976, 1979) suggested population increases
and possible developments in social organization across Central Texas during this period, and the higher
number of Middle Archaic sites in the SH 130 study corridor suggests that these drainages were more
intensively utilized by 2000 B.C. than ever before.
The Merrell site had an early Middle Archaic component, and the Merrell dart point type is a marker for
the early part of the period (or the latter part of the Early Archaic). The Beaver Head site (41WM139)
also along Brushy Creek in Round Rock contains at least two probable Middle Archaic burials (Clark
1964), plus a burned rock midden with dart point styles including Travis, Tortugas, and Abasolo (a point
typically found in south Texas). Other Middle Archaic sites along Brushy Creek include 41WM962 and
41WM927, both open campsites containing small hearths as well as a Nolan point and other stone tools.
Sinkholes were utilized at this time along Brushy Creek at sites 41WM572 and 41WM580 alongside
small burned rock middens in the Buttercup Creek Subdivision (Coffman and Prewitt 1985). Newly
occupied sites on Brushy Creek were also present at 41WM996 near Round Rock; 41WM927,
41WM961, and 41WM962 near Hutto; and 41WM282 downstream of Rice’s Crossing.
Colorado River: One multicomponent site, 41TV2020, consisting of a campsite with burned rock
midden, has been recorded within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of the Colorado River. The
Middle Archaic component at the site is identified by a single Travis dart point. Outside the SH 130 study
corridor, Middle Archaic artifacts have been found along Wilbarger Creek at a multicomponent campsite
(41TV1221), and along Gilleland Creek, where a possible Travis point was found at site 41TV1773.
Onion Creek: Within the SH 130 study corridor along Onion Creek, two Middle Archaic singlecomponent sites (41TV314 and 41TV436) have been recorded. Both are open campsites. Five
multicomponent sites within study corridor yielded artifacts diagnostic of the Middle Archaic. Three of
these, the Collins site, Smith Rockshelter, and 41TV265 contained stratigraphic cultural deposits.

440715/060270

21

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

San Marcos River: Within the San Marcos drainage basin, site 41GU49 contained two circular burned
rock middens associated with a Tortugas dart point, Clear Fork biface, and other stone tools.
Late Archaic (4000–1200 B.P.)
Researchers in Central Texas have tended to divide the lengthy Late Archaic period into a variety of
intervals. Prewitt (1981) used three phases (Uvalde, Twin Sisters, and Driftwood) for the period. Johnson
(1995) split the Late Archaic into two subperiods, designated Late Archaic I and II. Collins (1998a:Figure
4-1) recognized six style intervals (Bulverde, Pedernales/Kinney, Lange/Marshall/Williams, Marcos/
Montell/Castroville, Ensor/Frio/Fairland, and Darl).
The climate at the beginning of the Late Archaic was severely xeric, though mesic conditions gradually
returned. Middle Archaic lifestyles and subsistence strategies continued, with burned rock middens
reaching their zenith, particularly along the eastern Edwards Plateau during the time when Pedernales
points were in vogue (Collins 1998a:65). Between about 3500 and 2500 B.P., less-xeric conditions
prevailed and the use of burned rock middens diminished along the eastern edge of the plateau, though to
the west dry conditions prevailed and xerophytes continued to be baked in earth ovens.
Toward the end of the Late Archaic, evidence emerges of contact between the local peoples and cultures
to the east, in the form of exotic artifacts suggestive of ceremonial practices. There is good evidence that
the population substantially increased (Johnson 1995; Prewitt 1981).
San Gabriel River: Thirty-five single-component Late Archaic sites have been found within the study
corridor’s crossing of the San Gabriel River. This is the largest number of single-component sites that
occur along any of the five streams crossed by the SH 130 study corridor. An additional 28
multicomponent sites have been recorded that contained Late Archaic materials.
Along the North Fork of the San Gabriel River lies 41WM30, a site with two rockshelters and a burned
rock midden. Numerous cobbles, lithic debitage, and many stone tools suggest this was a raw material
procurement site, while the presence of mussel shell indicates some of the associated subsistence pursuits.
Two additional burned rock middens lie within the San Gabriel River drainage at sites 41WM824 and
41WM1101. Dart point types Frio, Darl, Montell, and Castroville were present at 41WM1101.
Extensive Late Archaic deposits were encountered during excavations at the Loeve-Fox site (41WM230)
located downstream of the SH 130 study corridor. Prewitt (1982) assigned these to two phases, the Twin
Sisters and the Driftwood. The earlier Twin Sisters occupations were the most intensive at the site. Ensor
dart points, Erath and San Gabriel bifaces, and exotic artifacts including a boatstone, stone gorget, and
marine shell gorget were found as well as numerous small basin hearths. At least four episodes of site use
could be attributed to the Twin Sisters occupations, which occurred between 1,800 and 1,450 years ago.
The succeeding Driftwood occupations were not as extensive and lacked the exotic materials, which
suggested territorial restrictions. The Mahomet (Darl) dart points found in these levels was seen as a
possible indication of an intrusive group.
440715/060270

22

3: Cultural Background

Brushy Creek: Thirty-one prehistoric sites with Late Archaic components have been recorded along the
SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of Brushy Creek. Included in this total are 10 single-component sites
and 21 multicomponent sites.
The Late Archaic is well represented at the Wilson-Leonard site, where a wide range and quantity of dart
point types is noted (including, in rough chronological order, Bulverde, Williams, Marcos, Castroville,
Pedernales, Montell, Edgewood, Marshall, Frio, Fairland, Ensor, and Darl), suggesting an expanded range
of subsistence activities. There is no evidence of local exploitation of bison there, and there are fewer
ground stone net sinkers and manos to suggest that fishing or the collection of nuts was as prevalent as in
previous periods. The presence of a stone pipe at Wilson-Leonard (Collins et al. 1998:246) suggests the
ritual use of wild tobacco, but not necessarily its early domestication.
A burned rock midden was present at the Beaver Head site in association with at least three Late Archaic
burials and in situ Ensor points. Also located along Brushy Creek are an open campsite 41WM927 and a
burned rock midden at 41WM961 containing Darl, Fairland, Ensor, Castroville, Marcos, and Montell
darts points, plus two conch shell pendants suggesting trade with coastal peoples. An open campsite at
41WM1010 located on the SH 130 ROW (Dixon and Rogers 2006) included one burned rock oven and
several cobble hearths, plus Darl, Ensor, and Fairland dart points in close associations. No evidence of
outside trade was found at the site. One dart point fragment was apparently reused as an arrow point.
Also on Brushy Creek, sites that have yielded Late Archaic period projectile points and features include
41WM439 and 41WM464 west of Round Rock, 41WM469 and 41WM470 not far away, the Beaver
Head site also west of Round Rock, sinkholes 41WM572 and 41WM580 with burned rock middens in the
Buttercup Creek Subdivision, the Bessie Kruse site (41WM13) downstream from the SH 130 ROW, and
41WM815 at Rice’s Crossing even farther downstream.
Colorado River: Only six Late Archaic sites have been recorded within the SH 130 study corridor at the
Colorado River crossing. This includes three apparent single-component sites and three multicomponent
sites. Two of the sites (41TV455 and 41TV456) were previously recorded open campsites reexamined
during the pedestrian survey of the SH 130 ROW along the Colorado River, near the confluence with
Onion Creek. Both sites both contained Ensor points.
Distal to the Colorado River, a Late Archaic burial was present on Gilleland Creek at 41TV1198, along
with a burned rock midden and an Ensor dart point. Along Wilbarger Creek, two open campsites were
located at 41TV1290 and 41TV1221. During the pedestrian survey of the SH 130 roadway, two sites
along Decker Creek contained open campsites 41TV1981 and 41TV1987 with Marshall and Montell
points.
Onion Creek: Seven single-component Late Archaic sites have been recorded within the SH 130 study
corridor. This total includes three open campsites, one campsite with a burned rock midden, two lithic
procurement sites, and one rockshelter. Diagnostic Late Archaic artifacts found at the sites include

440715/060270

23

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Bulverde, Pedernales, Ensor, Frio, and Darl projectile points. In addition, six multicomponent sites with
Late Archaic components have been found in the study corridor.
San Marcos River: Two multicomponent sites (41CW3 and 41HY166) along the San Marcos River in the
SH 130 study corridor were found to contain Late Archaic projectile points.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period is much shorter in duration than the preceding Late Archaic, and has long
been divided into two subperiods, designated Austin and Toyah. Prewitt (1981) categorized the two
subperiods as phases, using the Midwestern Taxonomic System. Black (1986) preferred the term
“horizon” to define the archaeological manifestations. Ricklis and Collins (1994) use the term “interval”
to describe the components.
Austin Phase
The Austin phase (A.D. 800–1300) identifies the early part of the Late Prehistoric period and is marked by
the introduction of the bow and arrow, with the Scallorn arrow point style a marker for the phase. The
technological replacement of the atlatl did not occur immediately and does not appear to have
accompanied any major changes in lifestyle in Central Texas. As noted by Johnson (1995), there was little
change in cultural practices other than the use of the bow and arrow, and hence the Late Archaic period
could be considered to continue until about A.D. 1200. However, to the northeast in the Caddoan area and
along the upper Texas coast, contemporary peoples were using pottery, farming, and living in sedentary
villages, and some of the traits associated with cultures were shared with Central Texas. Thus, it seems
appropriate to include the Austin phase in the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1998a:65). Widespread
hostilities are thought to have occurred during this period, based on a number of arrow-wound fatalities
(Prewitt 1981:83).
San Gabriel River: One single-component Austin phase site has been recorded within the SH 130 study
corridor’s crossing of the San Gabriel River. Nine multicomponent sites that contained Austin phase
materials have also been recorded in the study corridor.
To the east of the study corridor, extensive Austin phase encampments have been investigated at Hoxie
Bridge (Bond 1978) and the Loeve-Fox site (Prewitt 1982).
Three sites were excavated at Hoxie Bridge (41WM130, 41WM284, and 41WM294) as part of
investigations at the Granger Reservoir (Bond 1978). Of these, 41WM130 was found to contain discrete
evidence of occupations during the Late Archaic through the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric.
Numerous stone-lined hearth features were uncovered at the site. The author concluded that the proximity
of the site to a gravel deposit along the San Gabriel River was directly related to the location and reuse of
the site as a habitation area. The Austin phase component at the site could be separated horizontally but
not vertically from the succeeding Toyah phase component. Subsistence evidence demonstrated a reliance

440715/060270

24

3: Cultural Background

on plants and animal species that for the most part are still found in the area. Hearth design was found to
be stable for the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. Bond (1978:287) suggests that future
work at similar sites should concentrate on individual behavioral patterns, particularly those that may
have left manifestations of group size and social organization.
Austin phase occupations were extensive at the Loeve-Fox site, also located in the lands flooded to form
Granger Reservoir (Prewitt 1982). The Austin phase component evidenced numerous occupations over a
roughly 400 year period. Numerous stone-lined hearths occurred at the site, and the ratio of scraping and
cutting tools to projectile points suggested an emphasis on gathering, though hunting was a significant
part of the subsistence strategy. A disproportionate ratio of flakes to cores suggested that initial stone tool
reduction was conducted off-site. Marine shell artifacts found in the Austin phase component suggested
direct or indirect contact with the Gulf Coast. The component included a cemetery containing 27
noncremated individuals and 10 cremations. Evidence of human aggression found in the skeletal remains
is thought to be indicative of internecine warfare among contemporaneous groups.
Brushy Creek: Within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of Brushy Creek, the Austin phase is
represented at 15 sites, of which 2 (41WM996 and 41WM997) are single component. Both are open
campsites.
Several sites with Austin phase components along Brushy Creek have been excavated. The Beaver Head
site yielded Cuney and Scallorn arrow points and a burned rock midden. The Dr. John’s site (41WM961)
contained Scallorn arrow points within a burned rock midden. At 41WM1010 located at the junction of
Brushy and Channel Creeks in the SH 130 ROW (Dixon and Rogers 2006), Austin phase deposits
included cobble hearths, Scallorn points, and faunal material including deer, bison, and antelope. These
materials were found in close vertical and horizontal association with Darl dart points, supporting
Johnson’s (1995) hypothesis of cultural continuum between the Late Archaic and the early part of the
Late Prehistoric.
The use of burned rock middens continued during the Austin phase, as exemplified by findings at WilsonLeonard (Collins 1998c:271), the Merrell site (Campbell 1948; Laughlin 1935; Rogers 2000), and the
Cedar Park Mound (Schuetz 1957). Isolated and well-defined Scallorn contexts were only occasionally
noted on the eastern edge of the upper reaches of Brushy Creek, such as a single Scallorn arrow point
found in a sealed context at site 41WM997 (Hales 2003). However, most Scallorn arrow points have been
surface finds such as specimens found outside a sinkhole at site 41WM580 in the Buttercup Creek
Subdivision (Coffman and Prewitt 1985), in surface collections near site 41WM469 at the junction of
Lake Creek (Whitsett 1981), and in the fields near site 41WM815 and Rice’s Crossing (Brownlow 2003).
Colorado River: Seven Austin phase sites have been recorded within the SH 130 study corridor’s
crossing of the Colorado River. Four of these sites are single component, including one that yielded
ceramics and a single burial (41BP1). Another cemetery was uncovered outside the SH 130 study corridor
along Gilleland Creek. This is the Pat Parker site (41TV88), and excavations there uncovered 17 men,

440715/060270

25

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

woman, children, and infants. Also present as grave goods were deer antler, a marine shell pendant, and
possibly Scallorn arrow points (Greer and Benfer 1975).
Onion Creek: Along Onion Creek, the transition between the Austin and Toyah phases has been
documented at the Toyah Bluff site (41TV441). Numerous earth ovens used for plant bulb–processing
contained associated Scallorn and other arrow points, while aboriginal ceramics, Perdiz points, and other
Toyah phase stone tools such as beveled knives and bladelike flakes were also found, without strong
evidence of bison-processing features. While it is possible that these remains reflect two separate
occupations, it is thought that a transitional Austin phase group gradually adopted Toyah phase
technology as early as A.D. 1235 (Karbula et al. 2001).
Austin phase occupations within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of Onion Creek have been found at
the Collins site, Smith Rockshelter, Toyah Bluff, 41TV16, and 41TV2105. All are multicomponent sites.
At three of these sites, both Austin and Toyah phase components occur. At the Collins site, these
components were mixed, while at the Smith Rockshelter, the mixing appears to have occurred during a
transitional period when diagnostic artifacts from both intervals occurred together (Suhm 1957).
San Marcos River: Evidence of Austin phase occupations within the SH 130 study corridor’s crossing of
the San Marcos River are scant, limited to two multicomponent campsites, 41HY166 and 41CW3.
Toyah Phase
The Toyah phase (A.D. 1300–1600) is the late subperiod of the Late Prehistoric. The archaeological
manifestation of Toyah includes a number of traits that make it easy to distinguish from the earlier Austin
phase, including ceramics (locally made and imported), Perdiz arrow points, end scrapers, large thin
bifaces, beveled knives, and prismatic blades. The people who made and used these were fond of
pursuing bison, though they also exploited deer, antelope, and other creatures. The Perdiz arrow point
used to bring down these animals was hafted into a narrow shaft without the benefit of a barbed stem for
lashing. Burned rock middens do not seem to have been used during Toyah times; instead, large hearths
were used for cooking meat and plants in crude ceramic vessels, surrounded by butchering stations
perhaps used by multiple families (Johnson 1994).
The occurrence of these traits across a wide area at about the same time constitutes what Black (1986)
referred to as the Toyah archaeological “horizon.” There is currently debate among researchers whether
this archaeological horizon reflects the geographic spread of people from a “Classic Toyah Culture” area
(Johnson 1994), or whether it represents the spread of ideas that were picked up by different peoples
(Ricklis and Collins 1994). Deciding this argument is unlikely. Linguistic evidence, which might have
solved it, is missing, as by the time historic Indian groups were recorded they had undergone significant
displacement and cultural change (Collins 1998a:66). Johnson (1994:277–278) notes that the linguistic
evidence from historic groups argues against the inference that a Classic Toyah culture was possessed by
a single linguistic group. Rather, he sees the Classic Toyah culture as being borne by a very small number

440715/060270

26

3: Cultural Background

of large-scale linguistic groups, and that non-Classic Toyah culture, which occupied the surrounding
lands, adopted components of the Toyah toolkit.
There is some question regarding climatological conditions during the Toyah phase. Bog pollen data from
east central Texas indicate a return to mesic conditions. At odds with this is the evidence from Halls Cave
in the western Edwards Plateau where the least shrew and desert shrew (Cryptotis and Notiosores) ratios
point to drying conditions. Most researchers tend to support the xeric conditions (Collins 2005; Johnson
1995), but this would seem to conflict with the return of bison to the area, as in all other periods this
animal spread as the climate became less dry. Perhaps the dry period was of relatively short duration, and
the bison simply stayed in the area. Or perhaps because of the diversity of environments and the
overlapping environmental gradients within Central Texas, any changes in precipitation (even if uniform)
would result in changes in species proportions that would occur differentially across the landscape (Ellis
et al. 1995:419).
San Gabriel River: Nine Toyah phase sites have been recorded within the SH 130 study corridor at the
San Gabriel River. All are multicomponent.
Excavations at the Hoxie Bridge site (41WM130) uncovered Toyah materials including sandy paste and
Leon Plain ceramics. These materials could be separated horizontally but not vertically from Austin phase
materials (Bond 1978). At the Loeve-Fox site (41WM235), Toyah artifacts included Perdiz, Cliffton, and
Young arrow points found in association with bison bones and large flat stone hearths. The bison remains
are enigmatic in that while arrow points were found with the skeleton, no evidence was found that the
animal had been butchered (Prewitt 1982). At Rowe Valley (41WM432), evidence of a large village, or
rancheria, was found. Discrete activity areas, a midden, and hearth features were accompanied by artifacts
including Leon Plain and Patton Engraved ceramics and Perdiz, Cuney, Lott, and Guerrero arrow points,
suggestive of a large amalgamation of native peoples. The overall circular pattern of the site is typical of
Plains Indian villages recorded during historic times (Prewitt 2006).
Brushy Creek: Toyah materials have been recorded at eight multicomponent sites within the SH 130
study corridor’s crossing of Brushy Creek.
A few Perdiz points were found in collections near site 41WM469 at the junction of Lake Creek (Whitsett
1981) and in the fields near Rice’s Crossing (Brownlow 2003), as might be expected, but none were
found from securely dated contexts at the Edwards Plateau end of Brushy Creek. It therefore appears that
some drainages like Brushy Creek became marginalized from broader cultural events after approximately
A.D. 1300, at least based on our current state of knowledge of local prehistory.
Colorado River: At the Pat Parker site along Harris Branch of Gilleland Creek, six Leon Plain ceramic
sherds belonging to two separate vessels were uncovered. They were thought to align with Toyah phase
occupations at the site rather than with the cemetery at the site, which dates to the Austin phase (Greer
and Benfer 1975).

440715/060270

27

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Downstream from the SH 130 study corridor, site 41FY74 contained nearly complete bison skeletons
(except for the skull), most contained only fragmented long bones, ribs, and vertebrae presumably
representing marrow extraction for grease production. Other species found in association with the bisonprocessing and disposal features included deer, opossum, rabbits, rodents, reptiles, fish, turtles, birds, and,
less often, canines, javelina, and antelope (Skelton 1977).
Onion Creek: Along Onion Creek, site 41TV2019 is a single-component campsite dating to the Toyah
phase. The site yielded Perdiz points, scrapers, bifaces, cores, and a prismatic blade. Three important
multicomponent sites, Collins, Smith Rockshelter, and Toyah Bluff, were found to contain extensive
Toyah phase materials including ceramics, Perdiz points, beveled knives, and bladelike flakes. At Toyah
Bluff, numerous earth ovens used for plant bulb–processing at the site suggest that a transitional Austin
phase group gradually adopted Toyah technology as early as A.D. 1235 (Karbula 2003), without strong
evidence of bison-processing activities. The Toyah component at the Mustang Branch site (41HY209),
located a few miles west of the SH 130 corridor in Hays County, contained almost exclusively artiodactyl
remains. The density of faunal remains in the Toyah component suggests that an intensive, systematic,
and industrial approach to animal processing was being carried out. Such an approach may have been
communal in nature, and perhaps was part of an exchange network of materials such as hides, meat, and
grease that may have existed between hunter-gatherers and Caddo agriculturalists.
San Marcos River: Only a few Late Prehistoric sites have been found within the SH 130 study corridor
at the San Marcos River. Site 41CW3 contained Late Archaic period Austin and Toyah phase materials.

Conclusions
The foregoing paragraphs have demonstrated that the lands within the SH 130 study corridor were used
by native people for over 11,000 years. All of the cultural units from Early Paleoindian to the Toyah
phase of the Late Prehistoric are represented in the corridor.
Table 4 lists the frequency of recorded sites with diagnostics that occur within the SH 130 study corridor
for each of the cultural periods. For each period, the total number of components is given as is the
percentage of each period within the total components for that stream. For the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods, the total components per 100 years of their respective intervals is also provided. This
number is not to be taken as an indicator of actual sites that would have occurred, but is provided to show
trends in occupational history. Thus, for the San Gabriel River, the total number of sites with Late
Archaic components was 64, which represented 50.4 percent of the sites within the study corridor along
that river that had identifiable components. That period lasted for some 2,800 years, thus 2.3 sites per
century. The succeeding Austin Phase had only 8 site components, or 6.3 percent of the total, though
because that interval lasted only about 400 years, it equates with 2 sites per century, nearly equal with that
of the Late Archaic.
Site density varies between the streams, with the greatest number of sites with diagnostics occurring on
the San Gabriel River (n = 75) and Brushy Creek (n = 39). This does not necessarily prove or disprove
440715/060270

28

3: Cultural Background

that native peoples had a preference for one stream over another. Site density can be governed by a host
of environmental and cultural factors, including the amount of archaeological investigations that have
been conducted. Thus the large number of sites recorded along the upper reaches of the San Gabriel River
and Brushy Creek may in large part be a result of the greater number of archaeological surveys that were
performed in response to urban development. Environmental factors influencing site density include the
underlying physiography and depositional nature of the streams. Upstream of the SH 130 ROW, each of
the streams flows through Cretaceous upland areas where sites are typically shallow and highly visible,
while those that occur downstream on the prairies may remain undiscovered, being buried in floodplains
and alluvial terraces.

The following summary characterizes the nature of the occupations within the SH 130 study corridor for
each of the cultural periods.
The Early Paleoindian period is represented only by three sites in the SH 130 study corridor, one on the
San Gabriel River and two on Brushy Creek. These sites all yielded Clovis points. At two of the sites
these materials were found deeply buried. While some deeply buried sites may remain to be discovered,
the scarcity of these sites even in upland areas suggests their totals will remain very low. The best
evidence for the period was collected at the Wilson-Leonard site on Brushy Creek. The picture that
emerges from these data is one of well-adapted bands of highly mobile hunters traveling across the
landscape. A variety of game animals were pursued, and an array of plants was probably gathered.
Encampments appear to have been very brief, but some were revisited. Generally mesic conditions are
thought to have prevailed. During Folsom times these early hunters focused on bison, and these sites are
typically found on grasslands. While no Folsom artifacts have yet to be recovered from within the SH 130
study corridor, areas that may yield them could include the broad floodplains of each of the major
streams, where they can be expected to be deeply buried.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

The problematic Plainview point has been found in the study corridor at four sites on the San Gabriel
River and three sites on Brushy Creek. Most of these sites are deeply buried. San Patrice points, which are
diagnostic of the end of the Early Paleoindian, have been identified only at the Wilson-Leonard site on
Brushy Creek.
There is a slight increase in site density within the SH 130 study corridor during the Late Paleoindian
period, with site components identified on the San Gabriel River, Brushy Creek, and Onion Creek. Sites
including Wilson-Leonard and 41CW54 demonstrate these people had adopted a foraging lifestyle and
exploited a range of fauna. Patterns of behavior during this period can be viewed as transitional between
the earlier Paleoindian and the Archaic; evidence of activities including hunting, tool manufacturing, bone
grease processing, and plant gathering was found.
The dry climate that seems to have prevailed during the Early Archaic influenced prehistoric lifestyles.
The first use of burned rock for earth ovens probably occurred then, which may have been a response to
the harsh climate and the need to process plants such as sotol, which under more favorable climatic
conditions may not have been necessary. The greater emphasis placed on plant foods and a generally
more varied subsistence may also be attributable to the scarcity of bison in the region. Indeed, when bison
appear to be plentiful, changes occur that are visible in the archaeological record, which emphasize the
importance of this animal. At the beginning of the succeeding Middle Archaic, bison return in large
number and are being pursued in earnest. New stone chipping technologies appear, which may be
associated with newcomers entering the area from the southern plains. By the end of the period, the herds
have disappeared, dry conditions prevail, projectile point styles change, and burned rock middens become
abundant on the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau.
The long-running Late Archaic period witnessed environmental and cultural changes that have led some
researchers to subdivide or group it according to trends that were in vogue. During the earlier part of the
period, when dry conditions prevailed, burned rock middens reached their zenith. Bison were absent and
Pedernales dart points, thought to be a style of local origin, prevailed. Later, things changed again with
the return of less dry conditions. Population appears to have increased, and contacts were made with
eastern groups that had established ceremonial practices. The population increase may have been
accompanied by or have resulted in an expansion of territoriality, and infringements on cultural
boundaries appear to have led to an increase in conflicts.
Archaeologists tend to mark the appearance of the bow and arrow with a change or shift in behavior and
place its presence with the post-Archaic, or Late Prehistoric, cultural period. However, within the region
of our concern, very little cultural change appears to have accompanied this change in weaponry. It may
have made hunting a bit easier and led to an increase in warfare, but it was not until bison again returned
in large numbers that real cultural change occurred. This change, manifested archaeologically in the
Toyah phase, or interval, witnessed another wave of immigrant hunters with a specialized toolkit adapted
for killing and butchering bison. Though the origin of these traits and the nature of their spread among the

440715/060270

30

3: Cultural Background

various native peoples is still being debated, it is clear that a lifestyle was followed that centered on the
pursuit of bison, though not to the exclusion of other species.
The Toyah hunters represent the terminal phase of the prehistoric cultural history of the native peoples;
the last act of a long drama. The scene changes drastically when Europeans entered the stage.

HISTORIC PERIOD
The following discussion focuses on events that affected the lands crossed by the SH 130 roadway during
the historic period. Chronologically, it begins with a discussion of the native peoples who were residing
in the area at the time of the initial contact with Europeans. This is followed by the period of early
immigration and settlement (1800s–1860s), the post–Civil War period to the post–World War II era.

Native Tribal Groups
The following descriptions are provided for some of the native people who lived, hunted, or raided in the
vicinity of the lands traversed by SH 130 ROW at or near the time of initial European contact. What is
known of the lifestyles of these peoples varies considerably; the customs and beliefs of the Lipan,
Tonkawa, and Comanche are fairly well documented, but relatively little is known about most of the
smaller tribal groups.
Most of the following information concerning the native peoples was compiled for the report of the
PBS&J excavations at La Carneada (41WM1012), located in Segment A of the SH 130 roadway (Rogers
and Dixon 2006). This is the only site identified in the SH 130 ROW with an archaeological component
attributable to native people of the early historic period.
Yojuane
The Yojuane were Wichita (Caddoan) speakers who were found along the Colorado River in Bastrop
County by the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition of 1709 (Campbell 1983:2–3). They were often in
association with the Coco, Cantona, Mayeye, and Simaomo along the Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity
Rivers. The Yojuane were among the tribes at the San Gabriel missions (San Francisco Xavier de
Horcasitas) and participated in the raid on the San Saba mission in 1757 (Weddle 1964).
The Yojuane relied heavily on bison and also ate fish, tubers, and fruits (Newcomb 1993:19). They
hunted with the bow, but appear to have acquired firearms from the French by the time of the San Sabá
raid.
Mayeye
The Mayeye were first encountered by Henri Joutel of La Salle’s expedition in 1687 between Fort St.
Louis and the Maligne River, southeast of the Waco area. In 1727 Pedrode Rivera y Villalón met Mayeye
near the San Gabriel River, 15 leagues west of the junction of Little River and the Brazos. In 1749 there
440715/060270

31

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

were 86 Mayeyes at the San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas mission. They had been reduced by disease
and Apache attacks to a few hundred people (Newcomb 1993:24–25). After the San Gabriel missions
were abandoned, some of the Mayeye moved southward to the coast and joined the Coco, a Karankawa
tribe. That others were assimilated into the Tonkawa is suggested by the name Mayeye given to one of its
clans.
Ervipiame
Known in northeastern Coahuila between 1670 and 1688, members of this tribe were encountered in the
southwestern part of the Edwards Plateau in 1675 by the Bosque-Larios expedition. The Ervipiame were
probably Coahuiltecan speakers. Following repeated attacks by Apache and other groups, they migrated
to east Central Texas after 1707, and were usually found between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers
(Newcomb 1993:25–26).
The Ervipiame were encountered by Diego Ramón’s expedition of 1716 at Ranchería Grande, near
present-day Cameron, Texas. They were the principal tribe at this settlement, which was said to contain a
total of 2,000 native people, including a number of groups from Coahuila and apostate Indians from San
Antonio. They were one of several tribes served by the mission San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas,
numbering about 63 to 70 in 1749. They were later absorbed into the Tonkawa tribe (Newcomb 1993:26).
Tonkawa
Not native to Central Texas, the Tonkawa (or Toncoa) probably resided in north central Oklahoma prior
to the seventeenth century. They were forced south by the expansion of the Apaches in the seventeenth
century, and were listed as an enemy of the Hasinai by Fray Francisco Dasanas de Jesus Maria in 1691
(Swanton 1942:251). The word Tonkawa is the name given to these people by the Waco, and means “they
all stay together” (Carlisle 2001; Newcomb 1993:29)
The Tonkawa were only represented by small numbers at the San Gabriel missions as they were too far
north to be drawn to the missions. Tonkawa participated in the attack on the San Saba mission. By the end
of the eighteenth century, they had been forced out of Central Texas by the Comanche and Wichita and
occupied lands between the Trinity and San Antonio Rivers, where they became allied with the Apaches.
By then they were composed of a number of clans that had once been autonomous groups, including the
Mayeye, Yojuane, Ervipiame, and Sana.
The economic life of the Tonkawa centered around bison hunting, though they also pursued deer and
small game. There was a taboo on killing wolves and coyotes. Bison hunts were recorded as being
communal events.
Kanohatino
The Kanohatino were encountered by the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition of 1709 near present-day
Bastrop. In 1716 the Diego Ramón expedition found them at the junction of the San Gabriel and Little
440715/060270

3: Cultural Background

Rivers (Campbell 1983:4). Little is known about them, though they were considered expert bison hunters.
They are one of the most enigmatic Native American groups of Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:22).
Mesquite
This small group was present at the Little River at the time of Ramón’s expedition of 1716. They were
usually located between the Nueces and San Antonio Rivers, and established their rancherías along rivers
and streams. Their principal group associations were with the Ervipiame and the Catujano. Like the
Ervipiame, they hunted deer and bison and may have kept dogs. They were at the San Antonio missions
between 1720 and 1760 (Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:52; Wade 1998:531–533).
Lipan Apache
By the beginning of the eighteenth century, a number of Apache tribes in Colorado and northeastern New
Mexico were forced south and east into the Llano Estacado and High Plains regions of Texas as a result
of pressure from the newly arrived Comanche. By 1732 the Lipans (also known as Ypandis) had arrived
in the San Saba region. They raided the missions on the San Gabriel River between 1746 and 1755.
Missions were finally established among the Lipans on the San Saba in 1757, but were destroyed the
following year by the Comanche and their allies, including Tonkawa, Yojuane, and Ervipiame warriors
who had formerly been at the San Gabriel missions (Kenmotsu and Wade 2002). Many Lipans fled to
south Texas and Coahuila.
The Lipans were mounted on horses when they first arrived in Central Texas. They were largely
dependent on bison for food, clothing, and shelter. These animals were generally hunted during the spring
and fall, with the fall hunt often extending into the winter. During the spring hunts, several bands would
join together, forming a large expedition. When mounted, the Lipan would kill bison with bow and arrow,
gun, or spear (Sjoberg 1953:81).
Comanche
The Comanche were Shoshonean speakers who, according to their traditions, originated north of the
Arkansas River in the mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. The name Comanche was applied to them
by the Spanish—they called themselves Numa (Gunnerson and Gunnerson 1988:29). Sometime during
the seventeenth century they acquired horses, which resulted in their changing from being poor and
militarily weak, to a well-equipped and powerful people (Newcomb 1961:157). By 1720 they had entered
northwestern Texas, where they immediately encountered the Apache. It was the threat of Comanche
attacks that led the Lipan Apache to approach the Spanish to request missions for their settlements along
the San Saba, and it was the Comanche and their allies who destroyed the mission there in 1757. The
Comanche continued to be the dominant Native American group in the area until the latter half of the
nineteenth century, and were in constant conflict with the Texan settlers.

440715/060270

33

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

The Comanche were organized into bands, which varied in size and territory. Individuals and families
could change bands at will. Bison was the primary food source of the Comanche, and they practiced
large-scale communal hunts during the summer months and in the fall. Until they acquired guns, they
hunted bison with bows and lances. They lived in tepees of the Plains type (Newcomb 1961:163).
Other Native Groups
Several other nomadic native groups resided on or near the lands crossed by SH 130 east and southeast of
the Edwards Plateau (Johnson and Campbell 1992). Several of the groups entered into Franciscan
missions at some time, and what we know of their languages comes from names recorded in mission
documents (Johnson and Campbell 1992). Linguistically, they included several bands of Sanan speakers
such as the Emate, Sana, Sijame, Menanquen, and Toho, and groups including the Simaomo and Tusonibi
who had been displaced from their homeland in northeastern Mexico (Campbell 1983). Many of these
groups had formed large congregations and met the Spaniards along the San Marcos and Colorado Rivers,
where they had been hunting and trading among themselves and with the Caddo. Most of the Indians had
acquired horses by the beginning of the eighteenth century, and many were using firearms by about 1750.
Our knowledge of their lifestyles is limited, though all were regarded by the Spanish as bison hunters.
Most were enemies of the Apache.

Early Settlement
The earliest historic period settlement probably occurred in the southern portion of the project area by virtue
of the area’s proximity to the settlements at San Antonio, Goliad, and San Marcos. During the Spanish
Colonial period, large land grants had been issued to prominent individuals, such as Jose Antonio Navarro,
who established a substantial horse and cattle ranch along Geronimo Creek in current Guadalupe County.
These early ranches were widely dispersed and unfenced to allow the free movement of herds across an
open range. “Hispanic Colonial” ranching continued well into the nineteenth century when Anglos
adopted and adapted the Hispanic methods to create what eventually became Texas’s distinctive style of
open-range cattle ranching (Jordan 1981:16–17; Jordan et al. 1984:157).
The Spanish established a network of roads and trails, portions of which likely followed earlier paths
created by the native inhabitants or game trails. The Spaniards quickly took advantage of these trails,
which could vary due to unpredictable weather conditions and threats from Indians, resulting in everchanging paths, establishing a transportation corridor across the state that “influenced the establishment of
many Texas towns and cities, and, ultimately, the modern network of state highways” (McGraw 1991:3).
Beginning at the Presidio del Rio Grande, these trails converged at San Antonio but diverged again
northeast of San Antonio. The Camino de Los Tejas was an early upper trail “used to establish and supply
the first eighteenth-century Spanish Colonial missions of East Texas” (McGraw 1991:4). Near the end of
the eighteenth century, a route just to the south of the Camino de Los Tejas was established and referred
to as the Camino Arriba by Stephen F. Austin (McGraw 1991:4). Also known as the Old San Antonio
Road, these varying routes have come to be known collectively as El Camino Real. Spanish military

forces used the route to counter French expeditions into what is now Texas as early as the mid-1680s.
Arriving at an unusual river along this route on St. Mark’s Day in 1689, Alonso de Leon’s exploration
crew named it San Marcos in honor of the patron saint. By 1691, this route was the principal road
connecting Coahuila, Mexico, with the former Spanish capital of the Texas province, Los Adaes (now
Robelene, Louisiana).
By the mid-eighteenth century, under the perceived threat of French encroachment into territories claimed
by the Spanish Crown, Spanish friars and soldiers entered the Central Texas area and established military
presidios and missions along the Camino at spots chosen for their economic or geographic importance. In
1779, a postal service was inaugurated along the route from Nacogdoches to Arispe, Sonora. El Camino
Real continued to see use through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, serving as an important
transportation corridor for soldiers, merchants, and settlers alike.
A section of the Camino de los Tejas is known to have crossed eastern Travis County adjacent to Austin.
It crossed the SH 130 ROW near Manor (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, and Texas Department of Transportation, Turnpike Authority Division [USDOT-FHA
and TxDOT-TTA] 2001). Another section known as Camino de Arriba followed what is now SH 21 east
of San Marcos, It crossed the SH 130 ROW in Caldwell County, in the northern part of Segment C.
It is unlikely that the northern part of the project area saw any European settlement before the Mexican
war for independence from Spain (1810–1821). After the war, the newly formed Mexican government,
eager to expand its territory to the north, began granting lands to American empresarios who agreed to
bring settlers into the territory. During the 1820s, lands were granted in the current Williamson County
area as part of Robertson’s Colony (Odintz 2002). However, no recorded settlement took place there until
after the Texas Revolution. Eastern Travis County is part of an area awarded to Stephen F. Austin in 1827
as part of his “Little Colony” (Smyrl 2005a). A few Anglo settlers began to trickle into Austin’s “Little
Colony” during the 1820s, settling near the present-day town of Bastrop. The town of Mina (as it was
called then) became the colony’s headquarters. Lands in Caldwell and Guadalupe County were granted to
Green C. DeWitt, and the earliest colonists there settled mainly around Gonzales, east of the project area
(Smyrl 2005b).
The land survey methods used at the time resulted in many long lots extending back from major rivers and
streams, as well as irregularly shaped “metes and bounds” parcels that followed natural landmarks such as
existing roads, streams, or rivers. The size of the land grants varied according to the immigration status of
the individual. In the earliest historical period of immigration, settlement tended to be dispersed along
major rivers and streams, or located along old trails. With time, key crossing points, trails, and other
landmarks provided a base around which nascent communities developed. Colonization of Texas and the
project area continued until tensions between Mexico and the United States led the Mexican government
to forbid any further immigration by Anglos from the north. After the war of Texas Independence,
settlement intensified throughout the project area. New communities emerged in Williamson, Travis,

440715/060270

35

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties as the result of the push to expand the domain of the fledgling
Republic.
Although regular Comanche Indian raids prevented Travis and Williamson Counties from attracting large
numbers of settlers at first, the establishment of both military and civilian fortified communities gradually
began to encourage growth. In 1838 Thomas Kenney established the first civilian community in
Williamson County on Brushy Creek near the present-day crossing of the Missouri Kansas and Texas
Railroad in the project area. Although founded by civilians, Kenney’s Fort nevertheless had to be armed
against Indian attacks (Odintz 2002). Farther to the south, in Travis County, a chain of forts was founded
that extended from Bastrop westward into the project area. Protected to a certain degree by Fort Colorado,
Jesse Tannehill laid out a town he called Montopolis and built a log cabin there, hoping to attract new
homesteaders. About the same time, in 1839, the city of Austin was founded under the name Waterloo.
Located just a few miles upriver from Montopolis, Austin was chosen over Tannehill’s city as the new
capital of the Republic (Smyrl 2005a). In Caldwell County, small Republic-era communities, such as Plum
Creek (now Lockhart) and Fentress, both in the project area, emerged in the central and southwestern
portion of the county (Smyrl 2005b).
Indirect evidence of early settlement in the project area is also present in the form of historical markers
commemorating early settlers who lived in the area. For example, a cemetery on the Hornsby Ranch
features three Official Texas Historical Markers recognizing Reuban and Sarah Hornsby as the first
settlers in Travis County; their son, Reuban Hornsby, a Texas Ranger who fought against Indian raids;
and John Williams and Howell Hagget who were killed on the property by an Indian attack. In the southern
portion of the project area, Jose Antonio Navarro’s occupation of the Geronimo Creek vicinity is
commemorated, as is Dr. David Port Smythe who settled in Lockhart in the 1840s.
SH 130’s ROW follows a route that leads it through the location of a running battle that occurred in 1840
along an 18-mile-long southeast-to-northwest corridor from Lockhart to San Marcos, Texas. In this battle,
a small but well-armed force of Texans defeated a much larger group of Comanche, led by Buffalo
Hump. The Indians were returning from their raid against Linnville and Victoria, which they conducted in
revenge for the massacre of several of their chiefs and warriors at San Antonio, known as the Council
House Fight. The combatants met on the Clear Fork branch of Plum Creek, across from the present
entrance to Lockhart State Park on Highway 20 (Brice 2001).
The rural agrarian pattern of dispersed communities distributed along watercourses and existing roadways
continued into the mid-nineteenth century. Larger, better-organized towns were laid out according to the
model prevalent throughout the American south, with a central square surrounded by a regular grid.
However, at this time only a few real towns existed—most communities emerged as dispersed hamlets.
The core of such community centers often included little more than a post office, a store, a local school, or
even a gin that was surrounded by rural farms and ranches.

440715/060270

3: Cultural Background

At first, the economy throughout most of the project area was based more on livestock than farming.
Anglo immigrants coming from the American south distrusted the deep black soil of the Black Prairie,
imagining that only red clay was suitable for growing cotton. However, by the 1850s, cotton and corn
growing increased and several agricultural communities were established in the project area (Britton et al.
2001). Although no tangible evidence of the town’s mid-nineteenth-century history remains today, the town
of Staples on the San Marcos River is a surviving example of a dispersed agricultural community founded
in the project area during the mid-nineteenth century. In the northern portion of the project area, Palm
Valley, a Swedish community just east of Round Rock, grew up around the farm of Mrs. Anna Palm, who
moved to the area in 1853 (Leffler 2004).
While open-range ranching of the previous period continued and the practice of driving cattle to market
developed, this period also witnessed the Anglo takeover of previously Hispanic-owned ranches in many
areas throughout Texas (Jordan 1981:17). During this time, farming developed rapidly—a result of the
continued efforts of the pioneer phase settlers as well as the influx of new European immigrants.
In this period, the earlier pioneer farmsteads founded in the immigration and settlement phase were
typically expanded beyond their previous subsistence level, sometimes dramatically so, according to
ethnic tradition and varying degrees of individual wealth. For example, Lower Southern Anglos with
sufficient economic resources and arable land often sought to develop a large plantation using slave labor
to cultivate a large cash crop (e.g., cotton). Cash crops introduced into eastern Williamson and Travis
Counties were mostly wheat and cotton. These came later to southern Caldwell and Guadalupe Counties,
which continued to rely on ranching. Contrary to the Lower Southern preference for a plantation-scale
operation, Upper Southern Anglos, Germans, and Swedes with less wealth would focus on further
development of their existing “yeoman” farmsteads, planting a greater variety of cash and subsistence
crops (e.g., cotton, corn, and various vegetables). Some immigrant ethnic groups may have adopted the
Lower Southern Anglo plantation concept (e.g., wealthy Swedish and German farmers on the Black
Prairie). However, most preferred the smaller scale of operations suitable for a single family with no
slaves—especially in portions of Caldwell and Guadalupe Counties less suited to cultivation of vast
acreage. According to Frederic Olmsted’s 1856 account (1978), eastern Travis County boasted a few
plantation-scale operations. However, most of the farms he noted were of the small subsistence type. This
was particularly true for German immigrant farms in the southern portion of the project area.

Post–Civil War Development
The Civil War (1861–1865) caused dramatic changes in agriculture that were accompanied by a
redistribution of people across the project area. After the war, former plantations were often subdivided into
smaller tenant farming parcels. While many of the African Americans freed from the plantations relocated
to rural tenant farms belonging to their prior owner, others resettled into racially segregated rural
communities and urban enclaves. Additionally, many new immigrants of varying ethnicity, including many
displaced whites from the lower south, also entered the region and tended to settle in areas occupied by
others of the same ethnic background. Already in the pre–Civil War period, substantial concentrations of
440715/060270

37

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Germans and Hispanics had settled in Guadalupe County, around the core German settlement of New
Braunfels. After the Civil War, Germans continued to populate the southern portion of the project area.
Many blacks moved into Caldwell County, and Germans and Swedes into Travis and Williamson
Counties, often in small, ethnically segregated communities (Jordan et al. 1984:80–84). The town of
Geronimo, located just north of Seguin and named after Geronimo Creek, became a focal point for
German agricultural settlers, who moved into the area from Schumansville in 1860 (Smyrl 2001a).
With the arrival of the railroads in the 1870s and 1880s, settlement patterns again shifted dramatically.
The railroads provided important transportation links between towns and communities that had previously
been separated by poorly maintained roadways and trails. Farmers and ranchers now had better access to
markets via faster transportation. All this fueled an economic boom for many communities throughout
Texas, fostering unprecedented growth. New railroad towns evolved in which the main commercial center
formed a long narrow corridor that fronted the rail lines, instead of the central square as had been the earlier
model. Many towns abandoned their old locales and moved completely to be nearer the improved mode of
transportation. Others that were bypassed by the railroad faded into history. In the southern portion of the
project area, the former community of Wade, which had a post office in operation between 1891 and 1906,
and a population of 114 in 1904, had disappeared by the 1940s (Smyrl 2001a). Meanwhile, towns such as
Austin, Lockhart, Pflugerville, Round Rock, and Seguin thrived as a result of their strategic locations
along the railroad.
The Union Pacific Railroad ran through Williamson, Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties, and the
Southern Pacific ran through Caldwell County. The first railroad to come through Travis County was the
Houston and Central Texas Railroad in 1871, and 5 years later, the International Great Northern Railroad
was built linking Austin to Rockdale and Laredo (Odintz 2002; Smyrl 2001b).

The Twentieth Century
The subsequent development of automotive transportation in the early twentieth century changed the
nature of settlement and agriculture again. With trucks to haul produce to market, the success of
individual farmers and entire communities was no longer as dependent on having a strategic location
along the railroad. Consequently, many old roads and trails were improved as part of a farm-to-market road
system developed by the state highway department. Prior to the twentieth century, individual landowners
were responsible for maintaining the portions of roadways that ran through their property. However, the
widespread use of the automobile, with its noise, dust, and damaging tires, forced counties to take control of
roadway maintenance as part of a centralized effort (Hill 1889). Such changes are apparent in the network
of farm-to-market roads that remain in the project area today.
As noted above, agriculture in the project area has undergone several major phases of change but has
maintained its position as the predominant land use, even into the latter twentieth century. However, the
discovery of oil in Caldwell County in the 1920s did provide an alternative to those landowners fortunate
enough to retain their subsurface mineral rights. The earliest and most important discoveries were made

440715/060270

38

3: Cultural Background

around Luling in Caldwell County and along Darst Creek in Guadalupe County. Even today, portions of
the oil fields discovered in the 1920s still feature dozens of active pumpjacks, usually set in pasture land.

METHODS
PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The pedestrian survey of the SH 130 ROW was performed by one or more teams of PBS&J
archaeologists. Each team was composed of two to four archaeologists. Each archaeologist was equipped
with a shovel, 6.3-millimeter (0.25-inch) mesh hand screen, compass, topographic maps, PBS&J shovel
test forms, and TexSite forms. Each team carried a camera.
Once a site was located, a program of systematic shovel tests was implemented to help define the site’s
boundaries within the proposed SH 130 ROW, the depth of the cultural deposits, and the potential
integrity of the cultural deposits. Typically, site boundaries were defined by a series of shovel tests along
transects radiating in the four cardinal directions or, if more appropriate, along perceived major and minor
site axes. Shovel tests were placed along these transects at approximate 10- to 20-m intervals.
The shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated by natural strata where
possible, or in intervals not exceeding 10 cm (4 inches). All of the shovel tests were excavated to a depth
where pre-Holocene sterile substrates were encountered, if possible. In deeper soils, if the stratum was
indeterminate, the shovel tests were excavated to a minimum of 80 cm. All soil matrix was sifted through
6.3-millimeter (0.25-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless the matrix was dominated by clay. Clayey matrix
was finely divided by trowel and visually inspected.
For each of the shovel tests, the following information was recorded on PBS&J shovel test forms:
location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness, texture, color,
and the presence or absence of cultural materials was recorded. All shovel tests were backfilled upon
completion. All cultural material recovered from subsurface tests was collected. Collection of surface
artifacts from located sites was limited to temporally diagnostic artifacts. Isolated surface occurrences
were not collected unless they were temporally diagnostic.
The location of each archaeological site was recorded on a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic
map, and a sketch map was drawn showing the location of all shovel tests and other salient features at the
site. A temporary field designation was assigned, and a TexSite form was completed and submitted to the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for assignment of a permanent trinomial designation.

ARCHIVAL AND HISTORIC RESEARCH
Archival research included a records review of historic maps, literature, and files at the Lorenzo de Zavala
State Archives and Center for American History in Austin, Texas. It also included a review of available
chain-of-title documents, tax, census, and probate records, as well as any associated publications, vertical
files, cemetery records, and newspaper files at county libraries and courthouses. Informant interviews
were conducted with landowners whenever possible. However, in most instances no landowner was living
on the surveyed property. During the preparation of this report, a final effort was made to extract historic
data from landowners. A letter was submitted to the landowner of each property with a recorded historic
site. The request for information presented in this letter can be found in Appendix A.

PROBABILITY AREAS
Delineating the specific archaeological potential of each study unit was accomplished by dividing them
into high, moderate, and low probability areas. These probability areas were primarily intended to address
the prehistoric potential of the project area. Historic site locations were not generally governed by the
same factors of site location, but occurred virtually anywhere on the landscape. Therefore, all new ROW
was treated as having high or moderate potential for historic properties. Maps generated depicting the
high, moderate, and low probability areas are provided in Appendix B of this report.

High Probability Areas
High probability areas were defined as those areas most likely to contain archaeological sites. They
occurred within about 400 m of natural water and include areas in which previously recorded
archaeological sites are located. High probability areas also included Holocene alluvial deposits that
possessed a potential for harboring deeply buried prehistoric sites. Examining these areas required shovel
testing at intervals of about 30 m, and mechanical excavation in deep alluvial settings. High probability
areas consisted of 2,958 acres, or approximately 48 percent of the total project area. This total includes
approximately 2,200 acres of high probability areas in new ROW and 758 acres in existing ROW.

Moderate Probability Areas
Moderate probability areas occurred at somewhat greater distances from natural water. Typically, soils in
these areas are shallow and are not derived from Holocene alluvium, though colluvial and aeolian
deposition was present in sandier portions of Segments B and C. Between 60 and 80 percent of areas of
moderate probability received surface inspection with shovel tests where ground visibility was below
50 percent. Areas of moderate site potential occupied 2,427 acres, or about 39 percent of the project area.
Included in this total are about 1,455 acres in new ROW and 972 acres in existing ROW.

440715/060270

42

4: Methods

Low Probability Areas
Low probability areas had little prehistoric site potential. These areas occupied approximately 780 acres
or slightly less than 13 percent of the project area. This total includes about 655 acres in new ROW and
125 acres in existing ROW. Typically, low probability areas occurred at considerable distances from
natural water, and included steeply dissected terrain unsuited for human occupation. Areas of low
probability were subject to spot surface inspection with random examination of 15 to 20 percent of the
total area.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES
Standard procedures for processing artifacts were used. The artifacts were washed, cataloged, and labeled
prior to analysis and curation. Cataloging and labeling were to TARL curational standards. Prehistoric
lithic artifacts were sorted by reduction stage or functional classification. Raw material type for each
piece was recorded. When possible, type names appropriate to the local sequence were assigned to the
projectile points. Historic artifacts were sorted by material type (glass, ceramic, metal) and subdivided
according to recognizable attributes.

GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Geoarchaeological investigations were proposed for selected areas within the proposed 91-mile (146-km)
SH 130 ROW. Primarily, this work was performed in alluvial settings where the potential for deeply
buried prehistoric sites exists, and where constructional impacts might adversely affect cultural deposits
below the maximum shovel test depth of 80 cm. In Segment A these areas included the floodplain and
terraces of the San Gabriel River, Brushy Creek, Wilbarger Creek, and Gilleland Creek. In Segment B,
the subsurface investigations were performed along Decker Creek, the Colorado River, Onion Creek, Dry
Creek, and Elm Creek. Finally, in Segment C, geoarchaeological investigations were conducted along the
West Fork of Plum Creek, the San Marcos River, and Mill Creek.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The following site descriptions are presented for the 97 archaeological sites investigated during the
pedestrian survey of the SH 130 roadway. Seventy-six of these sites are newly recorded and 21 were
previously recorded. Because each of the segments of the roadway received unique State of Texas
Antiquity Permit numbers, the site descriptions are separated and presented in numerical order according
to their state trinomial in Segment A, Segment B, and Segment C.
Each description includes a discussion of the environmental setting as it was noted at the time of the
pedestrian survey, including observations on the vegetation, surface visibility, soils, elevation, and
potential impacts to the cultural remains. A summary of the methods used to record the site are also
provided and the distribution of surface and subsurface cultural deposits. In most cases a sketch map is
provided showing the site boundaries within the SH 130 ROW and the positive and negative shovel test
locations. A photograph of the site is also included.
A description of the number and types of artifacts encountered at each recorded site is also provided. For
prehistoric sites this includes the artifact type and material. An attempt is be made to assign projectile
points to specific types. Historic artifacts are described according to type, material, and presumed
function. An effort was made at historic sites to refine the time of occupation. This was accomplished by
attempting to recover at least two of the following three lines of evidence: (1) artifact analysis, (2)
informant interview, and (3) archival research.
Finally, each site description closes with the Principal Investigator’s opinion as to the significance of the
site and a recommendation as to the site’s status for NRHP eligibility or designation as an SAL. The THC
has concurred with the recommendations for all of the sites recorded within the SH 130 ROW.

SEGMENT A SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Williamson County
41WM917
This is a previously recorded prehistoric/historic scatter located on a Cretaceous-aged ridge summit. The
nearest natural water, Dry Berry Creek, is located approximately 300 m west of the site, while Berry
Creek is 400 m to the southwest. Elevation at the site nucleus is approximately 730 ft above mean sea
level (amsl). Soils recorded in the vicinity of the site have been mapped as belonging to the Ekrant cobbly
clay and Krum silty clay series (Werchan and Coker 1983). Ekrant soils are taxonomically classified as
Lithic Haplustolls, which are shallow, well-drained, stony soils on Cretaceous uplands, formed in
440715/060270

45

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

residuum over interbedded limestone, marls, and chalk. Krum soils are taxonomically classified as
Udertic Haplustolls, which are deep, well-drained soils on Quaternary stream terraces, formed in
calcareous clayey sediments.
At the time of the survey the site was situated in a pasture bordered with immature oak trees, affording
ground surface visibility of roughly 40 percent. Adverse impacts to the site may have included the
construction of multiple electrical transmission lines, County Road 195, and a modern house, as well as
ranching activities (Figure 3).
Site 41WM917 was originally recorded in 1997 as a prehistoric/historic artifact scatter (TARL site files).
Four shovel tests excavated at 15-m intervals were culturally sterile. Seventy-five historic artifacts
observed on the ground surface included clear, aqua, amethyst, and green bottle glass fragments; milk
glass fragments; canning jar lid insert fragments; window pane glass fragments; whiteware fragments;
and brown-slipped crockery fragments. These artifacts date to the late nineteenth or early twentieth
century and are consistent with a domestic habitation assemblage. Prehistoric artifacts observed on the
ground surface included four debitage fragments, one bifacially modified flake, and one core fragment, all
consistent with a lithic procurement area. The site size was judged to be approximately 65 x 25 m
oriented northwest-southeast. The site was not recommended for further work due to the limited potential
for buried or intact features or deposits.
Site 41WM917 was revisited during the SH 130 survey. An intensive surface inspection revealed a
relatively sparse scatter of historic domestic debris including one windowpane glass fragment, one
amethyst glass fragment, one clear glass fragment, and one whiteware cup/bowl fragment. The historic
artifacts suggest a late-nineteenth- or early-twentieth-century time frame and an assemblage consistent
with a domestic habitation site. No prehistoric artifacts were observed during the surface inspection. No
surficial artifacts were collected. A total of 14 shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 30
centimeters below surface (cmbs) in order to search for buried cultural deposits. Only one shovel test was
positive, yielding one windowpane glass fragment from a depth of 10–20 cm. No structures, cultural
features, or temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts were observed. The site size was judged to be
approximately 65 by 25 m oriented northwest-southeast, as recorded on the initial visit to the site. A
sketch map of the site is included as Figure 4.
Attempts to gather more information about the historic component at 41WM917 from oral interviews
with the landowner were unsuccessful. Historic maps, including the USGS 1928 Round Rock 30-minute
quadrangle and the Texas State Highway Department (TSHD) 1953 Williamson County General
Highway Map, depict a structure in the vicinity of this location. A structure does not appear on the 1936
Williamson County General Highway Map. Site 41WM917 may, therefore, be related to the structure
depicted on the 1928 map and/or a subsequent structure built in the same location after 1936.
The historic component at site 41WM917 does not meet any of the criteria necessary for listing on the
NRHP or designation as a SAL. The prehistoric component lacks chronologically diagnostic artifacts,

features, and subsistence remains. The clayey soils do not appear to harbor significant subsurface
deposits, and contextual integrity is minimal due to the adverse impacts to the site, mentioned above. It is
the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41WM917 should not be considered eligible for NRHP
listing or for designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41WM1010 (Shepherd Site)
This prehistoric site was recorded when mechanical trenching uncovered prehistoric cultural materials on
the north side of Brushy Creek. Four spatially distinct areas, designated Areas A–D, were identified at the
site (Figure 5). All occur in Quaternary terrace deposits in soils mapped as belonging to the Oakalla series
(Werchan and Coker 1983). Elevations range from about 620 to 630 ft amsl. At the time of the
investigations, the vegetation throughout the site consisted of improved and unimproved pasture and
scattered hardwoods. Brushy Creek forms the southern boundary of the site, and an unnamed drainage to
Brushy Creek traverses the parcel. Two modern homes exist within the confines of the site, and the
landowner stated that a few mobile homes had previously been situated within the northern part of the
site. An active water line extends from a well adjacent to one of the modern homes and terminates in the
area formerly occupied by the mobile homes. In addition to the domiciles, the site area contains an
unimproved road that runs from US 79 to the modern homes, and a small gravel pit located east of Area
B. Eight backhoe trenches were excavated in the site area; four of these were positive for cultural
materials.
Area A was investigated in Trench T-115-1. The trench was excavated parallel to an unnamed tributary to
Brushy Creek. The profile observed in this trench included a 50-cm-thick clay loam Ak horizon underlain
by a Bk horizon extending to a depth of about 180 cm, where limestone bedrock was encountered.
Cultural materials observed in the trench occurred at a depth of approximately 50–60 cmbs and consisted
of two thermally discolored limestone cobbles, interpreted as being hearthstones from a small hearth.
These items were uncovered by the backhoe, but no in situ materials were seen in the trench wall.
Area B was investigated in Trench T-115-3. This trench was located in a cleared area formerly occupied
by mobile homes. The active water line alluded to above was severed during the excavation of Trench T115-3, at a depth of 50 cm. Trench T-115-3 was excavated to a depth of approximately 300 cm; the
profile observed in the trench included an Ak horizon to about 90 cm underlain by Bk horizons to 180 cm
where dense gravels were encountered. Cultural materials consist of a longbone fragment (deer) from a
depth of about 50 cm, a vertebra fragment from an unidentifiable medium-sized mammal, and thermally
altered rock from depths of about 170–180 cm near the contact of the lowermost Bk horizon (Bkb) with
the gravel bed.
Area C was identified by Trench T-115-5, excavated on the north side of the unnamed tributary to Brushy
Creek that traverses Parcel 115. The trench was dug to a depth of about 220 cm and contained Ak and Bk
horizons to that depth, where a gleyed Bgb horizon and a perched water table were encountered. The
cultural material uncovered in the trench consists of a bifacially worked chopper and thermally altered

Area D was identified by Trench T-115-8 excavated on the terrace edge about 10 m north of Brushy
Creek. The trench was dug to a depth of about 280 cm. Cultural materials were observed in a buried soil
horizon from depths of 230–250 cmbs and include a phalange and long bones (bison). A number of
charcoal fragments were also uncovered but not collected, including one in situ fragment found in the
trench wall at a depth of 240 cmbs.
It was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that based on the presence of deeply buried in situ cultural
materials, the site possessed considerable research potential. It was recommended that a program of
archaeological testing should be developed to determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.

This site consists of a historic artifact scatter located on a Pleistocene terrace 400 m northwest of the San
Gabriel River. Elevation at the site nucleus is 708 ft amsl. The soils are Mollisols, mapped as Krum silty
clays (Werchan and Coker 1983). At the time of the SH 130 survey, the site was vegetated primarily with
scrub trees, mixed hardwoods, cacti, and a moderate understory of weeds and grass. Ground surface
visibility was approximately 30 percent.
Natural impacts to the site include erosion and bioturbation. Artificial impacts were not observed. The site
was identified due to a surficial historic artifact scatter approximately 60 m north-south x 40 m east-west
(Figure 6). Seven shovel tests were excavated in the cardinal directions to assess the subsurface integrity
of the site. Three of the seven shovel tests were positive for one clear glass bottle neck fragment, one
glass vessel fragment with a clear blue tint, one molded glass vessel fragment, one undecorated whiteware
sherd, and one metal fragment. These items were found at a depth of less than 10 cmbs.
No structural remains exist at the location. The artifacts observed are interpreted as representing a dump
site, perhaps associated with a structure shown approximately 300 m to the east on the USGS 1928 Round
Rock 30-minute topographic quadrangle. Based on the map data and the artifact assemblage, the site dates
to the early twentieth century. The current landowner has been on the property only since the early 1970s
and had no knowledge of the property’s earlier history. It is unlikely that additional investigations at the
site would contribute to our understanding of the historical development of the area. In the opinion of the
Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered a candidate for NRHP eligibility or designation as
a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41WM1012 (La Carneada)
This is a prehistoric open campsite located on Holocene T1 and T2 terraces on the north side of the San
Gabriel River. The site’s elevation is approximately 640 to 650 ft amsl. Soils that developed on the
Holocene terraces are Mollisols, mapped as belonging to the Oakalla silty clay loam series (Werchan and

Coker 1983). Oakalla soils are taxonomically classified as Cumulic Haplustolls, which are deep, welldrained floodplain soils that developed in loamy alluvium along major streams (Werchan and Coker
1983). At the time of the survey and mechanical trenching, the site was densely vegetated with pasture
grasses, forbs, and hardwoods, resulting in surface visibility of less than 50 percent. The site may have
been impacted by past flooding episodes, as well as from the effects of terracing activities and possibly
gravel mining in the western portion of the site.
The northern portion of the site was first recorded when surface artifacts were encountered during the
pedestrian survey of the SH 130 ROW (Rogers and Hales 2002). Ten shovel tests were dug at the
location, two of which yielded a total of two pieces of unmodified and one piece of modified lithic
debitage to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs. No time-diagnostic artifacts or intact features were
encountered, nor were any other shovel tests in the parcel positive. Based on the shovel testing, the site’s
size was originally estimated to be about 20 x 20 m in diameter (Figure 7). The occurrence of the site in
an alluvial setting rendered it a strong candidate for buried cultural deposits; however, at the time of the
pedestrian survey, backhoe trenching was not permitted on the entire site. No eligibility recommendations
were therefore made for the site, pending the results of mechanical trenching of the remaining alluvial
deposits at the site.
Access for mechanical trenching was obtained in July 2002. A total of seven trenches were excavated. Six
of the trenches were culturally sterile. One trench (T-35-7) uncovered a prehistoric hearth feature.
Fragments of wood charcoal from the hearth fill were submitted for radiocarbon assay to Beta Analytic,
yielding a 2-sigma calibrated calendrical date with three intercepts of A.D. 1640–1680, 1740–1800, and
1930–1950. No additional artifacts were observed.
In August 2003, landowner permission was also granted for exploratory trenching of the remainder of
41WM1012. The exploratory trenching was conducted on the lowest two terraces of the parcel and
consisted of the excavation of 16 backhoe trenches, with equal numbers of trenches excavated on both
terraces (see Figure 7). In situ faunal remains were found in four trenches on the lowest terrace, and
charcoal from one bison bone deposit yielded a calibrated 2-sigma calendrical radiocarbon date range of
A.D. 1645–1950 (intercept at A.D. 1665). Bone collagen from a bison tooth yielded a calibrated 2-sigma
radiocarbon date of A.D. 1660–1950 (intercepts at A.D. 1690, 1730, and 1810).
The results of PBS&J investigations of 41WM1012 were submitted in an interim report to TxDOT’s
Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT ENV) (Rogers 2003). PBS&J recommended NRHP testing for
the lowest terrace around the trenches that had yielded datable remains.
In a letter to the THC, TxDOT ENV agreed with PBS&J’s recommendation for additional archaeological
investigations. They noted that the subsurface work performed by PBS&J demonstrated that the
archaeological deposits along the two lowest terraces at the site appeared to be intact, with discrete
depositional integrity and chronological association. Such deposits could represent brief episodes of a

temporary occupation or even activities that occurred during a single event that was rapidly buried and
preserved.
For these reasons and the belief that data recovery efforts at the site could provide significant insights
about the temporary encampments of native peoples during the Early Historic period and their
exploitation of resources in the Black Prairie of Central Texas. TxDOT ENV requested the State
Historical Preservation Officer’s (SHPO) concurrence that 41WM1012 was eligible for listing on the
NRHP under Criterion D. In addition, they also recommended that data recovery rather than NRHP
testing be instigated given the fast-paced construction schedule of the SH 130 roadway.
41WM1013
This prehistoric site is located on a nearly level Cretaceous upland landform, a Pleistocene alluvial
terrace, and a Holocene-aged floodplain flanking either side of Pecan Branch. Elevations at the site range
from about 850 to 880 ft amsl. The soils mapped at the location include four Mollisols (Krum silty clay,
Doss silty clay, Queeny clay loam, and Oakalla silty clay loam). These soils occupy the terraces and
floodplain. One Vertisol (Houston Black clay) developed on the Cretaceous landform (Werchan and
Coker 1983).
At the time of the survey, the majority of the site was vegetated with short pasture grasses and hardwoods
(Figure 8). Ground surface visibility in the northern portion of the site was very good, averaging about
85 percent, while in the southern portion of the site vegetation obscured the surface, decreasing visibility
to less than about 20 percent. Adverse impacts to the site include overgrazing and the construction of
berms and stock tanks.
Surface observation within the right of way revealed a sparse to moderate concentration of lithics,
including tested cobbles, cores, bifaces, utilized flakes, and debitage. The scatter extends north-south for
approximately 1 km and is approximately 200 m in width at its widest point (Figure 9). Surface-collected
artifacts include three thermally altered bifaces and one intact prescription-finish bottle.
A total of 157 shovel tests were excavated at the site. Of these, 34 were positive for cultural materials.
Materials collected include 5 core fragments, 5 pieces of thermally altered rock, 1 ground stone, 64 pieces
of unmodified debitage, and 1 amber-colored glass vessel fragment. Diagnostic artifacts include 2 utilized
core tools, 1 heat-treated graver, 1 scraper, 1 thumbnail scraper, 2 heat-treated utilized chunks, 4 utilized
flakes, and 1 utilized flake fragment. All of these materials were found in the upper 30 cmbs, with the
majority (95 percent) being recovered from less than 20 cmbs.
Two backhoe trenches, designated Trenches T-30-1 and T-30-2, were excavated approximately 250–
300 m north of Pecan Branch, where Queeny soils occur (see Figure 9). Trench T-30-1 contained a
40-cm-thick dark grayish brown clay A horizon underlain by alternating lenses of gravels and clay to a
depth of 160 cmbs, where unconsolidated limestone bedrock was encountered. It was culturally sterile.
Trench T-30-2 was dug to a depth of 180 cmbs. The A horizon seen in this trench was much thicker,

extending to a depth of about 100 cmbs, where it contained stream-rolled gravels. A large, roughly oval
shaped, bifacially worked chert cobble, measuring approximately 18 x 27 cm was recovered from the
base of the A horizon at a depth of about 90 cmbs. The artifact evidences slight thermal discoloration. It
appears to have been intentionally shaped, and the central portion of its dorsal surface appears as a
depression and bears slight evidence of battering, perhaps indicative of use as a plant processor or as an
anvil stone (or both). The artifact does not appear to have been redeposited as its edges have not been
dulled from stream transport. No additional artifacts were observed in the trench.
The surface component of the site, with its abundant modified cobbles, cores, and debitage, appears to
reflect repeated visits by people seeking to secure and produce stone tools. The absence of finished tools
suggests most of these visits were temporary. The large bifacially worked artifact uncovered during
trenching may be reflective of a somewhat more substantial utilization. The deeply buried nature of this
component implied in situ cultural materials exist and warranted further archaeological investigations to
determine eligibility for NRHP listing or SAL designation.
NRHP testing was performed at site 41WM1013 on June 25 and 26 and December 2, 2002. Prehistoric
artifacts were found to occur on the present-day ground surface and at depths of approximately 65–
100 cmbs. The buried prehistoric materials are covered by recent alluvial sediments that have
accumulated as a result of slopewash. A total of 12 trenches were mechanically excavated at the site.
Hand excavations of a 50-x-50-cm column were performed in one trench. Site 41WM1013 was
determined not to contain information that is important to the prehistory of the area and was
recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL (Dixon and Rogers 2007).
41WM1014
This is a historic dump and surface scatter located on an upland Cretaceous-aged ridge. Elevation at the
site’s nucleus is approximately 760 ft amsl. The soils at the location are Mollisols, mapped as Austin silty
clay (Werchan and Coker 1983). At the time of the survey, the site was sparsely vegetated with short
pasture grasses with large open patches of exposed soil. Ground surface visibility was about 90 percent.
The site has suffered somewhat from erosion, cultivation, and overgrazing.
Site 41WM1014 was initially identified through surface inspection of a large historic dump, including car
parts, toys, tires, numerous metal cans, ceramics including transferware, and several broken bottles. Some
of the glass present was solarized amethyst suggesting a pre-1916 age. The green transferware was
manufactured between 1829 and 1850. The hand-painted whiteware sherd may also have a midnineteenth-century manufacturing date (Stelle 2001). The remaining artifacts date to the twentieth
century, including a bottle fragment from the Owens Bottling Company made in 1937, and a Wildroot
hair tonic bottle dating to about 1950. All artifacts seemed to be restricted to the rubbish pile. Collected
artifacts include five intact bottles, two fragments of decorated whiteware, one fragment of undecorated
whiteware, one solarized glass fragment, and one milk glass fragment. Site size (30 x 30 m) was

determined by the extent of the surface scatter. Subsurface investigations, in the form of three shovel
tests, did not uncover any cultural materials.
A review of archival maps revealed the presence of a structure near the vicinity of the dump located at
41WM1014 on the TSHD’s 1936 and 1953 Williamson County General Highway Maps. The site is
possibly the result of dumping episodes associated with this structure.
No structural remains or other indications of a domicile exist at the location. The historic debris appears
to date from the early to mid-twentieth century and may be associated with residences near the location
during those decades. Attempts to contact the landowner about the site were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended
41WM1015
This is a prehistoric site located on a Pleistocene terrace, at an elevation of 670 ft amsl. The soils at the
site are Vertisols, mapped as Krum silty clay (Werchan and Coker 1983). The nearest natural extant water
source, Pecan Branch Creek, is 500 m northwest of the site. The site is situated within a recently plowed
field, with some sporadic patches of short pasture grasses. Ground surface visibility was estimated to be
about 90 percent at the time of the survey. The site has been adversely impacted by cultivation and
construction of adjacent Highway 971.
Site 41WM1015 was recorded when chert cobbles were observed on the ground surface. Most of the chert
cobbles were found to be modified. Three chert bifaces and a tested cobble were collected as a
representative sample of site content. A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated to delineate the boundaries
of this site. All shovel tests were culturally sterile. Site size (60 x 180 m ) was determined by the extent of
the surface scatter (Figure 10).
The site appears to have functioned primarily as a lithic procurement area. The site lacks stratigraphic
integrity and has been adversely impacted by cultivation and road construction, it is unlikely that further
investigations would contribute to our understanding of the prehistory of the area. In the opinion of the
Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No
further work is recommended.
41WM1016
This is a surface scatter of prehistoric lithics located on a Pleistocene terrace approximately 500 m
southwest of Berry Creek. Soils at the location belong to the Krum series (Werchan and Coker 1983).

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Vegetation at the time of the survey consisted of sparse short pasture grasses, which afforded a surface
visibility estimated at between 50 and 70 percent.
The site was recorded when prehistoric artifacts were seen on the ground surface. Materials observed at
the location consisted primarily of tested cobbles, bifaces, and large flakes. A total of 87 shovel tests were
placed on the site, 7 of which were culturally positive to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs. Material collected
at the site includes eight pieces of unmodified debitage, one core, nine utilized flakes, three gravers, four
core tools, and four bifaces. Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site covers the entire width of
the proposed ROW for a distance of about 600 m (Figure 11).
It is likely that the site represents a continuation of site 41WM1013, described above, being separated by
County Road 152. Because of the shallow nature of the site, it is unlikely that in situ cultural deposits
remain. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility
or for designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41WM1017
This site consists of a surface scatter of historic artifacts situated on a Holocene terrace about 300 m north
of Brushy Creek. The site’s elevation is approximately 620 ft amsl. Soils at the location are Mollisols
belonging to the Oakalla series (Werchan and Coker 1983). Vegetation at the time of the survey consisted
of short pasture grasses, which afforded very limited surface visibility.
The site was located by surface inspection. Historic materials observed on the surface included vessel
glass fragments and historic ceramics. Collected surficial artifacts include 1 piece of golden-yellow
glazed vessel glass, 1 piece of cobalt vessel glass, 3 sherds of undecorated whiteware, and 2 sherds of
flow blue decorated whiteware. A total of 16 shovel tests were placed to delineate site boundaries (Figure
12). Two shovel tests were positive for cultural materials, yielding 27 glass fragments (clear, amber, and
jadite), 1 screw-top glass bottle neck, 1 intact screw-top glass bottle, 2 pieces of whiteware, and 12 metal
fragments from depths of less than 20 cmbs. The artifacts were found in an arc measuring less than 15 m
in diameter. A sample of the collected historic artifacts is shown in Figure 13.
There are three structures shown in this vicinity on the 1928 USGS Round Rock 30-minute topographic
quadrangle. One structure is shown on the 1953 TSHD Williamson County General Highway Map. The
current landowner was unaware of the earlier occupations on the property, but stated that her family had
acquired the tract in 1979 from Mrs. T.M. Juvenal.
In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site does not possess research potential and should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41WM1018
This site consists of a surface scatter of prehistoric and historic artifacts located on a Cretaceous-aged
upland landform overlooking Mankins Branch Creek. Elevation at the site nucleus is 755 ft. The soils are

Mollisols, mapped as Austin and Doss silty clays, respectively (Werchan and Coker 1983). The southern
portion of the site is vegetated with pasture grasses, affording surface visibility of about 65 percent. The
northern portion of the site has been denuded of soil from land clearing and subsequent erosion, and may
also have been affected by the construction of County Road 104.
The site was discovered through surface examination. Nineteen shovel tests were excavated to investigate
the subsurface potential of the site. Of these, only two were culturally positive to a maximum depth of
5 cmbs, containing one glass fragment and one piece of lithic debitage. The surface artifact scatter of both
site components covers an area measuring approximately 70 x 220 m (Figure 14).
The site lacks stratigraphic integrity and has been adversely affected by land clearing and erosion. It is
unlikely that additional investigations would contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory. In
the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41WM1019
This is a shallow subsurface accumulation of prehistoric and historic artifacts located on a Cretaceous
upland landform about 10 m south of Mankins Branch. Soils at the location are Vertisols mapped as
Houston Black clay (Werchan and Coker 1983). The elevation of the site is about 700 ft amsl. The
vegetation at the time of the survey included mesquite, cacti, and short pasture grasses. Adverse impacts
include land clearing and erosion.
The site was discovered by shovel testing. A total of 15 shovel tests were placed across the site, 8 of
which contained cultural materials. Prehistoric artifacts consist of 10 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage.
Historic materials consist of 4 square nails, 1 round nail, 5 pieces of unidentifiable metal, 1 piece of
solarized glass, 4 pieces of green-tinted glass, and 1 piece of amber glass. All artifacts were found at
depths of less than 40 cmbs, with the majority of the materials originating from the upper 10 cmbs. Both
prehistoric and historic site components were found in an area measuring about 70 x 130 m (Figure 15).
The prehistoric component can be classified as a location. It lacks stratigraphic integrity. In the opinion of
the Principal Investigator, it should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. The
historic materials are probably associated with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century homestead. A
structure is shown in this vicinity on the 1928 USGS Round Rock 30-minute topographic quadrangle. No
house is visible on TSHD’s 1936 Williamson County General Highway Map, implying the structure had
been destroyed or removed by that date. According to the landowner, the historic artifact scatter at
41WM1019 is associated with the homestead of Mr. and Mrs. William Ericson. The Ericsons were of
Swedish decent. The landowner also stated that a capped well (located outside the SH 130 ROW) is all
that remains of the Ericson residence. The historic component is not considered eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or for designation as a SAL.

41WM1020
This is a prehistoric site located on a Pleistocene terrace 600 m west of Berry Creek. Elevation at the
site’s nucleus is approximately 740 ft amsl. The soils that developed at the location are Mollisols, mapped
as Krum silty clay (Werchan and Coker 1983). At the time of the survey the location had recently been
plowed; while this afforded excellent surface visibility, cultivation has likely had an adverse effect on the
site. Additionally, activities associated with a nearby recreational vehicle park may have impacted the
site.
The site was located through visual surface examination. The entire area is littered with tested cobbles,
cores, bifaces, utilized flakes, and debitage in various stages of reduction. No surficial artifacts were
collected. Ten shovel tests were placed on the site in order to investigate the subsurface potential. All 10
shovel tests were culturally sterile. The site’s size, based on the extent of the scatter, is approximately
90 x 100 m (Figure 16).
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. However, it lacks stratigraphic integrity,
cultural features, and diagnostic artifacts. Additional investigations are not likely to contribute to our
understanding of the prehistoric development of the area. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the
site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41WM1021
This prehistoric site is situated on a Pleistocene alluvial terrace 600 m west of Berry Creek. The elevation
of the site is approximately 670 ft amsl. The soils that developed on the terrace are Mollisols belonging to
the Krum series (Werchan and Coker 1983). At the time of the survey, the site was covered in short turf
and pasture grasses, and ground surface visibility was poor to moderate. Adverse impacts to the site
include erosion and highway and residential construction.
The site was located by subsurface shovel testing. A total of 67 shovel tests were excavated at 30-m
intervals across the site. Of these, 36 were culturally positive for prehistoric artifacts, defining an area
measuring 180 x 500 m (Figure 17). Cultural materials recovered from shovel testing consist of 144
pieces of unmodified debitage, 7 utilized flakes, 1 utilized tested cobble, 1 core tool, 1 undiagnostic
projectile point fragment, 1 piece of clear glass, thermally altered rocks, charcoal, and bone fragments.
All of these materials were encountered at depths of less than 30 cmbs, with the majority (90 percent)
being found less than 20 cmbs.
The site probably represents a lithic procurement area where additional activities, including camping,
occurred. Because of the shallow nature of the site and the amount of disturbance from highway and
residential construction, it is unlikely that in situ cultural deposits remain. In the opinion of the Principal
Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further
work is recommended.

41WM1022
This site consists of a surface scatter of prehistoric lithic materials located on a Pleistocene terrace in at an
elevation of 675 ft amsl. An unnamed intermittent drainage lies 30 m west of the site. The closest major
drainage, Cottonwood Creek, is 1.2 miles northeast of the site. The soils at the site are Mollisols, mapped
as Krum silty clays (Werchan and Coker 1983). The site lies within a recently plowed field, devoid of
vegetation, and affording excellent surface visibility. The land has undergone severe erosion and is
traversed by several erosional drainages.
The site was recorded when prehistoric lithic materials were observed on the ground surface. Observed
surficial artifacts include modified flakes and unmodified lithic debitage. Collected surficial artifacts
include two early stage bifaces (Figure 18). Ten shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site; all were
culturally negative. Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site’s size is estimated to be 30 x 120 m
(Figure 19).
The site was probably a lithic procurement area where some early stage tool production took place. It
lacks cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, and does not possess stratigraphic integrity. Further research is
unlikely to contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistoric development. In the opinion of the
Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended.
41WM1023
This prehistoric site is located on a T1 terrace extending approximately 50–100 m south of the San
Gabriel River. Soils at the location are Mollisols belonging to the Oakalla series (Werchan and Coker
1983). The site’s elevation is approximately 700 ft amsl. At the time of the survey, the vegetation at the
site consisted primarily of immature mesquite, cedar, and pasture grasses, resulting in poor ground
surface visibility. During the past, the site area has been under cultivation, which may have had an
adverse effect on shallow cultural deposits.
The site was located by shovel testing and mechanical trenching. Seven shovel tests were excavated at the
location; three were culturally positive, producing a total of five pieces of unmodified lithic debitage from
depths of 30–40 cmbs. A sketch map of the site is provided on Figure 20, while trenching at the site is
shown on Figure 21.
Four backhoe trenches, designated Trenches T-37-1 through T-37-4, were dug at the location (see Figure
20). Prehistoric artifacts were encountered in three of the trenches, T-37-2, T-37-3, and T-37-4. The
profile observed in Trench T-37-2 consisted of dark grayish brown clayey Ap and Ak horizons extending
to about 80 cmbs, where they contacted a 60-cm-thick gravel deposit. One piece of modified debitage and
Rabdotus shells were uncovered at the top of the gravel bed. The gravel was underlain by a yellowish
brown clayey paleosol, which extended to about 220 cmbs where it contacted another gravel bed. A single
piece of unmodified debitage was recovered from the paleosol at a depth of about 170 cmbs.

5: Site Descriptions

The profile observed in Trench T-37-3 consisted of dark grayish brown clay Ap and Ak horizons
extending to a depth of 30 cmbs where they contacted yellowish brown silty clay Bk horizons. The trench
was excavated to a depth of 230 cmbs. A single second chip was found in the Bk2 horizon at a depth of
100 cmbs, and a core was recovered from the Bk3 horizon at a depth of 230 cmbs.
Trench T-37-4 was excavated to a depth of 250 cmbs. The Ap and Ak horizons extended to about
80 cmbs. The underlying Bk horizons yielded two pieces of unmodified lithic debitage from a depth of
about 220 cmbs.
The deeply buried nature of this component implied in situ cultural materials exist and warranted further
archaeological investigations to determine eligibility for listing in the NRHP or SAL designation. Should
proposed construction preclude avoidance/preservation, it was recommended that a program of
archaeological testing be implemented for the site.
41WM1024
This prehistoric site is located on the backslope of a north-trending ridge about 300 m south of the San
Gabriel River. The site’s elevation is approximately 650 ft amsl. This upland landform was formed during
the Cretaceous period. Soils that developed on it are Vertisols, mapped as Ferris-Heiden clays (Werchan
and Coker 1983).
At the time of the survey, the site was vegetated with several varieties of pasture grasses, scrub trees, and
various cacti. Ground surface visibility was very low, estimated at less than 10 percent. Natural impacts
include erosion; artificial impacts include cultivation and, more recently, cattle grazing.
The site was located by shovel testing. A total of five shovel tests were excavated to delineate this site.
Three positive shovel tests yielded 10 pieces of unmodified and 1 piece of modified lithic debitage to a
maximum depth of 20 cmbs. Based on the results of the shovel testing, the site size is estimated to be
about 35 m in diameter (Figure 22).
The site can only be interpreted as a location. It lacks stratigraphic integrity and does not contain
diagnostic artifacts, subsistence data, or cultural features. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator,
41WM1024 should not be considered a candidate for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No
further work is recommended.
41WM1025
This site consists of a historic artifact scatter located on a Cretaceous upland landform, 800 m east of an
unnamed drainage of the San Gabriel River at an approximate elevation of 790 ft amsl. The soils are
Mollisols, mapped as Austin silty clays (Werchan and Coker 1983). The site is located in a recently
plowed field with 100 percent visibility. At the time of the cultural resources survey, vegetation consisted
of johnsongrass and hay. Natural impacts include erosion and bioturbation, while artificial impacts
include agricultural activities, such as plowing.

5: Site Descriptions

The site was initially identified because of the presence of a surficial historic artifact scatter. The extent of
the artifact scatter was used to determine the site’s horizontal dimensions. Approximate site size is about
75 m in diameter (Figure 23). The subsurface potential of the site was investigated with three shovel tests,
all of which were culturally sterile. Cultural material found on the surface included 23 ceramic sherds, 27
pieces of container glass (solarized manganese, cobalt blue, amber, aqua, dark brown, and clear), 2 metal
fragments, a serving spoon, a lock, and 4 pieces of flat window glass. Examples of the artifacts are shown
on Figures 24 through 27. One of the ceramic sherds is green transferware with a Chinoserie scene (see
Figure 24f). It was manufactured between 1830 and 1850. Another fragment is green and brown banded
annularware (Figure 24d) manufactured between 1815 and 1860 (Stelle 2001). The solarized glass can be
roughly dated to 1890–1920.
A review of archival maps revealed the presence of a structure located in the vicinity of the site on the
1936 and 1953 TSHD Williamson County General Highway Maps. Attempts to contact the landowner
regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended.
41WM1026
This is a shallow accumulation of prehistoric artifacts unearthed during the mechanical trenching (Trench
T-118-1) south of Brushy Creek (Figure 28). The site is situated on T2 terrace deposits. Soils at the
location are Mollisols mapped as belonging to the Queeny series (Werchan and Coker 1983). Vegetation
at the site consists of scattered hardwoods, cedar, native grasses, and forbs. The site’s elevation is
approximately 620 ft amsl.
Artifacts observed in T-118-1 consisted of two thermally discolored limestone cobbles and a chert core.
These materials were found in the Ak horizon at a depth of approximately 30 cmbs. The trench was
excavated to a depth of 220 cm, where limestone bedrock was encountered. Underlying the Ak horizon
was a 40-cm-thick Bk horizon, which extended to 160 cmbs, where it contacted a 60-cm-thick gravel
deposit. This rested on the bedrock. No additional cultural materials were found in the trench.
In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the shallow nature of the site precludes in situ deposits being
present. It is unlikely that additional work at the site would contribute to our understanding of the
prehistory of the area. The site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.

site. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as Vertisols, belonging to the Houston Black clay series
(Werchan and Coker 1983). Houston Black soils are taxonomically classified as Udic Haplusterts, which
are formed on Cretaceous uplands, under prairie vegetation in calcareous clays and marls.
The site occupies several vacant house lots surrounded by plowed fields (Figure 29). Because of the lack
of vegetation at the time of survey, ground surface visibility was between 90 and 100 percent. Adverse
impacts to the site may include the construction of adjacent County Road 102, plowing in the northern
portion of the site, and possibly leveling and clearing in the southern portion of the site, in the area of the
vacant house lots.
The southern portion of the site was first recorded when artifacts were encountered during the pedestrian
survey of the SH 130 ROW (Hales and McMurtrie 2002). The site was recorded as a surficial scatter of
prehistoric lithic artifacts, consisting of flaked cobbles and unmodified debitage. No surface artifacts were
collected. Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 55 cmbs; all were negative.
Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the portion of the site within the ROW measured 60 x 100 m
(Figure 30).
When the site was initially recorded, access had not been granted for the adjacent property to the north.
Once access was granted in December 2002, the survey was completed and a continuation of site
41WM1046 was observed. The entire parcel appeared to contain prehistoric artifacts, including biface
fragments, scrapers, tested cobbles, cores, and unmodified debitage consistent with lithic procurement and
initial tool production. The surface component of the site, with its abundant modified cobbles, cores, and
debitage, appears to reflect repeated visits by people seeking to secure and produce stone tools. However,
the absence of finished tools suggests most of these visits were temporary and final tool production
occurred elsewhere. A total of 10 additional shovel tests were excavated at 30-m intervals in order to
define the limits of the site within the ROW. All shovel tests were culturally sterile to a maximum depth
of 30 cmbs. Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site size was revised to be approximately
100 x 260 m.
Site 41WM1046 has an extremely low research potential. The site lacks contextual integrity in the form
of buried cultural deposits, features, time-diagnostic artifacts, and subsistence remains, and appears to
have been impacted detrimentally by agricultural-related activities. It is unlikely that additional work at
the site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory. It is, therefore, the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation.
41WM1064
This site is an extant historic house located on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform at an elevation of
780 ft amsl (Figure 31). An unnamed tributary to Cottonwood Creek is located immediately south of the
site. Soils in the vicinity of the site are Vertisols mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan and Coker
1983). Houston Black soils are taxonomically classified as Udic Haplusterts, which are deep, moderately
drained soils formed on uplands from calcareous clays and marls of Cretaceous age.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

The site occupies cattle pasture vegetated with sparse mixed grasses affording ground surface visibility of
approximately 80 percent. The site may have been adversely impacted by agricultural activities and
weathering.
Architecturally, the building is a two-room house measuring 24 by 12 ft, with board-and-batten
construction, a corrugated metal roof, and an extant brick chimney in the center (Figure 32). The house
rests upon concrete foundation piers. The interior flooring is raised approximately 2 ft off the ground and
is constructed of wooden planks and wire nails. A nearby building complex (160 m east of the SH 130
ROW) may be associated with the house. An intensive surface inspection revealed a single windowpane
glass fragment approximately 10 ft south of the structure (not collected). No other artifacts or features
were observed in the vicinity of the building. Four shovel tests were excavated in cardinal directions from
the structure; all were culturally sterile (Figure 33). Because of the inundated nature of the ground at the
time of survey, no other shovel tests were excavated.
Analysis of historic map data revealed the presence of a possible structure at this location beginning on
the 1936 TSHD Williamson County General Highway Map. The structure is still present on the 1953
version of the same, and the 1982 USGS 7.5-minute Georgetown topographic quadrangle. This suggests
an early- to mid-twentieth-century time frame for the house.
This site was evaluated and determined not eligible during a Historic Buildings Survey prior to the
commencement of the cultural resources survey (Adams and Foster 2001). Because of the lack of
architectural significance or historic artifacts associated with the house, it is unlikely that further research
at this site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s history. It is, therefore, the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the site is ineligible for NRHP listing or designation as a SAL. No further work
is recommended.
41WM1132
This site is the previously recorded remains of two historic farmsteads situated on a toeslope of a low
ridge overlooking the headwaters of Channel Creek 200 m to the southwest. The site is located at an
elevation of 760 ft. Soils that developed at the location are Vertisols and are mapped as Castephan and
Austin Silty Clays (Werchan and Coker 1983). The site is situated in the Black Prairie, and vegetation on
the site consists of mixed grasses, scattered hackberry, and large mature cottonwoods. At the time of
survey, the area within and surrounding the site was used as cattle pasture.
The farmstead was recorded when two modern metal barns, a fenced farmyard with a sparse surface
scatter, a concrete pad, and two brick-lined wells (Figure 34) were observed. The first well was flush with
the ground and was bricked with “Standard Palmer” bricks dating to as early as 1903. The other well was
brick lined and aboveground and, according to the current landowners, was constructed in the 1950s.
Seven shovel tests were dug within the surface scatter, all of which were negative for cultural materials.
Artifacts observed on the surface dated to the twentieth century and included glass (clear, cobalt, and

milk), ceramics (whiteware, blue transferware, and stoneware), and metal farm implements (bucket
handles, wire nails, and a railroad spike). None of the surface artifacts were collected.
A chain of title revealed an initial transfer of the property to W.F. Sauer in 1908. According to the current
landowners, who purchased the property in 1995, the parcel was formerly the farm of the Sauer family
whose 1950s house was situated in the southeast corner of the site. Only irises and a concrete step were
present at the house site in 1995. A structure is shown at the location of 41WM1132 on the USGS 1928
topographic quadrangle. It is unlikely that additional historic research or field investigations would
contribute to our knowledge of the historic development of the area. In the opinion of the Principal
Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further
work is recommended.

Travis County
41TV1417
This site is a previously recorded prehistoric lithic procurement area and late historic habitation site, with
no structural remains. It is located on an eroded upland landscape immediately north of an unnamed
tributary of Gilleland Creek (Figure 35). Soils at the location are mapped as belonging to the Heiden and
Ferris-Heiden series (Werchan et al. 1974). Vegetation at the site at the time of the current survey
consisted of sparse grasses. The ground surface visibility was 60 to 80 percent. Elevation of the site is
approximately 560 ft amsl.
Site 41TV1417 was originally recorded in 1988 as a historic artifact scatter (TARL site forms). At that
time, a local resident informed the survey crew of two tenant houses that had once stood on the property.
The current owner of the property also informed the crew that the structures were not present when she
acquired the property in 1945. The site was then revisited by PBS&J in 2001 and again in 2003. During
both visits, an artifact scatter consisting of lithic debitage and early-twentieth-century refuse was observed
along an intermittent drainage. Sheet erosion, cattle movement, and agriculture were adverse impacts to
the integrity of the site.
Ten shovel tests were excavated within the artifact scatter, seven during the 2001 survey and three during
the 2003 survey. None of the excavated shovel tests encountered subsurface cultural material. Surface
artifacts observed included several primary and secondary flakes, less than 10 tested cobbles, and five
irregularly shaped cores and core fragments. Also present on the surface were clear bottle glass
fragments, amethyst glass fragments, historic ceramics, a screw-top Vaseline bottle, machinemade bricks,
and metal fragments. None of the surface artifacts were collected. The total site size measures about
140 x 200 m (Figure 36).
Because of the absence of time-diagnostic artifacts or intact cultural deposits, it is unlikely that additional
work at the site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s history or prehistory. It is, therefore,
the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.

5: Site Descriptions

41TV1893
This previously recorded historic site is situated on gently rolling upland terrain at an elevation of 605 ft
amsl. An unnamed tributary of Gilleland Creek is located about 375 m south of the site. The soils are
Vertisols, mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of survey the site was located
within a recently plowed field with ground surface visibility of 100 percent. The site appears to have been
destroyed by the construction of a power substation (Figure 37).
In 1999, 41TV1893 was recorded as a historic trash scatter of early-twentieth-century origin, measuring
approximately 30 m in diameter. Artifacts found during the initial recordation of the site included
asbestos tile fragments, clear flat glass, bottle glass, purple glass, blue glass, cast iron stove fragments,
stoneware, and a metal door knob.
In 1999, the site was categorized as a historic trash dump with no cultural features present. The site was
not recommended for further testing at that time. The site was revisited during the present survey with the
intention of observing its present condition and eligibility status. The site location was found using a GPS
and the site’s recorded coordinates. However, the site was apparently destroyed by the construction of a
power substation directly on top of it. Attempts to contact the landowner regarding the site were
unsuccessful.
This site has been destroyed by construction of the power substation and does not appear to possess any
significant cultural integrity. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1969
This site consists of a scatter of prehistoric and historic artifacts located on the Holocene-aged floodplain
of Wilbarger Creek and extends onto the adjacent gently sloping Cretaceous-aged uplands. Elevation at
the site nucleus is 620 ft amsl. Two soil types occupy the site. Silty clay, mapped as belonging to the
Trinity series, was found on the floodplain of the creek, while black clay mapped as the Houston series
was observed on the slope of the adjacent landform (Werchan et al. 1974).
At the time of the survey, vegetation at the site consisted of various hardwoods, with an understory of
scrub brush, cacti, and various grasses and weeds along the southern portion of the site next to Wilbarger
Creek. Ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent. The northern portion of the site occupies a
recently plowed field with little to no vegetation. Ground surface visibility in this portion of the site was
100 percent. Natural impacts include erosion and bioturbation. Agricultural activities such as cultivation
are the primary source of artificial impact observed at the site.
The site was recorded when prehistoric and historic artifacts were observed on the ground surface. The
prehistoric artifacts consisted of two pieces of lithic debitage. The historic artifacts included two
whiteware sherds, one porcelain sherd, single fragments of milk glass, solarized glass, and clear glass, and

three pieces of green glass. The prehistoric component can only be interpreted as a location. The historic
artifacts are likely associated with the residences shown to have been at the location in the 1930s and
1950s. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated to define the boundaries of the site; all were culturally
negative. The boundaries of both site components, as delineated by the extent of the surface scatter, are
estimated to be 90 x 120 m (Figure 38).
No structure is shown at the location on the USGS 1910 Austin, Texas, 30-minute topographic
quadrangle. A structure is shown at the location on a 1930 Travis County topographic map, and two
structures are shown at the location on 1936 and 1952 TSHD Travis County General Highway Maps.
It is unlikely that additional historic research at this site would contribute to our understanding of the
historic development of the area. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1970
This is a historic house site location located on nearly level upland terrain about 15 m south of Wilbarger
Creek. The elevation at the site is approximately 610 ft amsl. Soils at the location are Vertisols mapped as
Houston Black clay (Werchan et al. 1974). Vegetation at the time of the survey consisted of short pasture
grass and hackberry trees. A pomegranate tree was also present at the site.
The site was located by visual inspection. Surface artifacts observed at the location included decorated
(hand painted and transfer print) and undecorated whiteware, stoneware, and vessel glass (solarized, clear,
green, blue, brown, and olive). Twenty-three shovel tests were dug (Figure 39). Four of these yielded a
total of three vessel glass fragments and one piece of ceramic from depths of less than 10 cmbs. Figures
40 and 41 shows representative glass and ceramic artifacts. A modern sheet metal barn exists at the
location.
A structure is depicted at the location on the USGS 1910 Austin 30-minute topographic quadrangle. It is
also depicted on the 1928 USGS Round Rock 30-minute topographic quadrangle. It is not shown on any
subsequent historic maps.
There are no extant structures associated with the historic occupations at this site. No cultural features or
subsurface deposits occur. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would contribute to
understanding of the historic developments that occurred in the area. In the opinion of the Principal
Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1971
This site is an extant structure and historic artifact scatter located on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform
at an elevation of approximately 610 ft amsl. The site is 800 m from the intersection of Pflugerville Road
(Pecan Street) and Weiss Road, east of Pflugerville. An intermittent drainage of Gilleland Creek is 360 m
to the south. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as belonging to the Houston Black clay series

(Werchan et al. 1974). The vegetation, including grasses, various tree species, and scrub brush, rendered
ground surface visibility of approximately 60 percent.
Site 41TV1971 was discovered by surface observation. Four shovel tests conducted did not encounter
subsurface cultural materials. Artifacts observed on the site’s surface included green and clear bottle
glass, clear flat glass, whiteware, screw-top bottles, and miscellaneous metal fragments, including wire
nails. The artifacts were scattered over an area measuring 15 x 20 m. No diagnostic artifacts or subsurface
component were noted and no materials were collected. A sketch map of the site is provided as Figure 42.
Architecturally, the structure appears to be a side-gabled board-and-batten dwelling dating roughly to the
turn of the twentieth century (Figure 43). There is a centrally placed window on the south end of the
structure and a low porch on the eastern side. Recent modifications include the addition of corrugated
metal siding. This dwelling is probably part of an old farmstead associated with the Pflugerville
community. Analysis of historic map data revealed several structures in the vicinity of 41TV1971 on the
1936, 1941, 1946, and 1952 Travis County Highway Maps, as well as the 1930 Travis County
topographic and road map.
Attempts to contact the landowner for information regarding the site were unsuccessful. It is unlikely that
additional work at the site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s history. It is the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a
SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1972
This is a historic site located on a gently sloping ridge, about 250 m west of an unnamed tributary to
Wilbarger Creek. The elevation at the site is approximately 610 ft amsl. Soils at the location are Vertisols
mapped as Heiden clay (Werchan and Coker 1983). Vegetation at the site consisted of short pasture
grasses and buffalo gourd vines. Ground surface visibility was estimated to be between 30 and 70 percent.
Adverse impacts to the site are primarily related to past cultivation and ranching activities.
Site 41TV1972 was identified by the discovery of a 5-x-5-m concrete foundation, a large cylindrical
metal well/cistern, and a semi-intact tin roof. The metal cistern sits approximately 1 m above ground
surface and is approximately 2 m in diameter. There is a 15-x-10-m barbed wire fence surrounding the
cistern/well. A sparse surface scatter including three pieces of nondescript whiteware and two pieces of
clear flat glass was observed but not collected. Six shovel tests were placed adjacent to the cultural
features within the site. All shovel tests were culturally sterile. Site boundaries were determined according
to the extent of the existing cultural features (Figure 44).
Deed research shows that William Hill and family owned the parcel in 1899. By 1940 the parcel was
deeded to Mary Field who sold the property to Lee Johnston in 1941. Since 1959, the parcel has been
deeded to Charles Peck et al. and remained deeded to the Peck family at the time of survey. A review of

archival maps revealed that no structure is located within the vicinity of 41TV1972 on Texas State
Highway Maps of Travis County dated between 1910 and 1952.
The site appears to be the remains of an outbuilding constructed for livestock. In the opinion of the
Principal Investigator, the site does not possess research potential and should not be considered for NRHP
eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1973
This site is a historic house site located on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform, at an elevation of 610 ft.
There is an intermittent drainage 300 m east of the site, though the closest major drainage, Wilbarger
Creek, is 1.9 km to the northeast. Soils at the site are Vertisols, mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan
et al. 1974).
The site is located in a recently plowed field with nearly 100 percent surface visibility. Adverse impacts
to the site in addition to cultivation include the construction of a berm (15 m in length) and a large
subsurface disturbance from possible bulldozing or scraping of the area.
The site was first identified by the observation of concrete, brick fragments, and tiles. These remains may
be associated with recently demolished structures as evidenced by the large area of ground disturbance
and artificial berm just north of the disturbance, roughly 25 m in diameter. Adjacent to the disturbed area
is a brick-and-plaster-lined cistern/well and a windmill. Artifacts observed on the surface include plastic
bottles, a foam rubber ball, clear flat glass, and undecorated whiteware sherds. Twelve shovel tests were
placed in the vicinity of the historic remains (Figure 45). All shovel tests were culturally sterile. Site
diameter was therefore determined by the extent of the surface scatter in combination with the cultural
features. Approximate site size is 40 x 100 m.
A structure is depicted at this location on the USGS 1910 Austin, Texas, 30-minute topographic
quadrangle. It is also shown on later historic maps through 1952. Attempts to contact the landowner
regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL.
41TV1974
This is a historic house site located on a cultivated hilltop overlooking Gilleland Creek 300 m to the
southwest. Soils in the vicinity are mapped as belonging to the Houston Black clay series (Werchan et al.
1974). Vegetation is absent because of recent plowing. Adverse impacts include agricultural activities,
fence construction, surface erosion, and excavation of a cistern. The ground surface visibility was
100 percent. Elevation of the site is approximately 570 ft amsl.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Site 41TV1974 was discovered by surface inspection. Twelve shovel tests conducted during the current
investigation did not encounter subsurface cultural deposits (Figure 46). Collected artifacts include
ceramics, glass, and miscellaneous items. Ceramics collected for analysis include black and brown
transferware, hand-painted sprig pattern, blue shelled edgeware, undecorated whiteware, and whiteware
with partial British makers’ marks (Figure 47). Glass observed at the site includes solarized, cobalt, clear
bottle, and depression glass, although only solarized glass was collected. Collected miscellaneous items
include a “Frozen Charlotte” porcelain doll head, a marble, and buttons made of glass, shell, and ceramic
(Figure 48). The surficial scatter extends 100 x 150 m. A historic brick-lined cistern is located in the
center of the field. The cistern is filled with historic debris.
Many of the ceramics present at 41TV1974 represent a mid-to-late-nineteenth-century production range.
Black and brown transferware was made in England and has a production range of 1829–1850. Handpainted whiteware with a sprig pattern was popular until the late 1860s. Shell-edged ware was produced
in the early 1920s with an end date of 1897 (Stelle 2001).
Glass represented at the site includes solarized glass that has a mean date of 1890–1920. Depression glass
had a major production range of 1920–1940 (Stelle 2001).
Historic maps, including the USGS 1896 Austin, Texas, 30-minute topographic quadrangle, the TSHD
1936, 1941, 1946, and 1952 Travis County Highway Maps, as well as the 1930 Travis County
topographic and road map, were used to identify the time period of the house. A structure present in the
immediate vicinity of 41TV1974 is on all of the maps. It is possible that the structure could have been
constructed prior to 1896. The production range of some of the artifacts as well as the structures present
on maps from at least 1896 to 1952 suggests an occupation period at 41TV1974 from at least the late
nineteenth century (perhaps earlier) to the mid-twentieth century.
A letter was addressed to the owner of the parcel by the Principal Investigator, requesting information
regarding the history of the property. A legal representative responded via telephone and informed the
Principal Investigator that the landowner had been in possession of the property only since the early
1970s and had no knowledge of the occupations at the location prior to that date.
This site does not appear to have an intact subsurface component or, with the exception of the cistern,
standing architectural features. A very limited amount of artifacts was retrieved from the surface
inspection. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41TV1974 should not be considered for
NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. No further work is recommended.
41TV1975
This site is a historic farmstead located on the first and second alluvial terraces above an unnamed
tributary of Brushy Creek. Elevation at the site nucleus is 700 ft amsl. Brushy Creek is approximately
200 m south of the site. The soils are Vertisols, mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan and Coker
1983). The northern portion of the site consists of pasture grasses with 90 percent visibility, while the

southern portion of the site consists of overgrown weeds, reeds, and various tall grasses affording a
minimal 20 percent visibility. Artificial impacts include ranching and agricultural activities.
Site 41TV1975 is identified by the presence of a windmill and a brick-lined well/cistern. No artifacts
were observed on the ground surface. Fourteen shovel tests, three of which were culturally positive,
revealed one shard of green-tint bottle glass, six round nails, one wire fragment, one piece of
unidentifiable bone, and one sherd each of stoneware and undecorated whiteware (Figure 49). All artifacts
were recovered from a maximum depth of 25 cmbs.
Multiple structures are shown at this location on the USGS 1910 Austin 30-minute topographic
quadrangle. Two structures are depicted on the 1936 Travis County Highway Map, and a single structure
is shown on the 1952 Travis County Highway Map. Attempts to contact the landowner for additional
information regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
The site appears to date from the early to mid-twentieth century. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1976
This is farmstead location situated on the lower slope of a Cretaceous-aged upland ridge about 140 m
southwest of an unnamed tributary to Wilbarger Creek. The site’s elevation is approximately 720 ft amsl.
At the time of the survey, the site was in a recently plowed field.
The site was recorded when historic artifacts were observed in a recently cultivated field. Materials
collected from the surface include a horseshoe, a metal stake, 2 fragments of a metal lock, 2 square nails,
a spring hinge, 1 drill bit, 4 unidentifiable brick fragments, 5 whiteware sherds, 2 sherds of stoneware, 1
amber-colored glass bottle, and 19 vessel glass fragments (3 solarized, 3 milk glass, 8 clear, 1 yellow tint,
2 green tint, and 2 aqua). Seven shovel tests were excavated at the site, only one of which was culturally
positive, yielding 1 round nail and 1 wire fragment from a depth of 10–20 cmbs. Based on the extent of
the surface scatter, the site covers an area measuring 65 x 100 m (Figure 50). Examples of historic
artifacts at the site are shown on Figures 51, 52, and 53.
Two structures are shown at the location on the 1910 USGS 30-minute Austin topographic quadrangle.
The structures are also shown on additional historic maps as late as 1952.
A letter was addressed to the landowner by the Principal Investigator requesting historical background
information for the property harboring site 41TV1976. The landowner responded that he had no
knowledge of the historic occupations that had occurred on this property.
The structural remains appear to have been removed or destroyed after 1952, and no cultural features are
associated with the occupations at the site. The remaining artifacts present at the location have been
disturbed by continued cultivation. It is unlikely that additional work at the site would contribute to our

understanding of the historic development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1977
This site is a historic house located along an alluvial terrace immediately north of an unnamed drainage of
Gilleland Creek. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as belonging to the Trinity series (Werchan et
al. 1974). Vegetation includes immature deciduous trees and various grasses. The ground surface
visibility was 20 to 50 percent. Adverse impacts include water erosion and flood deposits. Elevation of
the site is approximately 530 ft amsl.
Site 41TV1977 was discovered by surface inspection. Twelve shovel tests excavated at the site did not
encounter any subsurface cultural material (Figure 54). Artifacts observed on the surface included glass
(windowpane, bottle, and vessel fragments), ceramics (whiteware, creamware, ironstone, and stoneware),
a spoon fragment, and a shell button, a sample of which was collected (Figures 55 and 56). In addition to
the artifacts, a brick-lined cistern is located north of the center of the site (Figure 57). The site size
measures 100 x 140 m.
The artifacts recovered from the site imply occupations dating from the mid-to-late nineteenth to the midtwentieth centuries. The earliest dates are attributable to the presence of transferware, which includes blue
transferware, which dates to between 1820 and 1860 (Stelle 2001) and red transferware dating from 1829
to 1850 (Majewski and O’Brien 1987). Salt-glazed stoneware with cobalt star stenciled and stamped
marks using a coloring oxide such as cobalt are most common on late salt-glazed vessels and Bristolglazed pots likely produced in Elmendorf at the Saenger Clay Works/Star Potteries circa 1900–1910
(Greer 1981).
The solarized glass can be roughly dated to between 1890 and 1920. One of the medicine bottles was
marked “NYAL Quality” indicating it was produced by the Illinois Glass Company between 1915 and
1929. The pink glass fragment is Depression glass dating from about 1920 to 1940.
A letter was addressed to the landowner by the Principal Investigator requesting historical background
information for the property. The landowner responded that he was not aware of any historic occupations
that had occurred there.
It is unlikely that additional work at the site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s historical
development. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for
NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. No further work is recommended.
41TV1978
This is a historic house site located on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform at an elevation of
approximately 755 ft amsl. An unnamed drainage of Wilbarger Creek is located 550 m to the south. Soils
in the vicinity of the site are mapped as belonging to the Houston Black clay series (Werchan et al. 1974).

5: Site Descriptions

The site is adjacent to an agricultural field. Vegetation includes grasses, forbs, and mature oak trees. The
ground surface visibility was less than 10 percent.
Site 41TV1978 was discovered by surface inspection. Observed surficial artifacts included bricks, screwtop bottles, corrugated tin, medicine bottles (brown and clear), pink glass, windowpane glass, and wire
nails, none of which were collected. Fifteen shovel tests excavated at the site failed to yield cultural
deposits. The site size was estimated to be 160 x 60 m (Figure 58). In addition to the artifacts, several
earthen berms, limestone blocks (foundation piers), and a brick-lined cistern are present (Figure 59). The
cistern is bottle shaped, a typical design for cisterns built during the late nineteenth century.
Several structures are depicted in the vicinity of this site on the USGS 1910 Austin 30-minute
topographic quadrangle and later maps, including the 1930 Travis County topographic and road map and
the 1936, 1941, 1946, and 1952 TSHD Travis County General Highway Maps. No structures are depicted
on the 1987 Pflugerville East USGS topographic map. It appears that the site was occupied sometime
between the end of the nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century. This site may be remnants of a
farmstead that was part of the Pflugerville community. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain
additional information regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
It is unlikely that additional work at the site would contribute to our understanding of the area’s history. It
is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
SAL designation. No further work is recommended.
41TV2158
This site is a prehistoric lithic scatter situated on the toeslope of a hill named Bald Nob, overlooking a
tributary of Gilleland Creek 250 m to the southeast. The site is located at an elevation of approximately
620 ft amsl. Vegetation present at the time of survey included mixed grasses and weeds. Prior to the
survey, cedar and oak were cleared from the area on and near the site. Ground visibility ranged from 10 to
100 percent where disturbed. Shovel tests revealed a gray-brown blocky dry clay overlying a sterile clay
subsoil. Soils are mapped as Heiden Clay (Werchan et al. 1974).
The site was initially detected as a surface scatter of lithic artifacts limited to primary and tertiary chert
flakes extending across the entire ROW measuring 300 m north-south by 20 m east-west (Figure 60).
Artifact density was highest in the south-central portion of the site at approximately two artifacts per
square meter. Artifact density tapered off to the north and south on the slopes away from the ridge. No
surface artifacts were collected. Four shovel tests were placed within the ROW/site boundary and were
negative for cultural remains.
Site 41TV2158 can only be classified as a location. It lacks diagnostic prehistoric artifacts and
stratigraphic integrity. It is unlikely that further work would contribute to our understanding of the
prehistoric development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not
be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation.

SEGMENT B SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Travis County
41TV150
This is a previously recorded multicomponent site situated on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform at an
elevation of 520 ft amsl. The soils are mapped as belonging to the Ferris-Heiden series (Werchan et al.
1974). At the time of the survey, vegetation consisted of mesquite, high grasses, and cacti, affording
ground surface visibility of approximately 60 percent. The site has been impacted by erosion and also
may have been affected by past agricultural activities and road construction.
This site was first recorded as the Buddy Pierson site in 1968, and described as a prehistoric quarry
containing projectile points, gougelike tools, blades, bifaces, and choppers (TARL site files). All cultural
materials were found on the ground surface. No subsurface investigations were conducted at the time, and
no recommendations were made concerning the site’s NRHP eligibility or the need for further work.
Site 41TV150 was reported in the initial SH 130 Segment B interim report (Rogers et al. 2002a). The site
was found to contain a historic component as well as the above-described prehistoric component. The
historic component consisted of the remains of a house and nearby barn. Historic artifacts recovered from
the site consist of glass fragments (amber, brown, aqua tint, clear, green, solarized, jadite, milk glass, and
windowglass), one intact glass bottle, ceramics (decorated and undecorated), nails (cut and wire), a coin, a
plastic die, and one shell button. The prehistoric component was limited to three pieces of unmodified
lithic debitage and one biface fragment. Forty-three shovel tests were excavated at the site, of which 16
contained artifacts, most of which were historic. The site size, including both components, was estimated
to be about 50 x 70 m (Figure 61).
A review of historic maps revealed that a structure existed at the location in 1910 (USGS 1910 Austin,
Texas, 30-minute topographic quadrangle). No structure is shown at the location on the 1936 Travis
County Highway Map, suggesting a house had been at the location prior to 1910, but had been destroyed
or removed by 1936. A second structure appears to have been at the location during 1946 when it again
appears on the Travis County Highway Map.
The site size was expanded once access was obtained to survey the land north of Moore Road. The
historical component of the site north of Moore Road was found to contain five historical agriculturalrelated outbuildings made of wooden planks with corrugated metal roofs (Figures 62 and 63). Debris from
farm equipment was scattered around the buildings; however, no domestic residential artifacts were
observed. Seventy shovel tests were excavated to culturally sterile substrate in order to explore the
subsurface component; all were culturally negative.
Among the historic artifacts were several diagnostic items. These include red transferware, manufactured
between 1829 and 1850, and blue transferware, manufactured between 1820 and 1860; Bristol glaze

stoneware, manufactured about 1890; pink and blue banded annularware, manufactured between 1840
and 1900; solarized glass manufactured between 1890 and 1920; a clear glass bottle base made by the
Owens Glass Company in the 1940s; and a 1942 penny (Greer 1981; Stelle 2001) (Figures 64 and 65).
The agricultural buildings may be related to the historical house and barn previously recorded (south of
Moore Road). These structures are in disrepair and do not appear to be architecturally significant. Several
structures are shown in the vicinity on a 1930 Travis County topographic and road map (Travis County
Engineering Department 1932), as well as the 1936, 1941, and 1952 TSHD Travis County Highway
Maps, suggesting one or several houses may have been at this location during the early twentieth century.
The site size was revised to be approximately 300 x 500 m (see Figure 61).
It was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that neither the prehistoric nor the historic components at
site 41TV150 warranted further work, and should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation (Rogers et al. 2002a).
In October 2002, DeVon Wood, a Travis County Historical Cemetery Advocate, contacted PBS&J stating
that cemeteries might be located in or adjacent to the ROW of SH 130 in southeastern Travis County.
Mr. Wood drove with PBS&J personnel, visually identifying an unnamed cemetery located within the
boundaries of archaeological site 41TV150. The cemetery did not have any tombstones. Mr. Wood
indicated that he located the site with the assistance of a long-time resident of the Elroy community.
Based on information given by Mr. Wood, PBS&J archaeologists conducted limited exploratory
mechanical excavation of a suspected historical cemetery located on the edge of a small ridge summit in
the southeastern corner of the ROW on the north side of Moore Road. Representatives of TxDOT and
HDR were present during all 3 days of mechanical excavation (January 3, 21, and 23, 2003), and
Mr. Wood was present on January 21. This portion of 41TV150 contained the collapsed remains of a
small chicken wire and wooden plank fence measuring approximately 2 m square, surrounded by planted
irises (Figure 66). Mechanical scraping revealed a soil discoloration that at first appeared amorphous in
shape. However, at a depth of approximately 100 cm, the soil anomaly appeared roughly rectangular,
measuring approximately 70 cm wide by 230 cm long (Figure 67). It was recorded as Feature 1. Manual
excavation at 140 cmbs exposed the remains of a wooden coffin, and limited removal of a small segment
of the coffin/casket exposed the skeletal remains of an individual. The exposed skeletal remains were
photographed and recorded in situ (Figure 68). The burial was backfilled. Subsequent mechanical
scraping to a depth commensurate with these remains within an area around Feature 1 measuring
approximately 10 m east-west by 30 m north-south revealed no further burials.
TxDOT approved removal of the burial and reinterment in another cemetery. A detailed proposal for the
removal and reinterment was then prepared.
On January 5, 6, 7, and 9, 2004, the burial was excavated. Backhoe scraping removed the overburden
again to the 2003 level. Hand clearing and artifact recovery continued over a 3-day period from January 5

through 7 and final machine excavation below the burial and backfilling on January 9. This work was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3305.
In spite of extensive archival and informant research and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing of people
believing to be potential descendants, the identity of the interred individual could not be determined
during this investigation. In accordance with legal requirements prescribed in Section 711.010(b) of the
Texas Health and Safety Code, TxDOT and PBS&J cooperated in the reinterment of the unidentified
human remains excavated from 41TV150 to Onion Creek Memorial Park, a perpetual care cemetery
located in Austin, Texas. There being no known survivors of the decedent, consent for reinterment was
executed by PBS&J Vice President, Clell Bond. Reburial of all funerary remains was in a plot purchased
by TxDOT, as prescribed in Section 711.010 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Harrell Funeral Home,
directed by Dan Schallau, a licensed mortician, conducted the transportation of the remains from the
PBS&J Environmental Laboratory to Onion Creek Memorial Park. The Memorial Park prepared the grave
and interred the remains after a brief ceremony on September 23, 2004. The orientation of the reburial
retained the original burial pattern from the Moore Road Cemetery (41TV150), along the east-west axis,
head to the west, facing the east (Kalter et al. 2005).
41TV410
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site situated on a Holocene-aged alluvial terrace south of Onion
Creek. The elevation at the location is 400–450 ft amsl. Soils are mapped as belonging to the Lewisville
and Frio series (Werchan et al. 1974). Lewisville soils formed in alluvial sediments. Taxonomically, they
belong to the Mollisol soil order. Frio soils also formed in alluvium. They are younger in age than
Lewisville soils and are confined to an area along Onion Creek. At the time of survey, the site was located
in an overgrown field containing tall grasses and several varieties of hardwoods, and surface visibility
was approximately 50 percent. Adverse impacts to the site include agricultural activities and frequent
flooding and erosion from nearby Onion Creek. A view of the terrain at the site can be seen on Figure 69.
In 1979, 41TV410 was recorded as a prehistoric open campsite consisting of a surface lithic scatter and a
deeply buried component observed in an erosional cut, in which rock-lined hearths (20–40 cm in
thickness), mussel shells, bones, charcoal, and debitage were observed at depths of 60 to 150 cmbs
(TARL site files). The condition at that time was regarded as excellent, and the site was recommended for
further study.
When revisited during the current survey, 39 shovel tests were excavated across the SH 130 ROW (Figure
70). Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs. All of the tests were negative.
According to its placement on topographic maps, only a portion of the site (approximately 50 x 200 m)
appeared to be within the SH 130 ROW. The remainder of the site, including the eroded area where the
deeply buried artifacts were noted in 1979, is outside of the SH 130 ROW.
The portion of site 41TV410 within the SH 130 ROW examined by shovel testing during the pedestrian
survey does not contain time-diagnostic artifacts, features, or other prehistoric materials. However, the

northern edge of the site abuts Onion Creek, where a narrow band of Holocene alluvium exits, in which
soils of the Frio series developed. The alluvial deposits in this area were scheduled to be explored using
mechanical excavation equipment.
The alluvial deposits along Onion Creek were examined between November 10 and 22, 2005. Five
backhoe trenches were excavated in this area. Trenches 1 and 4 were excavated along the lowermost
portion of the alluvial terrace, Trenches 2 and 5 were excavated in the midsection, and Trenches 3, 6, 7,
and 8 were excavated in the upper portion of the terrace. Sediments observed in the trenches were
relatively uniform, and consisted of thick-bedded to massive calcareous silts, silty clay, and sands. Dense
gravels occurred in Trenches 1 and 4.
Sparse cultural materials were observed but not collected in Trenches 1, 3, 4, and 7. Most of these
materials occurred at depths of over 200 cmbs. They consisted of a single utilized flake in Trench 1
(270 cmbs), two flakes in Trench 3 (210 cmbs), mussel shell and charcoal in Trench 4 (300 cmbs), and a
tested cobble in Trench 7 (110 cmbs).
At a meeting to discuss the results of the geoarchaeological investigations between TxDOT ENV and
PBS&J, it was agreed that the lowermost part of the alluvial terrace adjacent to Onion Creek, particularly
the area around Trenches 1 and 4, appeared to contain deeply buried cultural deposits including artifacts,
subsistence remains, and datable carbon. However, insufficient work had been performed to recommend
NRHP eligibility testing. It was therefore decided that a much larger part of the lower terrace would be
mechanically excavated.
The additional mechanical excavations utilized a 345L Trackhoe to excavate an area measuring
approximately 20 x 45 m in size, long axis parallel to Onion Creek, to a depth of approximately 3 m. This
effort resulted in the exposure of one stone-lined hearth with carbon, and a large (25-x-50-cm) limestone
slab at a depth of 3 m. In a telephone conversation with Dr. Lain Ellis of TxDOT ENV, PBS&J was
advised to continue with the mechanical excavations in the remaining unexplored portion of the
lowermost alluvial terrace, to expose the stone-lined hearth, and to excavate the activity area around it.
Manual excavation of the activity area around the hearth produced three pieces of chert debitage, several
burned limestone fragments, and charcoal fragments. No animal bone was observed in situ or during
screening, although mussel shell fragments and Rabdotus shell fragments were encountered. A sample of
charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon dating, and yielded a calibrated 2-sigma date of A.D. 660 to 790,
with the intercept of the radiocarbon age with the calibration curve occurring at A.D. 700 (Beta 213174).
Based on the absence of robust returns from the excavations, it was the recommendation of the Principal
Investigator that no further work was warranted for those portions of site 41TV410 within the originally
surveyed SH 130 ROW. The THC concurred with this recommendation on December 9, 2005. A
complete record of the PBS&J excavations at 41TV410 is provided in Appendix C of this report.

5: Site Descriptions

41TV443
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site. When it was revisited during the current survey, it was
found to have a historic component as well. The site is situated on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform
approximately 328 ft southeast of Onion Creek. The elevation of the site is approximately 490 ft amsl.
Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Ferris-Heiden series (Werchan et al. 1974).
Ferris-Heiden soils occur on nonaggrading upland surfaces of Eocene age. At the time of the survey, the
vegetation at the site consisted of scrub brush, prickly pear cacti, oak and mesquite trees, weeds, and low
grasses. The site has been severely impacted by erosion and construction of SH 71, which transects it
(Figures 71 and 72). The ground surface visibility was approximately 60 percent northeast of the highway
and 20 percent southwest of the highway.
Site 41TV443 was originally recorded in 1979. It was described as a prehistoric quarry containing
scattered flakes and an occasional core, found eroding out of a bluff (TARL site files). It was noted at that
time that the site had been severely impacted by the construction of SH 71, and by the demolition of a
modern house that had been located there. During the current investigation, an intensive surface
inspection was performed, and six shovel tests were excavated in the portion of the site within the SH 130
ROW. Three of these tests were excavated east of SH 71, and three shovel tests were excavated west of
SH 71. Each shovel test was excavated to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs where substratum clay was
encountered. All of the tests were negative. Cultural materials observed on the surface of the western
portion of the site included tested cobbles and lithic debitage as well as historical artifacts (solarized
glass, whiteware fragments, and a scatter of bricks); only a sparse surface scatter of lithic debitage was
observed on the portion of the site east of SH 71. No time-diagnostic prehistoric artifacts, historical
structures, or subsurface components were noted and no materials were collected. The dimensions of the
site within the ROW, including both components, is approximately 120 x 160 m, based on previous and
recent investigations; however, the site extends both northeast and southwest beyond the boundaries of
the SH 130 ROW (Figure 73).
Analysis of historical map data revealed a structure at the location of site 41TV443 on the 1936 and 1946
TSHD Travis County General Highway Maps. The structure does not appear on the earlier USGS 1910
Austin 30-minute quadrangle or the 1930 Travis County topographic and road map. This would suggest
an early-to-mid-twentieth-century time frame for the historic artifacts observed at the site. Attempts to
contact the landowner to obtain additional information regarding the history of the property were
unsuccessful.
The prehistoric component has been interpreted as being a quarry or lithic procurement area. The site
lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that
additional work at the location would increase our understanding of the prehistoric development of the
area. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.

41TV453
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site located in the floodplain of Onion Creek. Soils at the
location have been mapped as belonging to the Lewisville and Frio series (Werchan et al. 1974).
Vegetation includes short mixed grasses to the north and fallow cropland to the south (Figure 74). The
ground surface visibility varied from 0 to 60 percent across the site. The current land use is cattle pasture
and agricultural fields. The site has been severely impacted by the construction of the Onion Creek Bridge
and SH 71, which bisect the site, and by the installation of utility electric and natural gas lines. Elevation
of the site is approximately 440 ft amsl.
Site 41TV453 was originally recorded in 1979 (TARL site files). The site was described as a thin surface
scatter of lithic debitage, cores, and an occasional piece of burned rock found within a plowed field north
of Onion Creek. It likely represents the remains of one or more campsites. The original site form (TARL
site files) states that the site is 50 x 400 m; however, the THC site atlas depicts the site as being
100 x 600 m. The site was not recommended for further work.
The site was revisited during the SH 130 survey. No surface artifacts were visible at the recorded
location. Six shovel tests were excavated there, but all were culturally sterile (Figure 75).
Because of the absence of artifacts and features and the lack of buried cultural deposits, it is unlikely that
additional work at the portion of the site within the SH 130 ROW would contribute to our understanding
of the area’s prehistory/history. Additionally, the construction of SH 71 and the adjacent Onion Creek
Bridge have severely impacted, if not completely destroyed, the portion of the site within the SH 130
ROW. Backhoe trenching, to search for deeply buried intact deposits, was not conducted for these
reasons. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the portion of the site within the ROW should
not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV454
This previously recorded prehistoric site lies within the Holocene floodplain of the Colorado River, about
100 m south of its channel. The elevation at the site is approximately 420 ft amsl. The soils at the location
have been mapped as Bergstrom silty clay (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of survey, the site was
located within a recently plowed field, with ground surface visibility of nearly 100 percent. In addition to
cultivation, the site may have been adversely impacted by the construction of Fallwell Lane, which
parallels the northern boundary of the site.
In 1979, 41TV454 was recorded as an open campsite containing burned rocks, debitage, and mussel shells
(TARL site files). It was recommended for further testing. The site was revisited during the present
survey. Several pieces of unmodified debitage were observed on the ground surface. Two shovel tests
were excavated at the location, but both were culturally negative. Estimated site size within the ROW is
approximately 35 x 100 m (Figure 76). Based on the site files, the main portion of the site is located west
of the SH 130 ROW.

5: Site Descriptions

A single backhoe trench, designated T-354-1, was excavated at the site during the exploratory
geoarchaeological investigations conducted as part of the SH 130 survey. No cultural deposits were found
in the trench, which was excavated to a depth of 260 cm. The soils observed in it conformed with those of
the Bergstrom series.
Site 41TV454 is interpreted as having been a campsite. It has been adversely affected by plowing and
lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that
additional work at the location would increase our understanding of the prehistoric development of the
area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP
eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV455
This previously recorded prehistoric site is located on a low Holocene terrace above the Colorado River,
south of Fallwell Lane. Elevation at site nucleus is 440 ft amsl. The soils are Mollisols, mapped as
belonging to the Lewisville series (Werchan et al. 1974). The site is located in and along a field road that
traversed a recently plowed field. Ground surface visibility was about 90 percent. Adverse impacts
include extensive plowing, land clearing, and erosion.
The site was recorded in 1979 (TARL site files). It was described as a scatter of lithic debitage, burned
rocks, and a few fragments of mussel shell located in a dirt road in a plowed field. The site was
recommended for testing.
Site 41TV455 was revisited with the intention of observing its present condition and eligibility status. The
site was relocated using a GPS and identified by a surface scatter of tested chert gravels, fire-cracked
rocks, and unmodified lithic debitage. Most of the gravels occur within the field road. No surface artifacts
were collected. Subsurface investigations included 33 shovel tests, of which 1 was culturally positive for
one piece of quartzite debitage and one distal projectile point fragment found within the plow zone at 20–
30 cmbs. The site’s size was estimated to be 100 x 120 m (Figure 77).
A backhoe trench, designated T-354-5, was dug in the approximate site location during the exploratory
trenching performed as part of the SH 130 survey. No cultural materials were observed in the trench. The
soil profile consisted of dense carbonate-rich A, Bk, and Ck horizons extending to a depth of over
220 cm. No siliceous gravels were found at any depth in the trench.
This site appears to have been heavily impacted by plowing and may simply represent artifacts that were
mixed with gravel brought in to line a field road. It should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation. No further work is recommended.
41TV456
This is a previously recorded multicomponent site consisting of a prehistoric campsite and historic
homestead. It is located on a terrace about 100 m south of the Colorado River at an elevation of 440 ft

amsl. The soils at the site have been mapped as Bergstrom silty clay loam (Werchan et al. 1974). The site
is located in a cultivated field that had recently been harvested at the time of the survey, affording
excellent ground surface visibility (Figure 78). Adverse impacts to the site include those from cultivation
and possibly from the construction of Fallwell Lane, which parallels the site’s northern boundary
The site was initially recorded in 1979 (TARL site files). At that time lithic debitage, burned rocks,
mussel shells, and bones were found at the location. Two clusters of historic debris containing brick,
ironstone, glass fragments, and square nails were also noted. The prehistoric component was
recommended for testing.
During the SH 130 survey, the site was relocated using a GPS and identified by a sparse scatter of
prehistoric artifacts, including unmodified lithic debitage and several tested cobbles, none of which were
collected. A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated on the site. Of these, only one shovel test was
culturally positive, yielding one piece of unmodified lithic debitage from a depth of 20–30 cm. The spatial
extent of the site within the SH 130 ROW was estimated to be about 200 m in diameter (Figure 79).
Two backhoe trenches, designated trenches T-354-2 and T-354-6, were dug at the site. Both were
excavated to approximately 260 cmbs. Trench T-354-6 was culturally sterile. Trench T-354-2 contained
buried cultural materials consisting of two biface fragments, one piece of unmodified lithic debitage, and
a depleted core. These materials were found at a depth of approximately 80–90 cmbs. A mussel shell
fragment was also found in the trench at a depth of 60 cmbs.
No historic artifacts or structural remains were found at the location during the SH 130 survey. Piles of
bulldozed historic debris occur north of the site, between Fallwell Lane and the Colorado River, which
may be the remains of the historic component. The USGS 1896 and 1910 Austin, Texas, 30-minute
topographic quadrangle as well as the 1936, 1946, and 1952 Travis County Highway Maps all depict a
structure close to this site. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional information regarding
the historic component at the site were unsuccessful.
It was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the deeply buried cultural deposits at the site could
contain information relevant to the prehistoric development of the area. A program of archaeological
testing was designed to determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
41TV540
This previously recorded prehistoric site is located on a low Cretaceous-aged upland landform and
Quaternary terrace above a secondary tributary of Onion Creek. Elevation at the site’s nucleus is 450 ft
amsl. The closest major drainage, Onion Creek, is approximately 600 m northwest of the site. The soils
are Mollisols, mapped as belonging to the Lewisville and Houston Black clay series (Werchan et al.
1974). The northern portion of the site (north of Pearce Lane) is located in a pasture with various short
grass and cactus species. Ground surface visibility was approximately 50 percent at the time of survey.
The portion of the site south of Pearce Lane is located in a recently plowed field with ground surface

visibility of 70 percent. Natural impacts include erosion, flooding, and bioturbation. Artificial impacts
include quarrying along the north side of the site, the construction of pipelines and transmission lines, and
various agricultural activities.
Site 41TV540 was first recorded in 1981, and described as a surface lithic scatter including tools,
hundreds of cores, lithic debitage, and mussel shell (TARL site files). One shovel test was excavated at
this time and revealed one retouched flake to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. Site 41TV540 was revisited
during the SH 130 survey with the intention of observing its present condition and eligibility status. The
site was relocated using a GPS. A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated in the portion of the site north of
Pearce Road. Of these, two were culturally positive containing two pieces of unmodified lithic debitage to
a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. This portion of the site appears to have been heavily disturbed by
quarrying and construction activities. South of Pearce Lane, a total of 27 shovel tests were excavated. All
of these shovel tests were culturally sterile. The site boundary was determined by the extent of the visible
surface scatter as being 200 x 240 m (Figure 80).
This site has been heavily impacted by construction, agricultural, and quarrying activities. The cultural
material collected is very ambiguous in nature; the flaked chert may be the result of plowing or other
agricultural activities in the area. The site lacks stratigraphic integrity, subsistence remains, diagnostic
artifacts and cultural features. Further work at the location is unlikely to contribute to our understanding
of the area’s prehistory. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, site 41TV540 does not warrant
inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.
41TV541
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site located 150 m southeast of an unnamed tributary of Onion
Creek. The soils at the site have been mapped as belonging to the Houston Black clay and Lewisville
series (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of the survey, the site was situated within a pasture, and ground
surface visibility was limited to approximately 50 percent. Impacts to the site include cultivation, power
transmission line construction along its western edge, and gravel quarrying along its northern boundary.
Elevation at the site’s center is 460 ft amsl. The terrain at the site is shown on Figure 81.
Site 41TV541 was originally recorded in 1981 as a prehistoric quarry workshop (TARL site files) based
on the presence of cores, tested cobbles, and large and small flakes. The initial recorder recommended
further work at the site to determine whether it contained a subsurface component. During the current
investigation, 101 shovel tests were excavated to basal clay in order to redefine the portion of the site
within the ROW (Figure 82). None of the shovel tests were positive. However, a controlled surface
inspection located lithic debitage, several cores, and one Pedernales dart point (Figure 83). The
Pedernales dart points and one large flake were collected for analysis. The approximate site size within
the ROW measures about 130 x 270 m.
Although this site produced one temporally diagnostic artifact (a Pedernales dart point), the portion of site
41TV541 lying within the SH 130 ROW has been adversely impacted by transmission line construction,

gravel quarrying, and plowing. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, and does not contain cultural features or
subsistence evidence. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered
for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1256
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site located on a Pleistocene-aged terrace about 100 m north of
an unnamed tributary of Gilleland Creek. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as belonging to the
Burleson series (Werchan et al. 1974). The age of the terrace deposits precludes the presence of deeply
buried archaeological deposits. At the time of survey, vegetation consisted of pasture grasses, fairly dense
greenbriar and mixed hardwoods, such as juniper, mesquite, oak, and elm trees. Surface visibility was
estimated at about 40 to 70 percent (Figure 84). Natural impacts to the site include heavy stream erosion.
Elevation of the site is approximately 530 ft amsl.
Site 41TV1256 was originally recorded in 1985 (TARL site files) as a sparse surface scatter of prehistoric
lithics measuring approximately 20 x 10 m. No further work was recommended because of the absence of
subsurface cultural deposits and the impacts to the site from land clearing and cultivation. No shovel tests
were excavated at the time of the site’s initial recording.
During the current investigation of the SH 130 ROW adjacent to TARL’s location of site 41TV1256, a
surface scatter of prehistoric artifacts, including debitage and tested/worked cobbles, was observed across
the entire ROW. No diagnostic artifacts were noted, and only subsurface artifacts were collected. A light
scatter of burned rocks was observed across the ROW. Eighteen shovel tests were conducted to explore
the subsurface potential of the site (Figure 85). Three of the shovel tests were culturally positive,
revealing subsurface cultural deposits to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. Shovel Test 2 contained a
chopper-like tool in Level 3 (20–30 cmbs) (Figure 86), Shovel Test 3 contained one piece of unmodified
debitage in Level 2 (10–20 cmbs), and Shovel Test 12 contained one piece of unmodified debitage in
Level 3 (20–30 cmbs) and one core in Level 1 (0–10 cmbs). Shovel testing did not reveal concentrations
of debitage or deeply buried cultural material. The presence of a small number of subsurface artifacts is
attributable to vertical displacement that occurs because of the large cracks that characteristically form in
the soil at the site. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed.
Based on the location of the positive shovel tests and the surficial artifact scatter, the previously recorded
site boundary was extended west, south, and north. The new measurement of the site is approximately
125 x 180 m.
The site may have functioned primarily as a lithic procurement area. One or more encampments may have
taken place there based on the presence of a chopper-like tool and scattered burned rocks, which may be
the remnants of hearths. However, the site has undergone considerable negative impacts from modern
agricultural practices and is largely confined to the present-day ground surface. The shallow subsurface
component of the site is limited to a few artifacts that were likely either vertically displaced in the large
cracks that characterize the soil at the site, or by plowing. The lack of stratigraphic integrity, intact

cultural features, and subsistence remains greatly limits the research potential of the site, and it is unlikely
that further work there would significantly add to our knowledge of the area’s prehistory. In the opinion
of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a
SAL.
41TV1260
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site located on a Pleistocene-aged terrace adjacent to a tributary
of Decker Creek. The site’s elevation is approximately 500 ft amsl. Soils at the location have been
mapped as belonging to the Burleson series (Werchan et al. 1974). Vegetation at the site during the time
of survey consisted of mixed hardwoods such as juniper, mesquite, oak, and elm, providing a surface
visibility of approximately 50 percent. The area appears to have been heavily impacted from frequent
flooding and erosion, as indicated by a barbed-wire fence north of the site, which had been completely
flattened by past floodwaters.
Site 41TV1260 was originally recorded in 1986 (TARL site files) as a light lithic scatter measuring
approximately 15 x 20 m. A single shovel test was excavated at the site; it yielded an unrecorded amount
of lithic debitage from a depth of 10 cmbs. No further work was recommended because of the relatively
small size of the site, its proximity to the frequently inundated floodplain, and the shallow depth of the
cultural deposits.
The site was relocated by surface inspection during the SH 130 survey. The surface scatter observed at the
location included unmodified debitage, tested cobbles, and one biface fragment. The site was found to
occur on both sides of the unnamed tributary, and its boundary within the SH 130 ROW was expanded to
be approximately 20 x 30 m (Figure 87). Fourteen shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of
30 cmbs. None of the shovel tests were positive. No diagnostic artifacts, features, or subsurface
component were present.
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area, where some tool production took place.
Because the site lacks diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, subsistence evidence, and stratigraphic
integrity, further work at the location is not recommended. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that site 41TV1260 should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1268
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site situated on a gently sloping Cretaceous-aged upland
landform about 200 m north of Decker Creek. Soils at the site are nonaggrading and have been mapped as
belonging to the Houston series (Werchan et al. 1974). Numerous lag gravels occur at the location.
Vegetation at the site at the time of survey consisted of unimproved pasture grasses, cacti, mesquite, oak,
and elm. Surface visibility was estimated at 50 percent.

5: Site Descriptions

Site 41TV1268 was initially recorded in 1986 (TARL records). The site was described as a large thin
scatter of cultural materials, including large crude bifaces, a few flakes, and many heat-treated and
shattered cobbles and chunks. No diagnostic artifacts were noted at that time. Site size at the time was
estimated to be 200 x 75 m. The site was not recommended for further study because of disturbance by
erosion, clearing, grazing, and multipurpose development.
When the site was revisited by PBS&J in 2003, scattered prehistoric artifacts, consisting primarily of
shattered or tested heat-treated cobbles and cores, were observed on the ground surface. No diagnostic
artifacts were noted, and no surficial materials were collected. A total of 21 shovel tests were excavated
across the site at 30-m intervals. All were culturally sterile. Based on the extent of the surface artifacts
within the SH 130 ROW, the site measures about 120 x 150 m, long axis north-south (Figure 88). A small
cabin and an imitation well, constructed for the filming of the movie Lonesome Dove, are situated outside
the eastern edge of the SH 130 ROW.
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. Some early-stage tool reduction may have
occurred there. The site lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, features, and subsistence data. It
is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41TV1268 should not be considered eligible for
NRHP listing or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1270
This is a previously recorded prehistoric site occupying the lower portion of an upland slope southeast of
Lake Walter E. Long. The site overlooks Decker Creek approximately 400 m to the northeast. The clayey
soils at the site are mapped as Houston series soils (Werchan et al. 1974). Mixed hardwoods comprise the
vegetation on the slope and include cedar and oak. Ragweed, cacti, and grasses make up the vegetation in
cleared areas. Ground surface visibility ranges from 10 to 40 percent in the wooded areas to more than
80 percent in pasture. Elevation at the site ranges from 460 to 500 ft amsl.
Site 41TV1270 was originally recorded in 1986 (TARL site files). At that time the site was described as a
surface scatter of lithics. Materials observed included a core, secondary flakes, and a thin biface fragment.
A single shovel test was excavated at the site. The site was relocated during the current investigation.
Artifacts observed on the site’s surface included tested cobbles, cores, and lithic debitage. A single shovel
test was excavated to confirm the nondepositional nature of the landform. The test was culturally sterile.
The site remains defined on the basis of a surface artifact scatter measuring about 200 x 600 m (Figure
89). The western edge of nearby previously recorded site 41TV1271, located just outside the ROW, may
be included within this area. Artifacts observed at the site include tested cobbles, cores, and lithic
debitage. No diagnostic artifacts were noted and no materials were collected.
The site is appears to have functioned primarily as a lithic procurement area. Because of the lack of
stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence remains, it is unlikely that
additional work at the location would contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory. It is the

opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41TV1270 should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL.
41TV1275
This previously recorded multicomponent site is located on a gentle Pleistocene-aged terrace remnant
overlooking the Colorado River floodplain at an elevation of approximately 520 ft amsl. Soils of the
Wilson series have been mapped in the area (Werchan et al. 1974). Taxonomically, soils of this series are
classified as Alfisols. At the time of survey, the vegetation at the location included grasses and cacti
(Figure 90). Ground surface visibility ranged from 40 to 60 percent, and the site was originally recorded
as a lithic scatter with a light surface scatter of historic artifacts (TARL site files). The current
investigation defined the site size as approximately 100 x 150 m (Figure 91). A total of eight shovel tests
were excavated across the site, all of which tested positive for cultural resources. Lithic tools, debitage,
and fire-cracked rocks were recovered from the ground surface and shovel tests. Most of the artifacts
recovered from the shovel tests were found at depths of less than 30 cmbs, though two tests (5 and 6)
excavated on the upper backslope produced 12 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, 2 cores, and 10
pieces of fire-cracked rock from depths of 30–60 cmbs. Five pieces of historic whiteware were recovered
from the site surface.
Much of the site area has been modified by development activities. Mechanical dozing of the soils has
exposed the underlying clays and gravels on the western part of the site. It is possible that some soils may
exist intact along the eastern side of the backslope, which appears undisturbed. These soils may contain
buried prehistoric deposits. The small number of earthenware fragments on the surface may represent a
single, insignificant dumping episode, as a review of historic county maps failed to find any evidence of a
historic occupation other than the modern house located about 60 m to the northwest. Attempts to contact
the landowner regarding the historic component were unsuccessful.
Despite considerable impacts in historic times, subsurface prehistoric artifacts, apparently buried in
colluvium, exist at the location. These deposits could yield information relevant to the area’s prehistory. It
was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that a program of archaeological testing be developed to
determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
41TV1278
This previously recorded multicomponent site includes the remains of a historic homestead and a buried
prehistoric artifact scatter. The site occupies Quaternary terrace deposits overlooking Decker Creek
approximately 700 m to the northeast. The gravelly fine sandy loam mapped at the location belongs to the
Travis series soils (Werchan et al. 1974). Houston Black gravelly clay also occurs along a shallow
drainage near the south end of the site. Patches of pasture vegetation are mixed within the oak/cedar
woodland that dominates the site (Figure 92). Visibility of the ground surface ranges from less than
10 percent to about 60 percent in cleared or eroded areas. Elevation at the site’s center is approximately
530 ft amsl.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Site 41TV1278 was originally recorded as a historic homestead with a minor, subsurface prehistoric lithic
scatter component (TARL site files). An abandoned dwelling is included in the original site description
but is located just outside of the SH 130 ROW. The structure is a single-storied, side-gabled, framed
house with a projecting front porch. Limited shovel testing at the site during its initial recording
encountered lithic debitage. Intensive systematic shovel testing across the ROW during the SH 130
survey refined the extent of the buried prehistoric component. A total of 85 shovel tests were excavated
across the landscape, of which 40 tested positive for cultural resources. One core, 153 pieces of
unmodified lithic debitage, and 103 pieces of fire-cracked rock were recovered from depths of less than
10 to 80 cmbs. Two lithic tools were recovered from the site surface. Currently, the site is defined as a
deeply buried prehistoric lithic scatter measuring approximately 130 x 500 m (Figure 93).
The depth of the artifacts found in the prehistoric component suggested that it was buried by colluvial
deposition and possessed stratigraphic integrity. The Principal Investigator proposed that a program of
archaeological testing be developed to determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
41TV1400
This is a previously recorded multicomponent site composed of a prehistoric open campsite and a
historical house. The site is located on the edge and slope of a prominent ridge overlooking Onion Creek,
approximately 1 km to the northwest. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as belonging to the
Ferris-Heiden series (Werchan et al. 1974). Ferris-Heiden soils occur on nonaggrading upland surfaces of
Eocene age. They are taxonomically classified as Udic Haplusterts, which are Vertisols having clay rich
A and Bss horizons. They have no potential for containing deeply buried archaeological deposits.
Vegetation at the time of the survey included grasses, scrub brush, and a few hardwood trees (Figure 94a).
The ground surface visibility ranged from 30 percent in the grassy areas to 100 percent in a bulldozed
area. Elevation of the site is approximately 500 ft amsl.
In 1988, site 41TV1400 was recorded as an early-twentieth-century house site (TARL site files). The
property owner reported that a cistern marked the site of two small wood-framed tenant houses that had
since been removed and the area subsequently bulldozed. Because of poor ground surface visibility, no
artifacts were observed on the surface. The site was not recommended for further work.
During the current survey, the site was identified by the relocation of the yellow brick cistern mentioned
by the previous recorder (Figure 94b). This cistern is the only extant feature relating to the historical
component of the tenant houses. No historical artifacts were observed on the surface. However, a
prehistoric component, including several flakes and a large tested chert cobble, was noted but not
collected. Ten shovel tests excavated to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs, where basal clay was encountered,
did not encounter subsurface cultural deposits. The original site boundaries, which measured 50 m in
diameter, were expanded to 100 x 125 m to include the newly recorded prehistoric component (Figure
95).

SITE 41TV1400

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Analysis of historical map data revealed structures in the vicinity of 41TV1400 on the 1936, 1941, 1946,
and 1952 Travis County Highway Maps, as well as on the 1930 Travis County topographic and road map.
However, the 1901 and 1910 USGS Austin 30-minute topographic quadrangles do not depict any
structures in the vicinity of this site. Attempts to contact the landowner regarding the historic component
at the site were unsuccessful.
The historical component of the site has an absence of structural features and adverse impacts, including
bulldozed areas and push piles. Because of the absence of time-diagnostic features or artifacts and the
lack of buried cultural deposits, it is unlikely that additional work on the prehistoric component of the site
would contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory/history. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL.
41TV1401
This previously recorded prehistoric site is located on a Cretaceous-aged terrace, southeast of Onion
Creek at an elevation of 500 ft amsl. The soils are Vertisols, mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan et
al. 1974). This site is situated on the edge of the ridge, in a pasture consisting of several grass varieties,
with ground surface visibility of approximately 50 percent. Natural impacts include erosion and
bioturbation, while artificial impacts include agriculture-related activities.
In 1988, 41TV1401 was recorded as a prehistoric open campsite and a historic trash dump site (TARL
site files). The site was revisited during the present survey with the intention of observing its present
condition and eligibility status. The site was relocated using a GPS and identified by surface inspection of
the area. A surface scatter, including five pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, was observed within a
20-x-40-m area. No surface artifacts were collected. Eight shovel tests were placed along transects at
30-m intervals through the area. One test produced two pieces of unmodified debitage from a depth of 0–
10 cmbs (Figure 96).
It is likely that the site has been destroyed through agricultural and heavy erosional activities. In the
opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation
as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1979
This is a prehistoric site located on a Cretaceous-aged ridge 200 m south of South Fork Dry Creek, at an
elevation of 511 ft amsl. The soils are mapped as Vertisols, belonging to the Houston Black clay series
(Werchan et al. 1974). The site is located in an open pasture vegetated with various grasses, ragweed, and
several mesquite trees. Ground surface visibility was estimated at about 50 percent at the time of survey.
Moderate erosion, plowing, and moderate ranching activities have likely impacted the site.
Site 41TV1979 was recorded when a scatter of prehistoric artifacts was observed on the ground surface
but not collected. The artifact scatter included unmodified lithic debitage, tested cobbles, and cores. A

series of 28 shovel tests was excavated in order to explore the subsurface potential of the site. Of these,
seven were culturally positive to a maximum depth of 10 cmbs for nine pieces of unmodified lithic
debitage, one utilized flake, and one utilized biface. Estimated site size is approximately 100 x 150 m
(Figure 97).
The site appears to have functioned as a lithic procurement area. Prehistoric cultural materials are
confined to the surface or very shallow depth, and thus the site thus lacks stratigraphic integrity. No
cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, or subsistence data occur at the location. It is unlikely that additional
research at site 41TV1979 would contribute to our understanding of the areas prehistory, and in the
opinion of the Principal Investigator, it should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for designation
as a SAL.
41TV1980
This is a prehistoric site situated on a Cretaceous-aged upland landform about 600 m east of an unnamed
tributary to Cedar Creek. Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Houston series
(Werchan et al. 1974). Vegetation in the area is composed of a mix of grasses and patchy areas of scrub
brush. The elevation at the site ranges from approximately 620 to 630 ft amsl.
The site was located by surface inspection. Artifactual materials collected consists of two utilized Stage 1
bifaces. A total of 26 shovel tests were excavated across the area, none of which tested positive for
cultural resources. The size of the site is about 35 x 215 m (Figure 98).
This site probably represents a periodically utilized lithic procurement area. Because of the absence of
time-diagnostic artifacts, subsistence data, and cultural features, and the lack of stratigraphic integrity, it
is unlikely that additional research at the location would contribute to our understanding of the prehistoric
development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
41TV1981
This is a prehistoric campsite located on a Quaternary-aged upland terrace west of Lake Walter E. Long.
An ephemeral unnamed drainage is located about 100 m south of the site. Elevation at site nucleus is
510 ft (155 m) amsl. The soils at the location are Alfisols, sandy clays developed in ancient alluvium,
mapped as belonging to the Travis series (Werchan et al. 1974). The site is situated in an upland forest,
vegetated with mixed hardwoods, cacti, and scrub brush. At the time of survey ground surface visibility
was approximately 75 percent. Adverse impacts to the site include cattle ranching, water erosion,
bioturbation, and evidence of recent clearing in the form of large push piles.
The site was first recorded when a surface scatter was observed in an area recently cleared of vegetation.
A surface inspection revealed a scatter of unmodified lithic debitage. A total of 30 shovel tests were
excavated to explore the subsurface potential of the site (Figure 99). Of these, 13 were positive for

prehistoric artifacts including 54 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, 1 utilized flake, 1 preform, 1 core
fragment, 1 core tool, and 1 projectile point typed as Martindale (Figure 100). The artifacts were found
from the ground surface to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs. The estimated site size is 60 x 110 m. An
accumulation of rocks surrounded by a lithic scatter was observed approximately 10 m west of the ROW
edge. Since this feature was out of the SH 130 ROW, it could not be further investigated
The presence of buried cultural materials suggested that the site possessed stratigraphic integrity. The
Principal Investigator recommended that a program of archaeological testing be developed to determine
the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
41TV1982
This is a historic site located on a small knoll at the lower margin of the uplands above the Colorado
River floodplain. Soils at this location are of the Hornsby series (Werchan et al. 1974). Vegetation is
composed mainly of common grassland vegetation with a scattering of older oak trees throughout the
pasture (Figure 101). Ground surface visibility at the time of survey was approximately 80 percent.
Elevation of the site ranges from 450 to 465 ft amsl.
This site was discovered by shovel testing during the SH 130 survey. A total of 24 shovel tests were
excavated, 11 of which tested positive for cultural materials. The site covers an area of approximately
50 x 70 m (Figure 102). Artifacts were recovered from depths of 0 to 30 cmbs. Most of the artifacts
recovered from shovel testing are items common to historic domestic sites including solarized glass, a
Phillips milk of magnesia bottle, wire and cut nails, and decorated and undecorated whiteware.
Additionally, a small brass bell was recovered from the ground surface. Representative examples of
collected artifacts are shown in Figures 103 and 104. Artifact distribution appears to be random
throughout the landform as no concentrations of historic debris were encountered.
Analysis of archival maps reveals a structure is in the vicinity of 41TV1982 on 1901 and 1910 USGS
Austin, Texas, quadrangle maps. Structures are also present on the 1932, 1936, 1941, and 1952 TSHD
General Highway Maps of Travis County. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional
information regarding the site were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that 41TV1982 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL,
and no further work is recommended.
41TV1983
This prehistoric site is located on Cretaceous-aged dissected uplands east of Lake Walter E. Long.
Elevation at the site nucleus is approximately 490 ft amsl. The nearest water source is Gilleland Creek,
200 m south of the site. Soils in the area belong to the Ferris-Heiden association. Houston Black gravelly

clay composes much of the summit, with Ferris-Heiden complex soils comprising the backslopes
(Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of the survey, the site was vegetated primarily with mesquite, cedar,
cacti, and a dense undergrowth of vines, briars, and grass, resulting in poor ground surface visibility.
Adverse impacts to the site include heavy erosion as evidenced by the deeply incised gullies surrounding
the site.
The site was recorded when prehistoric artifacts, consisting of tested cobbles, bifacially worked stone, and
lithic debitage were observed on the ground surface. To explore the subsurface potential of the site, four
shovel tests were excavated. All were culturally sterile. Based on the surface artifact scatter, the site
measures 150 x 200 m (Figure 105). Three chert rock piles approximately 5 square meters in diameter
were observed within the site’s boundary. These rock piles are probably related to historic land-clearing
activities. No burned rocks or heavy concentration of artifacts suggesting a middenlike feature were
observed. No artifacts were collected.
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. Some early-stage tool reduction may also
have taken place there. No diagnostic artifacts, subsistence data, or cultural features were observed, and
the site lacks stratigraphic integrity. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that it should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. No further work is recommended
41TV1984
Prehistoric artifacts were observed at this site eroding out of a stream cutbank flowing through a
Quaternary-aged upland east of Lake Walter E. Long. The elevation of the site is approximately 480 ft
amsl. The main channel of Gilleland Creek is 1 km south of the site. The soils at the location consist of
Mollisols mapped as Trinity clay (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of survey the site was vegetated with
pasture grasses, affording ground surface visibility of approximately 70 percent. Severe erosion has
created deeply incised drainages dissecting the area.
The site was recorded when prehistoric materials were observed eroding out of a deeply buried deposit
approximately 2 m below ground surface. Specifically, scattered debitage was observed and two large
bifaces were collected for analysis. Due to the depth of the deposit, no shovel tests were excavated. No
cultural features or diagnostic artifacts were encountered. Site size was difficult to ascertain because of
the buried nature of the cultural deposits, but was estimated to be approximately 40 m in diameter (Figure
106). The thickness and integrity of the site is also difficult to estimate because of the small amount of
alluvial deposits visible in the bisected streambed.
The depth at which artifacts were observed suggest the site may contain in situ deposits and could yield
information relevant to the prehistoric development of the area. It was the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that should construction-related activities preclude preservation or avoidance, a program of
archaeological testing should be developed to determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility.

5: Site Descriptions

NRHP testing was performed at site 41TV1984 on June 21 and November 20, 2002. Prehistoric artifacts
at the location were found to be buried in recently deposited colluvium confined to erosional gullies that
drain into Gilleland Creek. A total of three trenches were excavated at the location. Screened hand
excavation of 50-x-50-cm columns was conducted in two of the trenches to a depth of 120 cmbs. No
prehistoric artifacts were encountered in any of the trenches. It was the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL. No
further work was recommended (Dixon and Rogers 2007)
41TV1985
This is a prehistoric site situated on a Quaternary-aged upland interfluve overlooking a tributary drainage
of Gilleland Creek about 8 m to the east. Elevation at site nucleus is 550 ft amsl. Soils at the site are
Vertisols, mapped as Houston Black clay and Burleson gravelly clay (Werchan et al. 1974). The site is
located partially within a wooded area, consisting of mesquite, cedar, and thick scrubby vegetation, and
partially within a cleared transmission line corridor vegetated with various grasses. Ground surface
visibility was approximately 50 percent at the time of survey. Adverse impacts to the site include erosion
and artificial clearing for construction of the transmission line corridor and access roads.
The site was first recorded when prehistoric lithics, consisting of several concentrations of unmodified
lithic debitage, cores, cobbles, and one biface, were observed on the ground surface. No surficial artifacts
were collected. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated to determine the subsurface boundaries of the
site. Of these, five were culturally positive to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs, and yielded 30 pieces of
unmodified lithic debitage, 5 pieces of thermally altered rock, 2 utilized flakes, and 3 bifaces.
Approximate site size is 70 x 100 m (Figure 107). No cultural features or diagnostic artifacts were
encountered.
Site 41TV1985 appears to have functioned as a lithic procurement area. Some early-stage tool reduction
took place at the location. The site lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and
subsistence data. The landform on which the site is located is not aggrading, and it is likely that the
artifacts found below the surface were translocated through cracks in the clayey soil. Such cracks are
common to soils such as those of the Houston Black clay and Burleson series. It is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. No
further work is recommended.
41TV1986
This is a multicomponent site located on gently sloping upland. Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped
as belonging to the Burleson series (Werchan et al. 1974). The site is bisected by a shallow, unnamed
drainage that has its headwaters in open pasture approximately 250 m to the north. At the time of survey,
vegetation at the site was composed of common pasture grasses and a few clusters of oak and small
juniper. Surface visibility ranged from 40 percent in grassy areas to more than 80 percent in exposed areas
along the drainage. Elevation at the site is approximately 600 ft amsl.

5: Site Descriptions

The site was recorded when a biface, two tested chert cobbles, several chunks of cement, two fragments
of unidentified blue transferware, and several fragments of ferrous metal were observed on the ground
surface. None of the observed surficial artifacts were collected. Six shovel tests excavated at the site; none
were positive for cultural resources. The site measures approximately 30 x 40 m (Figure 108).
A structure is depicted on the USGS 1910 Austin 30-minute topographic quadrangle. It is not shown on
subsequent maps. Attempts to contact the landowner to acquire additional information regarding the
historic component at the site were unsuccessful.
Although the historic component may be over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with
significant events or persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that the historic component does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or
for designation as a SAL, and no further work is recommended.
The prehistoric component is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. It lacks stratigraphic
integrity, and it is unlikely that additional work would contribute to our understanding of the prehistoric
development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41TV1987
This is a prehistoric site situated on the broad ridge summit and backslope overlooking an unnamed
tributary to Decker Creek about 75 m to the east. Soil maps show a mix of Travis, Houston, and Heiden
series soils in the area (Werchan et al. 1974), but sandy loam with gravel of the Travis series dominates
the site. The area’s vegetation comprises mixed hardwood and cacti (Figure 109). Ground surface
visibility is approximately 40 to 50 percent. Elevation at the site ranges from 525 to 535 ft amsl.
A total of 36 shovel tests were excavated across the site, of which 31 tested positive for cultural resources.
Artifactual materials recovered include 125 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, 4 biface fragments, 71
pieces of thermally altered rock, 3 utilized flakes, 1 hammerstone, 1 piece of ocher, 1 core, and 2 unifacial
scrapers. Artifacts were recovered from depths of less than 10 to 70 cmbs. The site measures 250 x 280 m
(Figure 110).
The depth of the artifacts at the site suggests they have been buried by colluvial deposition and could
possess stratigraphic integrity and contain information pertinent to understanding the prehistory of the
area. It was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that should proposed construction activities preclude
preservation or avoidance, a program of archaeological testing should be developed to determine the
site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
41TV1988
This is a prehistoric site located on a terrace about 120 m east of Onion Creek. Silty loam sediments were
encountered during shovel testing, and the area is mapped as Lewisville series soils (Werchan et al.

1974). At the time of survey, vegetation consisted of grasses, allowing ground surface visibility of
approximately 75 percent (Figure 111). Elevation at the site is approximately 430 ft amsl.
Site 41TV1988 is expressed as a scatter of lithic debitage, 2 biface fragments, and a core fragment limited
to a depth of approximately 10 cmbs. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated at the site, of which 2
were positive for cultural resources. The site measures 120 x 130 m (Figure 112). The site may represent
a lithic procurement area where initial stages of stone tool manufacturing occurred.
The site lacks stratigraphic integrity, cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, and subsistence remains.
Further work at the location is unlikely to contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory. In the
opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation. No further work is recommended.
41TV1989
This is a historic site located on a terrace of the Colorado River at an elevation of 385 ft amsl. The river is
1.5 km south of the site. The soils are Mollisols, mapped as Bergstrom silt loam (Werchan et al. 1974).
The site is located within a recently plowed field with about 90 percent visibility. Adverse impacts to the
site include erosion, flooding, and agricultural activities such as plowing.
The site was recorded when a scatter of historic material was observed on the surface. Historic artifacts
included 3 metal fragments (1 large bolt and 2 miscellaneous objects), 1 shell button, 17 vessel glass
fragments (including 3 bottle necks that date from between 1865 and 1890), and 16 ceramics. Among the
ceramics were fragments of green transferware manufactured between 1829 and 1850, and blue
transferware, manufactured between 1820 and 1860 (Stelle 2001). Other diagnostic artifacts include glass
insulators made by “A.B.G.M. Co” (1886–1925) and solarized glass dating between 1890 and 1920. To
explore the subsurface potential of the site, nine shovel tests were excavated. All shovel tests were
culturally sterile. The size of the site (45 x 100 m) was thus determined by the extent of the surface
historic scatter (Figure 113). No cultural features, such as foundation piers, well/cistern, or a privy, were
observed. A sample of the historic artifacts is provided on Figure 114.
Analysis of historic map data revealed a structure at this location on the USGS 1910 Austin 30-minute
topographic quadrangle. Later maps, including the 1936, 1946, and 1952 TSHD Travis County Highway
Maps, depict several structures in this vicinity. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional
information on the history of the property were unsuccessful.
Site 41TV1989 is interpreted as debris associated with multiple structures that existed at this location
between the late nineteenth through mid-twentieth century. No structural remains or other features are
present, and all artifacts are confined to the ground surface. It is unlikely that additional work at the
location would contribute to our understanding of the historic utilization of the area. It is the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a
SAL. No further work is recommended.

41TV1990
This historic site consists of a concrete cistern and small historic debris scatter located on a high terrace
west of Lake Walter E. Long. Elevation at site nucleus is 460 ft amsl. The soils at the location are
Alfisols, sandy clays developed in ancient alluvium, mapped as belonging to the Travis series (Werchan
et al. 1974). The site is situated in an open pasture with vegetation consisting of short pasture grasses,
cacti, nettles, and assorted weeds and vines. Minor secondary growth consists of several oak and cedar
trees growing along the fenceline 10 m east of site. Ground surface visibility was estimated to be between
10 and 20 percent at the time of survey. Adverse impacts include water erosion, cattle grazing, and
evidence of push piles or berms surrounding the site.
The identification of a small concrete cistern (80 cm in diameter) and an associated historic artifact scatter
led to recordation of this site. A 55-gallon metal drum has been sunk into the ground 50 cm east of the
cistern, and a wooden plank extends from the area between the drum and cistern (Figure 115). No
additional structural remains were visible within 50 m of the cistern. However, a historic structure and
associated historic scatter were observed approximately 80 m southwest of the site, outside of the SH 130
ROW. The cistern and related features may be associated with this structure. The surficial artifact scatter
contained historic brick, ironware, glass, and metal fragments. Four shovel tests were placed around the
cistern and associated features to search for subsurface remains. All four shovel tests were culturally
sterile. The artifact scatter was found in an area around the cistern measuring about 10 m in diameter
(Figure 116).
A structure is depicted in the vicinity on the USGS 1910 Austin, Texas, 30-minute topographic
quadrangle, but is not shown on subsequent maps. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional
information regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
Although the site appears to be over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant
events or persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that 41TV1990 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as
a SAL, and no further work is recommended.
41TV1991
This is a historic site located on the first terrace above the Colorado River, in Travis County, Texas, at an
elevation of 430 ft amsl. The soils developed during the Holocene period from alluvial deposits, and
consist of Mollisols, mapped as Bergstrom silty clay loam (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of survey
the area was overgrown with secondary growth, including various hardwoods, grasses, vines, and weeds.
Ground surface visibility was 10–30 percent. Natural impacts include heavy erosion and bioturbation.
Artificial impacts include possible flood control measures and the construction of Fallwell Lane,
immediately south of the site.

5: Site Descriptions

The site was first observed because of a large debris scatter on the first terrace above the Colorado River.
Materials observed but not collected, include historic cans, bottles, metal fragments, household goods,
and structural elements. All of these materials appear to have been either dumped or pushed with a
bulldozer from adjacent fields above the site. The area appears to have been utilized as a dump for an
extensive period, though much of the deposit may have been washed away by flooding or buried by
bulldozed deposits. Of the 10 shovel tests placed within the area, none yielded relevant historic or
prehistoric materials and all suggest that the soils along this terrace edge have been heavily modified. Site
extent, estimated from the extent of the surface scatter, was 50 x 180 m (Figure 117).
The USGS 1910 Austin, Texas, 30-minute topographic quadrangle and the 1936, 1946, and 1952 TSHD
Travis County Highway Maps all depict a structure close to this site. A structure is also shown at the
location on the 1987 USGS topographic quadrangle. At the time of the survey no evidence of a structure
(footings, brick foundations, etc.) was observed. The area appears to have been bulldozed, and various
constructional debris, including sheet metal and old lumber, has been dumped into the drainage and lined
along the cutbanks. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional information regarding the
history of the property were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. The site appears to have been destroyed and
subsequently bulldozed over the terrace banks. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
41TV1991 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and no further
work is recommended.
41TV1992
This is a prehistoric site situated on a terrace of the Colorado River at an elevation of 425 ft amsl. The
river is approximately 900 m south of the site. The soils are Mollisols, mapped as Bergstrom silty clay
loam (Werchan et al. 1974). The site lies within a plowed field with 100 percent visibility. Adverse
impacts include intensive plowing and the construction of a transmission line along the southern portion
of the site.
The site was first identified as a surface scatter, including unmodified lithic debitage, two crude bifaces,
one possible preform, and numerous pieces of fire-cracked rocks. One biface exhibiting possible residue
on both sides was the only surficial artifact collected. Twenty-nine shovel tests were excavated to explore
the subsurface potential of the site (Figure 118). Of these, one shovel test was culturally positive for a
single medial projectile point fragment at a depth of 20 cmbs. No other subsurface artifacts were
encountered. Approximate site size is 90 x 120 m. The two collected artifacts are shown on Figure 119.
The site is interpreted as having been a campsite. It has been heavily impacted by intensive plowing and
transmission line construction, and lacks stratigraphic integrity, cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, and
subsistence remains. Further work at the location is unlikely to contribute to our understanding of the

area’s prehistory. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP
eligibility or for listing as an SAL eligibility. No further work is recommended.
41TV1993
This is a multicomponent site located on a small knoll or terrace remnant above the Colorado River
floodplain. The site is located approximately 100 m west of the river. Soils at this location are of the
Hornsby series (Werchan et al. 1974), which are manifested throughout the site as a relatively shallow
sandy loam underlain by gravelly loam. Common grassland vegetation covers much of the site, with a
thin stand of oak trees and other hardwoods covering the northern portion (Figure 120). Ground surface
visibility at the time of survey was less than 10 percent because of the tall grass. Elevation of the site is
approximately 440 ft amsl.
A large rubble pile composed of brick and metal fragments prompted systematic shovel testing of the
area. A total of 33 shovel tests were excavated, 9 of which tested positive for cultural resources (Figure
121). Shovel testing and ground surface examination delineated an area of approximately 50 x 125 m.
Artifacts were recovered from shovel tests at a maximum depth of 20 cmbs. Artifacts recovered from the
ground surface and shovel tests are items common to historic domestic artifact scatters. These include
bottle glass (including solarized, aqua tint, amber, and clear), cut and wire nails, ceramic fragments, metal
fragments, and bricks. A very minor prehistoric component, composed of a single piece of lithic debitage
and one fire-cracked rock fragment, was also encountered. It is not considered significant.
The historic artifacts at 41TV1993 appear to be associated with multiple structures dating from the late
nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. A structure is shown in this vicinity on 1901 and 1910 USGS
Austin, Texas, quadrangle maps. Structures are also present on the 1932, 1936, 1941, and 1952 TSHD
General Highway Maps of Travis County. Attempts to contact the landowner to obtain additional
information regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that site 41TV1993 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a
SAL, and no further work is recommended.
41TV2000
This is a historic site located on an upland backslope overlooking an unnamed tributary of Dry Creek.
Soils at the site have been mapped as Houston Black clay (Werchan et al. 1974). The site is on the edge of
an old agricultural field, among large oaks and immature mesquite, with prickly pear cacti and other
thorny vegetation also present. The old field to the north and east is overgrown with tall pasture grass and
weeds. Ground surface visibility is approximately 60 percent. The nearest permanent source of water is
Dry Creek, approximately 1 km to the southeast; however, a small tributary of Dry Creek was observed

10 m southwest of the site boundary. Elevation at the site is approximately 530 ft amsl; the site is
approximately 80 m in diameter.
The site is a farmstead composed of the remains of a residential structure, a large wood-framed
outbuilding, a brick-lined cistern, a cement stock tank, segments of a post-and-wire fence, and a surficial
artifact scatter of building materials, glass, textiles, metal, and ceramics. Seven shovel tests were
excavated within the site boundary, five of which produced historical artifacts within the first 5 cm
(Figure 122). No evidence of deeply buried or intact deposits was encountered. All shovel tests were
excavated until basal clay was encountered. Included among the surface scatter of artifacts were
fragments of amber-colored and clear bottle glass, molded glass, white earthenware, wire nails, carpet
scraps, clothing and shoe remnants, and building debris. The artifacts encountered seem typical of
domestic artifact scatters and appear to date to the early or mid-twentieth century.
What remains of the residential structure is a pile of bricks that appear to be the remains of a fallen
chimney, and a push pile of burned timber, brick, tile, and other structural debris (Figure 123a). Nothing
of the structure remains intact from which to describe the character of the residence. An overgrown gravel
road leads south from the residential remains. Approximately 20 m to the north there remains an
uncovered and empty brick-lined cistern. The cistern is approximately 4 m deep. Approximately 35 m to
the southwest of the residential remains is a collapsed, wood-framed outbuilding with a corrugated tin
roof (Figure 123b). This structure measures approximately 30 ft (9 m) square. The southern half of the
site consists of a sparse scatter of domestic trash, a cement stock tank, and remaining segments of postand-wire fencing.
Analysis of historical map data revealed structures in the vicinity of 41TV2000 on the 1936, 1941, 1946,
and 1952 TSHD Travis County Highway Maps, as well as on the 1930 Travis County topographic and
road map (Travis County Engineering Department 1932). No structures are depicted on the 1901 or 1910
USGS Austin 30-minute topographic quadrangles, suggesting that the structures at 41TV2000 were
constructed sometime in the early twentieth century, most likely between 1910 and 1930. Attempts to
contact the landowner to obtain additional information regarding the history of the property were
unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years old, it is not known to be associated with significant events or persons.
No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
it does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and no further work is
recommended.
41TV2132
This is a historic site located on a toeslope of a low ridge overlooking the floodplain of a tributary to Dry
Creek approximately 100 m to the south. The site’s elevation is 150 ft amsl. Shovel testing revealed a
gray-brown blocky dry clay extending to a depth 60 cmbs above a dense sterile clay subsoil and cobbles.
The soil is mapped as Heiden clay (Werchan et al. 1974). At the time of survey, fallow agricultural fields

were present east of the site and a modern home stood just west of it. Vegetation within the site consisted
of mixed grasses including ragweed and pigweed, elm, pecan, and juniper, affording an average ground
visibility of 40 percent.
Site 41TV2132 was discovered when historic cultural remains were encountered on the surface. The site
measured 65 m north-south by 55 m east-west and was comprised of a circular water cistern, an
unfinished gravestone, a brick barbecue pit and a concrete and brick subterranean structure, surrounded
by a thick scatter of historic artifacts (Figure 124). The cistern was approximately 3 m deep and was
constructed of mortared limestone topped by a concrete dome and metal roof. The subterranean structure
was a 1.5-m-wide by 3-m-long framed concrete structure partitioned by two brick and mortar walls,
elevated about 30 cm above ground surface and 1.5 m deep. According to the property owner, the granite
gravestone was etched with “AGE” by her grandfather, who was a stone carver; the stone was kept as a
sample of his work. It is not associated with an interment.
Artifacts found in the surface scatter and in the shovel tests include whole clear, brown, and green glass
bottles; clear, green, amethyst, brown, and blue glass sherds; and whiteware, transferware, and various
metal fragments. Seven shovel tests were placed within and outside of the scatter. One shovel test was
positive and contained a whiteware ceramic sherd, a solarized glass fragment, a metal clothing snap, and a
rifle shell casing.
A structure in the location of site 41TV2132 is present on the 1955 and 1966 USGS Montopolis
quadrangle maps and a structure is present in the vicinity of the site on an 1896 Austin quadrangle map.
Chain of title research revealed that the site falls within the W. Lewis Survey, Abstract No. 479. A
warranty dated August 30, 1889, transferred the property from Fred Sassman et ux. to Max Wappler
(Travis County Deed Records 87:491). This parcel then became the property of the First National Bank in
1926, the Federal Land Bank of Houston in 1927, and the Austin National Bank in 1933. In 1942, the
parcel became the property of Harry Palmer, followed by transfers to the Shirley family in 1942 and
1947, until the parcel became the property of Dorothy J. King et al. in 2005 (Travis County Deed Records
Document No. 2005123569).
Given the time frame spanned by historic artifacts at the site, plus pertinent historic maps and the chain of
title research, site 41TV2132 likely pertains to the time frame between 1889 and 1947. Although the site
is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or persons. No standing
structure remains, and the artifacts observed date to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that 41TV2132 meets none of the criteria for
NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and no further work is recommended.

Caldwell County
41CW74
This is a prehistoric site located on the edge of a Quaternary-aged terrace and extends onto the backslope
of a ridge above Withers Hollow, a tributary of Elm Creek. The soils at the site are mapped as Burleson
and Houston series soils, which are taxonomically classified as Vertisols (Lowther and Werchan 1978).
Vegetation at the time of survey consisted of tall grasses and patchy mesquite, cacti, and other thorny
plants, allowing approximately 40 percent ground surface visibility. Elevation ranges from 560 to 580 ft
amsl at the site.
The site was recorded when prehistoric artifacts were observed on the ground surface. A total of 34
shovel tests were excavated, of which 13 were positive, yielding 1 unifacially worked scraper, 1 core, 6
pieces of fire-cracked rock, and 20 pieces of debitage from depths of 0–30 cmbs. The portion of the site
within the ROW measures approximately 100 x 600 m (Figure 125). The nonaggrading nature of the
upland landform is attested to by the presence of numerous lag gravels on the ground surface.
The site is interpreted as a campsite. The occurrence of some artifacts at depths of up to 30 cmbs can be
attributed to the nature of the soil, as Vertisols such as the Burleson and Houston soils are characterized
by the presence of large cracks that can easily displace surface materials. The area has been cultivated,
and this activity can also translocate materials. In addition to the lack of stratigraphic integrity, no cultural
features or subsistence remains occur at the location. It is unlikely that further work at the site would
contribute to our understanding of the prehistory of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or for SAL designation. No further work is
recommended.
41CW75
This site is composed of four spatially discrete concentrations of thermally altered cobbles and lithic
debitage (Figure 126). It is situated on the broad backslope of a ridge about 200 m west of an unnamed
tributary to Dry Creek. Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Wilson series (Lowther
and Werchan 1978). At the time of survey, these rocky Alfisols supported a mixture of common grasses
with patches of dense scrubby vegetation that includes cacti and mesquite. Ground surface visibility
ranged from approximately 40 percent or less in areas of thicket to 100 percent in bare areas. Elevation
ranges from 550 to 560 ft amsl.
The pedestrian survey crew encountered a small, exposed, burned rock and lithic debitage concentration.
This concentration appears as a slight mounded accumulation of fractured cobbles less than 30 cm in
height and approximately 5 m in diameter. Limited shovel testing was conducted adjacent to the
accumulation to determine the extent and depth of any subsurface deposits. These two shovel tests were
excavated down to 20 cmbs in dense, rocky soil, and yielded three pieces of unmodified lithic debitage at
a depth of less than 10 cmbs. The lack of soils in the vicinity of the site precluded further shovel testing.

Three other lithic concentrations were found in the vicinity. These ranged in size from approximately 2 m
square to more than 10 m square, and were composed of chert gravel. The concentrations appear to be
surficial and lack any evidence of organic soils. No diagnostic artifacts were found in association with
any of the concentrations, and no surface artifacts were collected. The rock accumulations may have been
constructed as a result of historic land-clearing efforts.
The function of the site is uncertain. It may represent the results of historic land-clearing practices. The
prehistoric materials appear to lack stratigraphic integrity, and there is an absence of diagnostic artifacts
or subsistence remains. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would contribute to our
understanding of the area’s prehistoric development. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site
should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. No further work is recommended.
41CW76
This is a historic site located on a backslope of a ridge at the upper reaches of Cedar Creek. Soils in the
area are taxonomically classified as Vertisols and have been mapped as belonging to the Houston series
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). At the time of the survey, the vegetation at the site consisted primarily of
pasture grasses with scattered clusters of scrub (Figure 127). The elevation of the site is approximately
560 ft amsl.
The site consists of structural remains and a surficial artifact scatter, and measures approximately
35 x 60 m (Figure 128). The structure is a single-story, frame domicile with a tin roof (Figure 129).
Modern gas and electric lines were once attached to the structure. Artifacts within the surface scatter,
which were observed but not collected, include construction debris, brick fragments, wire nails, glass
fragments, and earthenware. Collected artifacts include vessel glass (cobalt, solarized, milk glass, and
clear), bottle glass (whole and clear fragment with decal), metal hardware, and decorated and undecorated
ceramics. Eight shovel tests were excavated at the site, two of which were culturally positive yielding 15
pieces of vessel glass (aqua tint, amber, clear, and milk glass), 13 metal fragments, and 6 ceramic sherds.
All materials were recovered from depths of 0 to 30 cmbs. Temporally diagnostic artifacts include
solarized glass dating between 1890 and 1920, a screw-top clear jar and a brown screw-top medicinal
bottle both manufactured by the Brockway Machine Bottle Co. post 1925, a modern crown-cap green
bottle manufactured by Gallo Glass Company post 1966, and a soda bottle manufactured by Knox Glass
Bottle Co. between 1932 to 1953. Examples of artifacts recovered from 41CW76 are shown in Figures
130 and 131.
No structure is shown at the location on the 1936 General Highway Map of Caldwell County. A structure
is present, however, on the 1946 map along the newly constructed SH 29. The same structure appears on
the 1953 map.
The historic artifacts and pertinent map data indicate that the site likely dates to the mid-twentieth
century. Although over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal

This is a historic site situated on the summit of the dissected uplands east of Elm Creek. The clayey soils
at the site are mapped as belonging to the Heiden series (Lowther and Werchan 1978), characterized by a
rough, gravelly texture marked by larger stones and chunks. The site is located on a slope at the upper
reaches of the Withers Hollow drainage. Vegetation at the time of survey consisted of a single cluster of
oak trees surrounded by a broad field of tall prairie grass. Ground surface visibility around the site was
less than 10 percent at the time of survey because of the tall grass. Elevation is approximately 600 ft amsl.
The site is approximately 5 m in diameter and is represented by a brick-lined cistern, positioned among a
stand of oak trees (Figure 132). No surface artifact scatter was noted. A total of four shovel tests were
excavated around the cistern, and all tested negative for cultural resources. The cistern appears as a
slightly tapered cylinder, approximately 1 m high and 1.5 m in diameter, constructed of multiple courses
of machine-made bricks. Below ground surface, the cistern extends several meters in depth and is lined
with unfinished stones or bedrock. A dilapidated plank cover tops the empty cistern.
The 1908 San Marcos, Texas, 30-minute topographic map depicts a dwelling adjacent to the road in the
immediate vicinity of the cistern. A local informant residing on an adjacent property recalled that a house
once existed at the location, but that it had been moved to another property approximately 30 years ago.
An attempt to contact the landowner in order to obtain additional information regarding the history of the
property was unsuccessful. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should not be
considered for NRHP eligibility or SAL designation.

Caldwell County
41CW78
This is an extant historic farmstead located on the backslope of a Pleistocene-aged terrace at an elevation
of 537 ft amsl. Boggy Creek is 200 m west of the site. The soils that developed at the location are
Vertisols, mapped as Branyon clay (Lowther and Werchan 1978). The site is situated within an open
pasture vegetated with several varieties of grasses, ornamental cedars, and mesquite, affording ground
surface visibility of approximately 75 percent. Current land use for agricultural and ranching activities, as
well as erosion, may have adversely impacted the site.
The property includes a single-story wood-frame house. It is a side-gabled dwelling with a hall and parlor
plan and a full-width integral porch (Figure 133a). It has been modified with a central dormer, asbestos
siding, and a one-story room addition with flagstone veneer and casement widows. The house is fenced
by a fully machine-wrought iron fence that is secured in a mortar and brick foundation. About 5 m from

the north end of the house is a 1 x 2 m root cellar made of mortar and extruded brick, with a metal roof.
Approximately 20 m northeast of the house is a two-room shack (Figure 133b). Other modern
outbuildings are present. The area of the site measures about 40 x 50 m, not including the modern
outbuildings (Figure 134). No artifacts were observed except for a small midden of extruded bricks.
A structure is shown at this location on the 1908 USGS San Marcos topographic map, and the 1936 and
1953 TSHD Caldwell County General Highway Maps. According to an informant, the farmstead is
associated with A.L. Brock, a prominent rancher, and was constructed in the 1880s. Mr. Brock also built
several of Lockhart’s downtown commercial buildings, some of which are listed on the NRHP.
The structure is included in the SH 130 Historic Buildings Report (Adams and Foster 2001) as site No.
144. It was recommended as not eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion C, because alterations have
compromised the architectural integrity, and also recommended as not eligible under Criterion A, because
Mr. Brock’s significance in the local community is already represented in his commercial buildings
located in the Lockhart National Register District.
41CW79
This historic site is situated along the summit of a ridge overlooking the Clear Fork of Plum Creek, which
flows approximately 1 km to the northeast. Soils at the site are predominantly Heiden clay of the HeidenFerris association (Lowther and Werchan 1978). A prominent row of landscaped oak trees crosses the
site; the remaining vegetation consists of pasture grass. Ground surface visibility at the time of survey
ranged from approximately 20 percent in grassy areas to 90 percent along an unimproved access road on
the site’s southern edge. Elevation at the site ranges from approximately 600 to 620 ft amsl.
A sketch map of the site is provided on Figure 135. Systematic shovel testing at the site encountered very
few cultural artifacts. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated across the site, but only one was
positive.
A barbed wire fragment was recovered in Level 1. Level 2 yielded one amber glass vessel fragment, one
clear glass vessel fragment, two bone fragments, and one prehistoric lithic chert core. The conspicuous
line of oak trees, the level appearance of the hilltop, and the existence of a small cistern prompted a more
detailed inspection of the ground surface. Artifacts recovered from the site surface included a machinemade brick, a “Smith’s Pride” metal button (patented 1924), one clear glass vessel fragment, three flat
aqua glass fragments, a clear glass fragment from the base of jar made by the Owens Illinois Glass
Company sometime after 1980. The cistern was found to contain trash and the remains of several animals
(Figure 136). The site measures approximately 70 x 90 m.
The site is located on a property occupying the northeast corner of a “T” intersection that appears on the
1908 USGS San Marcos topographic map. Additionally, the map depicts a residential structure at this
location. Attempts to contact the landowner regarding further information on this historic site were
unsuccessful.

5: Site Descriptions

The historic artifacts and pertinent map data indicate that the site likely dates to between about 1900 and
1935. Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that 41CW79 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended.
41CW80
This is a prehistoric site occupying the lower slope of a Cretaceous-aged upland ridge at an elevation of
560 ft amsl. The nearest water source is an unnamed tributary of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek, 20 m west
of the site. The soils that developed at the location are Vertisols, mapped as Heiden clay (Lowther and
Werchan 1978). At the time of survey the site was covered by a variety of grasses, limiting ground
surface visibility to 30 to 50 percent. Moderate erosion, cattle ranching, and a two-track field road
running along the southern boundary may have adversely impacted the site.
The site was recorded when unmodified lithic debitage, early-stage bifaces, and tested cobbles were
observed on the ground surface. Eight shovel tests were excavated at the site, one of which was culturally
positive. One tertiary flake was found at a depth of 0–10 cmbs. The site measures about 80 x 140 m
(Figure 137).
This site is interpreted as being a lithic procurement area. Because the site lacks stratigraphic integrity,
diagnostic artifacts, subsistence data, and cultural features, it is unlikely that further investigations would
contribute to our understanding of the prehistory of the area. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator,
the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41CW81
This historic site is situated on the backslope of a Cretaceous-aged upland ridge overlooking Plum Creek,
400 m to the south. Elevation at the site’s nucleus is 470 ft amsl. The soils that developed at the location
are mapped as Heiden clay (Lowther and Werchan 1978). At the time of survey, the vegetation at the site
included mesquite and grasses, limiting ground surface visibility to less than 10 percent (Figure 138).
Site 41CW81 was initially identified based upon the presence of a large stock tank ringed by an artificial
berm. An examination of the surrounding area revealed foundation pier remnants. Removal of sections of
dense grass revealed a scatter of brick and mortar centralized around the artificial berm and the
foundation piers. A distinct depression, possibly an in-filled well or privy, was located 14 m southeast of
the foundation piers. A large junk pile, consisting of twentieth–century garbage such as tires, bed frames,
and broken glass, was located 28 m east of the depression. A two-track road runs through the southern
portion of the site. Subsequent shovel testing determined the site size to be roughly 40 x 80 m.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

A total of 32 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals (Figure 139). Twelve of these were culturally
positive. All artifacts were found below ground surface to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs. Although 7
pieces of prehistoric lithic debitage were found, the majority of the recovered artifacts appear to be related
to the presence of the earlier structure. Historic artifacts include 51 pieces of glass (7 amethyst, 4 aqua
tint, 2 brown, 1 green, 2 cobalt, 1 milk glass, and 34 clear, including a small embossed body shard); 22
ceramic vessel fragments (9 plain whiteware, 1 decorated whiteware, 1 earthenware, and 11 pieces of a
German-made porcelain cup with maker’s mark); 18 brick and mortar fragments; 22 metal artifacts (6
wire nails and 3 nail fragments, 1 flat screw, 2 staples, 1 buckle latch, 2 battery cells, 7 miscellaneous
metal fragments); 1 small fragment of rope; and 18 unidentified bone fragments. Examples of the artifacts
are shown on Figure 140.
Diagnostic artifacts within the historic artifact assemblage suggest an early-to-mid-twentieth-century
occupation. Wire nails came into use after 1890. Amethyst glass generally dates to sometime between
1890 and 1920, while the maker’s mark on the porcelain cup points to a post-1921 manufacturing date.
These dates are in agreement with archival information in that the 1908 USGS San Marcos topographic
map shows three structures in the vicinity. A further review of the 1936, 1946, and 1953 TSHD General
Highway Maps from Caldwell County also revealed a structure in the vicinity of the site. Unfortunately,
attempts to contact the landowner regarding the history of the property were unsuccessful.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that 41CW81 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended.
41CW82
This is a prehistoric site located on the backslope of a Cretaceous-aged upland ridge. The site is at an
elevation of 500 ft (152 m) and overlooks Plum Creek, approximately 500 m to the south. The soils at the
location are mapped as Heiden clay (Lowther and Werchan 1978). The site is situated in a predominantly
oak forest with medium grasses, affording poor ground surface visibility, estimated at less than 5 percent
(Figure 141).
The site was located by shovel testing. A total of 14 shovel tests were excavated. Of these, 5 were
culturally positive, yielding 2 utilized flakes and 6 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage. Six of the
artifacts were found at depths of less than 10 cmbs. The other two were found between 20 and 30 cmbs,
but were probably vertically dislocated in the large cracks that occur in Heiden soils. Because of poor
surface visibility, no artifacts were observed on the ground surface. Site size, estimated from the shovel
test results, is 15 x 45 m (Figure 142).
Because the site lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, subsistence data, and cultural features, it
is unlikely that further investigations would contribute to our understanding of the prehistory of the area.

5: Site Descriptions

In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or
designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41CW83
This is a prehistoric site located on Holocene-aged T1 and T2 terraces on the north side of the San Marcos
River. The site was discovered during exploratory mechanical trenching of alluvial deposits within the
SH 130 ROW. Soils at the site have been mapped as belonging to the Bosque and Lewisville series
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). Bosque soils are taxonomically classified as Cumulic Haplustolls, which
are freely drained, dark, base-rich grassland soils (Mollisols) that developed in calcareous alluvium.
Lewisville soils are taxonomically classified as Udic Calciustolls, which are well-drained, carbonate-rich
Mollisols that formed in ancient (late Pleistocene or older) loamy and calcareous alluvium.
Vegetation at the site at the time of the survey included grasses, shrubs, and mature pecan trees (Figure
143). Surface visibility averaged about 30 percent or less. Surface elevation ranged from about 440 to
460 ft amsl. There were no readily visible preexisting impacts to the site area, although plowing is likely
to have occurred during the cotton-producing era.
The investigations at the site identified four spatially discrete areas containing prehistoric artifacts,
designated areas A–D (Figure 144). A total of 14 trenches and 56 shovel tests were excavated to delimit
and investigate the site. Based on the results of the trenching and shovel testing, the site’s size is
estimated to be approximately 200 x 250 m, oriented in a crescent shape along the terrace edges.
Areas A and B contain apparently intact prehistoric hearths. Both of these areas are on the first, or T1,
terrace. Area A was discovered when prehistoric artifacts and apparent hearthstones were observed
eroding from the terrace about 30 m north of the San Marcos River (Figure 145a). Four shovel tests were
placed around the feature at 2-m intervals. Two of the shovel tests yielded thermally altered rocks, mussel
shells, animal bones, charcoal, and lithic debitage from depths of 30 to 60 cmbs.
Area B is identified by a stone-lined, basin-shaped hearth unearthed in Trench 8 at a depth of
approximately 50–60 cmbs (Ab horizon) (Figure 145b). The feature, approximately 20 cm thick and
60 cm in length, was visible in the west wall of the trench and appeared to have been only slightly
impacted by the trench. Numerous thermally altered limestone and chert cobbles and charcoal were
visible, and a sample of these materials was collected, along with two mussel shells. A tarp was placed
against the hearth, and the trench was backfilled. As the hearth was only examined in a trench wall
profile, additional controlled excavations would be required for a detailed description of its extent and
construction. Seven shovel tests were excavated at 5-m intervals around the feature. All were negative.
Five backhoe trenches (Trenches 1, 2, 3, 13, and 14) were excavated outside the site boundaries in the
modern floodplain. No evidence of cultural remains was encountered in the Bosque series alluvium to a
depth of over 2 m, so no shovel tests were placed in the floodplain.

5: Site Descriptions

Five backhoe trenches (Trenches 4–8) were excavated on the T1 terrace within the site boundaries. The
profile description compiled below for Trench 4 is representative of the subsurface deposits in the T1
terrace.
STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE DESCRIPTION, T1 TERRACE, TRENCH 4, SOUTHEASTERN WALL, 41CW83
0−25 cmbs: Stratum 1, A horizon; medium bedded; clear smooth boundary; very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) clay; medium moderate angular blocky structure; friable (moist); many roots.
Modern alluvium.
25−100 cmbs: Stratum 2, Ab horizon; thick bedded; clear wavy boundary; very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) clayey silt; medium moderate angular blocky structure; friable (moist); few
Rabdotus snail shells. Late Holocene alluvium.
100−250 cmbs: Stratum 3; IIA2 horizon; lower boundary not encountered; very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) silt; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable. Holocene alluvium.

Areas C and D occur on the T2 terrace in areas mapped as containing Lewisville soils. Both areas are
identified based on sparse prehistoric artifacts found at depths of less than 50 cmbs in two trenches
(Trenches 10 and 11). The artifacts found in Trench 10 consist of one piece of unmodified debitage and
one core recovered from a depth of approximately 50 cmbs. Ten shovel tests were placed within 10 m of
the trench. No additional cultural materials were recovered. The stratigraphic profile compiled for Trench
10 is representative of the profiles of the four trenches (Trenches 9, 10, 11, and 12) excavated into the T2
terrace at the site and is described below.
STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE DESCRIPTION, T2 TERRACE, TRENCH 10, NORTHWEST WALL, 41CW83
0−20 cmbs: Ap horizon; medium bedded; clear wavy boundary; very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2) silty clay; weak fine angular blocky structure; friable; roots common.
20−55 cmbs: Bk horizon; thick bedded; clear wavy boundary; brown (10YR 4/3) silt; weak fine
subangular blocky structure; friable; carbonate nodules less that 1 cm in diameter.
55−210 cmbs: Bt horizon; lower boundary not encountered; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay; medium
moderate blocky structure; firm.

Area D was identified in Trench 11, where two thermally altered pieces of chert were uncovered at a
depth of about 40 cmbs. Nine shovel tests were placed within 10 m of the trench. One test, located about
5 m north of the trench, produced three burned rock fragments from a depth of 50–60 cmbs.
The site is interpreted as representing a campsite. Based on the presence of in situ cultural features in
Areas A and B, it is likely that further work at the site could contribute to our understanding of the area’s
prehistory. Additional investigations at 41CW83 could contribute to our understanding of the prehistoric
people who inhabited the area. It is thus the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41CW83
possesses considerable research potential, and if the construction of the SH 130 roadway precludes
preservation/avoidance, a program of archaeological testing should be developed for the site to determine
its NRHP and SAL eligibility.

41CW86
This prehistoric site is situated on the lower backslope of a ridge overlooking an unnamed tributary to
Little West Fork Creek. Soils in the vicinity of the site have been mapped as belonging to the Houston
Black clay and Heiden series (Lowther and Werchan 1978). These are Vertisols characterized by having a
clayey texture and subject to shrinking and swelling. Vegetation at the site at the time of survey included
sparse mixed grasses with mesquite trees, which afforded ground surface visibility estimated at 90 percent
(Figure 146a). Elevation at the site is approximately 600 ft amsl. Preexisting impacts include land
clearing, overgrazing, and erosion.
The site was first recorded when tested cobbles, hammerstones, and cores derived from locally available
lag gravels were observed on the ground surface (Figure 146b). No diagnostic items were observed, and
no surficial artifacts were collected. Twenty-eight shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of
50 cmbs at the site. All were culturally sterile. Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site measures
approximately 135 x 175 m (Figure 147).
The site is interpreted as being a lithic procurement area. It lacks time-diagnostic artifacts, features, and
subsistence remains, and has no stratigraphic integrity. It is unlikely that additional work at the site would
contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41CW87
This is a multicomponent site situated on a gradual eroded slope 100 m southwest of Little West Fork
Creek. Soils in the vicinity of the site have been mapped as belonging to the Heiden and Houston Black
clay series (Lowther and Werchan 1978). These soils are Vertisols, which are clayey soils subject to
shrinking and swelling. Vegetation at the site includes mesquite, prickly pear, short grasses, and a small
cleared area around the site, affording ground surface visibility of approximately 85 to 100 percent.
Elevation at the site nucleus is approximately 490 ft amsl.
The site was first recorded when prehistoric and historical artifacts were observed on the ground surface.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs or a culturally sterile substrate in
order to assess the site’s subsurface characteristics (Figure 148). Only one shovel test was positive,
yielding a blue glass fragment from 0–10 cmbs. The prehistoric component appears to be a lithic
procurement area consisting of several tested chert cobbles and one bifacial core that is confined to the
northeastern portion of the site. The site also includes a historical surface scatter consisting of glass (clear,
solarized, cobalt, and brown), ceramics (salt-glazed and whiteware), wire nails, bolts, pipes, bricks, and
concrete fragments. Two types of bricks were observed: white and red with a “D HANIS” stamp,
manufactured by D’Hanis Brick and Tile Company, dating back no earlier than 1906 (Steinbomer 1982).
None of the surficial artifacts were collected. Structural components present consist of concrete
foundations with iron struts and a stone and concrete pillar foundation (Figure 149), likely the remnants

of a farm workshop, as no archival evidence suggests any commercial enterprise on this property. There is
also an intact wooden corral located approximately 100 m northeast of the foundations. The historic
component at the site measures about 125 x 390 m, while the prehistoric component is smaller, with
dimensions of approximately 65 x 90 m.
The historical artifacts may be related to one or both of the structures shown on the historical maps. This
would suggest an early- to mid-twentieth-century time frame for the historical component of the site.
There are no architecturally significant structures or intact archaeological historical features. The
historical component at 41CW87 does not meet any of the criteria necessary for listing on the NRHP or
designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended by the Principal Investigator.
The prehistoric component lacks time-diagnostic artifacts, features, subsistence remains, and significant
buried cultural deposits. It is unlikely that additional work on either component of the site would
contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory/history. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No
further work is recommended.
41CW88
This is a multicomponent site situated on the toeslope of a ridge 120 m northwest of an unnamed tributary
of Little West Fork Creek. Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Heiden series
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). Vegetation at the site at the time of the survey included dense mesquite and
prickly pear and other cacti, affording ground surface visibility of approximately 30 percent (Figure
150a). Adverse impacts include erosion, the construction of an artificial pond, and electric transmission
line construction. Elevation of the site is approximately 500 ft (152 m) amsl.
The site was first recorded when prehistoric artifacts were observed on the ground surface. An earlytwentieth-century artifact surface scatter, consisting of whiteware, glass, and metal fragments, and a 1942
license plate, was also encountered (Figure 150b). Surface-collected artifacts include one biface, one
chopper, one utilized flake, one piece of unmodified lithic debitage, and one plain whiteware sherd. The
site is within a small triangular-shaped area bounded by a stock tank, a property boundary, and County
Road 110. It steeply slopes towards the stock tank. Because of these disturbances and topographic
restrictions and the limited potential of the area to contain intact or buried prehistoric archaeological sites,
only four shovel tests were excavated. One test produced a single piece of unmodified debitage from a
depth of 0–10 cmbs; the other three shovel tests were negative. The historic component at the site
measured only 5 x 10 m; the dimensions of the prehistoric component were about 20 x 40 m (Figure 151).
Archival map research confirms a farm complex at this site as early as 1911 (USGS 1911). A farmstead is
also depicted on the 1936, 1946, and 1953 TSHD Caldwell County General Highway Maps. The 1963
USGS Lockhart North 7.5-minute topographic map does not show a structure at this location. Deed
research indicates that site 41CW88 is part of the J.D. Dial ¼-league survey patented in 1841 southwest
of Lockhart. In 1894 Robert Martindale subdivided the acreage into 13 lots (Caldwell County Deed

Records 17:101). He sold Lots 2, 3, and 4, each containing 100 acres, to August Ulbricht in 1895 for
$4,500. By 1918 the Ulbricht heirs mortgaged the 300-acre tract to the State Bank & Trust Company, San
Marcos, Texas, for $20,000 (Caldwell County Deed Records 63:252). After this time, the ownership of
the 300 acres is unresolved.
The prehistoric component at the site lacks cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, and subsistence remains
and does not possess stratigraphic integrity. It is unlikely that additional work at the site would contribute
to our understanding of the area’s prehistory/ history. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the
site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41CW89
This is a multicomponent site situated on the summit of a Cretaceous-aged ridge 0.5 mile south of Plum
Creek. The soils are mapped as belonging to the Houston and Heiden series (Lowther and Werchan
1978). At the time of the survey, the vegetation at the site consisted of short pastureland grasses and
mature pecan trees (Figure 152). Ground surface visibility was estimated to be approximately 60 to
70 percent. Adverse impacts to the site include erosion, plowing, and land clearing. Elevation at the site
nucleus is approximately 608 ft amsl.
Site 41CW89 was recorded when a scatter of historic and prehistoric artifacts was observed on the
surface. Early-twentieth-century historical artifacts consisted of ceramic whiteware and crockery, glass
(blue, green, brown, clear, and melted), red machine-made bricks, concrete, a bottle cork, boot heels,
aluminum cans, and wire nails. A well made of machine-made red bricks and cement mortar lies in the
center of one artifact scatter. It measures 10 x 12 ft, and at least 10 ft deep. The other scatter on the slopes
below indicates mechanical clearing of the field for modern plowing (Figure 153).
A prehistoric component, consisting of a bifacial core and several pieces of unmodified lithic debitage
within a 2-m radius, was also observed. No surficial artifacts were collected. Twenty-one shovel tests
were excavated across the area to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs or a culturally sterile substrate in an
attempt to define the site area. The shallow termination depth reflects the nondepositional nature of the
landform. All shovel tests were culturally sterile except one, which contained a fragment of earlytwentieth-century bottle glass. There was no concentration of prehistoric artifacts, and the historical
materials were readily visible on the surface since this site appears to have been impacted by bulldozing,
plowing, and erosion. The historic component measured about 30 x 110 m. The dimensions of the
prehistoric component were approximately 105 x 115 m.
This site is not depicted on the 1911 USGS San Marcos 30-minute topographic quadrangle. It is depicted
on the 1936, 1946, and TSHD 1953 Caldwell County General Highway Maps. A structure is shown in the
vicinity of this site on the 1963 USGS Lockhart North 7.5-minute topographic map.

5: Site Descriptions

Site 41CW89 is located on approximately 49 acres in the original W.C. Williams survey patented in 1841
and situated northwest of Lockhart and south of Plum Creek. The tract is a very small part of a much
larger tract that was subdivided multiple times among multiple owners. The archival map research on this
site indicates a farmstead at this location on twentieth-century maps. The well and historical artifacts
probably relate to a farmstead no longer extant on the property. Since 41CW89 and 41CW90 are located
on the same small tract, it appears likely that the two sites are related.
The historic artifacts are related to a farmstead that was in existence from sometime between 1911 and
1936, until after 1963. It appears to be associated with the Ulbricht family. No architectural components
are present at the location. The historic component at the site does not meet any of the criteria necessary
for listing on the NRHP or designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended.
The prehistoric component lacks cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, and subsistence remains, and does
not possess stratigraphic integrity. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator it should not be considered
for NRHP eligibility or designated as an SAL. No further work is recommended.
41CW90
This is a historic site located on the upper backslope of a Cretaceous-aged ridge overlooking Plum Creek
approximately 1.2 km to the north. The soils at the site are mapped as belonging to the Heiden series
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). These are Vertisols, which are clayey soils subject to shrinking and
swelling. At the time of the survey the vegetation in the area consisted of short pasture grasses, affording
ground surface visibility of 40–50 percent. Adverse impacts to the site include erosion and cultivation.
Elevation of the site is approximately 540 ft amsl.
Site 41CW90 was discovered when three extant structures and a concrete water tank were identified. An
associated historical artifact scatter observed in the surrounding area included clear and solarized glass,
decorated whiteware, and crockery. Eleven shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs
or a culturally sterile substrate to search for subsurface cultural deposits (Figure 154). One shovel test was
culturally positive, yielding a single clear glass fragment from 0 to 10 cmbs. No artifacts were collected
from the site. The size of the site is estimated to be approximately 90 x 160 m.
Structure 1 measures 25 x 50 ft and is 16 ft high; it is situated in the center of the site. It is a wood-frame
outbuilding with green tarpaper siding and a metal roof (Figure 155a). On the west side is an attached
lean-to. Immediately to the west of the lean-to, large engine parts and trailer tires are scattered about.
Another scatter of metal parts is located less than 5 m east of the shed. Directly south of Structure 1 is a
much larger scatter, approximately 50 m in diameter, of modern farm equipment and metal pipes. Two
additional structures are located approximately 40 m north of Structure 1. Structure 2 measures 10 x 16 ft
and is 7 ft high; it is made of corrugated metal. A rusted John Deere tractor is 10 m southeast of the
structure. Structure 3 is 10 m west of Structure 2; it measures 10 x 20 ft and is 7 ft high and is made of
both wood and metal. Structures 2 and 3 are in serious disrepair. No concrete slab or foundation piers
were observed, though a large round concrete water tank filled with debris lies approximately 20 m

northwest of Structure 1. The fragmentary, partially collapsed, and rotting remains of what appeared to be
a four-wheel wooden farm wagon with metal wheels is located 15 m north of the cistern (Figure 155b).
The wagon remains were in very poor condition and could not be identified as to type, manufacturer, or
date of construction.
A structure is shown at this location on the current 1963 USGS Lockhart North 7.5-minute topographic
map. Other historical maps, including the 1936, 1946, and 1953 TSHD Caldwell County General
Highway Maps, depict a farmstead in the immediate vicinity of this site. This farmstead does not appear
on the 1911 USGS San Marcos 30-minute quadrangle map. Artifacts and farm machinery observed at the
location suggest the farm complex was occupied during the early to mid-twentieth century.
As noted in the previous description for site 41CW89, site 41CW90 is located on the same 49-acre tract in
the W.C. Williams survey patented in 1841, northwest of Lockhart and south of Plum Creek. A farmstead
is shown at this location on twentieth-century maps. The historical artifacts observed at this site suggest a
twentieth-century occupation. Since 41CW89 and 41CW90 are located on the same small tract, it appears
likely that the two sites are related.
The archival evidence indicates the estimated period of occupation is early to mid-twentieth century.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that 41CW90 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended.

Guadalupe County
41GU70
This is a prehistoric site situated on the backslope of a Cretaceous-aged ridge. The site overlooks York
Creek, which is approximately 2 km to the northwest. Ferris and Heiden series soils cover most of the
locale, though an irregular-shaped area of Burleson gravelly clay also occurs at the site (Ramsey and
Bade 1977). Vegetation is composed of grasses and scrubby vegetation. Ground surface visibility at the
time of survey ranged from 50 to 100 percent in exposed areas. Elevation is approximately 500–540 ft
amsl across the site.
The site was recorded when a scatter of lithic debitage, tested cobbles, and cores was observed on the
ground surface. Surface-collected artifacts consist of one chopper, one bifacially worked core, and one
hammerstone. Six shovel tests were systematically excavated across the site. All were culturally sterile.
Based on the extent of the surface artifacts, the site measures approximately 210 x 300 m. It likely
extends beyond the limits of the ROW (Figure 156).
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, cultural
features, and diagnostic artifacts. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would contribute to our

understanding of the area’s prehistory. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should
not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41GU71
This is a multicomponent site located on a ridge summit in the Mill Creek Hills about 100 m west of the
headwaters of Brushy Creek. The Mill Creek Hills form the divide between the San Marcos River basin to
the north and the Guadalupe River basin to the south. Soils at the site have been mapped as Houston
Black gravelly clay (Ramsey and Bade 1977). Abundant chert gravel was observed in the cutbanks of a
shallow drainage that bisects the site, running roughly parallel with the project area (Figure 157).
Vegetation at the site is a mix of oak and mesquite woodland and grass with briar and other thorny
vegetation. Ground surface visibility ranges from 50 to 70 percent in open areas. Elevation at the site is
approximately 625 ft amsl.
The site consists of a surface scatter of prehistoric lithics and a historic trash dump. Pieces of lithic
debitage were encountered in the gravelly bed of the ephemeral drainage. Numerous large cortical flakes,
tested cobbles, lithic cores, and crude bifaces were noted, and suggest the location was a lithic
procurement area. Historic artifacts were also encountered and include blue-enameled crockery,
whiteware, bricks, and ferrous metal fragments. Surface-collected artifacts consist of two sherds of
decorated stoneware and one large piece of decorated metal. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated
across the site, none of which were culturally positive. The site measures approximately 75 x 270 m
(Figure 158).
A review of historic maps revealed the presence of two structures located less than 500 m northwest of
the trash dump on the USGS 1908 San Marcos quadrangle map. These two structures are also present on
the 1936, 1946, and 1952 editions of the TSHD General Highway Maps of Guadalupe County. It is
possible that historic trash at the site is related to the structures present on these maps.
The prehistoric component is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement and early-stage stone tool
manufacturing site. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence
data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would increase our understanding of the prehistoric
development of the area.
The historic component at the site, although over 50 years of age, is not known to be associated with
significant events or persons. No standing structures remain at the location. It is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL.
No further work is recommended.
41GU72
This is a multicomponent site on the backslope of a ridge in the Mill Creek Hills about 100 m west of

5: Site Descriptions

The vegetation at the location consists primarily of scattered oak, juniper, and cacti. Ground surface
visibility was approximately 50 percent. Elevation at the site ranges from approximately 600 to 620 ft
amsl.
Site 41GU72 contains two components: a historic outbuilding with a trash scatter, and a prehistoric lithic
scatter. The historic component consists of a framed outbuilding with a corrugated metal roof, a bricklined cistern (Figure 159a), and a corral constructed of railroad ties. Additionally, a sparse scatter of bottle
glass, undecorated earthenware, and metal, including a draft animal harness chain (Figure 159b) and
miscellaneous metal fragments was noted near the structure. Diagnostic artifacts collected from the scatter
include floral decalcomania dating from between 1890 and 1930, solarized glass from between 1890 and
1920, and a bottle made by the Owens Glass Company from between 1930 and 1970 (Figure 160). The
prehistoric component consists of three bifaces. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated at regular
intervals across the site. Two of the shovel tests were positive for a mix of cultural materials from 0 to
50 cmbs including undecorated ceramics, aqua tint glass, milk glass, one wire nail, and lithic debitage.
Shovel Test 1 produced a fragment of white earthenware at 40 cmbs and a single piece of debitage at
50 cmbs. These occurrences are probably the result of artifacts being vertically displaced through the
large cracks that can occur in Heiden soils. Both components at the site occupy an area of approximately
110 x 110 m (Figure 161).
An attempt to procure information regarding the historical background of site 41GU72 from the
landowner of the site was unsuccessful. Historic map research revealed that a structure existed at the
location in 1908 (USGS 1908 San Marcos topographic map).
The prehistoric component can only be interpreted as a location. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic
artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would
increase our understanding of the prehistoric development of the area.
The historic component, although over 50 years of age, is not known to be associated with persons or
events that were significant to the history of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the
site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41GU73
This is a prehistoric site situated on the upper backslope of a ridge in the Mill Creek Hills about 150 m
west of an unnamed tributary of Mill Creek. Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the
Crockett association (Ramsey and Bade 1977). Vegetation at the site at the time of the survey consisted of
scattered mixed oak and juniper, as well as cacti and sparse grasses (Figure 162a). Ground surface
visibility was approximately 90 percent. Elevation at the site ranges from 660 to 670 ft amsl.
The site was initially detected as a surface scatter of artifacts. Systematic shovel testing and surface
observations delineated the site within the ROW as measuring approximately 60 x 160 m (Figure 163).

5: Site Descriptions

The site appears to extend beyond the limits of the ROW. Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 20 cmbs in 9
of the 23 shovel tests. A biface, three utilized flakes, a dart point fragment, one piece of fire-cracked rock,
one core fragment, and 31 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage were collected from the shovel tests. One
collected utilized flake, the biface, and the dart point fragment are shown on Figure 162b. The center of
the site has been impacted by the excavation of a shallow borrow pit.
The site is interpreted as having been a prehistoric campsite. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic
artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would
increase our understanding of the prehistoric development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No
further work is recommended.
41GU74
This is a prehistoric site situated on the backslope of a ridge about 75 m south of the headwaters of Mill
Creek. Soils at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade
1977). Vegetation at the location during the time of the survey consisted of oak, juniper, mesquite, cacti,
and grasses (Figure 164). Ground surface visibility averaged about 60 to 75 percent. Elevation at the site
ranges from 750 to 775 ft amsl. Adverse impacts to the site include severe erosion, resulting in exposed
clay in several areas across the site.
The site was recorded when three pieces of lithic debitage and a biface fragment were observed on the
ground surface. Twenty shovel tests were excavated to define the site’s extent. All 20 shovel tests were
culturally sterile. The site is defined based on the areal extent of the surficial lithic scatter as
encompassing an area within the SH 130 ROW measuring approximately 75 x 120 m (Figure 165). The
site appears to extend to the southeast beyond the ROW.
The site can only be interpreted as having been a prehistoric location. It lacks stratigraphic integrity,
diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the
location would increase our understanding of the prehistoric development of the area. It is the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a
SAL. No further work is recommended.
41GU75
This is a prehistoric site located on the backslope of a ridge in the Mill Creek Hills. An unnamed tributary
to Mill Creek is located approximately 60 m to the southwest. Soils are mapped as Crockett gravelly
sandy loam throughout most of the site, with Uhland clayey loam bottomland soils along the drainage
(Ramsey and Bade 1977). The site is situated among oak and mesquite woodlands that have been
transected by numerous firebreaks. Ground surface visibility at the time of survey ranged from 0 to
80 percent, with the best visibility occurring in the fire breaks. Elevation at the site is approximately
615 ft amsl.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

The site was found at the junction of two 20-ft-wide firebreaks cut in the vegetation. The observed artifact
scatter consists of tested cobbles, a hammerstone, lithic debitage, and a concentration of lithic debitage
(including secondary and tertiary debitage), none of which were collected. Nine shovel tests were
excavated, none of which tested positive for cultural resources. The site measures approximately
50 x 50 m based on the surface artifact scatter (Figure 166).
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area where some early stage stone tool
production took place. It lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, and
subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would increase our understanding of
the prehistoric development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site should
not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended.
41GU76
This is a prehistoric site located on the summit and backslope of a ridge overlooking the San Marcos
River. The river is approximately 2 km to the northeast of the site. Houston Black clay and Crockett
gravelly sandy loam soils occur at the location (Ramsey and Bade 1977), with the latter appearing as
small, irregular-shaped areas containing chert pebbles and cobbles. At the time of the survey the site was
partially covered in sparse pasture grasses and partially under cultivation (Figure 167). Surface visibility
ranged from 80 percent in the pasture to 100 percent in the plowed portion of the site. Elevation is
approximately 555 ft amsl.
The site was located by surface observation. Prehistoric artifacts observed scattered on the site surface
included tested cobbles, cores, and debitage, none of which were collected. Twenty-one shovel tests were
excavated across the site; all were culturally sterile. Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the site
occupies an area measuring approximately 150 x 250 m (Figure 168).
Site 41GU76 is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. Some early-stage stone tool
production also took place there. The site lacks stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, cultural
features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would increase our
understanding of the prehistoric development of the area. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that the site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.
41GU77
This is a historic site consisting of an outbuilding and scattered modern debris in a pasture approximately
360 m south of US 90 and 1.5 km east of Geronimo Creek. The soils are mapped as belonging to the
Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade 1977). These are Paleustalfs, which have a calcic horizon within 1.5 m
of the surface and formed in landforms older than the Holocene. At the time of survey, the site was
located in an overgrown field containing sparse mixed grasses and scrubby vegetation that afforded good

surface visibility, estimated at 80–100 percent. The elevation of the site is approximately 550 ft (168 m)
amsl.
Site 41GU77 consists of a small, cedar post-framed shed with a corrugated tin roof and walls (Figure
169a). Five shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs on a north-south line near the
shed; all were culturally sterile. A random surface inspection uncovered bowling pins, windowpane glass,
sheet metal, metal signs, and a modern 1970 license plate, most of which may be modern debris. No
surface artifacts were collected. A metal water tank and concrete steps are located near the corrugatedsteel and wood shed (Figure 169b). These structures may also be modern. The site measures about 40 m
in diameter (Figure 170). No evidence of a domicile was observed at the location.
Archival research did not reveal a structure in this location on the 1911 San Marcos 30-minute quadrangle
map, or the later 1936 and 1946 TSHD Guadalupe County General Highway Maps. A structure first
appears on the 1952 TSHD Guadalupe County General Highway Map. This would suggest a midtwentieth-century time frame for this site.
Site 41GU77 was located on part of the nineteenth-century Benjamin Fuqua League and Labor and
headright augmentation. Fuqua was granted the land on June 14, 1832. The land has had several owners
since the nineteenth century. The cultural deposits recorded as site 41GU77 are probably associated with
the occupation of James Ander, who purchased the land from his brother H.R. Ander in 1945.
The artifact scatter is surficial and mostly modern. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the
site does not meet any of the criteria necessary for listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL, and no
further work is recommended at this site.
41GU78
This is a historic site located approximately 75 m north of an unnamed tributary of Mill Creek. The soils
at the location have been mapped as belonging to the Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade 1977). These are
Paleustalfs, which have a calcic horizon within 1.5 m of the surface and formed in landforms older than
the Holocene. Vegetation includes scrub brush, mixed grasses, and a few large oak trees, which afforded
ground surface visibility of approximately 60 percent (Figure 171). Adverse impacts to the site include
plowing and erosion. The elevation of the site is about 530 ft amsl.
Site 41GU78 was discovered by surface inspection. No cultural features or structures were observed. Ten
shovel tests excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs encountered no subsurface materials.
Approximate site size measures 40 x 50 m (Figure 172). Artifacts collected from the site surface include
Albany slipped stoneware, milk glass, solarized glass including a solarized apothecary bottle fragment,
two dark amber snuff bottle neck fragments, and a “Frozen Charlotte” porcelain doll body made between
1860 and 1900 (Figure 173).

The apothecary bottle fragment is made of solarized glass and probably represents less than one-third of
the original vessel. The remaining side panel contains the letters “ASS.” and a “4” is on the bottom. Such
bottles were typically manufactured in the late nineteenth century. Solarized glass dates from 1890 to
1920.
Attempts to contact the landowner regarding the history of the site were unsuccessful. A farmstead is
shown in this vicinity on the USGS 1911 San Marcos 30-minute topographic quadrangle. A structure is
not visible on the 1936 TSHD Guadalupe County General Highway Map, but the 1946 and 1952
Guadalupe General Highway Maps show an extant structure in the vicinity. The land is part of the
original William Griffin Survey.
The historic artifacts and pertinent map data indicate that the site likely dates to the early to mid-twentieth
century. Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events
or persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that 41GU78 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and
no further work is recommended.
41GU79
This is a historic site scatter located on a ridge summit, approximately 200 m northeast of an intermittent
tributary to Mill Creek. The soils are mapped as belonging to the Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade
1977). These are Paleustalfs, which have a calcic horizon within 1.5 m of the surface, and formed in
landforms older than the Holocene. Vegetation includes johnsongrass, cacti, and scrub brush. Surface
visibility was approximately 80 percent at the time of the survey. Adverse impacts to the site include
plowing and erosion. The site elevation is about 520 ft amsl.
The site was first recorded when historical and modern artifacts were observed on the ground surface
adjacent to two modern structures. A total of 22 shovel tests, including 3 shovel tests excavated adjacent
to the structures, encountered no subsurface cultural material (Figure 174). Surface artifacts observed but
not collected include stoneware, whiteware, and bottle glass fragments. Collected surficial artifacts
include a Coca-Cola bottle opener, one sherd of flow blue transferware, two pink Depression glass
fragments, a green tint glass bottle base, three pieces of embossed clear glass, one fragment of clear glass
with an applied decal, one large fragment of selenium-solarized vessel glass, and one embossed brown
bottle base. Among the artifact assemblage, diagnostic artifacts include the blue transferware, which has a
manufacture date between 1820 and 1860, pink Depression glass dating between 1920 and 1930, one
clear Owens-Illinois embossed clear bottle base dating to 1951 (Florence 1987; Stelle 2001), and one
brown Anchor Hocking bottle base dated post 1938 (Toulouse 1971) (Figure 175). A resident landowner
informed the survey crew that a small domicile thought to be associated with the artifacts was moved to
its present-day location from a nearby Air Force base in the 1930s. Site size is approximated to be
75 x 200 m east to west.

5: Site Descriptions

This historical site may be associated with a farmstead depicted on the 1911 USGS San Marcos
30-minute topographic quadrangle. A structure is not visible on the 1936 TSHD Guadalupe County
General Highway Map, but the 1946 and 1952 Guadalupe County General Highway Maps show another
structure that may be in the immediate vicinity. The land is part of the original William Griffin Survey.
The single small (less than 1 x 1 cm) ceramic fragment tentatively identified as blue transferware could
have a manufacture date as early as the nineteenth century. However, all of the other observed and
collected artifacts are modern, and there is no significant evidence that the site dates to such an early
occupation.
The landowner was contacted by the Principal Investigator requesting information on the history of the
property. The property is part of a 50-acre tract of land and is currently known as the Merriwether Estates.
Harry Merriwether (the landowner’s great-great-grandfather) owned and farmed the land around 1900. It
is likely that the historic artifacts observed at the location during the survey were associated with the
Merriwether homestead. The original farm has been subdivided among several descendants.
The historic artifacts and pertinent map data indicate that the site is associated with structures that existed
in the location between about 1900 and 1936. Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to
be associated with significant events or persons. No standing structures remain at the location. Therefore,
it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that 41GU79 does not meet the criteria for NRHP eligibility
or for designation as a SAL, and no further work is recommended.
41GU80
This is a prehistoric site situated on a relatively level, eroded upland landform approximately 300 m
southeast of an unnamed drainage of the San Marcos River. The soils at the site are mapped as belonging
to the Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade 1977). These are taxonomically classified as Paleustalfs, which
have a calcic horizon within 1.5 m of the surface, and formed in landforms older than the early Holocene.
Vegetation at the time of survey consisted of pasture grasses, affording ground surface visibility of 40 to
60 percent (Figure 176). Adverse impacts include erosion and the construction of a stock pond in the
northern portion of the site. Elevation of the site is approximately 540 ft amsl.
Site 41GU80 was first recorded when tested cobbles, cores, and unmodified lithic debitage were observed
on the surface. Twenty-eight shovel tests were excavated to further delineate the site boundaries. All were
culturally negative. Artifacts observed on the surface were not collected. All artifacts were confined to the
eroded gravel outcropping. Site size, based on the extent of the surface artifacts, is approximately
130 x 270 m (Figure 177).
The site is interpreted as having been a lithic procurement area. Because of the lack of stratigraphic
integrity, cultural features, diagnostics, and subsistence data, as well as the extremely disturbed nature of
the area, it is unlikely that further research would contribute to our understanding of the area’s prehistory.

It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that this site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility
or SAL designation. No further work is recommended.
41GU81
This is a historic structure located on a hill summit approximately 300 m west of a tributary of the San
Marcos River. This structure was not recorded during the prior architectural survey. Therefore, it was
recorded during the archaeological survey to ensure completeness of the cultural resources inventory
effort. The elevation is 540 ft amsl. The soils in the vicinity of the site are Alfisols, mapped as belonging
to the Crockett series (Ramsey and Bade 1977). The site is surrounded by modern farm buildings and a
gravel driveway denuded of vegetation, affording ground surface visibility of 100 percent. Adverse
impacts to the site include weathering, resulting in a visible tilt of the extant structure towards the south.
The entire area has been disturbed by the construction of the modern buildings and a gravel road, as well
as farm-related activities.
Architecturally, the building is a one-story side-gable barn (19.5 x 6.4 ft) with a corrugated sheet metal
roof and extended shed roof on its south side (Figure 178). The structure is constructed of 2-x-4 lumber
connected with horizontal planking and wire nails. The upper section of the west wall has a cut window,
and the east wall contains a plank door secured by rusted iron hinges and a latch. The structure rests upon
concrete foundation piers. The interior flooring is raised approximately 2 ft off the ground and is
constructed of wooden planks. Modern pipe pens are attached to the south wall. The building is in
deteriorated condition, missing several sections of side walls. According to the current landowner, it was
built between 1900 and 1910 and was once associated with several other structures that were located
outside the SH 130 ROW, some 200 m to the west. These structures are no longer standing. Five modern
farm-related structures, including a house and a trailer home, surround the structure (Figure 179). No
shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the site because of the presence of a hard-packed gravel
surface covering the entire area. No historical artifacts were encountered.
The site is on part of the original land grant issued to Edward Pettus by the Mexican government in 1831
(Guadalupe County Deed Records 28:1). Analysis of historical map data revealed the presence of
structures in the vicinity of this site on the 1911 USGS San Marcos 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
and the 1936 TSHD Guadalupe County Highway Map. No structures are depicted at the location on the
1946 and 1952 TSHD Guadalupe County General Highway Maps. An early-to-mid-twentieth-century
time frame is suggested for the occupation of the historical structure.
Although the site is over 50 years of age, it is not known to be associated with significant events or
persons. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the site does not meet the criteria for
NRHP eligibility or for designation as a SAL, and no further work is recommended.

5: Site Descriptions

41GU83
This site consists of two components: a prehistoric campsite located on a Holocene-aged terrace and a
house on a higher terrace, both situated on the south side of the San Marcos River about 50 m from the
channel. The elevation at the site ranges from 460 to 500 ft amsl. Soils at the location have been mapped
as belonging to the Bosque series, which are taxonomically classified as Mollisols (Ramsey and Bade
1977). Vegetation at the time of survey consisted of tall grasses, pecan and cypress trees along the river, a
low understory of brush on the prehistoric component, and low grasses on the historical component,
affording ground surface visibility of less than 5 percent (Figure 180). Adverse impacts to the site include
the prior construction of a ramp and road that runs down to and along the narrow terrace with the
prehistoric component, plus modification to the historical house by modern church camp activities.
The site was initially recorded during mechanical trenching of the alluvial deposits within Segment C of
the SH 130 ROW. Investigations at the prehistoric component included 18 shovel tests and six backhoe
trenches—three trenches on the first terrace, two on the second terrace with the site, and one on the
upland surface above the San Marcos River. Shovel Tests 13–18 encountered prehistoric remains
including one core, one tested cobble, seven pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, and several fragments
of bone and charcoal. The prehistoric component spanned the entire width of the ROW, although
undisturbed remains deeper than 20 cmbs were restricted to a 30-m-wide area including Trenches 4 and 6.
Because of the proximity of steep slopes above and below the culturally positive shovel tests, the size of
the prehistoric component is estimated to be 15 x 150 m (Figure 181).
A few historical artifacts were recovered from Shovel Tests 13, 15, and 16 in the prehistoric component at
depths of 10–35 cmbs. These materials include two small flat metal fragments, a glass jar fragment, and a
wire fragment, all of which appear to be of modern origin. There is no archival or historical evidence to
indicate that this portion of the terrace was occupied in historical times, although the historical habitation
is located on the T3 terrace, immediately above. Bricks found on the surface indicate that this terrace
received refuse from above; hence, the site boundaries extend well below the house. The size of the
historical component is estimated to be 100 m east-west by 150 m north-south (see Figure 181).
A total of 10 shovel tests (Shovel Tests 19–28) were excavated around the historical farmhouse, located
on the bluff above the prehistorically utilized terrace. All encountered compacted gravel deposits just
beneath the surface, and all 10 shovel tests were culturally negative. No surface evidence of historical
usage was observed, except for a 1940s-vintage John Deere tractor and Dodge truck abandoned along the
fenceline behind the structure. A search for a historical privy or well was negative, but modern church
camp activities have resulted in a wide scatter of trash and construction materials across the site.
Backhoe Trenches T803-1, 2, and 3 were placed on the first terrace above the river. Trench T803-1 was
located approximately 15 m south of the river, and excavated to a depth of 1.9 m. Trench T803-2 was
located 4 m south of the river and excavated to a depth of 1.7 m. Trench T803-3 was placed about 10 m

Backhoe Trenches 4 and 6 were placed on the second alluvial terrace above the San Marcos River. Soils
in Trench 4 consisted of a yellowish brown sandy loam (0–30 cmbs), dark brown clay (30–65 cmbs), and
dark brown clay with chert cobbles (65–100 cmbs) (Figure 182a). Prehistoric cultural materials, including
fire-cracked rocks, land snails, charcoal, and chert cobbles, were encountered beginning at a depth of
65 cmbs. From this point there was a noticeable increase in prehistoric artifact density until the
excavation was halted at a depth of 100 cmbs, when a burned rock hearth feature was observed (Figure
182b). The feature was covered with plastic sheeting and the trench was backfilled. Only one tested
cobble was recovered from Trench 4 to be further analyzed.

Trench 6 was placed 9 m north of Trench 4 to further explore the prehistoric subsurface component
identified in that trench. Soils in the first three levels of the trench were consistent with those of Trench 4
(see above). Trench 6 was excavated to a maximum depth of 110 cmbs, where a dark brown clay mottled
with olive green clay and chert cobbles was encountered. A second prehistoric feature, containing burned
rocks, charcoal, snail shells, and burned clay, was observed in the south wall of the trench at a depth of
74 cmbs. No materials were collected from Trench 6. The trenching is estimated to be about 15 m in
diameter. Below are the stratigraphic profile descriptions for Trenches 4 and 6.

5: Site Descriptions

The historical period homesite, located in the Edward Pettus survey granted by the Mexican government
in 1831 (Guadalupe County Deed Records 28:1), is reportedly associated with George Elam (Dennis
Elam, personal communication 1998) and the nearby Staples farming community. Located on a high bluff
along the south bank of the San Marcos River, the surviving component of the homesite is a two-story
dwelling with folk vernacular architectural characteristics that suggest it dates from ca. 1900, but possibly
as early as 1880 (Figure 183) (McAlester and McAlester 1989). Surrounding the house is a roughly
circular complex of trailer houses, recreational improvements, and a modern barn that have been recently
added to the site, extensively altering the otherwise rural setting of the house. The main house is sidegabled with a small central dormer over the front porch that appears to be an original element of the
house’s design. The house has a simple rectangular hall-and-parlor plan with enclosed room and porch
additions across the front and rear. The house appears to have undergone more than one renovation that
included construction of the front and rear additions, replacement of board-and-batten siding with
pressed-metal siding, and various window and door alterations. Overall, the building is in very poor
structural condition and lacks sufficient architectural integrity to meet National Register eligibility
Criterion C.
Archival research confirms the presence of a farm complex at this site in the very early twentieth century
(USGS 1908), although the main dwelling appears to be 10 to 20 years older. One or two barns depicted
nearby on the 1908 San Marcos 30-minute quadrangle map are no longer present. The location of the site
is too far removed from FM 621 to appear on the subsequent county highway maps for Guadalupe
County. A brief review of Guadalupe County history publications (Etlinger 1987; Weinert 1976) as well
as official deed, tax, census, and marriage records between 1870 and 1910 confirm the presence of the
Elam family in Guadalupe County, but not at this location. The lack of association between the Elam
family and this tract of land in this time period suggests that the George Elam family probably acquired
the property after 1910. Intensive deed, tax, and census research would be necessary to determine the
early history of the property. However, the poor architectural quality of the house and the low potential
for useful archaeological data suggest this component of site 41GU83 does not warrant this level of
archival research. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the historical component and building
at site 41GU83 should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended for the historical component.
Additional investigations of the prehistoric component of 41GU83 could contribute to our understanding
of the prehistoric cultures who visited the site. It is thus the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the
prehistoric component of site 41GU83 possesses considerable research potential, and if the construction
of the SH 130 roadway precludes preservation/avoidance, a program of archaeological testing should be
developed for the site to determine its NRHP and SAL eligibility.

This is a multicomponent site located on the second terrace about 100 m above a tributary of York Creek
in Guadalupe County, Texas, at an elevation of 490 ft amsl. Soils in the vicinity of the site have been

mapped as belonging to the Trinity series (Ramsey and Bade 1977). These are calcareous soils that
formed in floodplains. At the time of the survey, the site was vegetated with a hardwood canopy of oak
and young crepe myrtle (Figure 184). Ground surface visibility was approximately 50 percent. Adverse
impacts to the site may include land clearing and the construction of a small berm along the fenceline.
The site was first recorded when prehistoric and historical artifacts were observed on the ground surface.
Prehistoric artifacts, which appear to be the residue of encampments, include fire-cracked rocks, lithic
debitage, tested cobbles, scrapers, and bifaces; historic artifacts included a knife fragment, clear, dark
green, and purple glass fragments, undecorated white earthenware, blue transferware, brown-glazed
stoneware, light green transferware, wire nails, cut nails, a hand hoe blade, a plow blade, two-spoked
wheel hubs, a gear shaft with crank handle (hand-operated washing machine wringer), strap iron, steel
wire, and barbed wire.
Twenty-two shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs in order to further explore the
subsurface component of the site (Figure 185). Of these, 15 contained prehistoric artifacts to a depth of
30 cmbs, consisting of 1 biface, 17 pieces of unmodified lithic debitage, and 34 burned rock fragments
(see Appendix A). The biface was a nondiagnostic medial fragment with parallel sides and was
approximately 4 cm in length and 3 cm in width. Historical artifacts were found in 4 shovel tests to a
maximum depth of 40 cmbs, and included 4 amber, 1 brown, and 8 clear bottle glass fragments, 5
whiteware fragments, 3 wire nails, and 6 miscellaneous metal fragments. The small size of the blue
transferware sherd made it impossible to determine its exact date or manufacturer in the field. Although
the artifacts could not be returned to the laboratory for a detailed analysis, data from the field notes and
the photographs indicate the two identified glass bottle necks were mold-made with hard smoothed lips;
at least one did not have a through-lip seam, indicating a late-nineteenth-century manufacture date. No
intact ceramics or glass bottles were discovered. No artifacts were collected because of entry restrictions
imposed by the landowner. Artifacts were photographed (Figure 186), recorded, and reburied.
The historical component of the site appears to be limited to a roughly 30-x-100-m area adjacent to the
low berm. The prehistoric component, however, appears to be considerably larger, encompassing an area
of approximately 30 x 165 m, to within 100 m of York Creek.
The 1911 USGS San Marcos 30-minute quadrangle map depicts several structures in the general vicinity
of this site. Structures were not noted on the 1936, 1946, or 1952 TSHD Guadalupe County General
Highway Maps.
The landowner responded to a letter sent by the Principal Investigator requesting historical information
for the property. The site is part of a 485-acre tract that has been in the Sherrill family since the 1860s,
when James Sherrill arrived from Catawba County, North Carolina. The tract is part of the Pettis Grant.
Sherrill had been a plantation owner in North Carolina. He built a dog trot house on the farm in 1875. In
1909 it was replaced with a Sears & Roebuck “kit” mail order house. The property outside of the SH 130

ROW remains in the Sherrill family. Among the descendants of James Sherrill was the late Lt. General
James Sherrill USAF (Sherrill 2006).
The prehistoric component appears to lack stratigraphic integrity, diagnostic artifacts, intact cultural
features, and subsistence data. It is unlikely that additional work at the location would increase our
understanding of the prehistoric development of the area.
The historic component at the site, although over 50 years of age and part of the larger Sherrill family
property, is not known to be directly associated with events or persons significant to the history of the
area. No standing structures remain at the location. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the
site should not be considered for NRHP eligibility or designation as a SAL. No further work is
recommended.

EXPLORATORY GEOARCHAEOLOGY
INTRODUCTION
Geoarchaeological investigations, utilizing mechanical excavation equipment, were conducted in selected
areas within Segments A, B, and C of the SH 130 ROW (Figure 187). This work was performed in
alluvial settings where the potential for deeply buried prehistoric sites exists, and where constructional
impacts might adversely impact cultural deposits below maximum shovel test depth. Over 100 trenches
were excavated during the course of the investigations. Soils and sediments observed in each trench were
described using standard soil profile description nomenclature.

SEGMENT A
Geoarchaeological explorations took place in Segment A between October 15, 2001, and August 26,
2003. From north to south, the alluvial floodplain and terraces of the San Gabriel River, Brushy Creek,
Wilbarger Creek, Gilleland Creek, and Harris Branch were examined. This work was primarily
exploratory in nature, intended to located deeply buried prehistoric sites that may occur in these alluvial
settings. However, the subsurface investigations along the San Gabriel River, and the north side of
Brushy Creek also sought to provide additional data on the nature of prehistoric deposits at sites
41WM1012, 41WM1013, and 41WM1023, which had been recorded during the pedestrian survey of the
SH 130 ROW (see Chapter 5 of this report). Two sites, 41WM1010 and 41WM1026, were discovered
during the exploratory geoarchaeology; both sites are along Brushy Creek. An extensive subsurface
component was identified at a third site, 41WM1012, located on the north side of Brushy Creek.

San Gabriel River (North Side)
Geoarchaeological investigations within the SH 130 ROW on the north side of the San Gabriel River
involved two properties, designated Parcels 35 and 36. Parcel 35 encompassed a portion of the eastern
part of the ROW, and the investigations there took place during July 2002. Trenching on the remainder of
the ROW was not performed until access was granted to that tract in August 2003. As mentioned, the
investigations were conducted to further examine the subsurface deposits around site 41WM1012,
recorded during the pedestrian survey of Segment A (see Chapter 5). The investigations also sought to
assess the depositional characteristics and archaeological potential of three Quaternary-aged alluvial
terraces within the parcel. A total of 23 backhoe trenches were excavated, 7 in Parcel 35 and 16 in Parcel
36. The area encompassing the trenching is shown on Figure 188.

The trenching in Parcel 35 succeeded in locating an in situ prehistoric hearth feature on the first terrace
above the San Gabriel River, approximately 30 m south of the recorded location of site 41WM1012
(Figure 189).
In August 2003, landowner permission was granted for the pedestrian survey and exploratory trenching of
Parcel 36. The exploratory trenching in Parcel 36 was conducted on the lowest two terraces (T1a and T1b)
and consisted of the excavation of 16 backhoe trenches, with equal numbers of trenches excavated on
both terraces. In situ faunal remains were found in four trenches on terrace T1a and charcoal from one
bison bone deposit yielded a calibrated 2-sigma calendrical radiocarbon date range of A.D. 1645–1950
(Intercept at A.D. 1665). Bone collegen from a bison tooth yielded a calibrated 2-sigma radiocarbon date
of A.D. 1660–1950 (Intercepts at A.D. 1690, 1730, and 1810).
T1a Terrace Stratigraphy
The T1a terrace is a low, frequently flooded terrace that extends distally from the San Gabriel River for a
distance of about 60 m. It lies about 3 m above the San Gabriel channel. Soils that developed on the
terrace have been mapped as belonging to the Oakalla series, which occur in long bands in narrow stream
valleys. The T1a terrace is periodically flooded.

series, specifically Oakalla frequently flooded. The terrace is positioned about 1.5 m above the T1a
terrace. Portions of the T1b terrace within the ROW have been mined for gravel. The following profile
description summarizes the stratigraphy of this terrace.
STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE DESCRIPTION, T1B TERRACE, TRENCH T35-1
Stratum 1: 0−22 cm. Medium bedded; clear, wavy boundary; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very silty
clayey sand with isolated gravel; weakly pseudo-platy breaking to moderate, medium, fine angular blocky
structure; friable; few roots; few fine unlined pores; few casts. Ap horizon.
Stratum 2: 22−240 cm. Stacked A-C couplets (upward-fining sequence), each 30−40 cm thick; fine
components similar to Stratum 1; brown (10YR 4/3) very silty clayey sand with isolated gravel; weakly
pseudo-platy breaking to moderate, medium, fine angular blocky structure; coarser component is pale brown
(10YR 8/2) sandy to very sandy gravel, sand is medium to very coarse; gravel is pebble to gravel sized,
increasing to small boulder sized with depth.

T2 Terrace Stratigraphy
The third and oldest of the alluvial terraces along the north side of the San Gabriel River is approximately
200 m wide. Soils that developed on this terrace have been mapped as belonging to the Queeny (T2a) and
Sunev (T2b) soil series. The following representative profile was compiled from Trench T35-3 and most
closely conforms with Queeny soils.
STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE DESCRIPTION, T2A TERRACE, TRENCH T35-3
Stratum 1: 0−22 cm. Medium bedded; clear, wavy boundary; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5) silty sandy clay;
few isolated gravels; weak, pseudo-platy, fine, angular blocky structure; friable; few fine to medium roots;
few fine, open pores; many casts. Ap horizon.
Stratum 2: 22−50 cm. Thick bedded; smooth to wavy, abrupt boundary; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty sandy
clay; moderate, fine, angular blocky structure; friable; few roots; few fine pores; few casts; few snail shell
fragments. Bt horizon.
Stratum 3: 50−80 cm. Thick bedded; clear, smooth boundary; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly silty sandy clay;
gravels coarsen downward. Btb1 horizon.
Stratum 4: 80−135 cm. Thick bedded; strong brown (7.5YR 4/5) very gravelly silty sandy clay; gravels
coarsen downward. Btb2 horizon.

San Gabriel River (South Side)
Geoarchaeological investigations within the SH 130 ROW on the south side of the San Gabriel River took
place in October 2001. A prehistoric site, designated 41WM1023, had been found within the ROW during
the pedestrian survey (see Chapter 5). Four backhoe trenches, designated Trenches T37-1 through T37-4,
were excavated within the ROW to further explore the subsurface characteristics of the site (see Figure
188). Prehistoric artifacts were encountered in three of the trenches, T37-2, T37-3, and T37-4. The profile
observed in Trench T37-2 consisted of dark grayish brown clayey Ap and Ak horizons extending to about
440715/060270

80 cm, where they contacted a 60-cm-thick gravel deposit. Prehistoric unmodified debitage and Rabdotus
shells were uncovered at the top of the gravel bed. The gravel was underlain by a yellowish brown clayey
paleosol, which extended to about 220 cmbs where it contacted another gravel bed. A single piece of
unmodified debitage was recovered from the paleosol at a depth of about 170 cmbs.
The profile observed in Trench T37-3 consisted of dark grayish brown clay Ap and Ak horizons
extending to a depth of 30 cmbs where they contacted yellowish brown silty clay Bk horizons. The trench
was excavated to a depth of 230 cmbs. A single split pebble was found in the Bk2 horizon at a depth of
100 cmbs, and a core was recovered from the Bk3 horizon at a depth of 230 cmbs.
Trench T37-4 was excavated to a depth of 250 cm. The Ap and Ak horizons extended to about 80 cm.
The underlying Bk horizons yielded a biface fragment and a utilized flake from a depth of about
220 cmbs.
As a result of the trenching, NRHP testing was recommended for site 41WM1023. That work took place
during the summer of 2002. The testing succeeded in locating one in situ burned rock feature that was
either the remains of a hearth or a scatter. The absence of carbonized matter precluded its age
determination. The absence of associated faunal materials and diagnostic artifacts precludes any
consideration of the subsistence practices of the aboriginal peoples responsible for the creation of the
feature. Given the sparse concentration of artifacts, and the absence of diagnostics, botanical, or faunal
remains, it was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41WM1023 did not meet minimal
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL (Rogers and Dixon 2007).

Brushy Creek (North Side)
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted on the north side of Brushy Creek in
October 2001. A total of eight backhoe trenches were excavated within the SH 130 ROW (Figure 190).
As a result of the investigations, prehistoric site 41WM1010 was discovered. The site was found to
include four spatially distinct areas, which were later designated Areas A, B, C, and D.
Area A was investigated in Trench T115-1. The trench was excavated parallel to an unnamed tributary to
Brushy Creek. The profile observed in this trench included a 50-cm-thick clay loam Ak horizon underlain
by a Bk horizon extending to a depth of about 180 cmbs, where limestone bedrock was encountered.
Cultural materials observed in the trench occurred at a depth of approximately 50–60 cmbs and consisted
of five thermally discolored limestone cobbles, interpreted as being hearthstones from a small hearth.
These items were uncovered by the backhoe, but no in situ materials were seen in the trench wall.
Area B was investigated in Trench T115-3. This trench was located in a cleared area formerly occupied
by mobile homes. The active water line alluded to above was severed during the excavation of Trench
T115-3, at a depth of 50 cm. Trench T115-3 was excavated to a depth of approximately 300 cm; the
profile observed in the trench included an Ak horizon to about 90 cm underlain by Bk horizons to 180 cm

where dense gravels were encountered. Cultural materials consist of a longbone fragment (deer) from a
depth of about 50 cm, and bone, a core, and thermally altered rock from depths of about 170–180 cm,
near the contact of the lowermost Bk horizon (Bkb) with the gravel bed.
Area C was identified by Trench T115-5, excavated on the north side of the unnamed tributary to Brushy
Creek. The trench was dug to a depth of about 220 cmbs and contained Ak and Bk horizons to that depth,
where a gleyed Bgb horizon and a perched water table were encountered. The cultural material uncovered
in the trench consists of a large core, found in situ at the top of the gleyed Bkg horizon, immediately
above the water table at a depth of 220 cmbs.
Area D was identified by Trench T115-8 excavated on the terrace edge about 10 m south of Brushy
Creek. The trench was dug to a depth of about 280 cmbs. Cultural materials were uncovered from a
buried soil horizon from depths of 230–250 cmbs and include a phalange and longbones (bison) and a
depleted core. A number of charcoal fragments were also uncovered, including one in situ fragment found
in the trench wall at a depth of 240 cmbs.
Because of the presence of deeply buried in situ cultural materials, the site possesses considerable
research potential. It was recommended that a program of archaeological testing should be developed to
determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility status.
Between June 11 and August 2, 2002, PBS&J archaeologists conducted NRHP eligibility testing for the
Texas Turnpike Authority Division and the Texas Department of Transportation at 41WM1010. Since
this testing resulted in a recommendation that the site be considered eligible for listing in the NRHP and
for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, data recovery was conducted at the site from
November 4 through December 20, 2002. The results of both the testing and the data recovery of the site
found it to be significant under NRHP Criterion D for its prehistoric information content.
Three distinct spatial components of the site, designated Areas A, B, D North, and D South, were
identified during the eligibility testing and were targeted during data recovery. Area C, also identified
during the intensive survey, was not recommended for further work. A total of 72 cultural features were
investigated, 39 of which yielded wood charcoal that was radiocarbon dated between approximately
400 B.C. and A.D. 1200 (Dixon and Rogers 2006).

Stratum 4: 240+ cm. Dense, poorly sorted gravel.

The stratigraphy of Area D South contains alternating gravel and silt alluvial deposits that reflect the
vertical accretion of overbank flood deposits and the lateral movement of Brushy Creek as it migrated
southwards. The deposits that were left behind consist of alternating layers of silts and gravels, with the
gravels representing high-energy, near-channel deposits. These coarse-grained deposits contain some
transported and redeposited archaeological materials. In some instances the aboriginal peoples apparently
camped directly on the gravels in Area D South, which were probably point bar deposits at the time. The
silts that accumulated between the gravels in Area D South represent lower-velocity deposits, and it is
within these sediments, at depths between 2.5 and 3 m, that the primary archaeological deposits were
found.

Nineteen proveniences in Blocks D1 and D3 of Area D South were radiocarbon dated. The deepest of
these, which was about 3 m below the ground surface, yielded a calibrated 2-sigma date of 110 B.C. to
A.D. 70. The youngest calibrated date of A.D. 1400–1450 was taken from charcoal removed from a
culturally sterile silt lens in Block D3, about 110 cm below the present ground surface.

Brushy Creek (South Side)
Geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the SH 130 ROW on the south side of Brushy Creek
during November 2001. Four backhoe trenches were excavated (see Figure 190). Most of the T1 terrace
within the ROW extending approximately 20 m from the creek has been destroyed as a result of gravel
mining. The remaining sediments in the T1 terrace were described as follows.
T1 TERRACE
SOUTH SIDE OF BRUSHY CREEK
Stratum 1: 0–70 cm. Thick bedded; clear, wavy boundary; 10YR 3/2; clay; strong, coarse, blocky structure;
friable; roots common.
Stratum 2: 70–90 cm. Medium bedded; abrupt, clear, smooth boundary; 10YR 4/3 clay; moderate, medium,

The T2 terrace occupies the remaining alluvial deposits within the ROW. Three trenches were placed on
the landform. Prehistoric material, including a core and fire-cracked rock, were uncovered at a depth of
about 30 cm in one of the trenches. This is site 41WM1026 (see Chapter 5). The following profile
description is provided.

Wilbarger Creek
Alluvial sediments within the ROW of SH 130’s crossing of Wilbarger Creek are confined to a narrow
band less than 50 m wide bordering both sides of the creek. Soils that developed in these sediments have
been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series (Werchan et al. 1974). Unfortunately, this location, shown
on Figure 191, proved to be densely wooded, and attempts to penetrate it with a backhoe were

Gilleland Creek
Two trenches, designated T183-1 and T183-2, were excavated on the north side of Gilleland Creek
(Figure 193). Soils in this area have been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series. The terrain was
densely wooded; consequently, both trenches were placed within a recently cleared electric line ROW
that traverses the entire width of the SH 130 ROW. Trench T183-1 was placed on the eastern edge of the
ROW. It was 8 m in length and oriented 325°. Trench 2 was placed on the western edge of the ROW. It
was also 8 m long and was oriented 330°. Both trenches contained similar profiles. The profile for Trench
T183-2 is described below and shown on Figure 194. Both trenches were culturally sterile.

portions of the Segment B ROW examined between December 8, 2001, and November 18, 2005. The
following descriptions are provided for the work performed at each of these locations.

Decker Creek
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the floodplain of Decker Creek on
February 5, 2003. Soils in the area have been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series (Lowther and
Werchan 1978). Trinity soils are very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable floodplain
soils that formed in Holocene calcareous alluvium. Taxonomically, they are classified as Typic
Hapluderts. These are Vertisols characterized by having a clayey texture and have deep, wide cracks that
open during dry periods, typically for less than 90 cumulative days.
Two trenches, designated Trench T327-1 and Trench T327-2, were mechanically excavated on the north
side of the creek (Figure 196). No cultural materials were found in either trench. Trench 327-1 was placed
on the natural levee 15 m north of Decker Creek, and Trench 327-2 was located about 75 m north of the
creek (Figure 197). The following profile descriptions are provided for the trenches.

Elm Creek
Elm Creek is a tributary of the Colorado River. It has its headwaters in the uplands west of Lake Walter
E. Long and flows in a southeasterly direction across the alluvial plain of the Colorado River, entering the
river’s channel about 1.5 miles west of the town of Webberville, Texas. Within the ROW of Segment B,
Elm Creek appears as a small stream about 3 m wide. Its channel has been infilled and is less than 1 m
deep. Soils along Elm Creek in the ROW have been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series.
Five trenches were excavated along Elm Creek, on May 16 and 17, 2002 (Figure 198). Other than recent
flood debris observed in the upper part of the A horizon in the trench excavated nearest to the creek
(Trench T339-1), all of the trenches were culturally sterile. The following stratigraphic profile description
typifies the subsurface deposits along Elm Creek. A view of the creek and its environs is shown on Figure

Colorado River (North Side)
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the Holocene-aged alluvial terraces on
the north side of the Colorado River by Chris Caren and Michael Aiuvalasit on July 12, 2002. Two
trenches were excavated (Figure 200).
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the terraces along the Colorado River have been extensively studied by
geomorphologists and sedimentologists Weeks (1945) traced terraces downstream from Austin, and
subdivided them (from oldest to youngest) into the Uvalde, Asylum, Capital, Sixth Street, First Street,
Riverview, and Sand Beach levels.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

Trench T370-1 was placed on the proximal edge of the Riverview terrace (the Sand Beach terrace is
submerged in this area) and excavated to a depth of 290 cm, though the trench walls were unstable. The
trench was 20 m in length and stepped back for safety. It was oriented N60E. The stratigraphic section
exposed in the trench is as follows: 9 to >90 cm upward-firing sequences (mostly fine to medium sand)
grading upward (abruptly) to very silty, sandy clay (very fine-fine sand). Well stratified, the sands retain
cross-bedding throughout and appear as pale brown (10YR 6/3). The thickest fully exposed sand bed was
50 cm. The thickest exposed clay bed was ~55 cm and was bioturbated. It appeared brown (10YR 4/3),
ranging downward to dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3). The sediments in the trench were interpreted to be
Late Holocene-modern proximal overbank sequence. No cultural materials were found in the trench.
Trench T370-2 was excavated on a floodplain ridge near the distal edge of the Riverview terrace adjacent
to a swale at the base of a scarp of First Street terrace. The trench profile (northeast wall) was similar to
that in Trench T370-1 except that the sand beds appeared thinner (2–29 cm, mostly ~10 cm), and the sand
was finer (very fine-fine with rare medium). The beds dip subparallel (more gently) to topography. Clay
beds were highly variable in thickness; most ~20 cm, but 4–45 cm overall; and in color: dark reddish
brown (5YR 3/4) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1). There was little bioturbation evident in the sediments. No
cultural materials were found in the trench.

Colorado River (South Side)
Geoarchaeological investigations on the south side of the Colorado River were conducted by
Robert Rogers on November 12–14, 2001. A total of six trenches were dug in the investigations (see
Figure 200). These were designated T354-1 through T354-6. The area was in a cultivated field that had
recently been harvested.
Archaeological sites 41TV454, 41TV455, and 41TV456 all partially occur in the SH 130 ROW in this
area. Trench T354-1 was placed within the recorded boundary of 41TV454, Trench T354-3 was within
site 41TV455, and Trenches T354-2 and T354-6 were within site 41TV456. Trenches T354-4 and T354-4
were excavated between the sites.
Soils within the investigated area belong to the Bergstrom and Lewisville series. Bergstrom soils occupy
the Columbus Bend Alloformation Member 2 of the Colorado River Terraces, which Blum (1992:190)
estimated to have been deposited in this general area less than 1,000 years B.P. Bergstrom soils are
taxonomically classified as Cumulic Haplustolls. With the exception of Trench T354-5, all of the trenches
were excavated into Bergstrom soils. The following profile from Trench T354-2 is representative of these
five trenches. This trench yielded a mussel shell from a depth of 60 cmbs and a biface fragment from
80-90 cmbs.
The single trench excavated into Louisville soils (T354-5), was within the confines of site 41TV455
encountered a dense yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) calcareous clay below the plowzone. The clay extended
to a depth of over 220 cmbs. The trench was culturally sterile. Lewisville soils are alluvial soils of late

Onion Creek
Onion Creek is a tributary of the Colorado River and has its headwaters in western Hays County. It flows
into the channel of the Colorado River approximately 2 miles east of the SH 130 ROW. Within the ROW
it is deeply entrenched (Figure 201). The north side of Onion Creek was examined on May 8 and 9, 2002.
Access to the south side of the creek was not obtained until November 2005.
A total of three backhoe trenches were excavated on the north side of Onion Creek (Figure 202). All of
the trenches were placed in the eastern portion of the ROW, as two underground natural gas pipelines
occur on the western side. No cultural materials were found in any of the excavated trenches.
Soils within the ROW on the north side of Onion Creek have been mapped as belonging to the Frio series.
Frio soils are very deep, well-drained, and moderately permeable soils that formed in Holocene-aged
calcareous alluvium. Taxonomically, they are classified as Cumulic Haplustolls. These are soils that
developed under grasslands (Mollisols) in floodplains.
Two of the trenches (T359-1 and T359-2) were excavated in the Onion Creek floodplain. Both had
similar profiles. Following is the profile description for Trench T359-1, excavated 15 m north of the creek
channel.

Between November 10 and 22, PBS&J conducted geoarchaeological investigations in the SH 130 ROW
on the south side of Onion Creek in Travis County. The purpose of the investigations was to determine
whether deeply buried archaeological sites occurred in the parcels, particularly within the confines of the
known boundary of previously recorded prehistoric site 41TV410. The investigations were restricted to
the portion of the ROW east of a high-pressure pipeline. The entire area investigated totaled
approximately 5 acres. Eight backhoe trenches were excavated.
All of the trenches were placed in the alluvial terrace of Onion Creek. Trenches T360-1 and T360-4 were
excavated along the lowermost portion of the alluvial terrace, where soils of the frio series have been
mapped. Trenches T360-2 and T360-5 in the midsection (also Frio soils) and Trenches T360-3, T360-6,
T361-1, and T361-2 were excavated in the upper portion of the terrace, on Lewisville soils. Sediments
observed in the trenches were relatively uniform, and consisted of thick bedded to massive calcareous
silts, silty clay, and sands. Dense gravels occurred in Trenches T360-1 and T360-4.
Sparse cultural materials were encountered in Trenches T360-1, T360-3, T360-4, and T361-1. Most of
these materials occurred at depths of over 200 cmbs. They consisted of a single utilized flake in Trench

T360-1 (270 cmbs) , two flakes in Trench T360-3 (210 cmbs), mussel shell and charcoal in Trench T3604 (300 cmbs), and a tested cobble in Trench T361-1 (110 cmbs).
As a result of this work, additional mechanical excavations were conducted to investigate the mussel shell
and charcoal found in Trench T360-4. The profile description composed during those excavations is
presented below. That work resulted in the discovery of a hearth, which was then manually excavated.
The results of the manual excavations are described in Appendix C of this report.

Dry Creek
Dry Creek has its headwaters about 3 miles south of Austin in southern Travis County. It runs northeast
for 25 miles, emptying into the Colorado River about 10 miles northwest of Bastrop. It traverses portions
of the Black Prairie and Post Oak Savannah. Soils that occur along the stream at the SH 130 ROW
crossing has been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series.
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the SH 130 ROW crossing of the creek
on July 18 and 19, 2002. Three trenches were excavated (Figure 203). The following profiles are
provided.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

SEGMENT C
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were performed in Segment C of the SH 130 ROW, along
the San Marcos River, the West Fork of Plum Creek, and Mill Creek. As with the geoarchaeological
investigations conducted in Segments A and B, those presented below were designed to examine
Holocene alluvial sediments for deeply buried prehistoric sites.

SAN MARCOS RIVER
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were carried out on the north side of the San Marcos River
in March 2002. A total of 14 mechanically excavated trenches were placed there, with 6 of the trenches
located in the floodplain, 5 in the T1 terrace, and 3 in the T2 terrace. The trenching conducted in the T1
and T2 terraces succeeded in locating buried prehistoric artifacts, cultural features, and subsistence
remains, which were recorded as site 41CW83. These trenches are described in Chapter 5 under the
41CW83 site description. The general location of the trenching on the north side of the river is shown on
Figure 204.
No cultural materials were found in the five trenches excavated in the San Marcos floodplain. Each trench
had a similar profile of thick clay, silty clay, and silt to depths of approximately 3 m. Soils in this area
have been mapped as belonging to the Bosque series. Bosque soils are taxonomically classified as
Cumulic Haplustolls (Lowther and Werchan 1978:Plate 29). These are Mollisols, or soils that formed
under grassland vegetation. The term cumulic refers to their occurrence in alluvial deposits that
accumulated from repeated episodes of overbank flooding. The trench and the terrain are shown on Figure
205.
A description of Trench T801-1 follows. The profile is representative of the five trenches excavated in the
San Marcos River floodplain.

6: Exploratory Geoarchaeology

Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were also conducted on the south side of the San Marcos
River, in August 2002. The trenching on the south side of the San Marcos River (see Figure 204)
encountered buried prehistoric cultural materials which were recorded as site 41GU83. The trench profile
descriptions are included in the site description in Chapter 5.

West Fork of Plum Creek
The West Fork of Plum Creek rises in western Caldwell County, about 4 miles southwest of Lockhart. It
runs southeast for about 22 miles, joining Plum Creek 2 miles east of Luling.
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the floodplain of the West Fork of Plum
Creek in March 2003. Soils in the area have been mapped as belonging to the Trinity series (Lowther and
Werchan 1978). Seven trenches were excavated along the creek on its west bank (Figure 206). No cultural
materials were observed in any of the trenches. Alluvial sediments observed in the trenches include lowvelocity fine-grained clays and silty clays and lenses of sand and gravel. The latter represent episodes of
recent, high-velocity overbank flooding. A buried soil was unearthed in Stratum 4 (80−140 cm) of Trench
T689-2. Modern glass was found at this depth in Trench T689-3.
The water table was encountered in most of the trenches, and wall collapse prevented the profiling of
Trench T689-4. The stratigraphic profile descriptions of Trenches T689-1 and T689-2 are provided
below. Figure 207 depicts views of these trenches.

Mill Creek
Mill Creek has its headwaters 4 miles east of the town of Geronimo in north central Guadalupe County.
The stream flows southeast for about 16 miles, emptying into the Guadalupe River 7 miles south of
Kingsbury.
Exploratory geoarchaeological investigations were conducted in the floodplain of Mill Creek in August
2002. Three trenches were excavated along the creek (Figure 208). No cultural materials were observed in
any of the trenches. The following stratigraphic profile descriptions are typical of those of the Uhland soil
series, which are mapped at the location. Uhland soils are Holocene alluvial soils taxonomically classified
as Inceptisols. Views of the terrain along Mill Creek can be seen on Figure 209.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The preceding chapters have detailed the results of a cultural resources survey of the SH 130 roadway, in
Williamson, Travis, Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties, Texas. From north to south, the SH 130 roadway
is divided into three segments, designated Segment A, Segment B, and Segment C.
The survey assessed only the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) sections of the undertaking.
Additional properties were later assessed and reported on by Hicks and Company. The archaeological
inventory of the FEIS Segment A and nearly all of Segment B has been completed and Section 106
consultation with the Texas Historic Preservation Officer (TSHPO) and Native American (NA) Tribes has
been completed.
Segment A extends for 28 miles (45 km) from the northern terminus of the SH 130 ROW north of
Georgetown in Williamson County to US 290E in Travis County. Thirty-four cultural resource sites were
examined in the segment (Appendix D), including three previously recorded sites (41WM917,
41TV1417, and 41TV1893) and 31 newly recorded sites (41WM1010–41WM1026, 41WM1046,
41WM1064, 41WM1132, 41TV1969–41TV1978, and 41TV2158). Prehistoric sites 41WM1010,
41WM1012, 41WM1013, and 41WM1023 were recommended for further work. NRHP testing and/or
data recovery efforts were carried out at these sites. No further work was recommended for the remaining
30 sites.
Segment B begins at US 290E and continues for 31.37 miles (51.08 km) to just north of Lockhart, in
Caldwell County. A total of 157 parcels, equaling 2,404 acres (972.90 hectares) are within the segment.
Of the total, PBS&J surveyed approximaely 2,351 acres. Thirty-eight archaeological sites were identified
(Appendix D), including 17 previously recorded sites (41TV150, 41TV410, 41TV443, 41TV453–
41TV456, 41TV540, 41TV541, 41TV1256, 41TV1260, 41TV1268, 41TV1270, 41TV1275, 41TV1278,
41TV1400, and 41TV1401) and 21 newly recorded sites (41TV1979–41TV1993, 41TV2000, 41TV2132,
and 41CW74–41CW77). Two sites (41TV150 and 41TV410) were recommended for further work. One
of these, site 41TV150, contained an unmarked historical grave that was exhumed and reburied under a
THC-approved plan. It is TxDOT’s recommendation that 41TV150 should still be considered as
ineligible for the NRHP. Site 41TV410 was recommended for mechanical trenching to assess alluvial
deposits at the site for deeply buried prehistoric cultural materials. This work took place in November and
December 2005, and led to limited hand excavations, which are described in this report. It is the opinion
of the Principal Investigator that the remaining 36 sites are not eligible for listing on the NRHP or
designation as a SAL.

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

In addition to the above archaeological sites, one historic cemetery, the Guadalupe-Mendoza Cemetery, is
in close proximity to the SH 130 roadway. Located adjacent to US 183, south of it’s intersection with
CR 179, the cemetery represents the last vestiges of the community of Mendoza, and has been
recommended for listing in the NRHP under Criterion A, Consideration D, Ethnic Heritage (Hicks and
Company 2001:3-106, 3-107). At the time of the pedestrian survey of the SH 130 roadway, access to the
tract harboring the cemetery was not granted, and thus the cemetery is not included in the current report.
However, it is recommended that prior to construction, archival research be performed to determine the
metes and bounds of the cemetery. Informant interviews should also be conducted to gather historical data
regarding the cemetery. Finally, it is recommended that mechanical scraping be undertaken to ensure that
no historic unmarked graves extend within the SH 130 roadway.
The archaeological inventory of the FEIS Segment C has not been completed due to right-of-entry issues,
and additional survey for the outstanding parcels is required once right-of-entry issues have been
resolved. Additional TSHPO and NA tribal consultation is required for these parcels. A few parcels also
remain to be surveyed in Segment B (see Table ES-1) The outstanding parcels are also depicted on 7.5minute topographic maps in Appendix E.
The surveyed portion of Segment C included a total of 173 parcels equaling 1,799.118 acres (728
hectares) and approximately 24 linear miles (38.62 km). Twenty-five cultural resource sites were newly
identified (41CW78–41CW83, 41CW86–41CW90, 41GU70–41GU81, 41GU83, and 41GU84)
(Appendix D). Two of the 25 sites are recommended for NRHP eligibility testing (41CW83 and
41GU83). Stone-lined hearths and buried prehistoric deposits were recorded at both sites during
exploratory backhoe trenching and in eroded terraces along the San Marcos River. It is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that the remaining 23 sites (41CW78–41CW82, 41CW86–41CW90, 41GU70–
41GU81, and 41GU84) are not eligible for NRHP listing or designation as a SAL based on the lack of
subsurface features, artifacts, or subsistence remains, and, in some cases, because of adverse impacts to
the site. No further work is recommended for these 23 sites.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD
ALONG SH 130
The following paragraphs summarize the characteristics of the prehistoric and historic archaeological
record for Segments A, B, and C of the SH 130 roadway, based on the results of the current study. In
addition to condensing the results of this report, the data may prove useful in guiding future studies in the
area.

Prehistoric Sites
The primary parameters that form the basis of the archaeological record for prehistoric sites include
number of sites per kilometer, age, site size, landform, and distance to water. In general, the three
segments of the SH 130 roadway had a similar number of recorded sites per kilometer, ranging from a
high of 0.59 in Segment B, to a low of 0.4 in Segment A (Table 5). This similarity suggests that the
440715/060270

354

7: Conclusions and Recommendations

aboriginal utilization of the prehistoric landscape did not substantially differ among the three segments. A
key underlying impetus for prehistoric utilization was the availability of water, and thus the shared site
density is largely because of the relatively equal number of streams within each of the segments (Table 6).

Prehistoric Site Probability Areas
Prior to beginning the survey, the entire SH 130 ROW was divided into low, moderate, and high
probability areas. High probability areas occurred within about 400 m of natural water and included
Holocene alluvial deposits. High probability areas comprised about 48 percent of the total SH 130 ROW.
Over 80 percent of all prehistoric sites recorded in the ROW were found in areas designated as high
probability.
Moderate probability areas occurred at somewhat greater distances from natural water. Typically, soils in
these areas were shallow and are not derived from Holocene alluvium. Areas of moderate site potential
included about 39 percent of the SH 130 ROW. About 15 percent of the prehistoric sites recorded in the
ROW were located in moderate probability areas.
Low probability areas occurred at considerable distances from natural water, and included steeply
dissected terrain unsuited for human occupation. They were thought to have little prehistoric site
potential. These areas occupied slightly less than 13 percent of the SH 130 Row. Only 3 percent of the
prehistoric sites were discovered in low probability areas.
Prehistoric Site Types
Discerning the function of the prehistoric sites recorded during the survey is possible only in the most
general terms. Most of the sites are surface manifestations which likely represent an untold number of
visits over several millennia. The cultural residue left to be discovered by an archaeological crew who
440715/060270

355

State Highway 130: Segments A, B, and C

briefly visits the location can at best be vaguely assessed. Recognizing these limitations, the following
site types are believed to comprise the archaeological record as it was seen in the SH 130 ROW.
Lithic Procurement Areas
Many of the prehistoric sites were represented by scatters of chert cobbles that exhibited some evidence
of cultural modification. Often this was limited to the removal of a few flakes. These items, interpreted as
tested cobbles, suggest that raw material was being collected at these locations for stone tool
manufacturing. These procurement areas usually yielded evidence such as unfinished or abandoned early
stage blanks or preforms and debitage, which indicated some initial tool reduction took place. Less often,
complete or nearly complete tools indicate a more intensive use of the site or a prolonged visit or even a
short encampment. The raw material found at procurement sites occurred either as lag gravels on upland
surfaces, or in terrace deposits in alluvial settings. Tables 7 and 8 show the occurrences of these
procurement sites relative to natural water sources and landform type.

The data on the two tables suggest that for both types of lithic procurement sites, the distance from a
natural water source was not an overriding criteria. This supports the supposition that the use of these
sites was ephemeral and did not typically include encampments, which, as will be seen, were more
closely governed by the near occurrence of water. Of the 26 sites comprising the two types of
procurement areas, only about 30 percent occurred less than 100 m from a stream. Regarding the
landform type in which they occurred, about 80 percent were found on upland surfaces. However, this
does not imply that surface lag gravels found in the uplands necessarily provided more raw material for
stone tool manufacturing than did terrace gravels, as the latter could have been readily exploited at or near

440715/060270

356

7: Conclusions and Recommendations

encampments. Rather, it is more likely that the large number of lithic procurement sites in the uplands
reflects the ubiquitous nature of these gravels across much of the landscape traversed by the SH 130 Row.
Encampments
Prehistoric encampments were identified by the presence of hearths or hearth remnants and/or subsistence
data. Prehistoric hearths all along the SH 130 ROW in Segments A and B were lined with limestone or
cobbles. Those in Segment C were lined with sandstone cobbles. The hearths often appeared thermally
fractured and discolored. Subsistence evidence at these sites included animal bone, mussel shell, and
carbon deposits. As mentioned above, encampments nearly always occurred close to natural water, and in
most cases on terrace or floodplain deposits, where they could be found buried at considerable depths
(e.g., the Shepherd site, 41WM1010). Table 9 lists the occurrences of encampments along the SH 130
ROW in terms of distance to water and landform.

As can be seen, 60 percent of the encampments were less than 100 m from a stream, and 85 percent were
less than 300 m from water. Encampments on alluvial terraces or floodplain accounted for 80 percent of
the total.
Prehistoric Locations
Prehistoric locations are those sites that yielded only a few artifacts, usually only debitage (Table 10). The
function of these sites is uncertain. They are referred to as locations following Binford (1980) who
defined them as places where extractive tasks are carried out by foragers over a very short period of time.
They tend to be scattered over the landscape.

Historic Sites
The earliest historic period site recorded along the SH 130 roadway was 41WM1012, or La Carneada.
This is an early historic period bison kill site located on the north side of the San Gabriel River in
Williamson County, in Segment A. The site is interpreted as having been occupied for a very short period
by aboriginal hunters sometime between about A.D. 1650 and 1800 (Rogers and Dixon 2006).
All of the remaining 48 sites with historic components that were recorded in the SH 130 ROW postdate
the Civil War, and fall into four site types, and include 12 farmsteads, 29 house sites, 1 livestock pen, 1
gravesite, and 5 trash dumps. One site (41WM1018) contained only one clear glass shard and is not
included in the four types above.
The oldest identified farmstead is that of the Sherrill family (41GU84) in Guadalupe County, which was
first settled in the 1860s. Farmsteads dating from the late nineteenth century and later include three in
Segment A (41WM1132, 41TV1975, and 41TV1976), two in Segment B (41TV150 and 41TV2000), and
seven in Segment C (41CW78, 41CW87–41CW90, 41GU81, and 41GU83).
House sites (also referred to as homesteads) or residences were the most common historic site type
recorded during the survey, comprising nearly 70 percent of all of the recorded historic sites. Most of
these residences were occupied for decades. Ten had extant structures, two had structural remains, and the
remainder were identified from artifact scatters. A few of the house sites, such as 41WM1025 and
41TV1977 in Segment A, and 41TV1989 in Segment B, may have been built during the mid-nineteenth
century. An additional nine were constructed in the late nineteenth century. The others date to the
twentieth century.
Five trash dumps were recorded. These are associated with house sites located outside the SH 130 ROW.
One of these (41WM1014) contained artifacts dating from as early as the mid-nineteenth century; the
others date to the twentieth century.
One gravesite was recorded in Segment B. Found within the site boundary of 41TV150, the interment
was that of a female, aged approximately 40–44 years. The remains were exhumed in January 2004.
Efforts to identify the individual, including using mitochondrial DNA, were unsuccessful. Reinterment of
the remains took place at Onion Creek Memorial Park, a perpetual care cemetery in Austin, Texas, in
September 2005 (Kalter et al. 2005).
Table 11 lists all of the historic sites (and age of the occupations) recorded in Segments A, B, and C.

Abstract
Geoarchaeological investigations of Parcel 360 conducted by PBS&J at 41TV410 located on State
Highway 130 Segment B in Travis County, Texas, exposed the dispersed remnants of a small prehistoric
rock hearth. The hearth was spatially associated with a stream-rolled cobble with a possible grinding
surface. Manual excavation of the 1-meter-square and 20- to 30-centimeter-thick hearth zone (designated
Feature 1) yielded a considerable amount of soil, which has been floated for cultural and paleobotanical
remains. Results of screening the surrounding 2.5-by-2.5-meter-square drop and toss zones (designated
Block 1) through ¼-inch metal mesh included one chert core fragment, three chert flakes, several burned
limestone fragments, and charcoal fragments. No animal bone was observed in situ or during screening,
although mussel shell fragments and Rabdotus shell fragments were encountered. Paleobotanical remains
identified from the site included oak and sycamore. A sample of the wood charcoal yielded a calibrated
2-sigma date of A.D. 660–790.
Based on the absence of robust returns from the manual excavation of Block 1, it is the recommendation
of the Principal Investigator that no further work is warranted for those portions of site 41TV410 in
Parcels 360 and 361 and the surrounding acreage within the originally surveyed right of way.

I. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of archaeological investigations conducted by PBS&J at prehistoric site
41TV410, located within Segment B of State Highway 130 (SH 130) in Travis County, Texas.
Archaeological survey and backhoe trenching at this location were mandated by the Protocol for Historic
Property Identification, Evaluation and Treatment for the SH 130 Project, submitted in the Scope of
Work with the application for Texas Antiquities Permit 2692. Signatories of the protocol included the
Texas Transportation Authority Division (TTAD), the Texas Department of Transportation
Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT ENV), and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The
excavations and analyses presented in this report were conducted in compliance with the sampling,
collection, and discard procedures described in the protocol.
Investigations at the site were also conducted to evaluate its potential for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) using 36 CFR 60.4 Criteria for Evaluation, and as a Texas State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). This investigation was performed in compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915 USC 4231, 1970); the Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the Archaeological Resources Protection Act
of 1979; and guidelines set forth by the THC, the Council of Texas Archeologists, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Site 41TV410 was originally recorded in 1979 as a prehistoric open campsite situated on a fossil
Pleistocene terrace of Onion Creek. The site was described in Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) site files as containing in situ rock-lined hearths, mussel shells, bones, and lithic debitage
occurring at depths of 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) along the south bank of the creek. Today
the site is located in an overgrown pasture containing various tall grasses, a pecan grove, and several
varieties of hardwoods growing along the fenceline above the creek cutbank. Elevation at site nucleus
within the SH130 right of way (ROW) is approximately 400 feet (ft), or 122 meters (m), above mean sea
level (amsl). The soils are Mollisols, mapped as Lewisville silty clay loam (Werchan et al. 1974). One
natural gas pipeline runs roughly northwest-southeast through the site along the eastern edge of the ROW,
while three pipelines run roughly north-south outside the site along the western edge of the ROW.
In 2002, portions of the site in parcels 354 and 361 were shovel tested by PBS&J (Rogers et al. 2002), but
Parcel 360 remained uninvestigated pending landowner approval. Because of low ground surface
visibility, no artifacts were observed on the surface during the survey. Nine shovel tests were excavated at
the site within Parcels 354 and 361 (Figure C-1); all were negative as were shovel tests outside the site
within the ROW. In a letter from TxDOT ENV to the THC dated April 4, 2002, TxDOT ENV agreed

with PBS&J’s recommendations that construction at 41TV410 not proceed until the rest of the site within
the ROW could be tested for NRHP eligibility.
In 2003, portions of the site in parcel 360 were shovel tested by PBS&J (Hales et al. 2003), but landowner
approval was not granted for trenching in Parcels 360 and 361. As with the previous survey, no artifacts
were observed on the surface due to low ground surface visibility. A total of six shovel tests were
excavated at the site within Parcel 360 (see Figure C-1); all were negative, as were shovel tests outside
the site within the ROW. In a letter from TxDOT ENV to the THC dated September 4, 2003, TxDOT
ENV agreed with PBS&J’s recommendations that construction at 41TV410 not proceed until the site
could be trenched for NRHP eligibility within the ROW.

II. GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Between November 10 and 22, 2005, PBS&J conducted geoarchaeological investigations at Parcels 360
and 361 with landowner approval. The purpose of the investigations was to determine whether deeply
buried archaeological sites occurred in the two parcels, and particularly within the confines of the known
boundary of previously recorded prehistoric site 41TV410 (Hales et al. 2003; Rogers et al. 2002).
However, the investigations were restricted to the portion of the ROW east of a high-pressure pipeline.
The entire area investigated totaled approximately 5 acres.
The mechanical excavations conducted during geoarchaeological investigations conformed to guidelines
set forth in the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards as
presented in the Federal Register, Part II, 29 CFR Part 1926. Prior to trenching, an effort was made to
locate any underground cables, pipes, or utility installations in the area of the proposed trenching.
Trenches extending deeper than 5 ft (1.52 m) were stepped back, and all fill materials were stored a
minimum of 2 ft (0.61 m) away from the top of the trench. The excavation of backhoe and trackhoe
trenches was carefully monitored by PBS&J staff archaeologists. Both machines were fitted with a flat
hoe or plate across the teeth of the bucket to create a smooth surface during excavation. Frequent stops
were made to examine trench wall and back dirt for cultural remains. Culturally sterile trenches were
immediately backfilled after recording.
Five backhoe trenches were excavated in Parcel 360 and two trenches in Parcel 361 (Figure C-2). All of
the trenches were placed in the alluvial terrace of Onion Creek. Trenches T360-1 and T360-4 were
excavated along the lowermost portion of the alluvial terrace, Trenches T360-2 and T360-5 in the
midsection, and Trenches T360-3, T360-6, T361-1, and T361-2 were excavated in the upper portion of
the terrace. Sediments observed in the trenches were relatively uniform, and consisted of thick-bedded to
massive-calcareous silts, silty clay and sands. Dense gravels occurred in Trenches 1 and 4.
Sparse cultural materials were encountered in Trenches T360-1, T360-3, T360-4, and T361-1. Most of
these materials occurred at depths of over 200 cmbs. They consisted of a single utilized flake in Trench

T360-1 (270 cmbs), two flakes in Trench T360-3 (210 cmbs), mussel shell and charcoal in Trench T360-4
(300 cmbs), and a tested cobble in Trench T361-1 (110 cmbs).
A meeting to discuss the results of the geoarchaeological investigations was held between TxDOT ENV
and PBS&J. During the meeting it was agreed that the lowermost part of the alluvial terrace adjacent to
Onion Creek within Parcel 360, particularly the area around Trenches T360-1 and T360-4, appeared to
contain deeply buried cultural deposits including artifacts, subsistence remains and datable carbon.
However, insufficient work had been performed to recommend NRHP eligibility testing. It was therefore
decided that a much larger part of the lower terrace would be mechanically excavated.
The additional mechanical excavations utilized a 345L Trackhoe to excavate an area measuring
approximately 20 x 45 m in size, with long axis parallel to Onion Creek, to a depth of approximately 3 m
(Figure C-3). This effort resulted in the exposure of one stone-lined hearth, with carbon and a large
(25 x 50 cm) limestone slab at a depth of 3 m (Figure C-4). In a telephone conversation with Dr. Lain
Ellis of TxDOT ENV, PBS&J was advised to continue with the mechanical excavations in the remaining
unexplored portion of the lowermost alluvial terrace, to expose the stone-lined hearth, and to manually
excavate the activity area around the hearth (i.e., the drop and toss zones). Geoarchaeological
investigations conducted outside of this area in Parcels 360 and 361 failed to locate any significant
cultural resources.

III. MANUAL EXCAVATIONS
Between November 28 and December 9, 2005, PBS&J conducted manual excavations and limited shovel
testing within a large mechanically excavated pit at site 41TV410 measuring approximately 125 m in
length by 25 m in width (see Figure C-3). The hearth within that pit is hereafter referred to as Feature 1,
and the 5-x-5-m area gridded around the feature is referred to as Block 1.

FIELD METHODS
Within Block 1 and around Feature 1, arbitrary 10-cm-thick levels were excavated within natural
stratigraphic layers. Feature matrix within a 1-m area around the hearth zone (Figure C-5) was bagged in
the field and later floated for ongoing light and heavy fraction analysis. Soils within the 2 m2 drop zone
and within three 50-x-50-cm units in the toss zone were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth, with
only a 20-x-20-cm corner of each unit bagged for flotation.
Cultural materials, fire-cracked rocks, carbonized macrobotanical remains, and land snails were collected
by level and unit within the hearth zone, drop zone, and toss zone. Provenience and descriptive
information was recorded on standard unit level forms detailing artifact content, floor drawings,
photographs, accessioning information, and comments. Large-scale plans were also prepared for each
level of excavation, recording the exact position of every unit and feature in the block plus the location

and elevation of point-plotted fire-cracked rocks, charcoal, landsnails, and cultural remains exposed
during excavation. All unit levels, profiles, and feature components were photographed by a color digital
camera and 35-mm camera. All photographic information was recorded on photographic logs detailing
the subject, photo direction, photographer, and date. All four walls of the drop zone were profiled after
excavation and the soil strata described to aid in reconstructing site formation processes.

Paleobotanical Analysis
PBS&J submitted flotation and macrobotanical samples from 41TV410 to Shumla Archeobotanical
Services for analysis. The purpose of the current botanical study is to identify plant remains from the site
and to assess its potential for contributing significant data pertaining to the prehistoric economy of the
region.
The analysis followed standard archaeobotanical laboratory procedures. Each flotation sample was passed
through a nested set of screens of 4-mm, 2-mm, and 0.4500-mm mesh and examined for charred material,
separated for identification. Charred wood caught on the 4-mm and 2-mm mesh screens was separated for
weighing, counting, and identification. Carbonized wood from the 4-mm and 2-mm screens (smaller
pieces are seldom identifiable) was separated in a grab sample and identified. The material caught on all
of the sieve levels, including the bottom pan, was scanned for floral parts, fruits, and seeds. The
carbonized macrobotanical samples collected from excavation screens was sorted and identified.
Identification of carbonized wood was accomplished by using the snap technique, examining them at 8 to
45 magnifications with a hand lens or a binocular dissecting microscope. Identifications were made using
wood or seed identification manuals and wood, seed, and plant voucher reference collections in the
laboratory at Shumla Archeobotanical Services.
The density of the plant materials was low, and only wood charcoal fragments were identified in the
samples. Evidence for biological disturbance in the light fraction included gastropods along with roots
and leaves. Carbonized wood taxa were limited to oak and sycamore. Less than a gram of charred
material was recovered from the 15-liter flotation sample. A single point- or screen-collected
macrobotanical sample was also examined, yielding similar results. Sycamore wood fragments were
recovered from both samples, and oak wood was recovered from the flotation sample. The identifications
and counts are presented in Table 1.

Plant remains from the site were limited in both quantity and taxon abundance. Both samples from
41TV410 lacked any carbonized seeds, and based on these results the site lacks any potential to produce
useful data on the subsistence economy of the region. This conclusion is supported by the fact that less
than 0.1 gram of charcoal was recovered from a substantially large, 15-liter flotation sample.

Radiocarbon Dating
One of the charcoal samples found during the Feature 1 excavations was submitted to Beta Analytic
Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory for radiocarbon dating. The sample yielded a calibrated 2-sigma date of
A.D. 680–770.

LABORATORY METHODS
Standard procedures for processing artifacts were used in the PBS&J archaeological laboratory. Artifacts
were washed, cataloged, and labeled prior to analysis and curation. Cataloging and labeling were to
TARL curational standards. Prehistoric lithic artifacts were sorted by reduction stage or functional
classification. Raw material type for each piece was recorded.

RESULTS
Results of the manual excavation of Feature 1 and its surrounding drop and toss zones confirmed that the
feature was indeed the remnants of a small and shallow prehistoric cooking hearth, spatially associated
with a large river cobble apparently used briefly as a ground stone food preparation tool. Backdirt on the
western side of the block was first screened through ¼-inch wire mesh to retrieve materials disturbed
during mechanical exposure of the feature before beginning excavation. The exposed surface of Feature 1
and a surrounding 5-x-5-m area were then cleaned by hand and gridded (Figure C-6). The southeastern
corner of Block 1 was arbitrarily given the designation N500 E 500, with 1-m-square units given the
designation of their southwest corner. A datum was established on the exposed surface in Unit N501
E496 with an absolute elevation of 417.9 ft amsl, and excavation levels were measured from a string line
established 20 cm above the surface at 437 ft amsl.
Level 1 (20–30 centimeters below datum [cmbd]) contained at least seven fire-cracked rocks and several
clusters of charcoal associated with the upper hearth zone of Feature 1 and the ground stone cobble
resting nearby (Figure C-7). Several fragments of this ground stone and several fire-cracked rocks were
encountered during screening of the backdirt located on the west side of Block 1, indicating that the top of
the original occupation surface had been slightly truncated by the trackhoe. The dispersed nature of the
charcoal across Level 1 (Figure C-8) suggested some lateral movement from the hearth after its
abandonment as well as subsequent burial by alluvial deposits. Identification of recovered materials
indicates that one secondary chert flake was encountered in Unit N503 E 496 during excavation.

Level 2 (30–40 cmbd) contained at least three fire-cracked rocks and several flecks of charcoal associated
with the lower hearth zone of Feature 1 and the ground stone cobble resting nearby (Figure C-9). The
basal impression of the ground stone cobble was exposed at 36 cmbd (Figure C-10), lying on a 5-cmthick layer of silty clay just above the sterile sand and gravel substrate. The fire-cracked rock hearth and
cobble grinding tool therefore appeared to have been deposited upon a thin layer of alluvial soil before
becoming disturbed and then buried by a slightly later flood event. Preliminary identification of recovered
materials indicates that one tertiary chert flake was encountered in Unit N502 E496, one tertiary chert
flake in Unit 502 E498, and one chert core in Unit N502 E497.
Level 3 (40–50 cmbd) was only present in the northern two 1-x-1-m units and did not contain any firecracked rocks or charcoal beneath the lower hearth zone of Feature 1 (Figure C-11). Profiling of all four
walls of the 2 m2 drop zone (Figure C-12) revealed three thin strata:
Zone I, 10YR 5/4 yellowish brown silty clay with 10 percent gravel
Zone II, 10YR 5/2 grayish brown silty clay with 20 percent gravel
Zone III, 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow fine sand.
Zone III appears to have been a small flood event of limited volume that deposited a thin veneer of fine
sand over the previously deposited gravel bar. Zone II appears to be an even slower flood event that
deposited an alluvial silty clay upon which the inhabitants of 41TV410 constructed the hearth at Feature 1
and the ground stone cobble next to it. Land snails found in and around Feature 1 and elsewhere within
this same soil horizon mechanically exposed across the site suggest that a certain amount of time elapsed
after the hearth was abandoned, during which vegetation grew dense enough to provide an attractive
habitat for the snails. Zone I appears to have been a subsequent low-volume flood event in which the
abandoned hearth was disturbed and the stones dispersed within a 2-m radius around the ground stone
cobble. At some point after this event, a much higher-volume flood deposited up to 1 m of sands and
gravels on top of the disturbed hearth remains, in-filling a slight depression or back channel located
between Feature 1 and the modern channel of Onion Creek.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In a letter from TxDOT ENV to THC dated December 9, 2005, TxDOT ENV stated that “Unless
unexpectedly robust returns are forthcoming from that sampling [of Block 1], the site’s ability to
contribute to prehistory will be exhausted.” Based on the absence of robust returns from the manual
excavation of Block 1, it is the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that no further work is
warranted for those portions of site 41TV410 in Parcels 360 and 361 and the surrounding acreage within
the originally surveyed ROW.
