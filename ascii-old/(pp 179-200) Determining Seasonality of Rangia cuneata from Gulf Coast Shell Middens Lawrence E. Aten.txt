ABSTRACT
A method is described for efficiently recording seasonality characteristics from the shell of the
temperate, estuarine clam Rangia cuneata (Gray) as it occurs archeologically on the coast of the
northern Gulf of Mexico. The seasonal growth stage morphology is classified according to the
ratio of most recent growth to the extent of a full year’s growth. This classification is applied to a
sample of 50 shells and resulting frequency distribution of growth stages compared to a master
sequence. The master sequence is based on modern collections of R. cuneata. A match between
archeological and master sequence samples is used to infer seasonality of the archeological shells
and their context. The range of error is ± 1 month.

INTRODUCTION
Shell middens are peerless as a comprehensive record of the historical
interaction between man and nature in coastal zones. However, they are
reaching an attenuated state as a result of thousands of years of erosion by
nature and centuries of exploitation by man for road and building construction materials. This situation is particularly serious since shell middens are one
of the most prolific sources of cultural and environmental information. Many
archeological observations of molluscs and other shell midden materials are
convertible to baseline data about the status of coastal environments prior to
the alteration of worldwide air and water chemistry by industrial societies
beginning in the 19th Century. Because of this, middens which do remain are
increasing in value as a national resource for environmental monitoring.
Shell middens have many interpretive advantages. Aside from the mollusc
shell, which itself is a major data source, the carbonate enriched sediment
enables near total preservation of bone material. The shell matrix discourages
burrowing animals and limits effects of solifluction. The shell bulk dilutes
time/space volumetric relationships of deposition so that small temporal increments of archeological deposits can be documented. The often waterlogged condition of these sites enhances the retention of seldom preserved
materials such as uncarbonized seeds, cordage, bark, and wood. From observation of midden shell condition, morphology, structure, composition, and
demography, conclusions may be drawn about:
1. Radiocarbon age of the shells and their context;
2. Time or season of year shellfish collection occurred;
3. Qualitative and quantitative dietary contribution;
4. Differentiating separate occupational episodes;

5. Identifying hearth and other activity features within occupational episodes;

6. Effects of human predation on shellfish populations;
7. Postdepositional climatic history of a site and its immediate area;
8. History of clam habitat water chemistry;
9. High resolution reconstruction of the region’s paleotemperature record;
I0. Evolution of estuaries and other landforms.
As a corollary to investigation of shell middens on the upper Texas coast,
several of these questions were studied as they pertain to the temperate,
estuarine, epifaunal clam Rangia cuneata (Gray) within that portion of its
range located on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Andrews,
1971:186). An analysis of the use of R. cuneata for radiocarbon dating is
available (Aten, 1979:Appendix A).
Results of investigations into determining the collection season of Rangia
cuneata shells are presented. The ability to evaluate collection time represents
a potential for precisely controlling settlement scheduling and related questions for possibly 80% of the shell middens within the coastal zone of Texas
and Louisiana. Brief descriptions of this procedure were published previously
in Aten (1972, 1976, 1977), Dillehay (1975), Gilmore (1974), and McGuff
(1978). Other applications of R. cuneata to archeological problems remain
under investigation.

CONCEPTS
A basic observation on the growth of organisms is that they manifest cyclical
features. These cycles reflect metabolic responses to environmental and
physiological conditions of greater or lesser duration. At a major scale, rates
of growth or metabolic function respond to phases of the life cycle; while near
the opposite extreme of scale, growth responds to diurnal cycles. The question arises, therefore, whether this property of organisms, as documented in
mollusc shells, can be used on Gulf coast archeological problems for which
relatively precise determinations of season are required. General introductions to pelecypod shell growth are available (Rhoads and Pannella, 1970;
Barker, 1970; Berta, 1976; Kennish and Olsson, 1975; Rosenberg and Runcorn, 1975).
Approaches to seasonality analysis may be categorized as either chemical,
structural, morphological, or demographic. Chemical techniques (Shackleton, 1973; Killingley, 1981) measure oxygen isotope ratios to determine
water temperature at the time shell was formed. A series of mass spectrometer measurements are made on a shell to construct a temperature curve from
which collection season is inferred. This procedure is essential for paleotemperature research, but for archeological purposes it is technologically complex. The method is useful primarily on specimens from temperate climates
and its accuracy can be matched by other techniques.
Structural methods involve cutting a shell parallel to its width and examining the growth increments in the cross section either through thin section or
acetate peel (Coutts, 1970; Coutts and Higham, 1971; Koike, 1975; Rhoads
and Pannella, 1970). The method involves counting the daily increments of
growth between two periods of annual growth interruption. Because of prob-

Aten - Rangia cuneata

181

lems in identifying and interpreting the daily increments, an error of from I to
3 months is possible. Moreover, the daily and annual growth increments in
the shell are manifested best when there are strong warm and cold temperature cycles. Consequently, this method is less effective on subtidal and tropical species.
Morphological methods are practical when cyclical environmental variations in the mollusc habitat are sufficiently pronounced that gross morphology
of the shell is affected (Aten, 1972; Coutts and Higham, 1971; Weide,
1969). These methods compare the proportion of most recent growth to the
total annual growth increment. Under appropriate conditions, morphological
techniques can easily duplicate the level of precision attainable with structural
techniques. They probably are the simplest procedures now available and
have the particular advantage of being usable while in the field.
Demographic methods are based on changes in the mean shell size of a
shellfish population; this will cycle as juveniles grow larger and adults die.
Although the method is simple, its archeological applications are limited. For
small, short lived species such as the coquina, Donax variabilis, the results
(Miller, 1980) appear comparable to the morphological and structural
methods. For larger species (including Rangia cuneata) with several age
classes in the population, this technique probably would give a much less
satisfactory result. If the shellfish population was being collected intensively,
size data and seasonality conclusions would be confounded by predation
effects (Swadling, 1976).
Because Rangia cuneata is a temperate species with prominent growth
related shell morphology, a morphological technique was developed for
seasonality analysis. The approach is technologically simple, relatively fast,
and yields results as precise as the structural methods. R. cuneata is a practical
species to use because once it has settled on the water bottom as a juvenile
clam, it has total osmoregulatory ability. It can adjust its blood salinity to that
of the environment, thereby keeping its growth functionally unaffected by
significant changes in habitat salinity (Hopkins et al., 1973:70-74). This important adaptive capability limits the effects of environmental phenomena,
such as storms and neap tides, which act on shellfish physiology to inhibit shell
growth through creation of major salinity changes in the clam habitat.
Morphological seasonality methods require an understanding of pelecypod growth features. There are a variety of growth increments on mollusc
shell, from a few microns to several millimeters in width, all of which have
physiological, environmental, and/or chronological significance. These reflect subdaily, daily, tidal, lunar month, and annual growth periodicity (Kennish and Olsson, 1975:52).
Evidence of other phenomena causing growth reductions and interruptions is superimposed on patterns of shell growth: freeze shocks, heat shocks,
spawning breaks, storm breaks, and neap tide breaks (Kennish and Olsson,
1975). Each of these is characterized by distinctive patterns of growth prior
and subsequent to the growth interruption. Therefore, many of the environmental conditions of the shellfish habitat and, indirectly, those of the region,
are identifiable by the growth patterns preserved in the shell structure,
morphology, and composition. Principal tasks in a morphological approach

182

are to identify, amidst the noise of other growth and interruption features, the
annual growth increment and the proportion of this annual increment represented by the most recent period of growth prior to its death (collection).

METHOD
This method provides a systematic basis for classifying individual valves of
Rangia cuneata into growth stage classes employing macroscopic observational techniques. It has two basic parts: identification of annual growth increments which ordinarily are separated by a narrow, indented band around the
shell marking the annual growth interruption; and determination of which
stage in this cycle is represented by the most recent growth. For purposes of
orientation, typical R. cuneata shell morphology is shown in Figure 1A.
Through inspection and comparison with the age/length data in Table 1, it
usually is possible to identify, tentatively at least, one of the annual growth
interruption rings because of its dimension and/or prominence. Ordinarily,
second or third year rings are the easiest to recognize. A pair of sliding calipers
are set at the interval separating the tentatively identified annual ring and an
adjacent prominent growth ring. By moving up and down the growth axis
(i.e., width) of the valve, it can be seen if this interval matches additional
major rings.
If the measured interval between the rings in question matches prominent
rings over the entire width of the shell, then an annual growth increment
match likely has been made. If this interval does not match prominent rings
for the entire valve, then the annual ring sequence probably has not been
correctly identified. If this occurs, another tentative annual growth interval
should be selected and the procedure repeated.
Although there are exceptions, only two types of important growth interruption rings usually have to be distinguished on Rangia cuneata. These rings
are the major growth reduction or interruption ring associated with the cold
season; and a less frequent and shorter duration thermal shock interruption
ring apparently associated with high water temperatures of July and August.
The summer season ring usually is less prominent morphologically and occurs (if at all) near the middle of the annual growth increment.
One can often match across most of the shell width, more or less equal
intervals between winter and summer interruptions. For this reason, it is important to count the number of these rings to estimate the age of the shellfish.
Then shell length is measured at the last growth interruption ring and an age
estimate of the shellfish is derived from Table 1. If the summer increments
were mistaken for a cold season growth interruption, the clam will appear to
be nearly twice as old, by growth ring count, than the result from Table 1. The
average annual increment of growth is not exactly the same for all years in the
shellfish’s life cycle. The amount of difference from year to year, however, is
not great (Table 2) and does not obstruct analysis so long as the point is not
overlooked.
This method for evaluating annual ring increments is illustrated in Figure
lB. For demonstration purposes only, the sample valve shown in profile is

taken to measure 45 mm in length. A shell 45 mm in length can be estimated
to be in its fourth year of growth (Table 1). Growth increments roughly in the
middle of the valve can be matched (Fig. 1B). However, in going towards the
earlier and later growth periods, comparable matching growth interruption
rings are lacking. It is possible for an annual ring occasionally to be manifested
very slightly and to escape recognition; but it is rare for this situation to occur
repeatedly on a single valve. An evaluation based on matches in the small,
middle segment shown in the lower portion of Figure 1B is dubious and
probably represents misidentification of summer thermal shock interruptions
as major cold season annual rings.
The evaluation can be checked further by counting the putative annual
rings, including interpolation for missing rings. That count would indicate the

clam in the example was 8 years old when collected. This estimate is twice the
age indicated from Table 1 and far exceeds a reasonable estimate of age
based on the growth curve for a 45 mm long clam.
Alternatively, by matching growth increments as shown on the upper part
of Figure IB (i.e., a wider annual growth increment), then it is possible to
translate or match that interval to all major growth interruption rings on the
valve. Counting the number of these increments, the approximate result obtained is that this clam would represent a 4 1/2 year old individual. This
estimate is consistent with the age/length estimate from Table 1. Having
arrived at this determination of ring pattern, identification of the sequence of
annual growth interruption episodes during the cold weather season may be
assumed.
In the example (Fig. 1B), the last period of growth on the shell is an incomplete annual increment. The sliding calipers are set at the width of the most
recent complete annual growth increments. While maintaining this setting,
the calipers are then set over the latest partial increment of growth. By inspection, the full increment width is subdivided into three equal units which, for
convenience, are labeled Early, Middle, and Late.
The seasonal classification of the shell is based on which of the three equal
subdivisions is aligned with the final growing edge of the clam. In the example
(Fig. 1B), this specimen would be classed as a clam in the Middle period of the
annual growth cycle. Had the growing edge been longer and extended into
the last third, it would be classed as Late; if it extended into the period of
growth interruption, as marked by the beginning of a groove and an inward
turning of the growing edge, it would be classed as Interrupted.
Those complete valves for which a growth stage is not confidently determinable, or whose growth morphology is indistinct for some reason, should
be placed in a fifth classification category labeled Indeterminate. This category
has important analytical value and should not be used without making a
careful effort to classify each valve into one of the four growth classes.
In the Rangia cuneata method, classification of the latest growth increment
before death is made by inspection. Evidence is lacking that more precise
measurement of this last increment (Coutts and Higham, 1971) would yield a

186

superior determination of seasonality for this species. The range of error in
selecting appropriate landmarks on the valve from which to measure ordinarily exceeds the metric accuracy necessary to make growth stage estimates on
a more precise basis. This problem has been approached on R. cuneata by
using a visual evaluation of growth increments in terms of the four ordinal
growth categories (Early, Middle, Late, and Interrupted) on a large sample of
valves.
Rangia cuneata samples occasionally are encountered in which the
seasonal changes of the clam habitat evidently were not as intense as usual.
As a result, it may be difficult to discern where interruptions in shell growth
took place and which of these interruptions occurred during the annual cold
season. The best procedure is to spread out all of the valves to be classified
and inspect them for growth event regularities and irregularities affecting the
sample as a whole. Ordinarily, there will be some shells in the sample which
display prominent annual rings. Working from these specimens, an overall
impression is gained of the growth characteristics of that particular population. From this initial inspection of the whole sample, it generally is possible to
go on to evaluate growth on the individual shells.
Different archeological samples often represent breeding populations
which experienced a variety of habitat conditions. The resulting phenotypic
variation in shells must be recognized in order to evaluate growth stages successfully. The appearance of growth increments can be expected to change
with each new sample. Initially, these may appear hopelessly confused and
variable. However, there usually is a pronounced central tendency for the
length of shells in a given population for each age grade. Once this tendency is
identified with the aid of age/size models (Table 1) and an approximation has
been made of the increment of shell growth during the annual growth period
for a given age grade, growth stage evaluation can proceed.

EVALUATING THE CLASSIFICATION
The classification of growth stages has proved to be sensitive to population
growth changes over very short periods of time. Usually, this sensitivity has
meant intervals of about two weeks, although there is some variation, particularly during the cold season. Once frequency data for the sample have been
compiled into growth stages, the next step is to relate these to the annual
growth cycle. This relationship is expressed by arranging the data in a relative
frequency histogram (Fig. 2) and comparing it against a master sequence.
The master sequence (Fig. 3) is based on growth stage classification of 30
modern Rangia cuneata samples collected semimonthly from several Iocations on the upper Texas coast for most periods of the year (Table 3). Often,
more than one sample was taken in different years or from different upper
coast locations from some of these semimonthly periods. The multiple samples have been averaged together to provide histogram patterns (Fig. 3)
which represent the upper Texas coast as a whole. Because the growing edge
of the living clam is a very thin, delicate margin, it is almost always broken off
of archeological specimens by the periostracum as it dries and flakes off the

shell. In order to compensate for this condition, the growing edge was
scraped off all modern samples.
The frequency histogram of an archeological sample (excluding the Indeterminate category) is compared to this master sequence of growth stages to
identify which of the semimonthly increments provides the closest match in
terms of histogram shape. It is this identity that is taken to be the seasonality
estimate of the archeological sample. The principal feature of the histograms
is not the absolute value of growth stages represented in a sample or the
position of the modal class. Evaluation of a histogram must include the pattern formed by the secondary growth categories as well. It is the overall pattern of relationships between growth categories that is matched against the
master sequence.

The Indeterminate category is used as a control on the evaluation method.
In modern samples of Rangia cuneata used to prepare the master sequence,
the Indeterminate category fluctuates around a mean of nearly 13%, with a
standard deviation of about 4% (Fig. 4). This fluctuation means that when an
archeological sample’s Indeterminate category exceeds a range of from 5 to
21% (two standard deviations from the mean), the origin of this excessive
deviation should be determined.
If it can be shown through cross checking the classification with different
evaluators that these criteria have been applied uniformly and produced replicable results (Fig. 2), then the shells should be checked to see which morphological features caused the rate of indeterminancy to be increased or decreased beyond expectations for normal populations. In some cases, the
reason can be attributed readily to poor shell preservation such as erosion of
morphologic detail through leaching or weathering processes. Or, it may be
traceable to perturbations in the habitat of the living clam. Under some circumstances, these observations can be developed into paleoclimatic data and
inferences (Aten, 1972:5).
As an example of interpretation, a sample from site 41HR85 (Aten et al.,
1976), has the following key attributes (Fig. 2): 1) indeterminate category is
within the normal range; 2) overall pattern is unimodal in the Middle stage;
and 3) secondary abundances are Early greater than Late greater than Interrupted (E> L~ Int).
This sample may be viewed as an instantaneous slice of a clam population’s
annual growth dynamics. Nearly all of the population has passed out of the
period of growth interruption; most have passed beyond the period of initial
or Early growth. The majority of individuals are in the Middle of their active
growth period, and some members have entered the Late or final phases of
active growth during this growing year. Comparison of the shape of this histogram (Fig. 2) with those of the master sequence (Fig. 3) indicates that the only
histogram bearing a comparable shape is that derived from modern samples
for the end of the month of May. The slight differences in classification of the
same sample by a second worker (Fig. 2) does not alter this interpretation of
seasonality; it is replicable.
As a second example, the modern clam sample collected on August 18,
1971 (Fig. 2) was evaluated by Sorter B as if it were an archeological sample
of unknown collection season. The key attributes are: 1) indeterminates are
within the normal range; 2) histogram is unimodal (because growth is cyclic,
the Late category is succeeded by the Interrupted category at the beginning of
the histogram); 3) mode is in the Late stage; and 4) secondary abundances
are Interrupted greater than Early slightly greater than Middle (Int~E~M).
Comparison of the shape of this histogram (Fig. 2) with those of the master
sequence (Fig. 3) indicates that the only histogram bearing a comparable
shape is the one for mid August. In this case, Sorter B knew neither the date of
collection nor the results of evaluation by Sorter A. A histogram from any
other period of the year could not be confused with this particular one for mid
August. This classification was replicable in that slight differences in sorting by
the two workers would not alter the interpretation of collection season.
Because of the relatively rapid progress of the growth stage mode through
the calendar, especially when this progress is viewed as the pattern combina-

tion of four categories, it often is possible to recognize samples of varying
modes of origin. Samples representing a single episode of collection, a series
of single collection episodes during the same month but repeated over a
period of years, or a continuous collection (occupation) for not more than a
month or so will all produce clam growth stage histograms strongly unimodal
in one or, rarely, two sequential growth stage categories.
For many survey and testing purposes, distinguishing among these three
possibilities is not of great importance. If the samples were from excavations
of individual habitation areas, other field evidence might indicate which type
of occupation took place. Occasionally, however, a sample either will lack a
mode or display a weak mode in two or more adjacent growth stages. Conditions in nature will not produce such evenly distributed growth classes simultaneously in a Rangia cuneata population. The cause must be either an
error in sorting technique or a sample consisting of a composite of clams
collected over a span of time exceeding one month, but probably less than
three months.
If a bimodal histogram occurs, this reflects either error or a composite sample in which substantial seasonal separation of occupations has occurred
(probably more than three but less than six months). In evaluation of more
than 300 Rangia samples using this seasonality method, bimodal frequencies
did not occur. Because such composite distributions must be a very rare
occurrence, a significant effort should be made to determine whether error in
technique is the cause before proposing cultural explanations.
If a large number of seasonality estimates exist from a single cultural unit,
these can be easily summarized on a statistical basis by assigning a coded
value to each semimonthly seasonality increment (Fig. 5). In the example
(Fig. 5), the mean of 18 seasonality estimates is 4.8, which correlates approximately with a mid to end May season. The standard deviation is 0.7, or
approximately 3/4 of a month. The first standard deviation range is 4.1 to
5.5, translatable to a collection period extending from the beginning of May
through mid June.
Review of figures 3 and 4 verifies the discrete character of most of the
semimonthly histograms. The ability to evaluate modern samples of known
date correctly when they are treated as unknowns (Fig. 2) provides added
confidence. The most difficult application of the master sequence occurs with
samples from the September to November period and February. However,
archeological samples attributable to these periods are rare on the Texas
coast.
This approach actually correlates the archeological Rangia cuneata growth
patterns with a set of modern environmental conditions yielding similar
growth patterns. However, the relation of the calendar to environmental conditions may have shifted somewhat, especially over the short term. In this
sense, the archeological seasonality estimates are floating. However, because
there is little between year variation in the correlation of growth stage histograms from modern samples with their collection dates (Table 3), the recent
accuracy of this method is within + I month and likely may not be more than
+ 1/2 month.

SAMPLE SELECTION
Individual members of any given Rangia cuneata population vary slightly in
their growth rate (Fig. 3; Table 3). Thus, for any given time of year, the
population growth pattern will be unique. This unique growth pattern is revealed through classification of a large sample of individual shells. Samples of
100 valves were used initially, but samples of 50 valves did not entail loss of
information in the clarity of growth stage histograms. If shell morphology is
well developed and well preserved, samples of less than 50 valves may be
evaluated if necessary; however, fewer than 20 valves should be used only
with the utmost caution.

194

Texas Archeological Society

The most suitable Rangia cuneata shells to use for seasonality classification
are those in the third and fourth year age groups. Shellfish younger than 2
years have not completed an annual increment of shell growth as an adult;
therefore, the latest growth stage cannot be compared with its pattern of adult
growth. In exceptional cases (e.g., when third year clams are not available),
second year clams could be used to make a generalized estimate of growth
stage, such as assignment to early or late in the growth cycle. This assignment
would permit at least a crude estimate of the season of collection.
On shells 5 or more years old, annual rings become progressively more
difficult to distinguish. Feeding and respiratory efficiency of bivalve molluscs
decreases as they grow larger so that their growth is a self limiting process
(Stanley, 1970:54). Although the between year variation in width of new
growth is not great in Rangia cuneata (Table 2), methodological noise in the
histograms is minimized by concentrating on samples from a single, or
perhaps two sequential, age classes.
In selecting a sample, the principal criterion to observe is that all specimens
should be as capable of interpretation as when originally taken from their
habitat. Specimens should be selected carefully for: 1) age/size (preferably
third or fourth year clams); 2) completeness (must have an umbo to growing
edge section); and 3) preservation (shells must not be heavily eroded or
leached).
The sorting class of Indeterminate does not refer to fragmentary, eroded,
or otherwise degraded shells. The Indeterminate class is needed for whole,
well preserved shells of optimum size which nevertheless grew an indistinct or
equivocal morphology precluding assignment to a growth category. While
Indeterminates are not a growth stage, they are a function of growth processes in the clam population and serve as a methodological check.
Another important sampling factor is the selection of either right or left
valves for growth stage evaluation. This selection has not been observed
uniformly in the archeological samples because of the extreme bilateral symmetry in this species. There is only a remote possibility of duplicating right and
left valves from the same clam often enough to make any impact on the
growth pattern of a sample of 50 or so valves. Discretion should be used; if a
small shell lens consisting only of a few hundred valves were sampled, it-might
be more appropriate for only right or left valves to be selected. If the sample
represents tens of thousands of valves, then same valve selection would not
matter.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MAJOR GROWTH INTERRUPTIONS
Initially, the annual growth interruption rings were assumed to be associated exclusively with the winter season, but this is not exactly so. Close
examination of the modern clam growth stage histograms (Fig. 3) reveals a
regular progression of the modal growth category through the year.
Dynamics of growth variation become much more clear when the Figure 3
data are replotted in a time series by individual growth stage classes (Fig. 4).
At the top of Figure 4, Interrupted growth stages through the year are
plotted along one time axis; below this, the Early growth category is plotted,

Aten - Rangia cuneata

etc. By connecting the modal peaks of these sequential growth stages with a
straight line, the progression of each year’s growth through a population is
graphically demonstrated. By selecting any point along the horizontal time
axis and then looking vertical to that axis through the growth stages, the
growth variation around the mode is seen. By this means, the duration and
magnitude of Interrupted growth is seen to be always present to some degree.
Interruption is a major constituent of variation from roughly August to April
and reaches its maximum intensity from December to February. This situation
suggests a causal relationship with habitat temperature.
Rangia cuneata ciliary activity is reduced substantially below 16 °C (6 I°F)
and above 28°C (82°F) (Hopkins et al., 1973:154). Because the cilia are
essential to feeding and ventilation, their response to temperature variation
must be related significantly to shell growth. To test this, there should be a
strong negative correlation between the percentage of clams in the Interrupted growth stage and temperature (Table 4). The correlation coefficient
for this relationship was R = - .84 (significant at the .01 level) which supports the hypothesis.
Other environmental factors, however, might influence the proportion of
shells in the Interrupted stage. For example, rainfall may affect salinity, and
stream discharge may affect salinity as well as flush quantities of algae, detritus, or phytoplankton into the lower streams and estuaries. Salinity alone,
however, was not found to be a controlling factor in ciliary activity (Hopkins et
al., 1973:25-27).
Correlation coefficients relating rainfall and stream discharge to the combined proportions of Early, Middle, and Late clam growth stages should be of
a much lower order than for temperature. In testing this relationship, data
were used both for a large river (the Trinity) and for a small river draining only
the coastal plain (the Lavaca). None of the correlation coefficients was statistically significant, thus supporting the hypothesis (Table 4). Because the
growth response to salinity might not be immediate, correlation coefficients
also were calculated for stream discharge against the total percentage of
Early, Middle, and Late stage clams of the succeeding month. Results were
not statistically significant (Table 4).
Data on reduced ciliary activity at temperatures above 28 °C (82 OF) probably point directly at the cause of the principal secondary, or summer, growth
interruption feature. Average air temperatures of 82°F are exceeded in July
and August (Table 4) and water temperatures are only slightly cooler. There is
a pronounced positive bulge in the Interrupted growth curve for the AugustSeptember period (Fig. 4) reflecting the small but noticeable impact of high
temperature growth interruption.
The conclusion is that the major annual Interrupted growth stage is of long
duration and most closely associated with seasonal variations in temperature.
It is not correlated with fluctuations of rainfall, stream discharge, and salinity.
Presumably, any other natural phenomena which might cause a growth interruption would introduce very low orders of predictable interruptions. These
mechanisms primarily contribute to background noise; some amount of
growth interruption may be found on virtually all modern seasonality estimates throughout the year.

CONCLUSIONS
One of the principal foundations for describing and testing archeological
models is the determination of temporal and spatial control of archeological
data. Because of this need, reconstruction of annual patterns and schedules
of settlement must be made. On the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
from the coastal bend of Texas to the Florida panhandle, the majority of shell
middens are composed either partially or entirely of the brackish water clam
Rangia cuneata. A practical method now exists for determining the season of
collection of R. cuneata clams with an accuracy of at least + 1 month.
Use of this method opens opportunities for analysis of scheduling at both an
intersite regional and intrasite local scale. For example, current analysis
(Aten, unpublished data) indicates that nearly all coastal shell middens in the
upper Texas coast were occupied during the early summer. Seasonality samples have been analyzed from single occupation episode sites which seem to
allow discrimination of habitation periods as short as 2 weeks duration from
others occupied for periods up to 6 weeks duration (Aten, unpublished data).
Other applications are plausible. Archeological Rangia cuneata shells theoretically contain the most detailed season by season record in existence of
water temperatures for the last 3500 years on the coast. The morphological
seasonality technique used in conjunction with oxygen isotope and C14 determinations could be the basis for a practical regional research program into
high resolution reconstruction of paleotemperatures.
Finally, a second Rangia species, R. flexuosa, is found occasionally in the
region’s archeological sites (Aten et al., 1976:9; Fig. 4). Rangia flexuosa is
distinguished from R. cuneata only by its slightly indented pallial sinuses and
short hinge teeth which do not extend to the adductor muscle scars (Fig. 1A).
Rangiaflexuosa occupies somewhat higher salinity estuarine habitats than are
normally used by R. cuneata; is uniformly smaller in size; and does not display
the prominent growth ring morphology seen on R. cuneata. Consequently,
this seasonality procedure probably cannot be extended to R. flexuosa.
