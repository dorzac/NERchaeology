ABSTRACT
During the spring of 1967, the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project partially excavated three prehistoric sites
in the proposed Conroe Reservoir area. Occupations of these
sites were intermittent. The recovered material is of the
Archaic and Neo-American (Formative) Stages. Information
obtained from the Archaic material has allowed a better
definition of the western boundary of the southern La Harpe
Aspect. Material from the Neo-American (or Formative)
Stage indicates that this locale was a buffer zone between
the Caddoan area to the north and the Galveston Bay area to
the south. There appears to be an indigenous ceramic
tradition which never reached the sophistication that
developed in the adjacent Caddoan or Galveston Bay area,
though contact with these areas is evident.

This report is submitted to the National Park Service
by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, The University of Texas in accordance with the Provisions of
Memorandum of Agreement 14-10-3:931-1.

PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A project of the San Jacinto River Authority, the Conroe Reservoir and dam will
be located about 7 miles northwest of Conroe, Texas on the West Fork of the San
Jacinto River. The planned reservoir will inundate portions of Montgomery and Walker
counties and when completed will be approximately 15.5 miles long with an average width
of 2 miles. Maximum pool elevation will be 201 feet above mean sea level.
This monograph reports the findings at three aboriginal sites in the Conroe
(formerly Honea) Reservoir basin in Montgomery County, Texas (Fig. 1). During the
winter of 1965, a Texas Archeological Salvage Project (T.A.S.P.) crew conducted a
preliminary survey of the area to be affected by the reservoir. Thirty-four archeological sites, three of which were recommended for excavation (Shafer, 1966a) were
located and appraised. The primary goal of the Conroe Reservoir project was to
recover a representative sample of the archeological data that will be affected by
the reservoir. From March 1 through April 28, 1967, two of the three recommended
sites, 41 MQ 5 and 41 MQ 6, were partially excavated. An additional site, 41 MQ 4,
initially recommended for testing, was also excavated in lieu of the third recommended
site which presented logistical problems.
Under the general supervision of J. Richard Ambler, excavations were directed
by Harry J. Shafer. Crew members were Daymond D. Crawford, field assistant, A. C.
Manning, Felix Robinson, Aaron Taylor, Ed Wise, Chester Wright, and Downey Young.
I would like to acknowledge the help and cooperation of many individuals who
have contributed to the work of this archeological project.
Permission to excavate in the reservoir basin was granted by the San Jacinto
River Authority, which also assisted T.A.S.P. in the reservoir area investigations in
both the survey and excavation phases. In particular, I want to thank C. W. Curry of
the River Authority for his interest and invaluable cooperation.
T.A.S.P. is especially indebted to Mr. Don Moore of Conroe, Texas for volunteering
his services in the excavations and for making survey trips into newly cleared areas
of the reservoir. I wish to express my personal gratitude to Don and his wife, Linda,
who made our stay most enjoyable.
The gracious attitude of citizens of Montgomery, Texas and in particular the
hospitality shown by Mr. and Mrs. Sherman Hicks, Mrs. Emma Simonton, and Mr. and Mrs.
Martin Simonton is greatly appreciated.
Cataloging of the artifacts was done by Joetta Scarborough and Yvonne Reader.
Mrs. Scarborough and G. R. Price also provided laboratory assistance.
Technical advice and assistance were given by J. Richard Ambler, Robert K.
Alexander, Dee Ann Story, T. N. Campbell, Michael B. Collins, William M. Sorrow, and
T. R. Hester.
Vaughn M. Bryant and G. R. Price drafted the maps and profiles and James E.
Corbin identified the faunal remains.
Typing and preliminary editing were done by Melinda Giles and Charlotte Hudler.
The Houston Archeological Society tested Site 41 MQ 14 and is currently in the
process of analyzing the findings. The preliminary results of this endeavor have
been made available to me for comparative purposes. The Society is to be commended
for an excellent job. It has demonstrated how a conscientious amateur group, working
closely with a professional organization can be extremely beneficial to archeology.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Environment
Conroe Reservoir (Fig. 1) is located
in the East Texas Plains region defined
by Johnson (1931: Fig. 18). High humidity, coupled with the physiographic condition, cause a forest-like vegetation.
Total rainfall in this region varies from
40 to 50 inches a year. Moisture conditions vary not only with the yearly rain
fall but also with the amount of evaporation, the porosity of the soil and subsoil,
and the height of the ground-water table
(ibid. 88). The climate of Montgomery
County proper is regarded as subtropical
with mild winters and warm, humid summers;
mean average temperature is 67 degrees
and average annual precipitation is 49.17
inches, (Moore, l9b3: 252).
The reservoir lies between two
escarpments of the Gulf Coastal Plain
Physiographic Province as defined by
Fenneman (1938: 100-112). The first
escarpment, the Kisatchie Cuesta, is
located to the north of the reservoir in
central Walker County at the edge of the
Catahoula sandstone formation. The second,
the Hockley Scarp, is seaward-facing and
separates the uplands from the flat plain
bordering the coast (ibid.). Faintly
rolling uplands and relatively broad
valleys along the major streams characterize the topography. The valley bottoms
are usually scarred by former stream
channels which appear as sloughs or small
oxbow ponds. Often small promontories,
probably representing eroded upland or
terrace remnants, are present on the floodplains and many evidence human occupation.
Outcrops of Miocene and Pliocene
sands and clays, particularly the Lagarto
Formation of the Fleming Group (Sellards,
Adkins, and Plummer, 1958: 727-749),
dominate the surface geology.
The flora and fauna is typical of
the Austroriparian Biotic Province as
defined by Blair (1950: 98-100). Prevalent vegetation in the upland forests
are loblolly pine, yellow pine, red oak,
postoak, and blackjack oak, while hardwoods such as sweetgum, magnolia, tupelo,
water oak, and various other species of
oak, elm, and ash characterize the lowland forests. Palmetto is common in the
meadows and swampy areas along and near
streams. Spanish moss is also typical
of this province.

According to Blair, the vertebrate
species of fauna of the Austroriparian of
Texas include the following: mammals (47),
snakes (29), lizards (10), land turtles
(2), anurans (17), and urodels (18).
Among the common mammals are opossum,
armadillo, cottontail rabbit, swamp rabbit,
mole, bats (at least 2 species) fox
squirrel, gray squirrel, and the pocket
gopher.
Ethnohistory
The Indians occupying the Lake Conroe
vicinity during the early historic period
were Atakapan speakers, whose major groups
were the Bidai, Patiri, Akokisa (Orcoquisac
or Arkokisa), and perhaps the Deadose
(Swanton, 1946: Map l; Newcomb, 1962:
Map 4; Bolton, 1962: General Reference
Map). Ethnographic accounts of these
people are sketchy, but it is possible to
draw some inferences about their culture.
Specific location of individual groups
is often difficult, if not impossible to
ascertain with the ethnographic information available. Generally, however, the
Akokisa are known to have occupied the
Lower San Jacinto and Trinity River areas
and the eastern shores of Galveston Bay
(Newcomb, 1962: 316). A major concentration has been noted in the vicinity of
Spring Creek, a tributary of the San
Jacinto River (Bolton, 1962: 333). The
Patiri lived in the San Jacinto river
valley (Newcomb, 1962: 316). Upstream
from the Akokisa in the Trinity valley
were the Bidai and to their north were
the Deadose (ibid: 316). The location of
these groups at a given time probably
varied considerably, and it is quite
possible that the Patiri, Bidai, or
Akokisa occupied the immediate vicinity
of Lake Conroe. Bolton (1962: 334) notes
that the Akokisa traveled with seasonal
changes between the coast and the interior
although they lived in relatively fixed
villages.
Cultural information is available
only on the Akokisa and Bidai. Hunting,
gathering, fishing, and agriculture were
of major importance in their livelihood.
Newcomb infers that the Akokisa probably
had little, if any, agriculture and that
their subsistance depended in large upon
fishing, gathering of shell fish, and
some hunting. Newcomb's inference is

2

supported in a statement by Simars de
Bellisle, a French officer who, along with
four other officers, was sent ashore from
the French ship Marechal d'Estees to fill
water flasks in 1719. For some inexplicable reason, the shore party was left
behind. De Bellisle who was the only
survivor of this group lived with the
Akokisa for about two years. De Bellisle
states that the Akokisa (those with whom
he was acquainted ?) did not raise crops
(Newcomb, 1962: 323). However, Bernardo
de Miranda, a Spanish surveyor who mapped
much of the area around the lower Trinity
and San Jacinto Rivers, states that the
Indians raised "superfine maize" (Bolton:
335). Bolton also says that Spain traded
with the Bidai and Akokisa for corn,
horses, and hides (337).
Specific information about Bidai
material culture has been compiled by
Sjoberg from early accounts (1951: 397398). She states:

Bidai women made cane
baskets, which are described
only as 'of curious design and
great variety'. Some of these
Indians are reported to have
carried baskets when they went
to trade. They would fill these
with the articles they desired
and then offer to exchange the
baskets for their contents.
During the early nineteenth
century, chairs were fashioned
of rattan and hickory and were
frequently traded to white
settlers.
According to Ker, the Bidai
employed 'bark canoes' in river
transportation. However, it is
doubtful that these were anything more than dugouts with the
bark left on.
Canoes were also a possession of the
Akokisa (Newcomb, 1962: 321).

The bow and arrow was the
most important (tool). Although projectile points of
flint were most commonly employed, copper-tipped points
have been noted. Ker reported
that the Bidai also had spears
which were ten feet long and
tipped with deer antler. During
the middle eighteenth century,
they received a plentiful
supply of firearms and ammunition from the French in Louisiana.
Flint knives and scrapers served
as tools for dressing skins or
for carving wooden articles.

The account of the unique Bidai
pottery is interesting, but to my knowledge, is not supported by archeological
evidence.
The only available description of
habitations is that of the skin tent
winter dwelling of the Bidai (Bolton,
1962: 330).
As mentioned, the Akokisa lived in
relatively fixed villages, but during the
summer, their bands consisted only of
family groups. The Bidai also stayed
inland during the winter (ibid: 335). One
Bidai settlement near the Spanish settlement of Bucareli consisted of seven
"rancherias". How big these "rancherias"
were is unknown, but the rancherias or
the settlement may have consisted of a
cluster of family-size groups. Sjoberg
speculates that the Bidai were politically
united only briefly--in the 1770's--and
this was evidently brought about by the
Spanish (1951: 398).

The Bidai made unusual
clay vessels. These were
fashioned by first weaving
strong rushes into bags, which
were either circular or square
in shape. These were coated
inside and out with a thick
layer of clay. Then the vessels
were either sun-dried or baked
in pits filled with hot ashes.
These 'daub' pots, as they were
called by early Anglo-American
settlers, probably could not
stand water, and so must have
been used primarily for storage
purposes.

These groups suffered severly from
European diseases, and this, along with
constant pressure from the Europeans,
eventually led to their extinction. However, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, there was a small band of Bidai
living 12 miles from Montgomery, Texas
(Swanton, 1946: 96). This would be a
maximum of 18 miles from Lake Conroe.

Other containers were also
used by the Bidai. Food was
sometimes cooked in skin vessels
through a stone-boiling process.
Occasionally, however, they
obtained iron pots through
trade and these must have been
used in cooking. Bowls, dippers,
and spoons of pecan wood, as
well as polished gourds, frequently served as utensils.

If at times the Akokisa had corn
surplus for trade, some groups must have
been practicing rather extensive agriculture. Archeological evidence in the
Lower Trinity River area certainly indicates that extensive use of shell fish
was practiced by the more coastal groups
during prehistoric times and probably

3

during historic times as well (Shafer,
1966b: 31 and 32), but none of the historic Indian sites has been excavated.
The availability of good agricultural
lands in the lower Trinity region (Bolton,
1962: 349) was undoubtedly a major factor
in the Spanish establishing a mission and
a presidia in 1756 in that area. Sandy
soil suitable for primative agriculture
becomes even more abundant away from the
coast, and it is evident that the Bidai,
and perhaps the Pitiri and Deadose as well,
relied more on agriculture than did the
coastal Akokisa.
Hunting evidently played an important
role in the subsistence of the Bidai and
Akokisa. Deer, bison, bear, beaver
(Sjoberg, 1951: 396-397) and alligator
(Newcomb, 1962: 324) were hunted. In
addition, the Bidai frequently gathered
wild foods such as honey, fruits, seeds
of water chinquapin, and acorns (Sjoberg,
1951: 397).
In cultural reference, the Bidai,
Patiri, Deadose, and Akokisa are often
spoken of as belonging to the Southeast,
but they definitely were marginal (Newcomb,
1962: 315 and Sjoberg, 1951: 391), in
that, they evidently lacked the sedentary
way of life of their northern neighbors,
the Caddo, and of the Southeastern cultures
in general. As a result, they are classed
among the "culturally impoverished" which
is an unfortunate term as it implies an
ethnocentric value judgment. Although in
some respects the culture of the Southeast
Texas groups differed from that of their
northern neighbors, agricultural practices
appear to have been in existence and
extensive use was made of the surroundings,
whether coastal or inland. Their culture
was adapted to the environment and although
contact with the Caddo is inferred in view
of their proximity, this contact evidently
did not change their basic cultural pattern
to conform to that of the Caddo. They
remained in one place for a time if
sufficient resources were available or
they moved about in search of game and
other natural resources. Bands ranged in
size from small family units to villages.
Dwellings consisted of skin or brush
structures; permanent, and planned village
arrangements are unknown for them.
Archeological Background
Prior to the 1967 excavations, the
only systematic archeological endeavor in
the Lake Conroe area or in the immediate
vicinity was the survey conducted by
T.A.S.P. to appraise the archeological
resources of the reservoir (Shafer, 1966).
Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954: Figs. 4
and 5), in their discussion of the various
cultural complexes in Texas, designate
this portion of the state as archeologically "undefined". This section of Texas

is located east of the central Texas
cultural area (Suhm, 1958: Fig. 1), south
of the northeast Texas area (Webb, 1958:
Fig. 1), and north of the only defined
archeological unit in southeast Texas,
the Galveston Bay Focus (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954: Fig. 5). Since 1954,
the Archaic cultures of East Texas have
been redefined and the Lake Conroe area is
included within the geographical limits
of the La Harpe Aspect a broad Archaic
pattern covering much of East Texas, and
parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana
(Johnson, 1962: 268). Presently, this is
the only archeological unit which includes
this portion of the state.
Although there has been little archeological exploration in the immediate
vicinity of the reservoir, there have been
several important investigations in the
surrounding region. Excavations to the
northeast, in Livingston Reservoir located
in Polk and San Jacinto counties, have
produced material bearing a marked resemblance to that from the Lake Conroe area
(McClurkan, 1967). Excavations have been
conducted in Addicks Reservoir, south of
Montgomery County in adjacent Harris
County (Wheat, 1953). The Galveston Bay
Focus was defined largely on the basis of
the data obtained from these excavations
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954). More
recently, investigations were conducted
at Wallisville Reservoir located southeast
of Lake Conroe in Chambers County (Shafer,
1966 and Tunnell and Ambler, 1967), and
in Cedar Bayou in Harris County (Ambler,
1967). Other explorations in the coastal
region south of Lake Conroe include those
at the Caplen site (Campbell, 1957) and
at the Jamison site (Aten, 1967). There
has also been recent testing in the vicinity
of Lake Jackson (T. R. Hester, personal
communication).
Intensive investigations in the area
immediately to the west are lacking.
However, some preliminary work has been
done in Washington County (Haaskarl, 1961)
and in Lee and Burleson counties (Honea,
1961 and Peterson, 1965).
Basic Excavation Procedures
Certain procedures were basic in the
excavation of each of the three sites. A
grid system of 5-foot squares oriented
magnetic north served as horizontal control;
vertical control within each unit was
maintained by excavating in arbitrary
1/2-foot levels. A permanent elevation
datum to which elevations were keyed,
was established at each site.
Excavation was done by hand using
shovels and trowels and all removed soil
was passed through 1/3-or 1/2-inch hardware cloth. Material from each level was
bagged separately with the provenience

4

recorded on each bag.
Reports on each
excavated level were kept and feature
reports and a daily journal were maintained.
Profiles were recorded at each site and
photographs were taken periodically.
In

addition, contour maps of 1-foot intervals
were constructed . All field notes, photographs and artifacts are on file at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
in Austin.

CHAPTER II
THE SITES
Site 41 MQ 4
Site 41 MQ 4 (Fig. 2) is located
approximately 9 miles west-northwest of
Conroe, Texas, on Atkins Creek about 0.8
of a mile above its confluence with the
West Fork of the San Jacinto River.
The
site (or midden) is situated on a gently
sloping, sandy point of a low bluff that
forms the southern boundary of the Atkins
Creek floodplain . The site slopes [relief
is about 4 feet within the site confines
(Fig. 3)] in a westerly direction and the
midden is located on the point where a
small, but relatively deep gulley cuts
through the bluff.
This bluff slants at
a 45° angle to approximately 25 feet
above the floodplain.
Presently, Atkins
Creek meanders to within 100 feet of the
edge of the bluff and access to the creek
from the site is not difficult.
Grasses, particularly wild Saint

foreground.

Augustine, Bermuda, and grass burr, and
scattered, moderately large pine trees
cover much of the top of the bluff.
Hardwoods (principally hackberry and
several species of elm) remain along the
rim although recent clearing has removed
a majority of the large vegetation along
the slope and on the floodplain.
Palmetto
grows in profusion in the floodplain north
of the site.
The sparse vegetation on
top of the bluff suggests that the site
has been under cultivation; however, this
could not be confirmed.
Initial indication of a concentrated
refuse midden was revelaed in the numerous
small cones of sand marking the entrances
to rodent burrows.
These tiny heaps of
sand contained flakes and other cultural
refuse and indicated that the sand was
darker than that revealed in other portions

It is presumed that the
darker color was caused by the cultural
activity.
This area of stained soil
measured approximately 120 feet east-west
and some 70 feet north-south (Fig. 3).
Along the midden periphery where the sand
became progressively lighter, the amount
of occupational refuse showed a marked
decrease.
Sand outside of the midden
was light-tan and contained only an
occasional flake or other evidence of
occupation.

The most prolific area was found in
the center squares, N95/Wl20 and N95/Wl45
(pit designations were determined by the
grid coordinates at the southeast corner).
The sandy matrix was slightly deeper in
the western-most test pit (N95/Wl75).

Excavation Procedures
A horizontal datum stake designated
as NlOO/WlOO was placed near the eastern
margin of the midden in order to confine
all grid points to one quadrant within
the immediate vicinity of the midden.
In addition to the primary vertical
control point mentioned previously, a
secondary datum was established immediately
north of the midden to serve as an additional reference point (Fig. 3).
Excavation was begun by digging four
5-foot squares at 20 or 25 foot intervals
along the N95 line which traversed the
east-west axis of the midden.
Th~se pits
were excavated to test the content and to
more accurately define the east-west

6

A north-south trench of eight contiguous 5-foot squares was excavated across
the western limit of the midden to expose
a profile. Additional contiguous pits were
excavated along the N60 line and in the
more prolific area along the lines N95,
Wl45, and Wl50.
A single pit was dug at
grid coordinates N60/Wl20 to test the
southeast periphery of the midden.
In
all, thirty 5-foot squares were excavated
to an average depth of 3 feet.
The depth
of the individual units varied from 2.5
to 4.5 feet.
The excavation plan is
shown in Figure 3.
In addition to the units excavated
on the grid system, random tests were
made in the immediate vicinity of the
midden in order to test the depth of the
sand and to determine, as accurately as
possible, the horizontal limits of the
midden.

Internal Structure

at the site was the midden.
In addition,
six occupational features, three hearths
and three pits, were noted within the midden.
They are presented below in the order of
their discovery.
Horizontal locations
are shown in Figure 3.

Two geologic zones were recognized
at 41 MQ 4--the compact, sandy clay basal
formation (Zone 1) and the overlying sand
(Zone 2) (Figs. 4 and 5).
These are
described as follows:
Zone 1: This zone was a gray-orangemottled sandy clay basal formation varying
in depth below the surf ace from 1 foot
about 10 feet beyond the southern limits
of the midden) to 4.5 feet at the western
extremity. Elevations taken on this
formation indicated that its surface
sloped from southeast to northwest within
the site. This slope was slightly more
pronounced than that of the ground surface.
It was tested to a depth of approximately
1 foot and was devoid of cultural remains.
Zone 2:
Zone 2 was the sandy soil
overlying the basal clay formation.
Three
subdivisions based on color changes, a,
b, and c (labeled from bottom to top),
were detected within this zone.
Subzone 2a: This subzone was
composed of a light-tan sand varying in
thickness from 0.2 of a foot in the extreme southeastern excavated unit (Pit
N60/Wl20) to 1.9 feet in Pit N95/Wl45,
in the northern extremity.
Subzone 2a
immediately overlaid the sandy clay basal
formation.
A moderate amount of small
gravels were seen on and immediately above
the contact line with Zone 1 but less
gravel was noted toward the surface.
Occupational refuse was sparse but increased near the top of the subzone.
Some rodent disturbance was observed.
Subzone 2b:
Subzone 2b consisted
of a dark brown-stained sand containing
abundant cultural debris.
Thickness
varied considerably within the site from
1.0 foot in the southeastern portion
(Pit N95/Wl25) to 2.4 feet in the northern
part (Pit N95/Wl25) where it reached the
surface.
Rodent burrows were abundant
especially in the upper portion.

Feature 1:
Pit (Fig. 6).
Though
only partially excavated, Feature 1 could
be recognized as a semi-circular pit.
It
was first noted in the floor of Level 3
(1.5 feet below the surface) in Unit N95/
Wl30.
This conical-shaped pit extended
downward to basal clay (Zone 1), 3.8 feet
below the surface.
At the level when first
recognized, the feature measured 3.0 feet
along the east-west axis and extended 1.4
feet into the unit from the north wall.
The fill consisted of dark-brown sand,
identical to that of Subzone 2b, and contained flaked, charcoal flecks, small burned
clay nodules, and a chopper.
Feature 2:
Hearth.
Feature 2 was a
circular area of reddish-orange, baked
sand which contained numerous charcoal
flecks and some small lumps of burned
clay.
It was encountered in Unit N65/Wl75
at the top of Level 8 (3.5 feet below the
surface).
The feature measured 2.6 feet
in diameter.
The stain was darker in the
approximate center and became increasingly
lighter toward the periphery.
The result
of a localized fire, it is presumed that
this feature was a hearth.
Feature 3:
Pit.
A basin-shaped pit,
irregular in outline, was first defined
at the bottom of Level 5 (2.5 feet below
the surface) in Unit N90/Wl20.
This
feature was only partially excavated; the
uncovered portion continued into the east
wall of the unit.
The pit measured 3.6
feet (north-south) and extended outward

Subzone 2c:
In this subzone, a
relatively thin layer of light-brown sand
could be seen in the southern and southeastern areas.
It contained a moderate
amount of cultural refuse and, like 2b,
it was badly disturbed by rodentactivity.
Thickness varied from a maximum of 1.2
feet in the southern-most units to 0.6
of a foot in the northernmost definable
unit (N90/Wl45).
Generally, however, it
was hard to trace in the northern part
of the site, and was completely indetectable in some of the northern units (Fig.
4).
Zone 2c may represent a plow zone.
Archeological Features
The principal archeological feature

Fig. 6.

41 MQ 4, Feature 1, a pit.

from the east wall 2.4 feet.
Maximum
depth of the pit was 3.5 feet below the
ground surface.
The fill was composed of
the dark-brown sand of Subzone 2b and
contained flakes, bone fragments, a few
small burned clay nodules, and two biface
fragments.
Rodent activity had slightly
disturbed the feature.
Feature 4: Hearth (Fig. 7). A small
concentration of burned clay nodules and
rocks was found within Level 4 (1.5 to
2.0 feet below the surface) in Unit N60/
Wl60.
The principal concentration measured
approximately 1 foot in diameter and consisted of at least seven burned clay
nodules found near the principal concentration may have been scattered by rodent
activity, as burrows could be traced in
the proximity of the feature.
The burned
clay nodules and the rocks were fist size
or smaller.
Feature 5:
Hearth (Fig. 8).
This
feature was exposed in Pit N95/W95 2.5
feet below the surface and was composed
of a distinct concentration of burned
clay nodules associated with a hard,
baked surface.
Maximum depth of the
concentration was 2.9 feet below the
surface. The baked surface was immediately
east of the burned clay concentration and
extended slightly into the east wall of
the pit. No charcoal was observed anywhere in the feature, although a few
small burned clay lumps remained in the
baked area.
The soil west of the baked
surface was a mottled light-brown and tan
sand, in definite contrast to the scorched

Fig. 8.
41 MQ 4, Feature 5, a
hearth.
sand.
The clay balls, which ranged from
fist size to marble size, were not arranged
in a discernible pattern, but appeared to
have been raked away from the burned
area.
To substantiate this hypothesis,
soil surrounding the burned clay nodules
showed no evidence of heat discoloration.
Also, there was no evidence of a pit outline.
Therefore, it is suggested that
the clay was used for cooking or heating
purposes in much the same manner as rocks
were used in other areas of Texas (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 103 and 104).
The elongated outline of the feature was
3.2 feet long (in an approximate eastwest direction) and had a maximum width
of 1. 2 feet.
Feature 6:
Pit. A basin-shaped pit
was uncovered in Unit N90/Wl45 at the top
of Level 6 (3.0 feet below the surface).
The pit extended into the west wall of
the unit and was not completely outlined.
Judging from the exposed portion of the
circumference, it was estimated to be
3.5 feet in diameter.
The feature extended 1.1 feet from the wall of the unit.
Maximum depth was 3.6 feet below the
surface.
Fill consisted of dark-brown
sand and included two Group 4 crude
bifacial implements, small burned clay
nodules, flakes, and burned bone fragments.

Discussion of Artifacts
During the excavation of 41 MQ 4,
649 artifacts were recovered.
A tabulation
of the artifacts by 6-inch levels is
presented in Table 1.

groups.

The ceramic sample is represented by
168 sherds which comprise a little less
than 26% of the total artifacts recovered.
An estimate of the number of whole vessels
represented is not possible, although the
variation of rim types suggests the presence of at least eight different vessels.
All of the pottery is a plain, sandtempered ware; the only appreciable difference among sherds is in the size of
the sand grains in the paste. In addition,
a few sherds from Unit N75/Wl50 allowed
a partial reconstruction of a small,
conical bowl (Fig. 31).

A graphic illustration by level of
all dart points and also of selected types
is presented in Figure 9. Sixty-six
percent of all dart points were recovered
from Levels 3, 4, and 5. Plotting the
three types individually, the same trend
holds true as the largest single concentration of Gary and Kent points was present
in Level 5; whereas for Palmillas, it was
~n Level 4.
The only inconsistency among
the levels was in Level 2, which contained
fewer examples than Level l (Levels 7 and
8 were only excavated in two units).

While potsherds were recovered from
the first six levels of excavation (3.0
feet below the surface, 76% of all the
sherds occurred in Levels 1 and 2 and
95% occurred in the first four levels of
excavation.
STONE
Only three arrow points were recovered
from 41 MQ 4--one Perdiz, Variety 1 (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 283) and two Catahoula
(Bell, 1960: 16). The Perdiz was recovered from Level 2 while one of the
Catahoula was found in Level 1 and the
other in Level 4.
Two hundred and six artifacts identified as dart points are in the collection. Three types, C@ry (contracting
stem), Kent (para11e1 stem), and Palmillas
(expanding stem) dominate the sample.
Gary is the most predominant (slightly
over 50%) ; Kent composes 23% of the dart
point total and Palmillas constitutes
about 6%. The remaining 20% are either
fragmentary specimens or descriptive

Table 1.

In an attempt to establish a dart
point sequence, four categories (Gary,
Kent, Palmillas, and Others) were used.
Dart point fragments and the surface
specimens were excluded and all descriptive
groups were combined since none occurred
in sufficient number to plot separately.
All specimens represented in the above
categories at each level were totaled and
the percent of each category at each level
was calculated (Fig. 9). By comparing
the frequency of occurrence of each category represented in each level, it was
hoped that a dart point sequence might be
evident. The results were somewhat disappointing, although Gary points increased
slightly in frequency from bottom to top.
Kent points occurred at about the same
frequency throughout, although they represent two of the points recovered at
deeper levels. Palmillas points were not
frequent at any time. The eight descriptive
groups which composed the fourth category
represented only minor percentages at any
given level, although two clusters appeared
to be present, one in Level 2 and the other
in Levels 4, 5, and 6.

Site 41 MQ 5

In summary, the vertical distribution
of knives and crude bifaces duplicates
that of the dart points; that is, the
greatest percentage occurred in Levels 3,
4, and 5.
The remaining major artifact
category, utilized flakes, was common
throughout the deposit, but was slightly
more abundant in the lower levels of excavation (3 to 6).

Site 41 MQ 5 (Fig. 10) is located 7.4
miles east of Montgomery, Texas near the
West Fork of the San Jacinto River.

Five major artifact categories
(pottery, dart points, knives, crude bifac
and utilized flakes) are shown in Figure
9.
Their vertical frequency best illustrates the probable cultural sequence at
the site. Horizontal clustering of any
of the artifact categories or groups
within each category was not evident.
Dart points are the single dominant artifact group below Level 2.
Pottery, on
the other hand, is the dominant group in
Level 2 and above.
It is chiefly on thi :
basis that two broad cultural assemblages
are inferred.
The earliest and best represented is an Archaic or pre-ceramic
assemblage which is characterized by dart
points, knives, and other bifacial tools.
The later assemblage is marked by the
presence of pottery, arrow points, and
Group 3 drills.
Dart points, knives, and
other bifacial tools are also part of this
assemblage, although they are less frequent
than in the preceding assemblage.

The site lies on a short terrace
finger some 1,200 feet west of the present
river channel and immediately south of a
county-maintained road.
The principal
area of occupation measures approximately
100 feet north-south and 70 feet eastwest.
When first visited during the 1965
survey, heavy vegetation had just been
cleared from the terrace.
However, there
was an overgrowth of weeds and grass in
the spring of 1967.

The lack of a more discrete stratigraphical separation of these assemblages
is partially due to rodent and other
disturbances in the loose sandy matrix.

When the site was first surveyed in
1965, two areas were defined:
Area A,
south of the county road and Area B, north
of the road (Shafer, 1966a: 6).
Shovel
tests were made in Area B by the 1967
field party but these proved sterile;
thus, Area B will not be considered and
the ensuing discussion will deal exclusively with Area A.
The surface of the site slopes gently
from northwest to southeast, with a relief
of about 4 feet in the main area of occupation. The eastern limits merge with the
present floodplain, but the extreme southeastern and southern boundary is marked by
a rather abrupt decline. At this decline
the terrace edge is clearly outlined by a
meander scar of the river which forms a
small oxbow pond some 500 feet southwest

seen from the north-northwest.

41

of the central occupational area.
The
western and northern limits of the site
are not so easily defined as the terrace
continues in these directions, but are
distinguished principally by the absence
of cultural refuse.
Surface disturbance resulting from
cultivation, land clearing, rodent activity, and recent occupation were evident
in both 1965 and 1967, although testing
during the survey revealed refuse sufficiently deep to warrant further investigation. Evidence of a house, and outbuildings was seen although the buildings
themselves had been removed,
A concretecased well remained.
Excavation Procedures
Basically, excavation procedures
employed at Site 41 MQ 4 (previously
described) were deplicated here. A grid
system of 5-foot squares oriented to the
magnetic cardinal directions was superimposed over the site for horizontal
control. A permanent elevation datum
was established by marking the top of the
concrete well casing located a short
distance northwest of the main area of
occupation and assigning an arbitrary
elevation of 100 feet.
A secondary datum
was established on the top of a fence
post 93 feet southwest of the primary
datum (Fig. 11).

was much like that of 41 MQ 4. Two zones
were observed in the excavation, the
sandy clay basal formation and the overlying sand (Figs. 12 and 13).

Five-foot square test units were dug
at coordinates N200/W300, N200/W255, NISS/
W32S, NlSS/W300, and NlSS/W280.
In
addition to these units, auger tests were
made over much of the site and at various
intervals along the terrace outside the
refuse concentration.
Upon completion
of these tests, the depth of the underlying sterile clay and the principal area
of occupation were defined.
Work proceeded by excavating contiguous squares within the refuse concentration (Fig. 11). Units were excavated
in half-foot vertical levels following
the contour of the original surface.
The
units varied in total depth from l.S feet
(Units N200/W300 and NlSS/W32S) to 4.S
feet (N200/W2SS). A majority of the
excavation units were terminated at Level
6 (3.0 feet below the surface). Below
this level occupational refuse was scarce.
Thirty-three S-foot squares were excavated
and approximately 2,47S cubic feet of
dirt moved.

Zone 1: The basal member consisted
of a yellow-tan sandy clay which, although
devoid of cultural refuse, contained an
abundance of small, ferruginous sandstone
nodules in the upper margin.
The undulating
surface of the sandy clay sloped from
northwest to southeast, more abruptly
than the ground surface. The zone was
noted about 1 foot below the surface in
the western periphery of the site, but
was encountered 3.0 to 3.S feet below the
surface along the W285 line.
Zone 1 was
not found in units excavated in the eastern
extremity.
Zone 2: This upper member consisted
of a tan to light-brown sand.which varied
in depth below the surface from 1.0 to
over 4.S feet and contained an abundance
of refuse in the upper portion.
Zone 2
was essentially homogeneous in appearance
though in profile, the upper portion was '
slightly darker, perhaps due to humus
staining (Fig. 14).
Small ferruginous
sandstone nodules, although present
throughout the sand, became more numerous
toward the bottom of the zone, and were
very abundant at the contact line between
Zones 1 and 2.

Archeological Features
There were no archeological features
recognized at Site 41 MQ S.
Their absence
may be attributeJ partially to the homogeneous nature of the soil bearing the
cultural material, thus preventing the
recognition of pits and other such
features.
Discussion of Artifacts
Eight hundred and twenty-five artifacts were recovered during the initial
survey and the excavation. A tabulation
of the artifacts by 1/2-foot levels is
presented in Table 2. Although not described, a small sample of recent angloAmerican material was collected during
the excavation. The vast majority of
this material was recovered from the uppermost level of excavation; however, recent
material was recovered from as deep as
Level 5.

remaining portion of the sherd collection
(3 bone-tempered sherds and 26 grogtempered sherds).
Twenty-three of the
sherds (or slightly over 8%) are decorated;
thirteen of these belong to a single, sandtempered, red-filmed vessel which is
identified as the tentative type, Goose
Creek Red Filmed (Aten, 1967: 11-13). The
remaining decorated sherds are grog tempered
and reveal such techniques as brushing
(7), punctating (1), punctated-incised (1),
and incised (1).
None of these sherds
could be assigned to a known type.

A percentage graph showing the vertical frequency of each past category at
each level is presented in Figure 15.
Bone tempering is represented by only one
excavated sherd.
The graph illustrates
the predominance of the sand-tempered
sherds, but also reveals that grog-tempered
pottery occurred throughout the potterybearing deposit.
STONE
Lithic artifacts comprise 67% of the
total collection.
Dart points constitute
the largest single lithic category; Gary,
Kent, and Palmillas are the principal
known types represented.
Gary occurs
most frequently.

POTTERY
The ceramic collection from 41 MQ S
totals 273 sherds, or about 33% of the
total artifact inventory.
Plain, sandtempered ("sandy paste") pottery represents 89 .4 % of the total ceramic sample.
Bone and grog occurred as aplastic inclusions in some sherds which constitute the

Catahoula, Perdiz, and Cliffton (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 269) points are identified

among the 39 arrow points recovered. All
specimens of Untyped 3 were confined to
this site. A graph showing the vertical
distribution of all arrow points is illustrated in Figure 15. All arrow points
(with one exception, a Perdiz in Level 7)
appeared in the first four levels of excavation, and the greatest percent at
any one level occurred in Level 1.

The other major lithic categories
consist of bifacial artifacts termed
"knives" and "crude bifacial implements."
The word knife is employed here as a
matter of convenience and is not intended
to imply function. A graph showing the
distribution of the knives recovered from
the excavation is shown in Figure 15 and
reveals that the greatest percentage was
recovered in Levels 2 and 3. Knife Group
1 occurred throughout, but appeared to
cluster in Levels 2, 3, and 4. Knife
Group 2 examples were found in Levels 1
through 4 and in Level 6; however, the
greatest number at any one level appeared
in Level 6.

Graphs showing the vertical distribution of all dart points and the most
frequently occurring types (Gary and Kent)
are presented in Figure 15. The vertical
distribution of Gary shows that the
greatest number per level were found in
Level 3; in Level 6 Kent was the most
abundant. On this basis, it might be
inferred that Kent is the earlier of the
two. The only other dart point groups
which appeared in significant number are
Palmillas (six recovered from excavation)
and Untyped Parallel Stem (eight recovered
from excavation), all of which occurred
in and below Level 3 (with the exception
of surface specimens). The single Angostura point was recovered in Level 1 and
undoubtedly was out of context. It may
have been introduced by later inhabitants.

Table 2.

The distribution of crude bifacial
implements was much like that of dart
points in that the largest number was
found in Level 3. Groups 1 and 4 may be
earlier forms as suggested by their vertical distribution (Table 2), whereas,
Groups 3, 5, and 6 may represent later
fo~ms.
The other groups were widely distributed throughout the deposit.
Utilized flakes and hammerstones
clustered in the upper levels of the
deposit.

A graph of selected artifact groups
showing their frequency of occurrence at
1/2-foot levels is presented in Figure
15. From the data presented in the graph,
it might be said that pottery and arrow
points were found more abundantly in upper
levels of this site. In contrast, dart
points and crude bifacial implements
decreased in frequency in the upper levels.
Knives, while most profuse in Level 6,
were otherwise scattered fairly evenly
throughout the remainder of the deposit.
Horizontal clustering of artifact
categories or groups within each category
was not evident.
In summary, the excavations at 41 MQ
5 revealed a considerably mixed cultural
deposit. The nature of the sandy soil
at the site did not allow a separation of
artifacts stratigraphically although the
distributional analysis of the artifacts
does reveal trends which are thought to
be significant. Distribution graphs shown
in Figure 15 suggest that dart points predate pottery and arrow points. Vertical
occurrence of Kent dart points may indicate that they are slightly earlier than
are the Gary points, although the latter
is the predominant projectile point type
throughout the deposit.

Site 41 MQ 6
Site 41 MQ 6 is located on the Weirs
Creek drainage approximately 5 miles westnorthwest of Willis, Texas, in Montgomery
County.
A relatively large site, 41 MQ 6 is
about 450 feet long and some 120 feet wide,
the long axis of which parallels Weirs
Creek and is oriented approximately eastwest. Immediately to the south, Weirs
Creek bottomland borders the site (Fig.
16). The principal areas of concentrated
midden refuse were found on and between
two relatively large knolls. The site is
divided into Areas A, B, and C. A countymaintained road has cut away a section of
the eastern knoll (designated as Area A).
This knoll, which is about 3 feet high,
and 7 to 8 feet above the floodplain is
flanked on the north by a rolling field
which ascends to a heavily forested valley
wall or uplands about 1/2 of a mile north
of the site.
A flat area between the two knolls
is designated as Area B and is separated
from Area A by a shallow gully. Area B
rises 4 to 5 feet above the present floodplain. The western portion of Area B
gradually rises to 12 feet above the flood-

20

plain until the western-most and more
prominent knoll, Area C, is reached. This
area is flanked on the west by Weirs Creek
bottom. To the north of Area C is a
depression measuring approximately 100
feet by 50 feet which, during extremely
wet periods, retains water. Marshy vegetation was found in this depression and
cursory examination suggested that recent
erosion had filled it considerably. This
depression may have been a permanent source
of water during prehistoric times. The
greatest concentration of refuse in Area
C was found on the southern or Weirs
Creek side rather than on the side facing
the depression.
The field in which the site is located
has been under cultivation for many years.
Recently, Bermuda grass was introduced
and the field is now a grassy pasture.
In the creek bottom is a heavy forest of
hardwoods and scattered pine. Two large
pine trees, one in Area A and the other
in Area B, and a narrow growth of hardwoods
and pine along the fence line bordering
the county road were the only trees within
the confines of the site at the time of
the excavation.
General Excavation Procedures
Because 41 MQ 6 is a much larger site
than the two previously discussed, excavation procedures differed slightly. A
thorough surface inspection prior to excavation revealed three distinct areas of
darker sand. It was primarily on the
basis of this color differentiation that
the site was divided into the three excavation areas. As a result, three areas
of concentration were investigated as
opposed to the single areas found at 41
MQ 4 and 41 MQ 5. Rather than superimposing a grid over the entire site,
local grids were superimposed over each
area designated for testing. The location
of these local grids is recorded on the
contour map of the site (Fig. 16).
To establish local grids, a northsouth base line was placed across each
area and wooden stakes were driven at 5foot intervals along this line. Five-foot
square excavation units were then triangulated from the base line, numbered in
order of excavation and labeled according
to area. For example, units in Area A
were designated A-1, A-2, and so forth.
Vertical control was maintained by
establishing a primary datum point. A
metal stake was driven into a large pine
tree located in Area A and an arbitrary
elevation of 100 feet was assigned to
this stake. In the same manner a secondary

datum point was established on a large
pine tree in Area B; the elevation of this
stake was taken from the primary datum.
This secondary datum served as vertical
reference for excavations in Area C as
well as Area B since the distance from
Area C to the primary datum was too great
for accurate reading.
Excavation procedures followed the
same pattern as in the previous sites.
Five-foot squares served as the basic
excavation units; these units were dug in
1/2-foot vertical levels following the
contour of the surface. All units were
backfilled when excavation in each area
was completed.
Excavation procedure pertinent to
each area, internal structure, features
encountered, and the artifacts will be
discussed under area headings.

excavated to define the outline of Feature
1.
The units were excavated to varying
depths; four were dug to 2.5 feet below
the surface, two reached a depth of 3
feet, three were excavated to a depth of
3.5 feet, the northern most unit reached
4 feet, and Unit A-3 was terminated 4.5
feet below the surface.
A shovel test
was made in the floor of Unit A-3 to test
the depth of the sand but approximately
2.5 feet below the bottom of the unit
(or 7 feet below the surface) the water
table and quicksand were encountered
making it difficult to retrieve the shovel
and impossible to test further.
In the
excavation, it was found that below Level
5, the amount of occupational debris
showed a marked decrease, and indeed, the
deeper levels (Levels 7 thtough 9) were
largely unproductive, save for an occasional flake or sherd.

Site 41 MQ 6-Area A (Fig. 17)
Internal Structure
Excavation Procedures
Eleven 5-foot squares were excavated,
nine of which were contiguous and formed
a north-south trench along the east side
of the base line.
The horizontal plan in
Figure 18 shows the location of these and
of the remaining two units which were

21

The entire profile exposed by the
excavation in Area A was composed of sand
(Fig. 19).
Basal clay, which was visible
in the roadcut and which characteristically
underlies the sandy topsoil in this region,
was not encountered either in excavation
or in the shovel test in the floor of

Unit A-3.
The presence of the basal clay
zone then is inferred and for this reason,
the soil bands discerned in the sandy fill
are referred to as subzones. This maintains a consistency with that used at 41
MQ 4 and 41 MQ 5 where basal clay was
referred to as Zone 1 and the overlying
sandy fill as Zone 2.
Rodentburrows were evident throughout the sandy matrix, but were more abundant in the upper part of the fill.

Subzone 3: This subzone consisted
of a brown, coarse sand which overlaid
Subzone 1 in the northern half of the
trench.
The top of Subzone 3 was slightly
over 1 foot below the surface.
Subzone
3 seemed to be the northern equivalent of
Subzone 2 as it generally corresponded
with the latter in depth below the surface
and in texture.
The primary difference
was color, although the amount of refuse
appeared to be slightly greater in Subzone
3.

Subzone 1: This subzone was the
deepest encountered in the excavation and
consisted of a tan-and brown-mottled,
coarse sand; the upper portion contained
a small amount of refuse, while the lower
part was for the most part, devoid of
cultural material.
Subzone 1 was encountered approximately 2 feet below the
surface in the northern-most unit (A-1)
and 1.5 feet below the surface in the
southern-most unit (A-6).
In Units A-5
and A-9, the top of the subzone was much
deeper and was not recognized at all in
Unit A-8 between the two.
The maximum
depth of the subzone was not reached.

Subzone 4:
A lense of dark-brown
to almost black sand, which represented
a small but very distinct midden was
designated as Feature 1.
It appeared in
all but the three northern-most units and
immediately overlaid Subzone 2.
The
thickest and darkest part of the midden
occurred in Units A-4, A-5, and A-8 (all
in the northern portion of the lense).
It became progressively thinner and lighter
in hue toward the south or down hill side
where it finally pinched out in the southernmost unit.
Subzone 4 proved to be prolific in refuse, particularly potsherds
and bone fragments.

Subzone 2:
Immediately overlying
Subzone 1 in all but the three extreme
northern units was a mantle of light-tan,
coarse sand which contained some cultural
refuse.
The contact between Subzones 1
and 2 was gradational and indistinct.
Subzone 2 varied considerably in thickness
from 0.4 of a foot in Unit A-11 to 1.7
feet in Unit A-5 where it extended into
the floor of the excavation.

Subzone 5:
Recognized in the
northern half of the profile, this subzone consisted of a layer of light-brown
sand which immediately overlaid Subzone
3 and the extreme northern portions of
Subzones 2 and 4.
It contained an abundance of refuse throughout.
The line of
demarcation between it and Subzone 3 was
not distinct, but where it overlapped
Subzones 2 and 4, the demarcation was

small but distinct midden designated as
Subzone 4 in the profile, was recognized
in the excavation of Area A.
It measured
approximately 27 feet in length in the
profile, but was much darker, thicker, and
more concentrated at the northern or uphill end.
In horizontal plan, the darker,
more concentrated area was oval in outline
and measured about 11 feet north and south.
The staining became progressively lighter
in all directions outside the main concentration (Fig. 18). The top of the midden
was easily Jistinguished once the plow
zone was removed.
The bottom varied from
about 1.5 to 2.0 feet below the surface.
Refuse in the form of bone fragments, potsherds, flakes, and a few chipped stone
tools was found throughout the midden.
Rodent disturbances were traced throughout
the feature, but these did not appreciably
disturb either the horizontal or the
vertical outline.

FEA TURE

During the investigation, it was
hoped that some evidence of a structure
might be found.
Upon completion of each
level, the bottoms were troweled in unsuccessful attempts to obtain traces of
posts or post molds. Although an occasiona~ small burned-clay nodule was encountered in Area A, none was concentrated
in any one area and none showed wattle
impressions. However, considering the
circular nature and discreteness of the
midden, the absence of wattle-impressed
daub and post molds does not rule out the
possibility that some type of structure
existed.
For example, a skin-or brushcovered dwelling would not necessarily
leave physical evidence of its presence.

quite clear. The top of Subzone 5 was
encountered about 1/2 of a foot below
the surface.

POTTERY

Subzone 6: This relatively thin
mantle of light-tan sand was easily dis
tinguished throughout the profile and undoubtedly represented the plow zone.
Refuse was abundant.
Thickness varied
from 0.5 of a foot in the northern end
of the profile to about 1 foot in the
south-central portion.
Subzone 6 overlaid
Subzone 5 in the northern half of the
trench, much of Subzone 4, and in the
extreme southern Unit (A-6) where Subzone
4 pinched out, it overlaid a small portion
of Subzone 2.

The ceramic sample from Area A is
composed of 423 sherds, the greatest
majority of which are undecorated. Thirtysix of these sherds belong to a partially
restored vessel (Fig. 32). Sand is the
predominant aplastic inclusion, although
eighteen sherds contain some pulverized
bone as a tempering agent and five are
tempered with grog.
Percentage graphs
illustrating the vertical distribution
of all excavated sherds and each of the
three major tempering categories (sand,
bone, and grog) as well as graphs showing
the frequency of each category in each
level are presented in Figure 20.
Eight decorated sherds are present
in the sample.
Decorating techniques
include lip notching, brushing, incising,
punctate-incising, and red-filming.

one sherd, the punctated-incised example,
can be identified by type and is classified as Pennington Punctated-Incised
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 121). The partially restorable vessel shares some
similarities with Goose Creek Plain (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962: 57) (paste, vessel, form,
and rim decoration) and may belong to or
represent a variant of that type. Lip
notching is common in both Goose Creek
Plain and Goose Creek Incised (Wheat,
1953: 183-189), and Jelks notes that lip
notching rarely occurred on Bear Creek
Plain (1964: 112). Lip notching is not
frequent on the sand-tempered rim sherds
from Area A, but the paste and rim form
of these lip-notched specimens duplicate
Goose Creek Plain and Bear Creek Plain as
they were originally defined.
STONE
Lithic artifacts total 179 specimens
of which arrow points are the dominant
class. Figure 20 presents percentage
graphs showing vertical distribution of
arrow points and dart points. There were
no significant vertical clusters recognized between the arrow point types, but
Perdiz and Cliffton types constitute the
majority of specimens. The vertical
distribution of the 14 dart points (11 of
which are Gary) recovered from Area A
suggests that they pre-date arrow points,
although there is some overlapping.
\

The remaining lithic artifacts recovered (not illustrated on vertical
distribution graphs) usually occurred in
such small quantities that the sample is
either too small for statistical use, or
vertical distribution shows no significant
Table 3.

clustering. Utilized flakes, and biface
fragments, however, occurred frequently
throughout the deposit. Group 1 drills
and scrapers occurred only in the upper
three levels.
In summation, excavations in Area A
revealed a small, concentrated midden
which contained a relative abundance of
ceramics and arrow points. Pottery was
recovered from all levels of excavation,
but decreased below Level 4. About 63%
of all pottery was recovered from Levels
2, 3, and 4. Arrow points were found in
about equal numbers in the upper four
levels; only six of the sixty-seven
specimens occurred below Level 4 and none
occurred below Level 6. Dart points were
not nearly as abundant as arrow points
and all but one were found below Level 3
(i.e., Levels 4 through 7 produced the
majority of the dart points).
Based on the clustering of dart
points in the lower levels, and of arrow
points in the upper levels, it is hypothesized that at least two separate
assemblages were represented 1n Area A.
A slight vertical separation was noted
in the clustering of arrow points and of
dart points; dart point were stratigraphically lower, i.e., earlier. The vertical
distribution of the few grog-tempered
sherds, Group 1 drills, and scrapers (all
of which occurred in the upper three levels)
strengthens this hypothesis. The distribution of sand-tempered pottery would
suggest that if two assemblages were
present, the sand-tempered pottery belonged
to both.
(Figure 20 illustrates the frequency of occurrence of potsherds, arrow
points, and dart points in each level).

Site 41 MQ 6-Area B (Fig. 21)
Excavation Procedures
The plan of the excavation in Area B
is i llustrate<l in Figure 22. Before controlled excavation was begun, brief
exploratory tests were made over much of
the area in order to locate the major
occupational concentration . Although the
tests revealed a moderate amount of cultural refuse over the entire area, the soil
in the southern or lower portion was
noticeably darker than that in the northern
part.
It was primarily on this basis that
Area B was divided into excavation blocks
(or subareas) in order to compare the
material from the darker soil with that
from the lighter. Block l consisted of
six 5 - foot units which formed a rectangle
10 feet wide and 15 feet long composed of
the odd-numbered Units B-1 through B-11.
There were nine units excavated in Block
2 (even-numbered Units B-2 through B-18)
which formed a 15-foot square . Additional
units were excavated at various intervals
in Area B for testing purposes and included
Units B- 13, B-15 , B-17, and B-19 through
B-22 .
Excavations in this area were hampered
by the high water table which prevented
excavation of the units to the bottom of
the sandy fill. The majority of the units
were terminated at 2 . 5 or 3.0 feet below
the surface because of the extremely wet
conditions, although Unit B-21, located in
the higher portion of Area B, reached a
depth of 4.5 feet before moisture became
a problem.
Internal Structure
The internal structure of Area B
28

basically duplicated that of Area A, except for the presence of some silt mixed
with the sand in Block 1, near the creek.
Basal clay was not encountered in Area B.
Several bands of subtle color changes were
noted in the sand in each profile and are
described belpw. These bands, like those
in Area A are defined as subzones. Only
the fill in Blocks l and 2 is described
since these were in greatest contrast.
Profiles in the units lying outside Blocks
1 and 2 were like those in Block 2.

Archeological Features

BLOCK

One occupational feature, a concentration of burned clay nodules, was encountered in Area B. This feature occurred
in Level 5 of Unit B-3 in Block 1, 2.5
feet below the surface and consisted of
an oval concentration of clay lumps.
The
concentration measured approximately 2
feet long, 1.5 feet wide and 0.3 of a foot
thick.
The nodules were fist size or
slightly smaller. The soil around or in
the immediate vicinity of the feature did
not show evidence of heat discoloration.

Discussion of Artifacts
The distribution of artifacts from
Area B is shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

VMB

Fig. 22.
Site 41 MQ 6, Area B, plan
of excavation showing locations of pits,
the feature, and illustrated profiles.

POTTERY
The ceramic sample from this area
essentially duplicates that from Area A.
Plain, sand-tempered ware is dominant,
although a small percentage of bone- and
grog-tempered pottery is present.
Decorated
pottery is rare, but Goose Creek Incised
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: Pl. 72),
San Jacinto Incised (Aten, 1964: 14),
Kiam Incised (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks,
1954: Pl. 40), and possibly Rockport
Black-on-gray types (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: Pl. 73) were identified in
the decorated sherds, adding to the known
types in this geographical region.

Although cultural refuse was found
throughout the excavation in Block 1, the
greatest amount of refuse came from the
upper two feet.
Rodent burrows appeared
abundantly in the upper levels but ordinarily could not be traced in the lower
levels. The presence of silt in Block 1
is attributable to alluvial sediments
deposited by the creek.
Block 2:
Five subzones were recognized in Block 2. The profile is illustrated in Figure 23.

In comparing the ceramics from Blocks
1 and 2, the differences were subtle.
Grog-tempered ware, for instance, was
slightly more frequent in Block 2. The
frequency of the sand-tempered (sandy
paste) pottery and bone-tempered pottery
was about equal in both blocks.
Figure
24 shows the frequency of pottery by
temper in each level and best illustrates

Subzone 1: A gray-to brown-mottled
sand was recognized only in the deepest
unit (B-8). The top of the subzone was
first recognized 3.3 feet below the surface.
It extended beyond the bottom of
the unit.

the great percentage of sand-tempered
ware. The graphs also reveal the vertical
distribution of bone- and grog-tempered
categories, which were restricted to the
upper pottery levels.
STONE
Horizontal and vertical separation
of dart points and arrow points was best
evidenced in Area B excavations. Horizontal separation was noted in comparing
their frequency in Blocks 1 and 2; dart
points were most frequent in Block 1
(48 specimens) although only three were
recovered from Block 2. Vertical clustering of dart points and arrow points
is presented graphically in Figure 24.
Other than projectile points, lithic
artifacts did not ordinarily occur in
sufficient numbers to make valid assumptions on vertical concentration. Small
drills, however, were restricted to the
upper levels of Block 2 and in the same
position in the miscellaneous units of
Area B. Additional implements and utilized flakes occurred throughout the
excavation of Area B. Only two pitted
stones were found and in each case they
were recovered from the upper levels
(one in Level 2 of Unit B-13 and the other
in· Level 3 of Block 1).
In summary, artifacts taken from

30

Area B revealed a clear horizontal and
vertical clustering of dart points and
arrow points. No significant vertical
trends in the types within each projectile point class were apparent.
Ceramics were common in all of Area B and
plain, sand-tempered ware was predominant.
A small percentage of bone- and grogtempered pottery was recovered from the
upper portion of the deposit.
The vertical distribution of dart
points, arrow points, and pottery in Block
1 suggested that three artifactual assemblages were represented in this section
of Area B. Comparison of the vertical
distribution graphs showed that the
greatest number of dart points occurred
in Level 6; there was a decrease in the
number of dart points in Levels 5 and 4,
but an increase in Level 3 was apparent.
Above Level 3, the dart points showed a
marked decrease. Arrow points were concentrated in Level l; a decrease was
evident in Level 2, and a slight increase
was noted again in Level 3. Below Level
3, a marked decrease was apparent. Pottery,
interestingly enough, was most abundant
in Level 3, which showed a secondary
concentration of dart points and arrow
points.
In Block 2, arrow points and pottery
showed almost identical vertical distributions. The greatest number of each was

points were recovered from this block;
all were found below Level 3 where pottery
and arrow points showed a marked decline.
Site 41 MQ 6-Area C
Excavation Procedures
Excavations in this area were confined to eight 5-foot units arranged in
a 10 by 20-foot rectangle (Fig. 25). Six
of these units were excavated to a depth
of 3.5 feet and the remaining two were
terminated 3 feet below the surface.

This was the only area in 41 MQ 6
where two geologic zones were revealed

Subzone 2a:
Immediately overlying
Zone 1 was a band of light, yellowish-tan
sand. Only 0.3 of a foot thick in the
southwest portion of the excavation, it
extended into the floor to an unknown
depth in the other parts of the excavation.

c

AREA

Subzone Zb: This subzone consisted
of a band of light-tan sand which varied
in thickness from 1 to 1.8 feet and was
visible throughout the profile overlying
Subzone 2a.

Zone 1: Tnis zone was composeu of
a reddish-orange, sandy clay which formed
the basal member of the sandy fill.
It
was encountered in the lower (or southern)
end of the excavated area 3.3 feet below
the surface at the southeast corner of
Unit C-8 where it sloped gradually toward
the east.
It was tested to a depth of
approximately 1 foot, but was unproductive.
Zone 2: This zone was the sandy
member which overlaid Zone 1. Cultural
refuse occurred throughout this zone, the
upper portion of which was disturbed considerably by rodent activity. Four subzones bases on color changes were defined
within this zone.

Internal Structure

41 MQ 6

(Fig. 26). These two zones are described
as follows:

Subzone 2c: Overlying Subzone 2b
was a layer of brown, midden-stained sand.
Thickness of this subzone ranged from 0.8
to 1.4 feet. The greatest concentration
of cultural refuse and most of the bone
remains were recovered here.

C-4

Subzone Zd: This mantle of lightbrown sand was regarded as the plow zone.
It also contained an abundance of cultural
refuse.

C-3

Archeological Features

C-7

A single occupational feature, presumably a hearth, was encountered in Area
C (Fig. 27).
It was located in Unit C-1
at the bottom of Level 7, 3.5 feet,below
the surface and extended to 3.8 feet below
the surface. The hearth was composed of
a small concentration of burned-clay
nodules confined to an area measuring 2.6
feet long and 1.2 feet wid~. The soil in
and immediately around the concentration
was baked, but no more charcoal was noted
in the feature than elsewhere in the site.
The burned-clay nodules were approximately
10 cm. or smaller in diameter.

tempered and grog-tempered sherds are
present.
Decorated pottery is extremely
The ceramics from Area C are conrare and no known types could be identi sistent in temper and in frequency of
fied, although one engraved rim sherd from
occurrence with Areas A and B.
Undecorated, a carinated bowl is probably of Caddo
sand-tempered pottery again dominates the
origin.
A graphic illustration of the
invPntory and a small percentage of bonevertical distribution of paste categories
and the frequency of these categories in
each level is presented in Figure 28.
These groups closely resemble those found
in Area A and, with the possible exception
of the bone-tempered sherds occurring
throughout much of the deposit, are fairly
consistent with Area B, Block 2 findings.
STONE
Dart points are somewhat more numerous
than are arrow points, and clearly show an
earlier position.
Most dart points fall
within the range of Gary, Kent, or Palmillas,
but there does not appear tb be any significant vertical clustering of any one type.
Bifacial artifacts other than projectile points were found with the dart
points in the lower levels.
Two pitted
stones were recovered, one in Level 3 and
the other in Level 4.
In summary, Area C produced evidence
of at least two artifact assemblages.
The
earlier, that of an Archaic or preceramic
assemblage, is marked chiefly by dart

points, "knives", and crude bifacial implements. The second assemblage is NeoAmerican and is characterized by arrow
points and pottery. Sand-, bone-, and
grog-temper categories are all represented.
Small drills which occurred with this
assemblage in Areas A and B were not found
in Area C. Pitted stones do appear in
this assemblage.
Summary of 41 MQ 6
Site 41 MQ 6 was divided into three
areas of excavation for two reasons.
First, it had been observed that although
refuse was scattered over the entire area,
there were three concentrations of material
within the sites. These concentrations
were situated on three distinctive topographic features, two knolls and an intervening flat area, and they occurred in
association with slightly darker soil.
Secondly, the excavations at 41 MQ 4 and
41 MQ S demonstrated that discrete stratigraphy, either geological or cultural,
was not present in the loose, sandy soil
of the area. With this in mind, it was
hoped that if vertical stratigraphy was
unclear at 41 MQ 6, horizontal differences
could be noted which would allow a fairly
discrete grouping of artifact assemblages
(providing that the three concentrations
represented more than one period of occupation). However, this tripartite division did not yield the horizontal separation initially anticipated, although the
two divisions within Area B (Block 1 and
Block 2) did reveal a quantitative shift
of certain artifact categories. Also, it
was noted that the greatest concentration
of pottery was in Area A.

Each area did show a significant
though gradual vertical shift in the frequency of certain artifact categories.
The most noticeable and important shift
occurred in Area C where dart points
decreased and pottery and arrow points
increased from lower to upper levels.
This particular shift allows two general
conclusions about the cultural history
of the site.
1. The initial occupation at the
site is basically Archaic (i.e. preceramic)
and is characterized chiefly by dart
points (Gary, Kent, and Palmillas being
most frequent types). Arrow points
(chiefly Perdiz, Catahoula, Cliffton and
Alba types), pottery, small drills and
pitted stones were introduced into the
site at a later date.
2. The cultural stratigraphy in
Area B suggests that the bone-tempered
and grog-tempered pottery was introduced
into the site later than was sand-tempered
pottery, but the vertical stratigraphy
of bone- and grog-tempered categories in
AreasA and C does not support this.
In addition to the above statement~
which are based on the distributional
study, an analysis revealed that the
majority of the pottery is a plain, sand
tempered ware, and that bone- and grogtempered ceramics occur infrequently.
The presence of Galveston Bay, Goose Creek
Incised, San Jacinto Incised, and possibly
Goose Creek Plain, Caddoan and Rockport
ceramics indicate contact with these areas.
However, the amount of plain, sand-tempered
pottery recovered suggests that the sandtempered ware is indigenous.

CHAPTER III
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
Pottery
Sand-Tempered Ware
The greatest majority (1,659 or 92%)
of the ceramics from Lake Conroe are santltempered but only 30 of these exhibit some
form of decoration. The sand-tempered
pottery is subdivided into three descriptive categories based on the size of the
sand in the paste (Fig. 29, a-f). To
determine the various grades of sand, the
Wentworth size scale (Shepard, 1961: 118)
was used.
Units of measurement of this
scale are as follows: silt, 0625 mm. or
smaller; very fine sand, .0625-.125 mm.;
fine sand, .125-.25 mm.; medium sand,
.25-.5 mm.; coarse sand, .5-1.0 mm. Of
these units, only very fine, fine, and
medium are represented in the sample.
VERY FINE SAND
Plain
No. of specimens:
Provenience:

120 sherds

16, 41 MQ 5; 104, 41

MQ 6.
Description:
In addition to the very
fine sand, larger sand grains or small
hematite particles are present in the
paste, but in each case, they represent a
small minority of the total temper.
Often,
tiny carbonized stains and cavities can
be seen but apparently these represent
burned out rootlets or other aberrant
vegetal matter. As a rule, the paste is
quite firm but becomes friable when wet.
The sherds that contain a high percentage
of sand erode easily. The technique of
manufacture is coiling and most sherds
tend to break along coil junctures. On
one sherd there is a single hole drilled
from the exterior side.
Surface colors are variable, ranging
from reddish orange to tan brown or almost
black. Core colors follow the same general spectrum. On some sherds these core
colors are uniform but many exhibit a
band along the exterior and occasionally
along the interior surface that is either
lighter or darker than the center of t~e
core.
Fire mottling is common.
Surfaces generally are well smoothed;
that is, coil junctures are completely
erased.
Some floating is apparent on the
outer surfaces of a few examples, but the
majority are quite gritty.
Individual
sherds are fairly uniform in thickness
and the thicknesses within the group vary
from 3 to 8 mm.

40

The eleven rim sherds are basically
straight (Fig. 30, a).
Lips are rounded
and tapering of the interior surface toward the lip has produced narrow lips on
most examples.
Exterior walls on a
majority of the rim sherds are straight.
The lips on two examples curve outward
slightly. The straight rims coupled with
curvature of the larger body sherds suggest that simple bowls or cylindrical jars
are represented.
No basal sherds were
recovered.
Decorated
No. of specimens:
Provenience:

16 sherds

13, 41 MQ S; 3, 41 MQ

6.

Description:
Unless otherwise stated,
paste characteristic of the decorated
sherds conforms to the plain ware.
Thirteen are apparently from a single vessel
recovered in 41 MQ 5. These sherds from
41 MQ S are unique in that a thin, dull
red film has been applied to the outer
surface. The interior surface is well
smoothed and appears to be coated with a
black substance.
The temper is similar
to that of the plain ware except that the
occurrence of carbonized vegetal matter
in the paste is quite common.
The rim is
straight and slight tapering on the interior side has resulted in a narrow,
rounded lip.
Faint, evenly spaced notches
occur along the top of the rim.
The
notches are spaced at approximately 3 mm.
intervals.
Rim shape and curvature of
the body sherds suggest that the vessel
was a relatively small cylindrical jar
approximately 120 to 130 mm. in diameter.
Wall thickness varies from 4 to 5 mm.
This vessel is very similar to the description of Goose Creek Red-Filmed recently reported by Aten (1967: 11-13).
From Area B of 41 MQ 6 was recovered
a very small rim sherd which exhibits at
least five incised lines running parallel
to the rim and beginning just below the
lip.
The rim is straight and is flattened.
Small, evenly spaced notches decorate the
inner edge of the lip. These notches are
spaced at about 3 mm. intervals. The
paste is much like that of the plain ware
and small carbon stains also occur in the
paste. The incising and lip notching are
characteristic of Goose Creek Incised.
One small body sherd, recovered from
41 MQ 6, Area A is brushed on the exterior
surface (Fig. 33, a).
The remaining decorated example, found
in Area C of 41 MQ 6,is a small, slightly

Description: The sand grains comprising the major portion of the temper
are .125 to .25 mm. in size; other than
grain size, the sherds in this category
are very similar to the previous group.
Often, larger or smaller grains are present in the paste but these constitute
only a minor portion of the total temper.
Like the previous category, carbonized
stains and cavaties occasionally can be
seen in the paste and presumably represent burned out rootlets. The paste may
be quite firm, or crumbly, depending on
how well the parent vessel was fired.
The sherds tend to break along coil junctures. Almost all sherds in this category
are friable when wet. The thickness of
individual sherds is usually uniform,
but sherds of uneven thickness are present.
Several specimens exhibit drilled holes,
made from the exterior surface, presumably
for suspension or repairing. Sherd thickness varies from 3 to 10 mm., but the
majority are between 4 and 7 mm. thick.

41 MQ 6

Description: The paste characteristics and color conform to those of the
plain ware in this category.
Shallow but distinct notches along
the top of the rims are evident on three
straight rim sherds from Area C. Otherwise, the sherds are plain. The rims are
thinned in the same manner as the undecorated examples.
Two of the decorated specimens are
small, fingernail-punctated body sherds
(Fig. 33, b,c) recovered from Area B.

One rim sherd recovered from Area A
exhibits two poorly executed incised lines
approximately parallel to the rim (Fig.
33, e). One line begins about 4 mm. below
the rim and the other some 12 mm. below
the rim. The flat lip possesses relatively
deep notches spaced at regular intervals
about 3 mm. apart. The notches are deeper

are often much larger (up to 2 mm. in
diameter) or smaller sand grains visible
in the paste, but they are never frequent
in any one sherd.
Carbonized stains and
cavaties occur frequently in the paste and
are sometimes visible on the surface.
Although sand comprises a major percentage
of the paste, the paste is generally firm;
the hardness is usually dependent on how
well the vessels were fired.
Fracturing
along coil junctures is common.
Core and surface colors are like
those of the previous categories.
Surface
finish is also much the same except that
several sherds in this group are poorly
finished also, surface irregularities are
present and sherd thickness ranges from
3 to 11 mm. though the majority are between 4 and 8 mm.
Slightly floated surfaces, usually accompanied with surface
cracking or peeling of the outer layer
are present.
Crack lacing holes occur
occasionally.
Thirty-nine plain rim sherds are in
the collection. Almost all are straight,
although slightly incurved or outcurved
rims occur rarely.
Lips are rounded or,
less often, poorly flattened (Fig. 30,
d,e). Two specimens exhibit everted lips.
Thinned lips occur on about half of the
specimens and are usually accompanied
by the outward tapering of the inner wall,
but tapering of both surfaces also occurs.
Only four small base sherds were
recovered, two of which are rounded and
two are conical.
One of the latter examples exhibits a slight bulb or knob at
the bottom, characteristic of Goose Creek
Plain and Goose Creek Incised pottery
types (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 55, 57).
Rim shapes and curvature of the
larger body sherds indicate that the
principal vessels represented are simple
bowls and jars.
One partially restored
vessel from 41 MQ 4 is a small conical
bowl 12-12.5 mm. in diameter at the orifice.
It tapers toward the bottom (Fig.
31). No basal sherds of this vessel were
found but an almost identical example
was recovered from Livingston Reservoir.
This second example is cone-shaped and
has a rounded bottom (McClurkan, 1967:
Fig. 17).

Drawing of partially
restored, medium sand tempered vessel
from Site 41 MQ 4.
partially restored vessel and five rim
sherd~ is the most frequent form of
decoration.
The partially restored vessel recovered from Area A of 41 MQ 6 is a large,
relatively deep jar with slightly outcurved rim and globular body (Fig. 32).
No basal sherds were recovered.
The lip
is decorated with deep, wide (about the
diameter of a pencil) scallop-like impressions that were made along the top of the
lip when the clay was still wet (Fig. 33,
j). The notches are spaced from 2 to 6
mm. apart, but most are about 3 mm. apart,
and are deeper along the interior of the
rim.
Projecting the curvature of the rim
sherds, it is estimated to have been about
240 mm. wide at the mouth and about 210
mm. high.
Wall thicknesses range from
4 to 6 mm.
The five rim sherds represent individual vessels and each exhibits a distinct type of lip notching.
One example
from Area A is a small, straight rim
decorated in the same manner as the previously-described vessel; however, the
notches are much smaller (Fig. 33, h).
Bulging of the paste occurs on each side
of the notches.
Contiguous notches are
evident along the interior of the rim.
The lip is flat.

A second sherd, also found in Area
A, is a small, deeply notched rim with on
one complete notch and traces of two others
(Fig. 33, i).
The notches are deeper and
more widely spaced than the two previouslydescribed examples, but also are deeper
on one side.
Because the sherd is small,

Bone Tempered
Included in this category are sherds
which have pulverized bone as the major,
or one of the major tempering agents. All
but one of the sherds contain some sand,
but the quantity and size of the sand
varies considerably. Only 3.4% of all
pottery recovered from Lake Conroe contains
bone as a tempering agent.

Description: Some sand is included
in the paste of all the plain sherds. In
addition to bone, (using the Wentworth
size scale for sand) 14 of the sherds
contain very fine sand, 23 contain fine
sand, and 20 contain medium sand. Admittedly, to be consistent, individual
categories should perhaps have been set
up using the sand size as a criterion,
but because the sample is small, this was
not done.

interior and exterior surfaces cannot be
accurately defined. Notches are about 3
mm. deep, 6 mm. wide, and are spaced at
about 4 mm. intervals.
The third sherd exhibiting this mode
of decoration is a straight rim sherd with
a narrowed but flattened lip. Contiguous
shallow but very distinct notches decorate
the top of the lip. It was found in Area
B.

The fourth specimen, recovered from
Area C, is a straight-rim sherd with a
thinned, rounded lip. Faint, shallow
nicks occur at approximately 4 mm. intervals along the interior of the lip.
The fifth example, a straight stem
with a flattened lip, was recovered
from Area A. The lip and body are about
equally thick (7 mm.). Parallel but unevenly spaced incised lines are exhibited
across the top of the lip (Fig. 33, g).
Spaces between the lines vary from 2 to
5 mm.

Paste is usually quite firm, depending
largely on how well the vessels were fired.
Those that contain an abundance of sand
are gritty and erode easily. Carbonized
stains and cavities occur often and occasionally can be seen on the surface. Core
colors vary; black and gray cores, are predominant but light or banded cores also
are present. Bone particles are usually
white and are readily visible but in some
cases they are completely carbonized and
are hard to detect. Surface colors range
from reddish-orange, tan, and brown, to
nearly black. Fire mottling is common.
Surfaces as a rule are not well smoothed
as evidenced by striations on some examples.
Thicknesses of individual sherds vary.
Maximum thickness of sherds within the
sample ranges from 4 to 15 mm., but most
fall between 5 and 10 mm. Cross-sections
of bone-tempered sherds are shown in
Figure 29, j-1.
Seven rim sherds are present and all
are very small (Fig. 30, f). Four are
slightly outcurved and three are straight.
One retains a part of a hole drilled from
the exterior side. Most frequently lips
are thinned rounded, but two specimens are
not thinned and exhibit convex or almost
flattened lips.

One of the decorated specimens is a
small body sherd possessing five parallel
lines. It was found in Area B. Because
the sherd is so small, no orientation of
the lines (horizontal, vertical, etc.)
can be determined.

Two very thick sherds (13 and 15 mm.)
appear to be from bases and if so, the
bases are flat.

The remaining decorated sherd in
this category is a relatively small,
fingernail-punctated body sherd (Fig. 33,
f).
It was also recovered from Area B.

Because of the generally small size
of the sherds, rim and base sherds in
particular, it is not possible to suggest
vessel shapes.

Provenience:

Bone constitutes the only visible
temper in the brushed sherd. The sherd
is dark gray throughout and it is 6 mm.
thick. Brushing is random and appears
to be on the exterior surface. The opposite surface is poorly smoothed. This
specimen was recovered from Area C.

Description: Physical characteristics other than decoration are like
those of the plain ware.
Examples of
engraved, incised, punctated-incised,
punctated, brushed, red-filmed, and
asphalt painted occur.
One rim sherd from a carinated bowl
recovered in Area C of 41 MQ 6 is engraved.
The poorly executed decoration consists
of parallel lines placed diagonally to
the rim (Fig. 34, g,g'). The lip is flat.
Two sherds are incised.
One rim
sherd from Area B at 41 MQ 6 has six
finely-executed incised lines parallel to
the rim (Fig. 34, e,e').
The lip is flat
and thinned.
The exterior surface of the
rim is slightly concave and appears to
be from a relatively large jar. The design and paste are characteristic of San
Jacinto Incised (formally included in
Goose Creek Incised) (Aten, 1967: 14).
The second example, a tiny body sherd from
41 MQ 5 (Fig. 34, f), possesses a single,
incised line.

Description: The principal tempering
agent of sherds in this category is clay
particles or grog (Fig. 29, g-i). Most,
if not all, of the clay particles consist
of pulverized sherds which can readily be
detected in the paste. Many contain very
fine or fine sand in addition to the grog.
Paste is characteristically much harder
than that of the sand-tempered and bonetempered categories and fractured edges
are often sharp and irregular.
Fracturing along coil junctures is not common.
Surface colors are brown or gray and
cores vary from dark brown to gray and
black. A light band in the core near the
exterior surface is often evident. Surfaces are not well smoothed; F.any are
striated (but not scored); the striations
are apparently caused by the tool or
fingers of the potter. Some irregularities are caused by protruding clay particles in the paste. Sherd thickness
varies from 6 to 9 mm.
Only two plain rim sherds are in the
collection. One is small and straight
with a rounded lip. The other is straight
with a thinned, flat lip. Thinning on
this specimen is accomplished by tapering
·of the inner surface.

47

Punctating-incising decorates four
sherds. The first is a large, straight
rim sherd with a rounded lip from Area
B at 41 MQ 6 (Fig. 34, a-a").
Three
widely spaced horizontal lines decorate
the rim area and diagonal punctates,
apparently made with a stick, decorate
the body.
The mode of decoration is
characteristic of Kiam Incised (Suhm and
Jelks, 1962: 89). A second example found
in Area A at 41 MQ 6 is a slightly outcurved rim sherd with a zone punctate
decoration (Fig. 34, d,d').
Zones are
outlined by incising and may represent
diamond- or triangular-shaped motifs, but
are arranged in such a manner that they
leave plain, inverted triangles along the
rim between zones.
This type of decoration
is found in Pennington Punctated-Incised
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 121). But the
rim shape of the Conroe example is generally
not characteristic of the Pennington
Punctated-Incised type.
The remaining
two punctated-incised examples are small
body sherds possibly representing zone
punctate designs; one was recovered from
41 MQ S (Fig. 34, e) and the other from
Area B at 41 MQ 6 (Fig. 34, b).
Four small body sherds exhibit stick
punctates. One was found at 41 MQ 5 and

the remaining three came from Area B at
41 MQ 6 ( Fi g • 3 3 , m- o) •
From 41 MQ 5 seven sherds possibly
representing a single vessel, exhibit a
brushed exterior surface. No orientation
of the brushing (horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal) can be discerned, however.
One otherwise plain body sherd is

The remaining example is buff and
retains a portion of a skillfully executed
asphalt painted design (Fig. 34, h). The
design was first outlined in narrow lines
along the border and the spaces between
the lines then painted in. Asphalt painting is diagnostic of Rockport Black-ongray (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 131).

41 MQ 6

Description: This outcurved rim sherd
recovered from Area B is tempered with
pulverized bone and grog (sherd) and,
contains some fine sand in the paste.
The brown surfaces are well smoothed and
the core is dark-gray. The lip is rounded
and slightly everted. A trace of an engraved design occurs near the bottom and
consists of a horizontal line intersected
by two separate groups of lines. The
sherd is 7 mm. thick below the rim.
Stone
There were 1,785 stone artifacts
recovered from the three excavated sites
in Lake Conroe Reservoir. The great
majority of these artifacts are made from
locally obtained pebbles and cobbles of
chert, quartzite, petrified wood, and
sandstone. As a rule, fracturing quality
of the local materials is poor, but despite this, some of the artifacts, particularly projectile points, are well executed. Aberrant fine-grained chert,
possibly obtaine<l from the Brazos River
drainage to the west, occurs infrequently.
A cursory examination of the chipped
stone artifacts revealed that both the
flake and the core industries were utilized. The dart points and knives illustrate both techniques. Some of the dart
points, for example, are made from relatively large flakes that retain traces of
the flake surface or portions of the positive bulb of percussion on one face.
Others are obviously made from small,

49

relatively flat pebbles as evidenced by
cortex which is sometimes retained on
both surfaces of a specimen. Many crude
bifaces are also made from flat pebbles,
but the arrow points are apparently ma<le
from flakes.
For descriptive purposes, the stone
artifacts are divided into four broad
categories: chipped, battered, ground,
and miscellaneous. Chipped stone artifacts have been further divided into the
following classification: dart points,
arrow points, knives, burins, drills,
crude bifacial implements, scrapers,
pebble unifaces, and utilized flakes.
Battered stone categories are hammerstones
and anvil. The ground stone category
includes manos and milling slabs.
Chipped Stone Artifacts
DART POINTS
There are 546 artifacts in the
Conroe Reservoir collection which are
identified as dart points or dart point
fragments. These items are divided into
three broad categories based solely on
stem configuration and may be termed stem
traditions. These categories or traditions
are contracting stem, straight stem, and
expanding stem. Within the respective
stem traditions, the type concept is
applied when possible to points which
share certain morphological traits that
distinguish them from .other points or
groups of points within that tradition.
When a type sample is large and variations
within the sample are distinctive enough,
the projectile points are subdivided into
morphological varieties. For example,
there are 267 points which fit the description of the Gary type; that is, they
all possess certain attributes characteristic of that type such as contracting
stems, convex, rounded, or pointed bases,
shouldered, triangular blades. However,
when secondary characteristics such as
stem variation (pointed, rounded, long,
short, etc.) are considered, the range of
variation within a large sample is sometimes phenomenal and in comparing a
variety at one extreme with one at the
other extreme, the differences are often
so striking that one is sometimes hesitant
to classify them as the same type. The
varieties described herein are established
from the Conroe Reservoir collection but
are compared with other existing varieties
in hopes that some spatial or temporal
changes can be detected.
Contracting Stem Tradition

(Fig. 35, a)
No. of specimens:

1

Provenience:

41 MQ 5

Remarks:
One of these specimens
retains a trace of asphaltum on the stern.

Description: This fragmentary specimen has a contracting stem with straight,
extensively smoothed stem edges.
The
thinned base is slightly concave. Although much of the blade is missing, the
remaining portion is narrow and tapers
inward from the stem.
The cross-section
is lenticular and workmanship is good
despite the thickness of the specimen.
Material:

Gary, Variety 1 bears close resemblance to the Gary, Kaufman variety described by Johnson (1962: 161-163) and by
Story (1965: 193), both from the northeastern portion of Texas.
Similar points
are also reported from Forney Reservoir
by Ross (Gary, Variety 3, 1966: 25) and
Sorrow's Gary, Variety 2 from Bardwell
Reservoir are also similar (1966: 11).

Variety 2 (Fig. 35, g-j)

Dimensions: Total length, unknown;
maximum width, 19 mm.; stem length, 18
mm.; maximum thickness, 8 mm.

No. of specimens:
Provenience:
MQ 5; 5, 41 MQ 6.

Remarks: Angostura is thought to
be a Paleo-Indian projectile point type
although such points are frequently found
in Archaic and Neo-American contexts
(Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell, 1962: 47,
75, 87 and Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross,
1967: 81). The Angostura point from
Lake Conroe is made of foreign chert and
since this is the only artifact with
Paleo-Indian attributes recovered from
site 41 MQ 5, it is reasonable to assume
that the point was brought to the site
by the later inhabitants.

12, 41 MQ 4; 10, 41 ,

Description: These points are
characterized by relatively long, contracting sterns and narrow blades. Stern
edges are straight or convex and most
have markedly convex bases.
The bases on
two are unworked, however.
Shoulders
vary from weak to moderate and usually
slant toward the tip.
Lateral edges are
generally straight, though faintly concave edges do occur.
Tips on the complete
specimens are sharply pointed. Workmanship varies considerably, ranging from
good to poor.

The Gary points are distinguished
by their contracting stems, pointed or
rounded bases, and shouldered, triangular
blades. They are divided into nine
varieties and one miscellaneous group.

Dimensions: Total length, 34-60 mm.;
maximum width, 17-27 mm.; stern length,
10-17 mm.; maximum thickness, 5-11 mm.

Gary, Variety III described by
McClurkan from Livingston Reservoir closely resembles this group (1967: 95, 98).

Provenience: 30, 41 MQ 4; 27, 41
MQ 5; 16, 41 MQ 6.
Description: Stems are sharply
contracting and bases are either pointed,
or markedly convex. Stem edges are generally straight, but may be slightly
convex.
Shoulders are prominent and extend out at right angles to the long axis
of the specimen. Blades are triangular
with concave, straight (less often) or
recurved (rarely}, lateral edges.
The
complete examples have sharply pointed
tips. The degree of workmanship is
apparently dictated by the coarseness of
the material and is therefore variable,
but a few examples exhibit excellent '
craftmanship.

13, 41 MQ 4; 15, 41

Description:
Sterns are relatively
short with mostly convex stem edges.
Bases, when finished, are rounded; eleven
exhibit unworked bases, seven of which
retain the weathered cortex of the parent
pebble or cobble across the base.
When
the bases are worked, the stems have a
semi-circular appearance. Blades are
triangular and shoulders are prominent.
Shoulders usually extend outward at right
angles to the long axis of the specimens,
but incipient barbs do occur. Often one
shoulder is more pronounced than the other,
lending an asymmetrical appearance.

One crudely made, though complete,
example was chipped from a thin pebble
and retains much of the cortex surface on
each face.
In contrast, one specimen is
made from a thick, curved flake.

Variety 5 specimens resemble McClurkan's
Gary Variety I from nearby Livingston
Reservoir (1967: 94, 95). Gary, Hobson
variety specimens described by Johnson
(1962: 163) are remarkably similar to some
of the specimens in this group, however,
most Variety 5 specimens tend to be much
larger than Gary, Hobson.

Description: These items have relatively broad, triangular blades and prominent shoulders. Lateral edges on most
are straight, but concave or convex edges
do occur. The contracting stems are relatively long and have either straight or
convex lateral edges. Bases on most are
unworked, but when the bases are chipped,
they are rounded. Generally, workmanship
is poor, although two examples are quite

Description: Stems are relatively
broad and contracting with convex edges.
Bases when worked are rounded. Blades
are triangular on most specimens and are
relatively long, although a few examples
have rather short, broad blades. Because
of the wide stems, shoulders are usually
slight. Lateral edges are either straight,
or concave but rarely convex. Craftmanship varies from good to poor but despite
the coarseness of the material, most show
good workmanship. Tips on the complete
examples are sharp.

Description: These dart points are
pentagonal in outline; stems are contracting and stem edges are straight. The stems
on five are approximately one-half of the
total length of the specimen. Bases, when
worked, are either straight, or slightly
convex; two examples have unworked bases.
The triangular blades are short with weak
to moderate shoulders and straight, or,
less often, concave edges. Workmanship
varies from good to poor, but most examples
are poorly worked.

Remarks: Variety 7 points bear some
resemblance to Johnson's Gary, varieties
Hobson and Emory (1962: 163, 164). The
stems of Variety 7 are similar to those of
the Emory variety, while the blades more
closely resemble the Gary, Hobson. Variety
7 samples are almost identical in outline
and form to the contracting stem B specimens illustrated from Livingston Reservoir
by McClurkan (1967: Fig. 20, a-d). They
differ from McClurkan's contracting stem
B only in exhibiting more pronounced
shoulders.

Dimensions: Total length, 36-65 mm.
(estimated); maximum width, 22-36 mm.;
stem length, 6-16 mm.; maximum thickness,

Remarks: One of these specimens is
made from a relatively thin pebble and on
both sides retains some of the cortex
surface of the original pebble. In contrast, another example was made from a
thick, cortex flake and retains much of
the weathered cortex on one surface and
the bulh of percussion on the opposite
face. The bulb of percussion forms the
stem while the blade on this interesting
specimen is unifacially trimmed on alternate edges.
Variety 9 points bear some resemblances to the Gary, Alsa variety described
by Johnson (1962: 163) although the latter
have pointed stems. Sorrow's Gary,
Variety 4 points from Bardwell Reservoir

Two of these specimens are made from
relatively thin petrified wood pebbles
and retain the cortex surface of the original pebble on each face. The unworked
nodular cortex is retained across the

concave base example has a lightly ground
stem (Fig. 38, j). Weak, moderate, and
pronounced shoulders exist in the sample.
Most examples have straight blade edges
(Fig. 38, i), but the lateral edges on
two examples are convex (Fig. 38, h).
Craftsmanship varies from good to poor.

Description: These dart points are
essentially side notched and are characterized by long, slender blades. Stems
expand slightly as a result of the broad,
shallow side notches and bases are usually
convex, but rounded and unworked bases do
occur. The long, narrow blades have
straight or convex lateral edges. Workmanship is poor.

1, 41 MQ 4; 2, 41 MQ 5.

Description: The stems on these
points are expanding and the bases are
convex, giving the stems a bulbar appearance. Shoulders vary from moderate to
pronounced but true barbs are lacking.
The triangular blades have either straight,
or less often, concave lateral edges.
Workmanship is, as a rule, good.

Description: Triangular blades and
expanding stems are the salient characteristics of these artifacts. Specimen A
(Fig. 38, t) has relatively deep, broad
corner notches and an irregularly chipped,
though essentially convex base. Specimen
B (Fig. 38, r) has a short stem formed by
broad, shallow corner notches. Specimen
C (Fig. 38, s) is asymmetrical and has
one deep, broad corner notch on one side
and a long, shallow notch on the opposite
side, causing an unbalanced appearance.
The blade, although offset, is triangular
with straight lateral edges. The tips on
all are sharply pointed although the overall workmanship is rather poor.

1, 41 MQ 4; 2, 41 MQ

Description: These are stemless dart
points. Two are small, leaf-shaped artifacts with convex lateral edges and rounded
bases (Fig. 39, a,b). Both are poorly
made. Four specimens are subtriangular
in outline; one small quartzite point
(not illustrated) has a ~traight base and
recurved lateral edges. A fragmentary,
but well made subtriangular specimen has
a "fish tail" like base (Fig. 39, d),
that is, two convex curves which meet in
the approximate center of the thinned
base. The base on this specimen is lightly
ground. The lateral edges are convex and
secondary retouching is present along the
blade edges. The third specimen has a
finely chipped, triangular blade and a
convex, but thinned base (Fig. 39, e).
The remaining specimen is triangular with
straight base and blade edges (Fig. 39,

41 MQ 6.

Description: These are relatively
small arrow points with triangular blades
and straight or concave lateral edges.
Shoulders are wide and outflaring and are
slightly barbed on one example (Fig. 39,
h). Stems are straight, or faintly contracting and bases are straight. All
examples are bifacially chipped by pressure
flaking, though none has serrated blades.
Material:

2, chert; 2, quartzite.

Dimensions: Total length, 20-30 mm.;
maximum width, 14 (estimated)-18 mm.;
stem length, 5-8 mm.; stem width, 6-7 mm.;
maximum thickness, 2.5-4 mm.
Remarks: One unique specimen (Fig.
39, s) exhibits extensive smoothing from
the tip to about midway up the blade.
The smoothing is more pronounced at the
tip. The specimen perhaps should be included in Type 1 drills, but since the
blade has only been smoothed, and not
rechipped, it is included here.

maximum thickness, 6 mm. (all specimens).
Remarks: The subtriangular specimen
with the "fish tail" base (Fig. 39, d),
although fragmentary, is similar in many
respects to the "copena" knives recovered
from the George C. Davis site (Newell and
Krieger, 1949: 173, 174).

Provenience:

2, 41 MQ 4; 5, 41 MQ

Description: The diagnostic attributes of these artifacts are the squared,
outflaring, usually massive barbs, and
the short, squared stems. Blades are
triangular with concave, straight, or
recurved lateral edges. Lateral edges
are usually finely chipped and most are
serrated. Workmanship varies considerably
within the sample but most are bifacially
chipped and some are very finely retouched.

Provenience:

3, 41 MQ 5; 20, 41 MQ 6.

Description:

These arrow points are

characterized by wide, sharply contracting
stems. Stems are usually short and often
rudimentary. Bases are either pointed
or somewhat rounded. Shoulders are generally squared, rarely rounded and on occasion, are difficult to delineate from
stems. Blades are triangular with either
straight, or less often, concave or.convex lateral edges. Workmanship varies from
good to poor and while the typical specimens in the sample are bifacially worked,
three specimens are predominantly unifacially chipped.
Dimensions: Total length, 16-33 mm.;
maximum width, 14-26 mm.; stem length,
1-7 mm.; maximum thickness, 3-9 mm.
Material: 5, chert; 15, quartzite;
3, petrified wood.

Perdiz arrow points were subdivided
into three morphologically distinct groups.
Variety 1 (Fig. 39, q-t)

Provenience:

31

5, 41 MQ S; 26, 41 MQ 6.

Description: These arrow points are
characterized bycontracting stems and
sharply convex bases. Stem edges are
usually straight but may be slightly convex. Blades are triangular and well
barbed shoulders are the norm; the shoulders rarely extend outward at near right
angles to the stem. Lateral edges are
more often serrated and may be either
straight, slightly concave, or recurved.
Workmanship, as a rule, is good and all
but two specimens are bifacially worked;
the exceptions are made from thin flake~
which exhibit primarily lateral alteration
and retain much of the original flake surface.
Material:

Materials: 7, chert; 15, quartzite;
5, petrified wood.
Dimensions: Total length, 16-39 mm.;
maximum width, 15-25 mm.; stem length,
3-6 mm.; maximum thickness, 2-5 mm.

Perdiz (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 283)

No. of specimens:

Description: These points are distinguished by their sharply contracting
and relatively short stems. Bases are
either sharply convex or pointed. Blades
are triangular and wide, and shoulders
generally extend outward at right angles
to the long axis of the specimens; barbed
shoulders occur infrequently. Blade
edges are straight or, less often, concave.
Serrated blade edges are rare. Workmanship varies from good to poor, but the
majority are poorly executed. All are
bifacially chipped although occasionally
one face will exhibit much of the original flake surface.

Remarks: The most notable characteristic separating this group from Variety
1 is the shorter and more sharply contracting stem. Some characteristics,
particularly the shorter, markedly contracting stem are shared with Bassett
points (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: Pl. 133)
but the Perdiz, Variety 2 is generally
wider and lacks the strongly barbed shoulders found on Bassett points.
Variety 3 (Fig. 39, y-bb)
No. of specimens:
Provenience:

41 MQ 6.

Description: Stems are short, contracting and have convex stem edges and
rounded bases. Shoulders are wide and
extend outward at approximate right angles
to the stem. Blade edges are concave on
three examples and are sinuous on the remaining specimen. All examples are bifacially chipped but craftsmanship is only
fair.

12, chert; 18, quartzite;
Material:

1, petrified wood.

Dimensions: Total length, 20-36 mm.;
maximum width, 15-26 mm.; stem length,
5-10 mm.; maximum thickness, 3-5 mm.
Remarks: Many or perhaps most
Variety 1 specimens would fit the de-·
scr:iption of Perdiz, Whitney variety described by Jelks (1962: 24-25). However,
concave or recurved blade edges are more
frequent on specimens from Conroe Reservoir.

Provenience:

Dimensions: Total length, 22-32 mm.
(estimated); maximum width, 14-22 mm.;
stem length, 5-7 mm.; maximum thickness,
3-4 mm.
Remarks: The outstanding characteristic separating these points from the
previously described varieties of Perdiz
is the rounded or semi-circular appearance
of the stem. The laterally projecting
shoulders are shared with some examples
of Variety 2 as are the concave lateral
edges. Stem configuration is similar to
Perdiz, Morgan variety described by Jelks
(1962: 26) but the Variety 3 specimens
as a group tend to have somewhat shorter
stems.

41 MQ 6.
Material:

Description: This corner-notched
arrow point has an expanding stem, slightly
concave base, small, barbed shoulders,
and straight lateral edges that form a
triangular blade.
Fine, minute serrations
occur along the blade edges. Although it
is relatively thick, the specimen shows
fine bifacial work.
Material:

Chert.

Dimensions: Total length, 18 mm.;
maximum width, 14 mm.; stem length, 4 mm.;
stem width, 8 mm.; maximum thickness,
3. 5 mm.
Remarks: The concave base, although
slight, is the diagnostic attribute of
Scallorn, Brangus variety (Shafer, Suhm,
and Scurlock, 1964: 35-36).

Dimensions: Total length, 15-19 mm.;
maximum width, 12 mm. (two specimens only);
stem length, 8 mm. (all specimens); stem
width, 7-8 mm.; maximum thickness, 3-3.5
mm.
Remarks: These items share some
similarities with the Friley type (Bell,
1960: 46) particularly the laterallyprojecting or "spurred" shoulders and
concave blade edges.
Friley, however, is
characterized by much stronger shoulders
and in many cases, the shoulders curve
toward the tip.

4, 41 MQ 5; 13, 41 MQ 6.

Description: These artifacts have
relatively long stems with parallel edges
and convex or rounded bases. Shoulders
are usually barbed (Fig. 40, b,d) although
squared shoulders, extending cut at right
angles, do occur (Fig. 40, a,c).
Lateral
edges are usually straight or concave,
but rarely recurved. All but one of the
examples are bifacially chipped and workmanship as a whole is good. The blade
edges on three specimens are serrated.
Material:
3, chert; 10, quartzite;
4, petrified wood.
Dimensions: Total length, 26-33 mm.;
maximum wid~h, 14-25 mm.; stem length,
5-8 mm.; stem width, 5-8 mm.; maximum
thickness, 3-5 mm.
Remarks: These arrow points are
morphologically similar to Perdiz, Varieties 1 and 3, but are distinguished from
the Perdiz by parallel rather than contracting stem edges.
Untyped 1 quite
possibly represents Perdiz variants.

Description: The stems on these
points expand slightly; stem edges and
bases are convex, leaving a bulbar-shaped
stem. Shoulders are strong and extend
outward at approximate right angles to the
stem. Blade edges are concave. All
specimens are bifacially chipped and workmanship, as a rule, is relatively good.
Material:

3, chejt; 2, quartzite.

Dimensions: Total length, 24-40 mm.
(estimated); maximum width, 15-25 mm.;
stem length, 7-10 mm.; maximum width of
stem; 7-9 mm.; maximum thickness, 3-4.5 mm.
Remarks:
Untyped 3 points share
certain morphological similarities with
Alba and Colbert types.
The Alba, however,
are distinguished by straight stem edges
and a straight or slightly convex base
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 263) and the Colbert are characterized by triangular or
fan-shaped stems (Webb, 1963: 180). The
blade attributes on the Alba, Colbert,
and Untyped 3 are essentially the same.

Description: Artifacts included in
this group are characteristically long,
slender, leaf-shaped tools. Bases are
either pointed or markedly convex.
Lateral edges are usually convex but irregular edges do occur. In most cases, workmanship is poor, although it varies considerably within the sample. Distal ends
on the better examples are rather sharp.
Material: 5, chert; 5, quartzite;
9, petrified wood.
Dimensions: Total length, 30-82 mm.;
maximum width, 12-32 mm.; maximum thickness, 7-14 mm.
Remarks: Two of these artifacts are

Description: Included in this group
are bifacially chipped artifacts of irregular shape which do not fit into the
previously-described categories. Each has
in common a deliberately chipped point.
One interesting specimen (Fig. 41, p) has
a markedly twisted blade. The base is
subtriangular and the lateral edges are
straight approximately one-third of the
total length, at which point the blade
makes a 90 degree twist and tapers toward
the tip. The result is a propeller-shaped
artifact with one rectangular and one
pointed end. One example (Fig. 41, r)
is bifacially thinned, but has a unifacially-beveled blade and a unifaciallytrimmed base.

CRUDE BIFACIAL IMPLEMENTS

Description: The bases on these
points are unworked and often consist of
the weathered cortex of the parent pebble.
Lateral edges are irregularly chipped,
though they taper to a rounded, or crudely
pointed distal end.
Chipping is exclusively percussion and is poorly executed.

Artifacts assigned to this category
are crude, percussion flaked items which
lack the symmetry found in the knife
category. Most, however are deliberately
pointed. They are divided into six
descriptive categories.

Material:
3, chert; 2, quartzite;
9, petrified wood.

Remarks:
Seven of these specimens
are made from flat pebbles and retain some
nodular cortex on both faces.

Description: These artifacts are
core tools that retain the unworked cortex surface of the pebble at one end.
They vary considerably in outline and
size but each has a bifacially chipped,
pointed end. All are percussion flaked
and the pointed end is usually dull.

The Bronson knives described by Jelks
(1964: 165, 166) are similar to some
Group 3 bifacial implements.

3, 41 MQ 4; 6, 41 MQ

Description: These artifacts bear
some resemblance to Perkin Pikes, but
differ in that they are apparently manufactured from split, rather than whole
pebbles. They are plano-convex in crosssection and all taper to a well defined
point, which is usually sharp.
One face
retains much of the weathered cortex surface on the proximal end and in many cases
across the base as well, while the opposite side exhibits a fresher, more altered
surface. The latter side is generally
flat.

MQ 5; 12, 41 MQ 6.
Description: These unique artifacts
evidently represent failures in the manufacture of projectile points.
They are
elongated, stemmed bifaces and due to the
coarse material from which they are made,
apparently could not be fashioned to the
desired shape or thickness.
The stems
are usually contracting, rarely parallel.
Many exhibit features such as thickened
portions on one or both sides caused by
repeated hinge fracturing during the
thinning process or rounded cortex surfaces that are too thick to serve as
adequate striking platforms. Some of the
latter examples exhibit batter marks made
in an attempt to thin the specimen.
Premature breakage of the core is also suggested in some instances. Most are
fashioned from whole pebbles and are
classic examples of the core industry;
a few, however, appear to have been made
from split pebbles.

points, knives, and crude bifacial implements are undoubtedly represented but
cannot be further separated because they
are broken.

1, 41 MQ 5; 9, 41 MQ 6.

Description: These stemmed drills
are made by altering the triangular blades
of arrow points; as a result, a marked
concavity occurs on each blade edge forming
the narrow drill point. Eight of the
specimens are complete, four of which have
extensively ground distal tips (Fig. 44,

arrow points.

Remarks: In addition to these examples,
an Alba arrow point (Fig. 39, g) exhibits
a smoothed distal tip but is otherwise
unaltered. The specimen is not included
in this group because the blade was not
reshaped into a drill point, although it
may very well have been used as a drill.

Description: These are irregularly
shaped bifaces altered to the extent that
it is impossible to determine if they represent the core or flake industries.
It is probable that both industries are
represented. Nine of these percussionflaked artifacts taper toward one end.
Remnants of the weathered cortex of the
parent pebble remain on one face of ten
examples.

CHAPTER IV
COMPARISONS
All of the reported sites are located
relatively low in the stream valleys.
The remains of each do not suggest great
antiquity. While the artifact yield at
all sites can be regarded as high, there
is little direct evidence to suggest that
these sites represent permanent villages.
Certain observations will support this
opinion. Sites 41 MQ 4 and 41 MQ 5 are
relatively small and the ceramic samples,
with one possible exception, are not large
enough to suggest that any one of the
formative occupations was very lengthy.
The only deviation from this hypothesis
might lie with the small, concentrated
midden in Area A of 41 MQ 6. Here, the
largest single sample of pottery was recovered. The midden was extremely localized and discrete, and in view of the
homogeneity of the artifacts recovered
from within and around it, it is regarded
as a single component feature. While
there was no physical evidence of a structure, the circular nature and discreteness
of the midden does raise the possibility
that one existed.
The occupation at 41 MQ 4 is basically
A small sample of sherds and
three arrow points was recovered from the
upper portion of the deposit, but this
material clearly overlaid the major portion of the occupation at the site. The
sherds are exclusively plain, sand-tempered
ware. Dart points represent the largest
single artifact category in the preceramic levels. Gary, Kent, and Palmillas
constitute the major types represented.
The greatest variety of dart points
occurred at this site.
Archai~.

The cultural deposit at 41 MQ 5 was
extensively mixed, although arrow points
and.pottery were found mainly in the upper
levels. Dart points were recovered from
throughout the fill but were more concentrated in the levels below those where
most of the pottery and arrow points were
found, Gary and Kent are the predominant
dart point types represented.
At 41 MQ 6, the findings not only
duplicated what was recovered at 41 MQ 4
and 41 MQ 5, but added some additional
information pertaining to a possible
cultural sequence. Here, the lower levels
were generally preceramic, although Area
A may be an exception. In Area B, ~lain,
sand-tempered pottery was found below
decorated, sand-tempered pottery and boneand grog-tempered ware. Caddoan and
Galveston Bay pottery were found in the
upper levels where arrow points were
clearly dominant over the dart points.
This lower stratigraphic position of the
grog- and bone-tempering categories was
not substantiated in Area A or in Area C,

but it is possible that the ceramic occupation in these areas was later than that
in Area B. It is also possible that the
findings in Area B were fortuitous, but
the occurrence of only plain, sand-tempered
pottery in 41 MQ 4 would suggest that it
was not. In addition, findings at Area B,
41 MQ 6 and at 41 MQ 4 are supported by
similar finding at Livingston Reservoir
(McClurkan, 1968: ms. in preparation).
Small drills, particularly those reworked
from arrow points, clearly show a late
position in the sequence, that is, they
belong to the assemblage containing arrow
points and decorated pottery.

.

Test excavations at Site 41 MQ 14
(located a short distance west of Site
41 MQ 4) by the Houston Archeological
Society, support the findings at the three
investigated by T.A.S.P. While analysis
of the 41 MQ 14 material is not complete,
the preliminary findings have been made
available to me. At the time of this
writing six 5-foot square units and three
2.5 by 5-foot units had been excavated.
Arrow points were confined to the upper
two levels of excavation and most of the
pottery (the majority of which is plain,
sand-tempered) occurred in the upper two
levels, although a few sherds were recovered from Levels 3, 4, and 5. The few
grog-tempered sherds were confined to the
upper two levels. Dart points occurred
throughout the six levels of excavation
and bifaces other than projectile points
were distributed fairly evenly throughout
the fill. (Charles Chandler, personal
communiaat'1on).
Generalizations about the findings
at the three sites are justified since a
clear separation in the artifactual
material is not possible due to the loose,
sandy matrix of these locations. Rodent
disturbances are clearly evident; in fact,
the industrious little animals continued
to work side by side and frequently in the
same unit with the excavators. It is
because of these disturbances that subtle
differences in vertical trends of certain
artifactual material should not be relied
upon too heavily. Horizontal distributional patterns of artifacts which are
represented from site to site are regarded
as more reliable evidence.
These general trends can be summarized
as follows:
1. The initial occupation at each
site is Archaic. It is characterized
chiefly by Gary, Kent, and Palmillas dart
points; crude bifacial implements other
than projectile points are more frequent
in the Archaic levels.

78

2. Ceramics, arrow points, and small
drills consistently show a higher position
in vertical distribution than do dart
points.
3. Plain, sand-tempered pottery is
the most dominant ware in each site
throughout the ceramic levels. Possibly,
the decorated, sand-, bone-, and grogtempered pottery were late additions to
the ceramic inventory.
The Archaic material from Conroe is
comparable to that from the southern area
of the La Harpe Aspect as defined by
Johnson (1962: 270) although the sequence
of projectile point stemming traditions
recognized in the La Harpe Aspect is not
duplicated. Of particular significance
is the absence of"dart point types that
would link this area to the Archaic
cultures located to the west, particularly
the Edwards Plateau Aspect. The reservoir
is located very near the western margin
of the eastern woodlands immediately east
of the Brazos River drainage, which is
the approximate eastern boundary of the
Edwards Plateau Aspect. Perhaps it is
this ecological factor, the woodlands,
that influenced which Archaic cultures
occupied this area.

like that from Conroe.
The virtual absence of Early Archaic
material in the collection could be
attributed to the relatively low position
which the sites occupy in the stream
valleys. It was suspected that earlier
sites might be found on higher or older
terrace remnants which, generally speaking, lie outside the reservoir boundary.
Recent investigations by Don Moore of
some of these localities have revealed
expanding stem- and side-notched projectile
points such as San Patrice and possibly
Big Sandy types (personal communication)
not found in any of the excavated areas.
The San Patrice and Big Sandy points are
regarded as Early Archaic (Wyckoff, 1968:
46). Thus, the Archaic material reported
here is not representative of the area as
a whole, but is felt to be representative
of the sites located relatively low in
the stream valleys. Archaic sites of an
earlier period do exist in the area, and
future explorations of these locations
would undoubtedly aid in establishing a
longer cultural sequence.

Galveston Bay area and therefore, this
construct is too inclusive to serve on a
finer level Qf comparison. Also, the
frequency of certain traits reveals some
significant differences between the
Galveston Bay and Conroe areas. My impression is that pottery is much more
common in the Galveston Bay area than at
Conroe and that the percentage of decorated
pottery (particularly rim sherds which
represent most of the Galveston Bay decorations) is much higher toward the latter
end of the Galveston Bay ceramic sequence.
Also, the frequency of projectile points
at Conroe reflects a major difference.
Stone projectile points are rare in the
coastal regions around Wallisville and
Cedar Bayou, but become more frequent in
the inland areas around Addicks and
Liberty. This, however, may simply be a
result of the lack of available material
in the coastal region.

The pottery felt to be intrusive from
the Caddoan area represents but a meager
percentage of the ceramics recovered.
Only one site, 41 MQ 6, produced identifiable Caddoan types, Pennington PunctatedIncised and Kiam Incised. Sherds with
free punctates, punctated-incised, incised
decorations, and a plain, carinated bowl
rim sherd were recovered and are considered
to be of Caddoan origin.
The majority of the pottery at
Livingston Reservoir, like Conroe, is
plain, sand-tempered ware (McClurkan,
1967: 74). However, more Caddoan pottery
was found there than at Conroe. Identifiable Galveston Bay pottery was practically non-existent--about what one
would expect in viewing the proximity of
Livingston to the Caddoan area.

CONCLUSIONS
The temporal span represented by the
artifacts recovered from the three excavated sites at Conroe extends from Late
Archaic to the Nee-American (Formative)
stage. The Archaic material is representative of the southern La Harpe Aspect
and although the eastern boundary of the
Edwards Plateau Aspect extends relatively
close to the Conroe area, none of the
artifacts could be related to this construct. During the Nee-American stage,
the Conroe area occupied ~ marginal position, both culturally and spatially,
between the Caddoan area to the north and
the Galveston Bay area to the south. The
amount of plain, sand-tempered pottery
certainly suggests that an irldigenoas
ceramic tradition was present, but it
never quite reached the sophistication
of these other traditions. The amount of
Galveston Bay pottery is small, but
Caddoan pottery is even less in evidence.
That Galveston Bay pottery is better represented is understandable considering
the proximity of the Galveston Bay area.
Assigning the most recent aboriginal
remains to a specific, or a general ethnic
group is not possible with the data at
hand. In the section labeled Ethnohistory,
it is noted that several groups, the
Bidai, Patiri and Akokisa may have occupied the Lake Conroe area. Available
information on their culture does not
contradict the archeological findings,
but it should be emphasized that evidence
of historic contact was not seen in the
Lake Conroe archeological material. The

80

Caddoan groups nearest the Conroe area
during historic times were the Hasinai,
Adai, and Eyeish (or Hais) (Newcomb, 1962:
Map 4). The Allen Focus has been attributed to the Hasinai as European trade
material has been recovered in Allen Focus
sites. In addition, the geographical
situation parallels that of the Hasinai
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 185).
Archeological material attributable to the
Eyeish or Adai is, however, vague although
Jelks suggests that the Angelina Focus
material might be attributed to them
(Jelks, 1964: 27ID). Identifiable Allen
or Angelina Focus pottery is not found in
the Conroe collection, and the identifiable Caddoan pottery present (Pennington
Punctated-Incised and Kiam Incised) represents the earlier Caddoan division,
the Gibson Aspect which is entirely prehistoric. It is primarily on this basis
that in this report the Conroe material
is not related to the Atakapan groups,
although the sites and artifacts recovered resemble defined Atakapan culture.
For example, the presence of ceramics
usually denotes a semi-sedentary way of
life but the ceramic samples were small.
Site 41 MQ 6 yielded the largest sample
of pottery. The large samp~e of projectile
points coupled with the animal bone of
deer, bison and beaver suggeststhat hunting
played an important economic role. There
was no physical evidence of agriculture,
although pitted stones and mialing slabs
hint of exploitation of wild foodstuffs
(consistent with the presence of burned
walnut shells). The milling slabs might
also be indicative of agriculture.
