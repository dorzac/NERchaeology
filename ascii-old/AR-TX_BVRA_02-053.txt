ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey of a 247 acre park in the city limits of
Madisonville, Texas (Madison County) was conducted in October 1997 by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas under Texas Antiquities permit
number 1898. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator and supervised the
project. The area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by
shovel testing. No evidence of prehistoric or historic sites was found in the project area.
A previous survey of the area prior to construction of Lake Madison by the Soil
Conservation Service in 1975 observed flakes and possible burned clay in what is the
current project area; however, this area was not relocated. Overall, the project area
consists of shallow soils and is very disturbed through construction of park
improvements. Should a site be present within the boundaries of the park its integrity is
most likely to be affected by one of the various forms of disturbance present in this area.
The final report is on file at the Division of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical
Commission (THC), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the City of Madisonville to conduct a cultural resources
survey of Lake Madison Park in central Madison County, Texas (Figure 1). The park is
247 acres in size. Lake Madison, constructed in the 1960s, was created from a dam
across Town Branch and is 80 acres in size; therefore, there are 167 acres of dry land
in the park boundaries. At the time of the current survey the park was being used by
local citizens and contained numerous improvements such as baseball fields, soccer
field, picnic areas, restrooms, and roads (improved and unimproved). The park area as
it existed during this survey is depicted in Figure 2. The project area is depicted on the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographical map, Madisonville (N3052.5W9552.5/7.5) dated 1963 (Figure 3).
The nearest water source is Town Branch. The main channel of this drainage
bisects the approximate center of the park and flows in a north-south direction with its
origin about 1500 meters to the north. This creek flows into the Navasota River to the
south. The close proximity of the project area to this creek makes it a likely location for
prehistoric or historic sites. In fact, flakes and possible burned rock had been found by
James E. Warren, archaeologist for the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), in a survey of
the proposed park area in 1975 (see Appendix I -Letter from the SCS to the SHPO).
His report has not been located at the SCS office or any of the state repositories where
these reports are often filed, and Mr. Warren does not have a copy. In an Lake
Madison Park Recreation Development and Erosion Control RC&D Measure Plan
prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
(1976:10) on file at the City of Madisonville, under the heading Historical and
Archeological Resources, the following statement is made regarding the results of
Warren's investigation:
The park area involved was surveyed by the SCS archeologist in March, 1975 for
evidence of historical and archeological resources. As a result of this survey, nothing of
historical significance was located, and only one area containing evidence of
archeological interest was found. A few flint chippings and some burnt clay were
discovered in the loose soil resulting from construction of a new baseball field in the
eastern corner of the park. This artifact-bearing area is not considered to be significant
or eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. A search of the
National Register failed to reveal any sites to be affected by the project. Due to the
dense cover of grass, trees, and litter it was impossible to assess the total potential for
cultural resources present.
Because of the presence of cultural materials in an area that was not examined
by shovel testing and the possibility of additional sites in the park area, it was
determined that a 100% Phase I pedestrian survey would be required before the City of
Madisonville would be able to construct additional improvements in the park. Therefore,
the City contracted with BVRA to perform this service

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Madison County is poorly represented in the archaeological record in terms of
numbers of site recorded. The project area is located in the Prairie Savanna
Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the
Department (now Division) of Antiquities Protection in Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6). As of
October 17, 1997, there were 24 recorded prehistoric and historic sites in Madison
County (TARL site records). These sites are categorized as prehistoric (10), historic
(5), multi-component (1), and isolated prehistoric finds (6). According to Kenmotsu and
Perttula (1993:11), Madison County contained 0.001 - 0.1 site per square mile and is
one of the counties with the lowest density of recorded sites in Texas.
It should be noted that although Madison County is located in the PrairieSavanna study region, as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), it is immediately
adjacent to the Southeast Texas planning region to the south and the Northeast Texas
planning region to the east (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6). Therefore, Madison
County probably shares cultural traits with these nearby regions.
Only one major survey involving Madison County has been conducted. In 1981,
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter 1982) conducted a cultural resources survey of the
Millican Project. The purpose of this investigation was to survey transects in order to
sample the cultural resources of the Navasota River Valley in Brazos, Grimes, Leon,
Madison, and Robertson counties. The data collected were used to assess the adverse
affects of four proposed reservoir alternatives prior to selection of the final reservoir site.
This project recorded sixteen cultural resource sites. Of this number, 6 are prehistoric,
3 are historic, 1 contained both prehistoric and historic components, and 6 consisted of
isolated prehistoric finds.
A check of the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series published by the
Department of Archeological Planning and Review, Texas Historical Commission,
revealed that only one survey was conducted in Madison County from 1987 through
1992. This study (Kotter 1988) found only one site; however, it was in San Jacinto
County. No major surveys have been performed in the county since that time (TARL
site files). The eight sites not recorded by the Millican project were recorded as a result
of professional surveys and individuals.
Prehistoric occupations in the region cover all time periods from Paleoindian
through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:44). There is no evidence, however, of historic Caddo sites in Madison County.
Previously recorded sites tend to be predominantly Late Prehistoric with several isolated
finds. The reader is referred to this comprehensive and well organized document for
additional information regarding the archaeological background for Madison County and
vicinity. Historic sites dating from the 19th century through the present are common in
the county and region.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 41.50 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 40 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 94 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 272 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:246). The
altitude varies from 200-370 feet. The project area is located on a tract of land that is
bisected Town Branch. Elevations vary from 290 feet along the lower creek terraces to
300 feet on the higher terraces away from this drainage.
According to the soil survey for Madison County published in 1994 (Neitsch
1994:Sheet 14), five soil types are found within the project area. They are Boonville fine
sandy loam (BoB), 1 to 3 percent slopes, Nahatche loam (Na), frequently flooded,
Robco loamy fine sand (RcB), 1 to 3 percent slopes, Tabor fine sandy loam (TaB), 1 to
3 percent slopes, and Zack fine sandy loam (ZaB), 1 to 5 percent slopes. Descriptions
of these soils as they are discussed in the soil survey follow, and they are illustrated in
Figure 4.
Booneville fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes: This is a very deep, very
gently sloping soil on uplands. It is usually found on the lower, slightly concave side
slopes or in broad, low, smooth areas. Individual areas are irregularly shaped or oval
and range from 30 to 200 acres in size. The surface layer of this soil is typically a
slightly acid, very dark grayish-brown fine sandy loam about 15 inches thick. The upper
part of the subsoil, from a depth of 15 to 24 inches, is medium acid, dark gray clay. This
soil is somewhat poorly drained and runoff is medium. Permeability is very slow, and
the available water capacity is moderate (Neitsch 1994:21).
Nahatche loam, frequently flooded: This is a very deep, nearly level soil found
mostly on flood plains along the smaller streams. A few areas are on flood plains along
rivers. This soil is flooded more often than once every two years for a few days.
Individual areas are mainly long and narrow and range from about 10 to 400 acres in
size. The surface layer of this soil is typically a slightly acid, very dark grayish-brown
fine sandy loam about 15 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil, from a depth of 15
to 24 inches, is medium acid, dark gray clay. This soil is somewhat poorly drained, and
runoff is medium. Permeability is very slow, and the available water capacity is
moderate (Neitsch 1994:37-38).

6

Robco loamy fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes: This is a very deep, very gently
sloping soil on concave side slopes, on small knolls, or near the head of drainageways
on uplands. Individual areas are generally irregular in shape and range from 5 to 250
acres in size. The surface layer of this soil is typically a strongly acid, brown loamy fine
sand about 8 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil, from a depth of 24 to 28
inches, is a medium acid, brownish-yellow loam that has streaks and pockets of very
pale brown loamy fine sand. This soil is moderately poorly drained and runoff is slow or
medium. Permeability is slow, and the available water capacity is moderate (Neitsch
1994:40).
Tabor fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes: This is a very deep, very gently
sloping soil on uplands. Individual areas are generally irregular in shape and range
from 15 to 200 acres in size. The surface layer of this soil is typically a medium acid,
brown fine sandy loam about 7 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil, from a depth
of 14 to 43 inches, is strongly acid, yellowish-brown clay that has reddish and grayish
mottles. This soil is moderately well drained and runoff is slow or medium. Permeability
is very slow, and the available water capacity is high (Neitsch 1994:43).
Zack fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes: This is a gently sloping soil on,
moderately deep to shale and located on broad and narrowly dissected uplands.
Individual areas are irregular in shape and range from 15 to 150 acres in size. The
surface layer of this soil is typically a medium acid, yellowish-brown fine sandy loam
about 7 inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil, from a depth of 7 to 24 inches, is
strongly acid. This soil is moderately well drained, and runoff is slow to rapid.
Permeability is very slow, and the available water capacity is moderate (Neitsch
1994:45).

The field survey was supplemented by a check of records housed at TARL and
an examination of archaeological site reports and other manuscripts. The records at
TARL were checked for a listing of known sites in the project area and vicinity. In
addition, all previous investigations in Madison County were identified. The Principal
Investigator did all background research.
The area was examined in the field by means of a Phase I 100% Pedestrian
Survey with William E. Moore acting as Principal Investigator. The field crew and
Principal Investigator walked the entire tract. Surface visibility was estimated to be
between 0-100%. In terms of prehistoric site location, the sandy terraces along both
banks of Town Branch are the areas of highest probability. Therefore, shovel tests
were concentrated along this drainage and the small tributaries or gullies of this
drainage, randomly across the project area, and in the area where prehistoric cultural
materials were reported during an earlier survey. The project area was divided into five
general areas (A-E), and these are discussed in the Results and Conclusions section
below. Local collector, Donald Barnes, reported finding artifacts in three areas of the
park. These were assigned the field designations Localities 1-3 and were shovel tested
in an effort to confirm the presence of a prehistoric site.
All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth and data
obtained from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix II). In all 70
shovel tests were dug, and each test was backfilled. Shovel tests were dug to clay.
Each test was 30 centimeters in diameter and varied in depth from 10 to 80 centimeters
below the existing ground surface. When exposure was favorable, the exposed surface
was examined in addition to shovel testing. Excellent exposure was present along the
unimproved roads that cross most of the park and an area of numerous erosional gullies
(Area C). These exposed areas were very carefully inspected for displaced or buried
cultural materials.
Soil descriptions were taken from Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil survey
published for the area (Neitsch 1994). This office is now referred to as the United
States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Field notes
were taken by the Principal Investigator. The project was aided by an engineering map
depicting the current and planned improvements, aerial photography of the area prior to
and after construction of Lake Madison, and the 7.5' USGS topographic quadrangle,
Madisonville. Color photography (35 mm prints) was taken at various locations across
the project area. No artifacts were observed or collected, and all notes and
photographs are on file at Brazos Valley Research Associates in Bryan, Texas. Copies
of the final report are housed at the Division of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical
Commission and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed the presence of lithic
debitage and possible burned rock near an existing ball field in 1975 in Area A.
Although this area was not considered significant by the Soil Conservation Service
archaeologist in a letter to the State Historic Preservation Officer (Appendix I), the
relocation of this possible prehistoric site was first priority of the current investigation.
Six shovel tests were excavated in the area where the cultural materials were found;
however, not one test produced artifacts. It is believed that this site is either very
ephemeral or has been destroyed through construction of the ball field. According to
David Evans, Assistant Supervisor for Public Works, this area had been greatly
disturbed through construction of the ball field. Topsoil had been pushed and some of it
was taken to other locations. The current ballpark was, in their words, a clay hill.
Three areas in the park were identified by former City employee, Donald Barnes,
as localities where prehistoric artifacts had been found. These were assigned the field
designation Locality 1, Locality 2, and Locality 3, and the Principal Investigator visited
each one with Mr. Barnes. Shovel tests were excavated in these localities in an attempt
to confirm the presence of prehistoric sites in these areas.
Locality 1 was described by Donald Barnes as an area along a tributary that
flows into Town Branch from the east where artifacts were found in the creek bank.
This area, located in Area A, was shovel tested, and no cultural materials were found. It
is believed that this tributary is in reality an erosional gully that carries runoff from the
uplands to the east. Small gravels and pieces of silicified wood were observed in the
creek bank. Locality 1 is believed to be a low probability area in terms of site
occurrence. Across the fence, out of the project area is an upland terrace. It is possible
that the artifacts reported by Mr. Barnes were transported from this landform during
heavy rains.
Locality 2 was described by Donald Barnes as an area (Area A) near the park
entrance in Area A where an isolated find, large dart point or biface, was found. This
area and the slope below were shovel tested with negative results. The soil was
compact and contained numerous small gravels. It is believed that the artifact found by
Mr. Barnes is an isolated find. If a site is present, it would be located on the top of the
landform to the east out of the project area.
Locality 3 was described by Donald Barnes as an area where several artifacts
were found on the surface (Area C). According to Mr. Barnes, he only found arrow
points (except for Locality 2) and no pottery. This area is very eroded and contains
several sizable gullies and an unimproved road. Shovel tests and an intensive surface
inspection failed to locate evidence of a prehistoric site. Considering the excellent
surface exposure it is believed that the artifacts reported by Mr. Barnes were isolated
finds.

10

Overall, the project area is viewed as sterile in terms of cultural resource sites.
Seventy shovel tests were excavated and not one test produced cultural materials.
Overall the project area is very disturbed through park construction, and it is unlikely
that in situ cultural materials are present in this area. In addition, most of the areas
tested contained relatively shallow soils overlying sterile clay, and much earth has been
pushed or removed due to construction. All areas were tested by shovel testing, and all
exposed areas were carefully examined by surface inspection. It is believed that the 70
shovel tests more than adequately covered the project area. Prior to the field survey
the terraces closest to the main channel of Town Branch were believed to be high
probability for prehistoric site occurrence. However, the survey revealed a highly
disturbed area with shallow soils common throughout the project area. It is now
believed that the entire project area should be defined as medium or low probability
areas. Therefore, the ratio of one shovel test to every 2.38 acres is considered more
than adequate coverage.
The amount of disturbance was documented through field investigation (shovel
testing and surface exposure), aerial photographs, and personal interview with Bobby
Webber, a City employee who remembers the park terrain prior to construction of Lake
Madison and the existing park improvements. Mr. Webber accompanied the Principal
Investigator on a tour of the park and pointed out the various means of disturbance such
as tree removal, earth pushing, and agricultural practices. Aerial photography revealed
a series of terraces in the area that were created for agriculture.
The five areas (A-E) have been disturbed in different ways and are described
below. Area A is the main part of the park in terms of improvements. This area
contains several ball fields, boat ramp, picnic area, parking lots, electrical lines, water
and sewer lines, public restrooms, storage sheds, and roads (improved and
unimproved). According to Mr. Webber, this area was more wooded in the past and
had been cleared prior to park construction that included pushing and scraping of the
existing ground surface. Only those areas near the park boundaries are likely to contain
undisturbed landforms.
Area B is a partially wooded terrace overlooking the lake to the west. This area
was originally more wooded, but has been used for agricultural practices (probably
corn) in recent times. The 1960 aerial photograph shows terraces in this area and more
woods than are currently present. Soils in Area B are shallow (15-60 cm). If any
cultural resources are present they would surely be disturbed by the clearing of trees
and cultivation methods. Since this area was initially regarded as the highest probability
area for containing cultural resources it received the most attention, and more shovel
tests were dug per acre in Area B than in any of the other areas in the park.
Area C is a relatively undisturbed area at the north end of the park. This section
of the park is heavily wooded but is disturbed through natural causes, mainly erosion.
Several large erosional gullies were observed throughout Area C, many of which are not
depicted on the project area map prepared by the City. Some of these are believed to
be very recent.

11

Area D is on the west side of the park and contains little in the way of park
improvements. However, a soccer field, storage shed, unimproved road, electrical line,
and water and sewer lines are present. According to Mr. Webber, this area used to be
wooded but was cleared for park construction. At the southern end of Area D near the
dam are artificially contoured slopes. The slopes were reworked so that rain runoff will
flow into the lake. There is very little chance of undisturbed materials in this area.
Area E is the extreme southern edge of the project area that includes the dam.
This area is totally disturbed through construction of the dam. Parts of this area have
also been reworked so that water runoff can flow back into the lake.
Regarding the availability of water in Town Branch, the consensus of local
informants is this stream contains water primarily following rains. Although it is springfed and pools of water may have been present in prehistoric times, it seems that Town
Branch can't be defined as a regularly dependable source of water except during the
rainy season.
It was originally believed that the T-1 terraces along Town Branch should be
considered high probability areas for prehistoric site occurrence. However, those areas
closest to the main channel are soils that are frequently flooded. It seems probable that
the only prehistoric sites on these terraces would be temporary. Also, there are no
deep sandy soils in the park area. Although sites in the area have been found in
shallow soils, permanent sites are typically found on sandy ridges containing deeper
soils. It is hypothesized that several factors combine to make the current project area
an unlikely area to contain undisturbed, significant cultural resource sites. These
factors are the large amount of disturbance (natural and artificial) throughout the park,
shallow soils, and intermittent nature of Town Branch.

12

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded cultural resource sites (prehistoric or historic) were
found in the project area. The locality where archaeologist James E. Warren reported
cultural materials was not found during this study. The three localities that, according to
Donald Barnes, produced prehistoric artifacts were also negative in terms of locating
cultural resource sites. It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there
are no significant cultural resource sites present in the 247 acre project area. Overall,
the tract is very disturbed, and any site present would probably lack in situ deposits.
As a result of this investigation, it is recommended that the City of Madisonville
be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. It is always possible that cultural
materials are missed during any cultural resources survey. Should additional areas
containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this report be discovered
during construction, the Division of Antiquities Protection must be notified immediately
and work stopped until the situation can be evaluated.
