Abstract
Gallegos Engineering, Inc., San Antonio, Texas is the lead agency for a proposed new
rehabilitation and nursing facility to be constructed on 4.97 acres in southeast San Antonio,
Bexar County, Texas. Gallegos Engineering contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations, LLC to conduct a cultural assessment of the tract. The tract is privately owned,
and development, to include infrastructure was entirely privately funded.
Although no public funding was involved that would require either an Antiquities Permit from
the Texas Historical Commission or federal review by the State Historic Preservation Officer,
the project is located within the jurisdiction of the City of San Antonio. Under the city’s Historic
Preservation and Design Section of the Unified Development Code (Article 635-630 to 35-634),
all new construction projects, regardless of funding must be reviewed by the city’s Historic
Preservation Officer (HPO). In that regard, a Scope of Work was submitted to the City for
approval before the cultural resources survey began, and this report of investigations was
reviewed by the city’s HPO.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area on
July 7, 2014, and 11 shovel tests were excavated. On July 11, 2014 archaeologists monitored
backhoe trenching operations and screened backdirt samples from eight backhoe trenches
excavated across the project area.
The only evidence of either historic or prehistoric cultural material observed either on or below
the surface consisted of concrete remains of two apparent dugouts and a concession
stand/restroom facility from a local neighborhood ballfield that was constructed and used in the
1950s and 1960s. These remnants were assigned archaeological site 41BX2018. In addition,
seven potentially historic structures were observed adjacent to the project area, and were
photographed.
Although interesting from an historic standpoint regarding the development of local
neighborhoods in this area of southeast San Antonio in the 1950s and 1960s, the concrete
structural remains of 41BX2018 have been fully documented during this investigation, and our
assessment was that they do not meet the criteria for nomination as neither a State
Archaeological Landmark, nor the National Register of Historic Places. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommended that no further investigations are warranted, and that construction of the
Southcross Rehab and Nursing Facility should be allowed to proceed as planned.
However, if any cultural resources were to be encountered during construction, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated.

Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) archaeologists conducted a thorough
pedestrian survey of the Project Area on July 7, 2014 and dug 11 shovel tests. Then, on July 11,
2014 archaeologists monitored backhoe trenching operations and screened backdirt samples
from eight backhoe trenches excavated across the project area. The survey was conducted under
the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas
Archeologists.

Project Setting
Geology
The local geology (Barnes 1982) within the project area is of Quaternary Alluvial Terrace
deposits (Qt), a combined depositional sequence of Austin Chalk (Kau), undivided Navarro and
Marlbrook Marl (Knb), Pecan Gap Chalk (Kpg), and Uvalde Gravels (Qtu). Edwards chert is
a common gravel component across the region, a result of down-cutting of the Edwards Plateau.
Edwards chert and the Uvalde Gravels both provided Native Americans a rich resource for lithic
tool production.
Soils
Development within the Project Area will impact Venus clay loame (VcA), commonly found
on gently sloping, smooth terraces 20 to 40 feet above the San Antonio River flood plain. The
typical pedon reveals limey clay in the upper roughly 16 inches (40 centimeters), underlain by
about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of clay loam (Taylor et al. 1991; Websoil Survey Online 2014).

Figure 5. Soils map of the Project Area.
Climate, Flora, and Fauna
The physiographic makeup of Bexar County is a combination of four distinct physiographic
regions of Texas: the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland Prairie, and the
South Texas Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 6). More specifically, the Project Area lies within a
transitional zone on the lower Balcones Escarpment region where it gives way to the Blackland
Prairie. As such, this micro-environmental zone can still be classified as upland prairie. In
addition, the Project Area lies within the Balconian vegetation area as defined by (Blair 1950;
Map 2014; Figure 7). The annual average rainfall is about 28 inches (77 centimeters), with 194
growing-season days per year (Taylor et al. 1991).
The Edwards Plateau physiographic region of Texas exists in the northern portion of Bexar

5

County where the group(s) which
occupied it were advantageously able
to exploit an ecotone encompassing
riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted
plants and animals. The Edwards
Plateau, with elevations reaching 2,250
ft. above mean sea level (amsl) in
northern Gillespie County (Allison et
al. 1975:76), is a hilly region, gradually
sloping to the southeast, and ending in
the escarpment running across the
middle of the sub-region (Figure 6).
The most common flora observed on
the plateau include juniper (Juniperus
ashei), plateau live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), and agarita
(Berberis trifoliata) (Blair 1950:112;
Van Auken 1988:45; Simpson 1988).
Due to overgrazing by livestock and
restricted range fires, much of the
plateau has been overtaken by juniper
in modern times (Buechner 1944:703704; Van Auken 1993:199-210).

Figure 6. Physiographic regions of Texas
(http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).

The Balcones Escarpment separates the
Edwards Plateau from the lower
blackland prairies to the east. It is a
fault zone, consisting of blocky
limestone, chalk, shale, and marl. The
escarpment slopes to the southeast from
about 700-1,000 feet above mean sea
level (Taylor et al. 1991:119). The most
economically important floral species
are riparian nut trees, including oak,
walnut, and pecan that thrive along the
rivers and creeks (Van Auken 1988:55).
The intertwined diversity in biotic
resources existing along the escarpment
provides an ecotone in which humans
could exploit a wide variety of plants
and animals from season to season
(Collins 1995:366; 2004). The presence
of prehistoric cemeteries found in areas

along the escarpment where seasonally rich food resources such as nut-bearing species,
particularly acorn and pecan trees, and prickly pear tunas may not be just a coincidence (Hall
1995:633-647).
The Blackland Prairie is a rolling and well-dissected plain representing the extension of the true
prairie that runs through the center of North America. The prairie was once dominated by
tallgrass species such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon
gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), and silveus
dropseed (Sporobulus silveanus). Oaks (Quercus species), elms (Ulmus), cottonwoods
(Populus), and native pecan (Carya illinoinensus) are common along the drainages.
The South Texas Plain is the western extension of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is a nearly level to
rolling plain that is moderately dissected by major river drainages through its northern half and
by numerous intermittent drainages, and the Bordas Escarpment in the south. It was originally
an open grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecans, and ash (Zanthroxylum fagara)
were common along streams (Black 1989:12; Hester 1980:31, 33).
Both the plains and the prairies have apparently undergone dramatic vegetational changes over
the past 300 years. Due in part to overgrazing and range-fire suppression, much of the original
vegetation has been replaced by woody invader species, transforming the grassland into what
we know today as the “South Texas Brush Country”, dominated by mesquite, huisache, granjeno
or spiney hackberry, brasil, lotebush, whitebrush, and cenizo (Black 1989:14-16; Hester
1980:34-37).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is located within South-Central Texas, and as such, prehistoric cultural
affinities most common to South Texas plains cultures and Central Texas/Edwards Plateau hill
country cultures are often manifested in archaeological sites near the Project Area (see Figure
8). The most basic chronology of the Central and South Texas regions can be divided into either:
(1) prehistoric cultural groups with no specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented
groups with a designated tribal or band name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries
arrived in Texas, the cultural activities of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who
inhabited the two regions can only be surmised from what we can glean from the archaeological
records at undisturbed, and well-documented sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed
firsthand by the Spanish soldiers and priests beginning in the late 1600s. The Spanish then began
recording in writing the names, numbers, and living conditions of the many groups of Native
Americans who lived in the regions. However, as we will discuss later in this section, there is
a significant transition era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups,
and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; that transition era occurs in the
1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.

The Prehistoric
Chronology
Based on research in
Texas over the past 70+
years, beginning with
professionals from the
University of Texas at
Austin, archaeologists
have been able to
segregate the prehistoric
period in Central and
South Texas into the
Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric
periods. Although other
archaeologists have
made significant
fou n d a t i on al
contributions to our
current understanding of
how past cultures
changed through time
(e.g., Story 1985;
Prewitt 1981), in our
opinion the most current Figure 8. Map of Central and South Texas Archaeological Regions
and widely recognized and Edwards Plateau.
chronologies are those
offered by Michael Collins (1995; 2004) for Central Texas, and Thomas Hester (1995; 2004)
for South Texas.
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
and South Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800
years ago (Collins 1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–436). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique,
fluted, finely flaked, and blade-shaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools
chipped on both sides, and unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from
river cobbles. Archaeologists have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such
as killsites, quarries, stone tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins
1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts
are fairly common in Central and South Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been
found south of Bexar County (Hester 1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the Project Area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
8

horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central and South Texas
archaeological sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into
what we commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the
Archaic has further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late
Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000 and
4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent until
much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the climate
began changing in Central and South Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:383).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
9

several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with our synthesis of the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans
inhabiting Central and South Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over
several hundred years. Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the
environment is questionable. In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the
two regions imply that change may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago, while Hester (1995) believes the Late Archaic traits seen in South Texas
archaeological sites may better be defined as between 2,400–1,300 years ago. The large cooking
ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned rock middens, intensified during the Late
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same
or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although the Native Americans of Central Texas still
sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly
cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue other food goods. Even though by about
1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison no longer predominated the now-dwindling
grasslands of Central and South Texas (Dillehay 1974), the Native Americans still hunted and/or
gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
Southcross Rehab area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because
of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels
until 1,000± years later (Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’
hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a
noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late Archaic. Keep
in mind that dart points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft with
a dart point attached to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It would not be until
perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for hunting in the region.
Late Archaic dart points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points, and the most
common dart points that are found within the area are what archaeologists call Ensor and Frio
types (Turner et al. 2011).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
10

Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the Project Area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or
Transitional Archaic”, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in South or Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central and South Texas regions
surrounding the Gardens at Pinnacle project area adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather
than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for
killing became much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts
arrow shafts carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have found Edwards
and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71).
Concurrently, excavations by professional archaeologists have provided evidence that Native
Americans began using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps
trading vessels from the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any
successful venture, the making of pottery was refined so that vessels were used more, and the
technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995;
Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens that we commonly call “Indian Mounds”, or burned rock middens in which they roasted
tubers nuts, and some game animals (see for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same
period, the inhabitants may have increased their dependence upon bison (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to South and Central
Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grassiness
in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor”
into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner
1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas during the
Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know that they began occupying the limestone
11

overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones
Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the
escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al.
1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967),
and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985).
Historic Period
Beginning roughly 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic missionaries, and
government officials encroached into what is today South and Central Texas in ever-increasing
numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in
both Central and South Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the two regions.
In Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. However, South Texas at the time was largely bypassed by early Euro-Americans
seeking permanent settlement. As such, the technology and lifestyles of the indigenous groups
in South Texas may have been affected by transient European influence, but today we can only
observe these changes in the archaeological record because the written accounts simply are not
available. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional
period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as
the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
12

Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in what is today Bexar County, in which Comanches brought hides, meat,
and tallow to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as
blacksmithing and gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic. The image of San Antonio as a metropolitan magnet has been enhanced
in a continuum ever since, from Texas’ evolution into statehood in 1846, through today.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area
The first officially recognized local (Bexar County) institution organized to promote an interest
in Texas archaeology was the Witte Memorial Museum, established in 1926. The Witte
continues to this day to promote to citizens of all ages the need to preserve our cultural
resources. Over 45 years ago, in the early 1970s, two other organizations were formed. The
Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio was born
in 1973. As the Center’s first director, Dr. Tom Hester sought to foster a hand-in-hand
relationship among amateur collectors, landowners, and professional archaeologists. As such,
he was instrumental in establishing the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) in
1973, a dedicated bunch of individuals who were (and still are) committed to documenting and
preserving archaeological sites throughout Bexar County and South Texas.
13

While we will never know for sure how many archaeological sites have been destroyed, or how
many still remain in Bexar County, we do know that professional and avocational archaeologists
have managed to document over 2,000 over the past 40+ years. Although it may seem odd that
there have been more sites recorded in Bexar County than in all its surrounding counties, and
the reader could presume that there are simply a whole lot more sites in Bexar, there are other
factors that influence the documentation of sites. For example, the largest city in the area is San
Antonio, and as such the city has many historic structures that qualify as archaeological sites that
skew the numbers in favor of Bexar County. Thanks to the city’s historic preservation office and
codes enacted by the city, many have been recorded over the years.
It also makes sense that the more pieces of property that archaeologists are able to examine, the
more sites are likely to be found. Most archaeological projects are undertaken because of Federal
and State Antiquity codes that require cultural resource surveys be conducted when public
money (tax dollars) are used for construction, such as highways, schools, prisons, etc. In
addition, military installations and the National Park Service (NPS) are required by federal law
to evaluate any cultural resources within their lands. Because of Bexar County’s explosive
population growth, many military installations, and the Spanish missions administered by NPS,
it seems reasonable that Bexar County should have more archaeological sites documented than
in the surrounding counties. In addition, professional and avocational archaeologists and
historians have been actively involved for many years in the county.
As shown in Figure 3, multiple cultural resources surveys have been conducted within one mile
(1,609 meters) of the current Project Area, resulting in multiple historic and archaeological sites
being recorded. The closest known site is 41BX270 – the Bustillo House. Around 1890,
Francisco and Martin Huizar Bustillo built and occupied this house, and it is the only remaining
house built before 1900 outside of Mission San José by descendants of the original land
grantees. Almost all of the land in this area at the time was still under cultivation.

Historic Maps and Aerial Photographs
In Figure 9, the Project Area is laid over an 1845 map of the vicinity (NARA 2014). At that
time, no structures are shown in the area. Notably, the map shows an unnamed ditch that coursed
west of the Project Area. Presumably, this would be an “acequia media”, or middle acequia
between Mission San José and the San Antonio River. According to I. Waynne Cox (2005),
Mission San José was likely re-located to the west side of the San Antonio River some time
before 1729, and construction of an acequia was begun. He surmises that the re-located mission
site was somewhere between present-day Mission Road and the river, and “This is somewhat
supported by evidence of an ‘acequia media’ between the later main San José acequia and an old
bow of the river since obliterated by rechanneling” Cox (2005:29). This may be the same ditch
or acequia that according to the National Park Service, about 300 meters of the abandoned
acequia were still visible in 1975, and almost all of the land behind the Bustillo House
(41BX270) was under cultivation and watered by the San José acequia (National Park Service
2014).

The 1903 United States Geological Survey (USGS 1903) map shown in Figure 10 indicates that
no structures were present within the Project Area at that time. However, notably it neither
shows the Bustillo House (41BX270) located at 238 Bustillo Drive.

A 1953 topographic map (USGS 1953) reveals that no structures were present within the Project
Area at that time, and East Southcross had been constructed (Figure 11).

17

By 1953, an aerial photograph (Figure 12) indicates that much of the Project Area was being
used as a baseball field (Aerials 1953). In fact, an adjoining property owner who visited the site
while we were conducting backhoe trenching revealed that his father, Richard (Rico) Guerrero,
coached teen baseball at the field in the 1960s (personal communication, Richard Guerrero, Jr.,
July 11, 2014). Notably, the photograph reveals probable structures associated with the baseball
field, and as will be discussed in the “Results” section below, archaeologists documented the
concrete remains of two apparent dugouts and a concession stand and/or restroom facility.

18

By 1966, the baseball field was apparently still being used (Figure 13; Aerials 1966).

19

Although the aerial photo shown in Figure 14 is blurred, it is apparent that by 1973, the baseball
field has been abandoned (Aerials 1973). As confirmation, Richard Guerrero, Jr. (Personal
communication, July 11, 2014) indicated that he was born in 1972, and he could not remember
a ball field being there, but his father often talked of coaching there in the 1960s.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The topics
addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric
theoretical framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and
social systems for the South-Central Texas region. The historic framework is structured around
the settlement along the Balcones Escarpment and adjoining Blackland Prairie as documented
in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests and government representatives, through
Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic survey
methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed previous archaeological
and historical reports of investigation, both in hard copy and online, that had been conducted in
the area in an effort to better understand the potential and types of cultural resources that could
potentially be encountered during the survey. In addition, soils and geological maps were
reviewed in order to evaluate the potential depths of archaeological deposits, and the types of
both historic and prehistoric features and associated artifacts that may be present.
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological Sites indicated
that the 4.97-acre tract had not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any
documented archaeological sites within it. However, there were known and documented
potentially significant prehistoric archaeological sites within one mile of the Project Area, and
it lies within an area of San Antonio that is rich in 1700s thru 1900s history.
Based upon modern aerial photographs, it could be surmised that the area of proposed
development may have been disturbed by modern development. However, without an
on-the-ground physical survey, the potential for intact and possibly significant archaeological
deposits could only be surmised.

21

The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the tract
was conducted. In addition, a shallow unnamed drainage that courses along the western edge of
the property was carefully examined (Figure 15). Surface visibility ranged from 10 to 100
percent across the area. Eleven shovel tests were placed in a systematic pattern across the area,
as were eight backhoe trenches (Figure 16). The results of shovel testing were fully documented
on Shovel Test forms, and are described in Appendix A. The shovel tests were dug in 20-cm
levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure 17).
Backhoe trenches were excavated in roughly 30-cm increments, and the sediments and soils
removed from the backhoe trenches were scrutinized by two archaeologists. In addition, a 5gallon bucket sample of each 30-cm increment was screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure
18). All backhoe trench walls were examined for potentially intact cultural deposits and features,
and the walls were photographed and briefly described.
Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests or backhoe
trenches were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled
shovel tests and backhoe trenches.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
A full pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility and the shallow
cutbanks along an ephemeral drainage on the western edge of the Project Area was conducted,
along with the excavation of 11 shovel tests and eight backhoe trenches (see Figure 16).
Typically deep and undisturbed sandy clay loam was observed along the intermittent drainage,
while significantly disturbed sediments and clay loams were observed in the shovel tests and
backhoe trenches in the upper, eastern portions of the Project area. The drainage appears to have
been artificially machine contoured in the recent past and subsequently filled with angular
limestone boulders to inhibit erosion (see Figure 15).
The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at the
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas, and may be made
available upon request. However, the results of shovel testing are also presented in Appendix
A. With the exception of Backhoe Trench 8, backhoe trenches were 5 meters long x 60
centimeters wide x 150 centimeters deep. As will be discussed below, the length of Backhoe
Trench 8 was extended to 10 meters in length in order to investigate a ‘possible’ desague (minor
irrigation ditch).
No evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed below the surface
in any of the shovel tests or backhoe trenches. However, the concrete remnants of what were
apparent dugouts and a concession stand/restrooms structure associated with a ca. 1950s -1960s
baseball field were observed on the surface. These remains were documented as archaeological
site 41BX2018, described further below.

Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT1) was positioned along the eastern edge of the unnamed drainage (see
Figures 16 and 18) so to investigate not only any archaeological deposits that could possibly
exist, but also the geomorphological profile of a possible T-1 terrace deposit. As discussed
above, sediments and soils were removed in 30-cm increments, they were examined as they were
removed, and a 5-gallon sample of each 30-cm level was screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
Although no cultural material was found, the profile of this 5-meter trench (Figure 20) revealed
apparently disturbed, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy clay with rounded limestone
pebbles and gravels from marble to baseball-sized, 2% by volume; highly fragmented snails
shell fragments; common grass rootlets, small tree roots, and worm casts in the upper 30
centimeters below the surface (cmbs). In addition, a concrete fragment similar to the constuction
material used in the modern elementary school north of East Southcross was found.

25

From 30 to 120 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), the Venus clay loam transitioned from
grayish brown to dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay with fragmented snail shells, few roots,
but with no pebbles or gravels; common slickensides, few coarse sand granules; very compact.
From 120 to 150 cmbs,
the soils gradually
transitioned to dark gray
(10YR4/1) clay with
highly fragmented snail
s h e l l s , occas i onal
rounded limestone
pebbles, and soft
calcium carbonate
masses; very compact.

26

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 was
situated on the eastern
edge of
what was
possibly a lower, T-1
terrace along the eastern
edge of an intermittent
drainage (Figures 20
and 21; see also, Figure
16). Soils in this area
revealed a typical pedon
of Venus clay loam.
That is, from
0 to 33 cmbs was
grayish brown (10YR
5/2) coarse sandy clay
with rounded limestone
pebbles and gravels
from marble to
baseball-sized, <5% by
volume; highly
fragmented snails shell
fragments; common
grass rootlets, small
tree roots, and worm
casts.

27

Backhoe Trench 3
Backhoe Trench 3 was
also excavated along the
eastern edge of the
intermittent drainage
(Figure 22; see also,
Figure 16). In this case,
we excavated the trench
to 150 cmbs (five feet)
within OSHA standards,
and documented the
south trench wall.
Following that, we
elected to dig deeper to
215 cmbs (7 feet) to
investigate deeper soils
and sediments. Without
entering the trench, we
examined the trench
walls and photographed
them from above. In
sum, we found no
changes in the lower 65
cm than what we had
observed in the lower
portions of BHTs 1 and
2.

28

Backhoe Trench 4
BHT 4 was placed in the eastcentral, upper portion of the PA,
where shovel testing attempts
could not penetrate the existing
pavement (Figures 23 and 24;
see also, Figure 16).
As shown in Figure 25, the
backhoe penetrated nearly 30
cm of pavement and road fill
before encountering gray,
compacted light brownish gray
(10YR6/2) clay with
slickensides, and highly
fragmented snail shells from
roughly 30 to 75 cmbs. Below Figure 23. Excavating BHT 4; facing southwest.

excavations revealed grayish brown to
dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay
with fragmented snail shells, with
common slickensides, few coarse sand
granules; very compact.

29

Backhoe Trench 5
As shown in Figure16,
BHT 5 was placed in
the southeastern portion
of th e P A. The
southwest wall of BHT
5 is shown in Figure 25.
The upper 30-35 cm
consisted of grayish
brown (10YR6/2) clay
loam, with machine
fractured angular, as
well as rounded
limestone gravels to
baseball size, <5% by
volume,
and
fragmented snail shells.
Below that, from about
35 to 70 cmbs is
grayish brown clay,
once again with highly
fragmented snail shells
and calcium carbonate
threads and fines. From
70 to 105 cmbs is gray
(10YR6/1) clay with
common calcium
carbonate masses. The
lower portion, from 105
to 150 cmbs is white
(10YR8/1) caliche.

30

Backhoe Trench 6
Backhoe Trench 6 was
placed in the
northeastern portion of
the PA (see Figure 16).
The north wall of BHT
6 is shown in Figure 26.
The upper 35-40 cm
consisted of pavement
and road base, before
encountering the
underlying grayish
brown (10YR6/2) clay,
with fragmented snail
shells, and an
occasional rounded
l im es t one pebble;
slickensides, massive
structure. Below that,
from about 120 to 150
cmbs is light brownish
gray (10YR6/2) clay,
with highly fragmented
snail shells, calcium
carbonate threads and
fines, and few calcium
carbonate masses.

31

Backhoe Trench 7
This trench was placed
in the vicinity of what
would have been the
pitcher’s mound on the
old baseball field
(Figure 27; see Figures
12 and 16).
As shown in Figure 28,
the upper 25-30 cm
consisted of reddish
brown (2.5YR5/4)
coarse, clumped sand,
not unlike the sand
m i x t u re used on
modern baseball
infields. Below that,
from about 30 to 105
cmbs was grayish
brown (10YR5/2) clay
with both whole and
fragmented snail shells,
calcium carbonate fines
that increased with
depth; slickensides,
very compact. From
105 to 150 cmbs, the
soil
smoothly
transitioned to light
brownish gray
(10YR6/2) clay with
common calcium
carbonate small masses,
and few rounded
limestone pebbles.

32

Backhoe Trench 8
This trench was positioned
along the south-central edge of
the Project Area (see Figure
16). It is the only trench that
was excavated beyond 5 meters
in length due the discovery of a
mesquite tap root, that before it
could be fully examined, was
considered to be a possible
post. Post and cedar lined
acequias in San Antonio were
not uncommon in 19th century
(e.g., Nickels et al. 1996), so in
this case an extended trench
was warranted in order to rule
out the possibility that a lined
irrigation ditch once existed on
this portion of the property.
Upon close examination, the
mesquite trap root exhibited a
relatively fresh rind, and no
evidence of an infilled ditch
was observed in any of the
backhoe trench walls. As
shown in Figure 29, the
mesquite tap root extended
from about 15 cm below the Figure 29. South wall profile of BHT 8.
modern ground surface to 95
cmbs, extending through grayish brown (10YR5/2), largely clodded clay with common
fragmented snail shells and calcium carbonate fines. Below that, from roughly 95 to 135 cmbs,
dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay with common calcium carbonate fines and threads was
observed. In the bottom 15 cm of the trench, the clay was mottled with white (10YR8/1) caliche
and soft calcium carbonate masses.
Personal conversation with Mr. Richard Guerrero, Jr., (July 11, 2014) an adjacent landowner,
revealed that the immediate area has periodically been cleared of small mesquite trees and brush
in the recent past.

Archaeological Site 41BX2018
Description
This site is
situated on a
gently sloping
upland area
within an older
neighborhood of
San Antonio,
that in the 1800s
and 1900s was
most probably
cultivated fields
before local
residents
constructed a
baseball field on
it in the 1950s
(Figure 30; see
also, Figure 12).
From that time
forward, the
site has been Figure 30. 41BX2018 site map.
cleared of the
natural mesquite,
huisache,
and
herbaceous weeds and
grasses that would
otherwise overgrow the
site. An intermittent,
machine-channeled
drainage courses some
50 meters west of the
site.
Levels of Effort and
Results
As shown in Figure 30,
archaeologists
excavated 11 shovel
tests and five backhoe
trenches on and around
Figure 31. Photo of 41BX2018; facing southwest from center field

described previously,
the results of backhoe trenching and shovel yielded evidence of disturbance in the upper 15-35
34

cm, but no evidence of cultural
material. During a surface survey of the
site archaeologists observed no
prehistoric or historic cultural material,
only modern glass and plastic.
However, as shown in Figure 30, 32
and 33, the concrete remnants of what
were likely two dugouts, and what was
likely the foundation for a concession
s t and / r es t room faci l i t y were
documented. The dugout foundations
measured 5½ feet x 18 feet, while the
concession stand/restroom concrete
slab measured 12 feet x 28 feet.
While archaeologists were conducting
backhoe excavations on the site, a local
resident visited with us and conveyed
that his father, Richard (Rico) Guerrero
was a local contractor who helped build
this ballfield and others in this area of
San Antonio. His father also coached
teen baseball at this field in the 1950s
and ‘60s, but the ballfield no longer
existed in the 1970s (personal

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Although interesting from an historic standpoint regarding the development of local
neighborhoods in this area of southeast San Antonio in the 1950s and 1960s, the concrete
structural remains have been fully documented during this investigation, and our assessment is
that they do not meet the criteria for nomination as neither a State Archaeological Landmark,
nor the National Register of Historic Places. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that no
further investigations are warranted, and that construction of the Southcross Rehab and Nursing
Facility should be allowed to proceed as planned.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility, along with the
examination of 11 shovel tests and 8 backhoe trenches within the project area was conducted,
but no evidence of either prehistoric nor historic occupation was found beneath the surface. The
only evidence of cultural materials were the concrete remains of two dugouts and a concession
stand/restroom facility on a baseball field constructed in the 1950s and used through the 1960s
(41BX2018).

36

In sum, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
