ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

First and foremost, this study is dedicated to the numerous avocational
archaeologists who share my enthusiasm for understanding the past, have selflessly
provided information regarding many of the sites and collections presented here,
helped with fieldwork, and provided places to stay.

I also thank them for their

willingness to part with artifacts for many different types of analysis.

These

individuals include Ronnie Bowles, Lance Bussard, John Erickson, Mike Gilger,
Kimmie Karber, Bob Kerns, Alvie Laverty, Alvin Lynn, Doug and Raymond
McGarraugh, Bobby Nickey, Joe Rogers, Philip Terrel, Russell Tibbetts, Doug
Wilkens, Danny Witt, and Tony Yates. I greatly appreciate the patience and trust that
all of you have shown me; I hope this study meets your approval. I also wish to thank
Forrest and Ellen Yates of El Reno, Oklahoma and Dickie Yates of Beaver, Oklahoma
for permission to conduct fieldwork at Odessa Yates from 1998 to 2000.
Without a doubt, some of my most enjoyable experiences have been spent
discussing research with friends and colleagues. In addition to the individuals listed
above, I would like to thank Mary Adair, Tim Baugh, Steve Black, Don Blakeslee,
Doug Boyd, Brett Cruse, Tim Earle, Adam Graves, Brian Hayden, David Hughes,
Paul and Susana Katz, Mark Latham, Chris Lintz, Lauren Ritterbush, Donna Roper,
H.C. Smith, John Speth, Martin Stein, Scott Sundermeyer, Pete Thurmond, and Rain
Vehik for their research, input, and encouragement throughout this process.

iv

In

particular, I greatly appreciate the many rewarding conversations I have had with my
closest friends Tod Bevitt, Casey Carmichael, and David Maki. Thank you for your
constant help and encouragement.
Special thanks go to the Oklahoma Archeological Survey and its entire staff
(Lois Albert, Leland Bement, Bob Brooks, Kent Buehler, Richard Drass, Marjy
Duncan, Larry Neal, and Lisa Stambeck) for research and office space, part-time
employment, use of field and laboratory equipment, access to comparative collections,
and friendly advice. Likewise, I also wish to thank Jeff Indeck, Rolla Shaller, and
Millie Vanover of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas and Don
Wyckoff and Peggy Rubenstein of the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural
History in Norman, Oklahoma for access to collections and records and for permission
to conduct specialized analyses on materials housed at these institutions.
Field investigations at Odessa Yates and Buried City were greatly improved by
geophysical surveys conducted by David Maki and Geoff Jones of Archaeo-Physics
L.L.C. of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

I love working with you guys and greatly

appreciate your much needed help and recommendations. Along similar lines, Steven
Shackley of the Berkeley Archaeological XRF Laboratory, University of California
completed all of the obsidian source provenance analyses reported here. Katherine
Spielmann of Arizona State University and Regge Wiseman provided assistance in
identifying Southwestern ceramics. Richard Drass studied all of the flotation and
wood samples from Odessa Yates and Buried City. Sheila Savage analyzed the faunal
remains from Buried City presented here. Pipestone sourcing was completed by
James Gunderson of Wichita State University.

v

Financial support for this study was obtained from numerous sources. Two
archaeological field schools at Odessa Yates and another at Buried City were cosponsored by the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Archeological Survey.
Several grants for fieldwork and analysis on the Odessa Yates project were obtained
from the Courson Family of Perryton, Texas. The Courson’s have also funded all of
the fieldwork and analysis at Buried City and I am extremely grateful to them for their
continued support. Two field seasons of pedestrian survey in the Oklahoma panhandle
were funded by National Park Service grants obtained by Leland Bement. Artifact
source analyses were funded by several grants obtained through the University of
Oklahoma Graduate Student Senate and another from the Council of Texas
Archaeologists.
Perhaps most importantly, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to Susan
Vehik for providing an office for writing and analysis when I most needed it,
encouragement and sage advice throughout this study, and overseeing this project to
its completion. Additional thanks go to the remainder of committee (Bob Brooks,
Paul Minnis, Joshua Piker, and Karl Rambo); their input and recommendations have
greatly improved this study. Leland Bement and Tim Earle also read portions of this
manuscript and provided many helpful comments. I wish to thank my wife, Lisa, and
two sons, George and Griffin, who have provided much needed support throughout
this research and continue to tolerate my obsessive behavior. Lastly, I would also like
to thank my parents, Duane and Nancy Brosowske, who have always encouraged and
supported me in everything that I do.

ABSTRACT

The Southern High Plains is a vast semiarid environment characterized by
erratic climate conditions and incongruent resources distributions. Prior to A.D. 1250
the region was inhabited by small groups of mobile foragers. Except for the transfer
of some high quality tool stone, evidence for exchange between these societies is
extremely meager suggesting that important resources were obtained through
residential mobility. The onset of the Middle Ceramic period around A.D. 1250 was
marked by the sudden appearance of Plains Village tradition societies who occupied
permanent settlements and practiced subsistence economies based on foraging and
horticulture. Settlements of the period vary from single family homesteads to villages
containing 250 people. The large numbers of habitation sites documented for the
period indicate that the region experienced a dramatic increase in human populations
at this time. Coinciding with these significant cultural changes, the Middle Ceramic
period also witnessed the emergence of widespread exchange networks. This study
examines this development and its meaning in small-scale societies of the region.
Durable goods obtained through exchange can be described in a number of
ways including the distances which items were traded and their function or meaning in
society. In this study, utilitarian items, particularly chipped stone tools produced from
high quality materials, are the most abundant exchange items documented. These
objects were regularly traded over distances of 100 to 300 km. Nonutilitarian items,
including jewelry produced from marine shell and precious stone, smoking pipes, and
elaborately decorated ceramics were also obtained from communities located 350 to
550 km away.

Given the distances involved, the latter objects are assumed to

xix

represent status or prestige items. While nonlocal utilitarian items are widespread
throughout the region, status items are notably concentrated at a few communities.
A political economic perspective, which envisions exchange as an activity
embedded in broader social, economic, and political institutions, provides the
theoretical foundation for understanding the alternative roles that exchange played in
small-scale societies that inhabited the region. By necessity, a contextual perspective,
which emphasizes both spatial and temporal parameters, is employed to investigate the
interrelationships that existed between exchange and broader realms of social life.
This study concludes that initially exchange was regional in scope and
provided access to utilitarian items among recently settled populations. Although
temporal trends are not well understood, exchange was later elaborated by a few
communities and involved the procurement of utilitarian and nonutilitarian objects
through long-distance trading expeditions to settlements outside the region.
Importantly, this expansion was also accompanied by the appearance of other key
developments including land tenure systems, intensified economic production, and
regional trade centers.

Altogether, these trends are interpreted as evidence for

increasing social complexity and the emergence of local leaders who encouraged and
organized these activities.

Support for this interpretation is derived from the

ethnographic record which demonstrates that the subsistence economy and exchange
frequently provide important avenues by which emergent leaders distinguish
themselves above other members of society. In this study exchange is seen as serving
a dual role that simultaneously brought prestige to local leaders and enhanced the
status and well-being of the communities they represented.

CHAPTER ONE

Introduction

Exchange is a complex and multifaceted activity. While exchange plays a
crucial role in initiating and sustaining interpersonal relationships, it is equally
apparent that the obligatory rules underlying exchange are intricately interwoven into
a much broader range of cultural norms, behaviors, and activities. The recognition
that exchange is embedded in the fabric of social life stresses the fact that it is an
activity that cannot be studied in isolation from the larger social context in which it
takes place (see Dalton 1977; Earle 1982, 1994; Malinowski 1922; Mauss 1967;
Polanyi 1957; Sahlins 1972).

Given the numerous constraints imposed by the

archaeological record, the significance of the contextual setting is especially
important for the study of prehistoric exchange.
The primary goal of the present study is to understand the development of
exchange between small-scale societies.

Archaeologists are constrained by

limitations in the material record for documenting and studying prehistoric exchange.
This study is no different, and by necessity, the movement of durable objects serves
as the primary evidence for investigating intersocietal interaction and exchange.
Here, the Early and Middle Ceramic periods (A.D. 500-1500) of the Southern High
Plains are investigated to document a situation where initially the transfer of material
items among resident societies was extremely limited. Later, exchange expanded
dramatically in a short period of time to include all societies of the region. As such, it

1

may be more appropriate to assert that the florescence of exchange is the topic of this
study.
Early Ceramic period (A.D. 500-1200) societies of the Southern High Plains
are characterized by: a) settlement patterns consisting of dispersed family groups, b)
subsistence economies dominated by broad spectrum foraging, c) material
assemblages that indicate an emphasis on locally available resources, and d) a rarity
or absence of trade items. While it is obvious that human societies are never entirely
isolated, the above evidence provides the principal data to conclude that Early
Ceramic societies of the region were largely economically autonomous.
Shortly thereafter, during the subsequent Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 12001500), the material evidence for exchange increased rapidly to astonishingly high
levels and appears to have linked all communities within the region. Importantly, the
emergence and florescence of exchange coincided with the appearance of a number of
other equally significant cultural developments. Items involved in exchange at this
time vary considerably from settlement to settlement, although subsistence related
objects are by far most common. For example, while evidence for exchange is
essentially nonexistent during the Early Ceramic period, following A.D. 1200 many
Middle Ceramic settlements are characterized by chipped stone assemblages where
80 to 90% of all tool stone was imported from sources 100 to 300 km distant.
While items linked to subsistence were most widely traded, items used to
display status were also obtained from communities 300 and 600 km away. In
general, these objects occur at nearly all Southern High Plains settlements, but in
extremely low frequencies (i.e., <10 items).

2

In contrast, several thousand such

exotics have been recovered at three settlements: Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock
Ruins 51, and Odessa Yates. Although understanding the social, economic, and
political implications of those vast discrepancies in prestige item distributions are an
important dimension of this study, it represents just one aspect of exchange that is
explored.
Previously, exchange research on the Great Plains has concentrated almost
exclusively on

relationships

described

ethnohistorically

between

sedentary

horticulturalists and nomadic bison hunters (see Baugh 1982, 1991; Ewers 1968;
Lintz 1986a, 1991; Speth 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983, 1991; Spielmann et al. 1990;
Wood 1980). Central to these models are: a) interaction between societies with
contrasting settlement patterns and subsistence economies, b) the central position that
food products played in exchange, and c) the development of exchange as a risk
reduction or buffering strategy.

In the present study exchange between

horticulturalists and horticulturalists as well as between horticulturalists and foragers
are the topics of study. All of these societies are characterized by sedentary or semisedentary lifestyles. Although the transfer of food products undoubtedly occurred in
some instances, for numerous reasons these items are seen as playing a minor role in
the emergence and expansion of regional and interregional exchange relationships.
Overall, the archaeological record of the Early and Middle Ceramic periods of
the Southern High Plains is of interest because it presents a situation where local and
long-distance exchange expanded quickly and in dramatic fashion. For these reasons,
it is proposed that from a methodological and theoretical standpoint the region
presents an ideal case study for isolating those factors which led to the development

3

or florescence of exchange among small-scale societies. However, the ability to
document the movement of trade items does not in and of itself produce models of
social interaction, this requires an interpretive framework to guide research and
explanation (Schortman and Urban 1987:51).
Traditionally, political economy is associated with the study of state-level
societies.

However, as many have demonstrated, the interrelationship between

political and economic institutions is also strongly developed in many nonstratified
societies (see Cobb 1993; Earle 1982, 1991, 1994, 2002; Johnson and Earle 2000;
Malinowski 1984; Mauss 1967; Polanyi 1957; Sahlins 1968, 1972). With this study’s
emphasis on the development of local and regional exchange networks, the
subsistence economy, and sociopolitical organization, it is apparent that this work is
heavily influenced by models developed and applied by political economists.
Following a discussion of fundamental anthropological terms and concepts related to
exchange, Chapter Two presents an evolutionary framework which examines the
changing role of exchange in human societies of varying social, economic, and
political scales (see Earle 1994; Johnson and Earle 2000).

These discussions

highlight the role of the economy, of which exchange is a part, in strategies to attain
prestige, power, and authority.
Given the substantivist assumption that the economy is embedded in the larger
social milieu of traditional societies, it is crucial that this study establish the
contextual setting for the developments examined here. Considering that the purpose
of the investigation is to examine the development and florescence of exchange, the
contextual setting must include both temporal and spatial dimensions. Combined,

4

Chapters Three and Four provide this information. Chapter Three introduces the
natural environment of the study area.

These discussions document a physical

landscape where natural resources vary considerably in distribution and abundance
across both space and time. The social context of the Southern High Plains is
presented in Chapter Four. The primary emphasis of that chapter is on Middle
Ceramic period (A.D. 1250-1500) societies of the region, although brief overviews
are also presented for neighboring regions. To provide an evolutionary perspective to
the development of exchange the preceding Early Ceramic period (A.D. 500-1200)
groups are also examined. Generally speaking, this information is largely culture
historical in scope, but introduces the reader to most of the major players involved in
regional and extraregional exchange. Altogether, Chapters Three and Four establish
the natural and social environment for the time periods of interest and provide the
contextual information necessary for reconstructing the structure of local exchange
systems that developed during this time.
As Earle (1982) has noted, the process of describing exchange involves three
interrelated steps: a) to source trade items, b) to describe the spatial distribution of
trade items, and c) to reconstruct the organization of exchange. The first of these
steps is accomplished in Chapter Five. Here, major trade items documented for the
region are presented and their source areas identified. The spatial patterning of these
objects at settlements of the study area is presented in Chapter Six. Despite some
limitations in existing data sets, the results of this analysis provide a thorough
overview of the distribution and frequency of trade items among communities of the
region.

5

Chapter Seven examines a number of topics frequently considered by political
economists. Comparative analyses presented in this chapter provide evidence for
competition, resource control, economic intensification, and redistribution of
resources among settlements of the region. Examination of these subjects provides
important insights into the relationship that existed between local subsistence
economies and exchange. It is apparent that these trends are generally thought to
occur under conditions of increasing social complexity.
Drawing on information provided by earlier chapters, Chapter Eight models
the evolution of exchange among Middle Ceramic period societies of the Southern
High Plains.

Although some overlap is apparent, trade items of the region are

discussed in terms of their relationship to either the subsistence or political spheres of
the economy (see Bohannan 1955; Dalton 1977; Earle 1994; Johnson and Earle
2000).

These discussions document exchange as an activity that expanded

incrementally to procure objects at greater and greater distances.

As exchange

expanded, the goods obtained also reflect a shift in emphasis from the subsistence to
political realms. It is argued that these trends are closely linked to the social and
economic developments discussed in Chapter Seven and mark the appearance of local
leaders who used these activities to establish and solidify their social standing. To
illustrate the interrelationship between economic and political systems, a basic
understanding of politics among small-scale societies is essential. This perspective is
provided by contemporary societies documented in the ethnographic record and
demonstrates that economic strategies play a crucial role in the political activities of
emerging leaders.

6

This study documents the growth of political behavior in human societies.
Previously, political economists have tended to concentrate their efforts on stratified
societies (Cobb 1993).

In these studies, coercion, ideological systems, and

institutional control of the economy are often presented as primary pathways to
power.

However, given the numerous constraints that limit the development of

marked social inequalities among small-scale societies, realistically, most of these
strategies are seldom observed outside the context of complex chiefdoms or states. In
the case study examined here, intensification of the subsistence economy and
exchange offered viable and socially acceptable strategies to politically ambitious
individuals.

Thus, while every case is unique in its own right, it is suggested that

these basic trends likely lay at the heart of emerging social complexity in all smallscale societies.

CHAPTER TWO
The Anthropology of Exchange

Generally, exchange denotes the transfer of goods or commodities between
individuals. In this manner, exchange means much the same as trade, and the two are
often used interchangeably. In a broader sense, however, exchange also has a wider
meaning and refers to all interpersonal contacts. Here, all social behavior can be
viewed as an exchange of both material and non-material goods.

In this sense

exchange also includes the exchange of information. In addition, even though trade
often signifies the movement of goods between persons from different social units
(i.e., external exchange), the fact that transactions also regularly occur among
individuals within a given society should not be overlooked (i.e., internal exchange).
In the ensuing chapter a number of fundamental terms, concepts, and ideas
related to the study of exchange are presented. After a brief introduction, traditional
modes of exchange (i.e., reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange) as identified
by Polanyi (1957) and Sahlins (1972) are reviewed. Although important, these terms
are less useful when examined in isolation. As such, the placement of exchange
within an evolutionary perspective is necessary to emphasize the idea that the function
and meaning of exchange can only be comprehended when viewed within a larger
social context (i.e., Johnson and Earle 2000). These discussions highlight the idea that
exchange among traditional societies can be split into two broad spheres: subsistence
and political (Earle 1994). This simple dichotomy is useful for stressing the dynamic,
and at times, contradictory role that exchange can play in the process of culture

8

change.

Overall, this chapter lays the groundwork for a study that examines

intersocietal exchange in nonhierarchical societies and its role in the emergence of
sociopolitical complexity.

Introduction to Exchange
Clearly, Marcel Mauss’s (1967) The Gift has had one of the most profound and
influential impacts on our understanding of exchange in traditional societies. Mauss
(1967) recognized that in most societies lacking monetary systems, the fabric of social
relations is bound together by a series of gift exchanges.

In these societies,

interpersonal relationships are typically initiated and underwritten by the giving of
gifts. Indeed, “if friends make gifts, gifts make friends” (Sahlins 1972:186). In these
transactions the gift does not represent a payment, but rather is a symbolic gesture that
imposes an obligatory bond on each of the parties involved, especially on that of the
recipient. For acceptance of the gift implies the obligation of repayment by another
gift of equal or greater value at a later date.
Equally influential has been Bronislaw Malinowski’s (1922) Argonauts of the
Western Pacific. Here, Malinowski (1984) describes an exchange network known as
the Kula among inhabitants of the Melanesian Islands. In this system, relationships
among exchange partners are established and cemented by the exchange of valuable
objects, most commonly shell. Although exchange among chiefly leaders focuses on
ceremonial gift giving, the transfer of foodstuffs and utilitarian items also occurs.
Overall, Kula exchange is subject to similar obligatory rules of gift giving as described
by Mauss.

9

In the Kula, two different types of shell (i.e., beads and Abalone) are
ceremonially exchanged between trade partners. Formal social rules dictate that beads
are always traded for abalone. In Kula exchange, trade is regular, such that individual
shells are not held in the possession of one person for very long before they are traded
again. Another feature of interest is that some of the particularly exceptional shells
develop reputations for their beauty and are highly prized and sought after by all. As a
result, the acquisition of these shells through calculated exchange brings much
prestige to the owners and their respective group. To better relate the social value of
these items, Malinowski (1984:89-91) compares these particular shells to national
treasures or heirlooms such as Britain’s “Family Jewels,” the “Hope Diamond,” or
Vincent Van Gogh’s painting “Sunflowers.”
In the examples presented above, it is emphasized that in many traditional
societies the recipient of a gift is obligated to reciprocate by giving an item of equal or
greater value. Equally important, however, is the idea that the giver or donor gains
status and prestige both through their generosity and the scale of the gift.

The

significance of this side of exchange is amply demonstrated by the fact that in many
societies gift giving often takes place in carefully orchestrated public displays that
serve to accentuate the generosity of the donor. Perhaps the best-known examples of
such displays are the lavish ceremonial gift exchanges of New Guinea societies (e.g.,
Feil 1984; Meggitt 1972, 1974) and potlatches of the Northwest Coast groups (e.g.,
Piddocke 1965; Suttles 1960). Indeed, in many societies positions of leadership are
often achieved and reinforced by extravagant gift giving and by the incurring of debt
on others (Hayden 1995).

10

Exchanges or gift giving, such as those outlined above, however, are closely
related to a whole series of other social obligations and activities including friendship,
alliances, providing marriage partners, feasting, and other communal activities.
Although socially complex, extensive, and intertwined, the tie that binds all of these
activities is the fact that they are subject to the same obligatory or reciprocal rules as
gift giving. That exchange plays an important role in many, if not all, of these
activities emphasizes the point that exchange is embedded in a much larger social
realm and is not just an economic transaction.
Reciprocal Exchange
Reciprocity refers to a type of trade that takes place between individuals who
are more or less social equals. Importantly and as noted in the examples above,
reciprocal trade does not imply that repayment of a gift always occurs immediately
upon acceptance of the gift, but may occur at some later date. This is especially true
and necessary in extravagant giveaways where the underlying strategy is the
establishment of social debt. Sahlins (1968, 1972) elaborates on these ideas and
identifies three different types of reciprocity: generalized, balanced, negative. As
Sahlins (1972) observes, these different forms of reciprocity may be envisioned as
parts of a continuum defined by: 1. How closely related are those involved in the
exchange transaction, and 2. How quickly and unselfishly obligations are reciprocated.
Generalized reciprocity takes places among the closest of kin and is
characterized by giving without expectation of anything in return. In general, this
form is synonymous with sharing and tends to govern exchanges between family
members. Thus, these transactions are generally not strictly economic in nature; rather

11

they are symbolic expressions of close personal relationships (e.g., gifts given to
children by their parents).

In many societies, generalized reciprocity or gift

giving/sharing is so ingrained in the social fabric that it would be considered impolite
for the recipient to express any sort of gratitude (see examples in Service 1966:16-17).
Overall, generalized reciprocity is found in all societies from foragers to contemporary
Western society (e.g., for examples among foragers see Bird-David 1992; Kent 1992).
Balanced reciprocity takes place among individuals that are more distantly
related, such as affines or a trading partner from another village, and refers to direct
exchange.

In these exchanges the giver expects something in return.

Although

reciprocity in these instances may not occur immediately, the social relationship may
be strained or ended if the obligation is not eventually met. For example, a wife may
say to her husband “we have had the Simpson’s over twice for dinner, lets not invite
them over again until they have had us over.” Generalized and balanced reciprocity
are thought to characterize exchange transactions among egalitarian level societies
(See Earle 1994; Johnson and Earle 2000; Sahlins 1972).
While generalized and balanced forms are based on trust and social ties,
negative reciprocity involves the strategy of getting something for as little as possible.
Such transactions typically characterize trade between strangers or those socially
distant from one another. This form of reciprocity is often economically motivated
and is most analogous to haggling, barter, or outright theft in modern society. Since
these transactions are often wrought with ambiguity and distrust, immediate
reciprocity is expected because of the fear of potential economic losses.

12

Redistribution and Market Exchange
Although rules of reciprocity characterize interpersonal relationships in many
traditional societies, Karl Polanyi (1957) has identified two other modes of exchange
that often characterize regional polities: redistribution and market exchange.
Redistribution implies the operation of a central authority. Here, goods are moved to a
central location, or are appropriated by it (i.e., a chiefly leader), and then are
redistributed back outward.

Although Service (1971) suggested that this type of

exchange is dominant in more centrally organized societies, such as chiefdoms and
states, this was later shown to not always be the case (see Earle 1977; Peebles and Kus
1977). Redistribution is generally envisioned to have developed as an organized
strategy to overcome geographic settings in which resources are abundant and diverse,
yet unequally distributed across the landscape. In this scenario, through the operation
of a centralized authority a fisherman along the coast could obtain produce and an
inland farmer could receive fish. Because redistribution works within the framework
of a central political organization it is a form of internal exchange.
Market exchange is the type of trade that is dominant in capitalist economies.
“Market exchange refers not only to the existence of market places (sites wherein
buyers and sellers congregate), but more importantly, to the organizational process of
purchase and sale at money price which is the mechanism of transacting material
products, labor, and natural resources” (Dalton 1968:144). Markets imply a social
setting where items are bought and sold, and bargaining occurs as a means to
maximize profit and minimize cost. Polanyi (1957:139) argued that bargaining first
became the basis of true market exchange in Tyre and Carthage, Greece, when coinage

13

based on a well-defined monetary system was also developed. Often, markets are
forms of internal trade, however, ports-of-trade represent an example of a market
setting where individual traders from different cultural backgrounds can meet and
bargain (i.e., external trade; see Arnold [1957] for an example of a port-of-trade).
As has been periodically noted in the preceding discussion, different modes of
exchange tend to characterize trade in certain types of societies (e.g., reciprocity in
foraging or egalitarian societies, redistribution in chiefdoms and states, market
exchange in states and empires). Although this is generally true, it should not be
forgotten that other forms of exchange might also regularly occur in a given society.
For example, reciprocity is commonplace in a modern market economy. In addition,
while different types of reciprocal exchanges typically occur within a society, as a rule
the particular form employed in each instance is largely determined by rules of social
distance.
Each of these points is important to consider when understanding the nature of
exchange and the interpersonal relationships they signify. This is especially true when
studying prehistoric societies. In contrast to the study of exchange in contemporary
groups where researchers benefit from first hand observations, archaeologists must
rely heavily on the movement of exchanged items to understand exchange among
prehistoric societies.

Taking into consideration that in most cases evidence for

exchange in the archaeological record is vastly incomplete (i.e., much of what was
exchanged is often not preserved), how may archaeologists determine the organization
of exchange and how exchange may have functioned based on the distributions of
materials observed in the archaeological record? For a general understanding this may

14

be accomplished through the use of analogy and by placing exchange within an
evolutionary perspective.

The Context of Exchange: An Evolutionary Perspective
Exchange is a social activity closely related to many parts of life. As such, the
significance and function of exchange can only be understood when examined within
the context of a local or regional cultural system.

This idea that the economy,

including exchange, is embedded in social relations is a key position of economists
aligned to the substantivist school of thought (Dalton 1968; Polanyi 1957; Sahlins
1972; Wilk 1996).

Of particular interest to substantivists is the evolutionary

relationship identified between modes of exchange and levels of social complexity.
Using an evolutionary framework (e.g., Earle 1994; Fried 1967; Johnson and Earle
2000; Service 1962), a contextual perspective of exchange is presented for three
general types of groups relevant to the present research: family level, local groups, and
certain regional polities (i.e., simple chiefdoms). Of course “these labels do not
signify perfectly discrete levels or plateaus, to one or another of which all known
cultures must be assigned; rather they designate stations along a continuum at which it
is convenient to stop and make comparisons with previous stations” (Johnson and
Earle 2000:245). Thus, it must be emphasized that an evolutionary perspective is used
here simply as a framework from which to highlight various types of exchange and the
social, political, and economic context in which they occur among different societies.
The following section is largely derived from Johnson and Earle (2000) and
Earle (1994) and provides a general outline of exchange and its role in traditional

15

societies. As many will recognize, this framework is similar to those presented earlier
by Elman Service (1966, 1971) and Morton Fried (1967) and consists of designations
based on the social and political organization of the economy. The decision to use this
more recent framework is largely a matter of personal choice and often the earlier
works mentioned above are frequently consulted to derive the following reviews. By
necessity, the following reviews are kept to a minimum and are not intended to be an
exhaustive discussion of each type of group. Therefore, the reader is encouraged to
consult the original references, and others noted therein, for additional details and
discussion (i.e., Earle 1994; Fried 1967; Johnson and Earle 2000; Service 1966, 1971).
Family-Level Groups
At its most basic level, the family group consists of a single nuclear or
extended family of five to eight members and several families comprise a “band” (see
Service 1966, 1971). Family groups are characterized by low population density (i.e.,
one person or two to 16 km) and are usually broad-spectrum foragers, although some
incipient horticulturalists may also be included.

Throughout the year individual

families periodically move in and out of larger camps or hamlets (i.e., consisting of
multiple families) of 25 to 50 members when resources are abundant or larger groups
are necessary for particular subsistence activities (e.g., communal hunts).

Thus, for

part of the year individual family groups forage alone, while multiple family groups
will aggregate for short periods of time. A division of labor along sex and age lines
characterizes these societies and suprafamily leadership occurs only in situations
requiring the cooperation of several families.

16

Given the close kin relationships that characterize these societies, exchange
among family-level groups is dominated by general and balanced reciprocity and often
involves the transfer of food (see Bahuchet 1990; Gould 1981; Kaplan et al. 1984; Lee
1979; Service 1966; Weissner 1996). That exchange often involves food among
foragers is not surprising considering that the acquisition of plants and animals is often
highly unpredictable from day to day, month to month, and year to year. Thus,
exchange within family level societies usually serves to even out resource shortages
over space and time. Because exchange among family-level groups often involves the
transfer of crucial resources between closely-knit family members or an extended
family, the term sharing is often used.
From an economic perspective, communal aggregations serve as a means to
exploit seasonally concentrated resources in quantities not possible by individual
family groups. While subsistence considerations clearly provide an underlying motive
to gather together, aggregation was equally important for providing a context in which
the exchange of goods and marriage partners and other important social activities
could also occur. Given the organizational requirements of activities associated with
aggregations, the formulation of short-term positions of group leadership was often
necessary.
In general, although exchange among family-level groups often equates to
sharing between closely related individuals (i.e., internal trade), the transfer of gifts,
including food and status items, also occurs with neighboring groups.

Here,

relationships established through gift exchanges frequently serve as a buffer against
economic shortfalls (see Wiessner 1982). In addition, although the creation of social

17

networks is most often used by family groups to maintain reciprocal access to
neighboring territories during times of resource shortage or periods of resource excess
(i.e., economically oriented), the procurement and display of valuable wealth items
probably also served as a strategy to show their attractiveness and value to potential
mates and trade partners (Sahlins 1972).
Local Groups
Local groups consist of politically autonomous societies of 100 to 500
members. These groups can be coresidential as a village, dispersed into hamlets, or
mobile depending on the nature of their social organization and economy.

The

subsistence economy is almost always based on domesticated species, although
reliance on extremely abundant natural resources, particularly marine resources, may
also occur (see Hayden 1995). Territorial defense is common among these societies
and constituent groups may claim ownership of important resources, such as fertile
land and valuable raw materials (see Earle 2000; Johnson and Earle 2000). Although
the term local group is often considered synonymous with the term “tribe,” the latter is
more of an association of local groups or a regional collectivity of big men groups (see
Hayden 1995; Sahlins 1968, 1972; Service 1962, 1971).
These societies are usually subdivided along kinship lines into corporate
lineages or clans and form around a common interest, such as food production and
storage or defense (see Sahlins 1968, 1972; Service 1971). The exact form and extent
of group interests greatly influences the overall size of the society. Among smaller
local groups, clan or lineage size segments of around 30 members may be dispersed
into hamlets or several groups of hamlet size may aggregate into a single village.

18

These groups combine to form a ritually integrated political unit usually under the
leadership of a village head or chief. In general, however, these integrated units are
usually short-lived and periodically dissolve as internal disputes arise.
Because warfare is common among these societies intercommunity alliances
are critically important for community well being.

Among local groups,

ceremonialism and exchange are very important for defining group membership, and
for establishing and maintaining intercommunity relationships.

Typically,

intercommunity alliances are established along individual family lines.
Regional exchange networks headed by strong, charismatic leaders, commonly
referred to as big men, integrate territorially defined local groups of 300 to 500 people
(Hayden 1995; Sahlins 1963).

Once again, settlement may consist of dispersed

hamlets or an aggregated village within a well-defined territory. Because warfare
between competing territorial groups is typically intense, big men are essential for
negotiating intergroup alliances, feasts, trade, and maintaining group cohesion. These
leaders also represent the group at important ceremonies that serve to establish and
solidify intergroup relationships (see Bulmer 1960; Godelier 1986; Hayden 1995;
Meggitt 1967; Sahlins 1963, 1972 for discussions of big men).
Overall, the underlying power of a big man is based on generosity with wealth
accumulated in his lifetime (i.e., achieved status) and his ability to lead. Supporters,
garnered through past favors and in anticipation of future rewards, recognize him as
leader and accept his decisions. Therefore, while individual villages typically have
leaders known as village heads, the big man has supporters from many villages. As a

19

result, the big man is important for overseeing and influencing social, political, and
economic activities in a much larger arena.
Although social alliances established through exchange may still continue to
function as a buffer against resource failures, the political economy of local groups
involves the steady transfer of primitive valuables. In these societies wealth goods are
frequently used in ceremonies, as items of personal display, and as a means for
creating status (see Rappaport 1968). Impressive intergroup ceremonies organized by
big men are characterized by the exchange of wealth items and serve to bolster both
the prestige of the big man and a groups’ reputation as a potential friend and enemy.
Regional Polities
Chiefdoms represent a regional polity that contains some elements observed in
the local group, and at times, elements observed only in more complex political units
(i.e., states). Thus, the term “chiefdom” represents an ideal type along the continuum
from tribes to states used by anthropologists to make social contrasts sharper than they
really are (e.g., Earle 2002; Feinman and Neitzel 1984; Johnson and Earle 2000;
Sahlins 1968; Service 1971). Of particular interest to the discussion here are simple
chiefdoms: regional polities that range in size from the low thousands to tens of
thousands.
Although considerable variability exists among simple chiefdoms (see Earle
1978, 1991, 1997, 2002; Feinman and Neitzel 1984; Peebles and Kus 1977;
Steponaitis 1978, 1981, 1991; Upham et al. 1989; Welch 1991), several features serve
to differentiate these societies from local groups.

First and foremost, permanent

leadership is organized beyond the village or local group level under the

20

administration of a single individual or ruling council.

Essentially, several local

groups are integrated under the rule of a single political entity. For this to occur
leadership becomes highly elaborated, institutionalized, and centralized. Typically,
chiefdoms are characterized by systems of redistribution through which surplus goods
are mobilized through staple and wealth finance to support the political ambitions of
chiefly leaders (see Earle 1978, 1991, 2002; Peebles and Kus 1977). In other words,
chiefs regulate the economy (i.e., the production, distribution, and consumption of
goods) and political economies are formalized to finance or support the heightened
institutional elaboration that emerges at this stage.
Like local groups, social relations in chiefdoms are based on kinship, marriage,
descent, age, and gender. In some cases, all members of a chiefdom are thought to be
descended from a single group of ancestors, and thus, are related to each other. Status
in these societies is based on differential access to resources. With the appearance of
chiefly leadership we also see the beginnings of truly monumental architecture (e.g.,
Pauketat 1994). These monuments serve as a testament to the emergence of a chiefly
power over a large labor force and to the development of regional political and
ceremonial centers (Earle 1991, 1997, 2002; Feinman and Neitzel 1984; Johnson and
Earle 2000:265; Peebles and Kus 1977; Steponaitis 1978, 1981, 1991; Welch 1991).
The elite segment of society is differentiated from commoners in chiefdoms by
privileged access to power, prestige, and wealth.

This is typically accomplished

through the display of wealth objects by the elite segment of chiefdom society. These
items serve as unambiguous symbols of status differentiation. Overall, “the exchange
of wealth goods is used to establish regional networks of political relationships and

21

alliances that are important for the well-being of the group and the renown of its
leader” (Earle 1994:430).
Discussion
Although very general in nature, the above review provides the context
necessary for understanding the role of exchange among various types of societies. As
seen here, although the function of exchange varies from group to group, there are
clearly some broad trends that may be identified. Overall, it is very important to
realize that the social scale associated with each of the evolutionary stages examined
here has tremendous implications for the appearance, structure, and function of
exchange.
Among family-level groups exchange typically serves as a risk reduction or
buffering strategy to combat shortages of food resources. Although exchange still
functions to provide security against risk among local groups, it is among these
societies that we begin to see for the first time the emergence of wealth items obtained
through exchange used as a means for creating status and prestige for individuals and
the groups they represent.

Here, public ceremonies, in which the display and

exchange of valuables plays an extremely important role, are carefully arranged by
aspiring leaders to establish intergroup alliances and to gain prestige. Among simple
chiefdoms the public display of wealth items by the elite segment of society develops
into a tangible means by which increasing differences in status and wealth are
manifested.

In general, the role of exchange within the context of the political

economy is obvious, it functions to support and reinforce the political standing of
individuals.

22

Spheres of Exchange
From the preceding section, two general classes of exchange may be identified;
those associated with the subsistence sphere and those involved with the political
sphere. Earle (1994, 2002) highlights the importance of these two major realms of
exchange and, in general terms, their consequences for social complexity (see Dalton
1977). While exchange in subsistence goods in many areas may remain relatively
unchanged over time and may represent a strategy to combat subsistence shortages
(see Braun 1986; Braun and Plog 1982; Johnson and Earle 2000; Spielmann 1982,
1991), the increasing importance of wealth or prestige goods exchange signifies one
avenue by which aspiring leaders seek to attain prestige and eventually monopolize
power (e.g., Arnold 2000; Earle 1994, 2002; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Hayden
1995; Peebles and Kus 1977). In the discussion that follows exchange within the
subsistence and political economic spheres are briefly examined.

This review is

necessary because it serves to further clarify the major classes of goods exchanged and
their role within the larger social arena.
In the subsistence sector of the economy the primary production unit is the
household (see Sahlins 1968, 1972). In most traditional societies, households only
minimally engage in exchange, rather, they seek to be relatively autonomous in that
most of their economic needs are met, carried out, and controlled at the household
level. Theoretically, exchange in the subsistence economy can involve the transfer of
three major categories: food products, utilitarian items, and raw materials (Earle
1994).

However, because the costs associated with moving food products any

distance are extremely high, it is unlikely that any real economic interdependence can

23

develop in the absence of markets or transport systems that can move food reliably
and routinely. This proposition is supported by the fact that examples of organized
and widespread food exchange documented outside these two contexts are
exceedingly rare (see Arnold 1992, 1995; Baugh and Ericson 1994; Spielmann 1982,
1983 for discussions on the exchange of food products).
In contrast, the exchange of utilitarian items (e.g., tools and ceramics) and raw
materials for their production is well documented throughout the world (see articles in
Baugh and Ericson 1994 for examples from North America).

The long-distance

movement of stone tools is perhaps the most common example for many areas. These
items are often produced from high quality materials, and are thought to have been
highly valued in contexts where time, special raw materials, and mobility were
restricted (see Andrefsky 1994; Binford 1979; Bleed 1986; Kelly and Todd 1988;
Nelson 1991; Torrence 1989 for discussions on technological organization). Despite
the numerous examples documented for the exchange of stone tools, Earle (1994:424)
notes that like food products, large-scale trade in utilitarian items is generally quite
rare. In most areas, the exchange of utilitarian items and raw materials becomes less
important as restrictions on mobility increase. In general, as groups become more
sedentary, the desire or need to acquire nonlocal high quality materials appears to
become less important and groups tend to rely more on locally available materials
(Parry and Kelly 1987).
This discussion is especially relevant within the context of decreasing mobility
that affected much of the world’s populations at one time or another.

Under

conditions of low human population, foraging groups over much of the world simply

24

moved to areas of resource abundance to meet food requirements (see Binford 1980;
Kelly 1995). However, as human populations increased and restrictions were placed
on group mobility, people often elected to specialize and intensify food exploitation
rather than rely extensively on others for crucial food resources (Earle 1994:422).
This further emphasizes the reasons why exchange in technologies and raw materials
are probably more important than the exchange of food in subsistence economies.
Whereas food is difficult to transport over long distances, these other items are often
much easier to move. An overview of exchange systems in North America (Baugh
and Ericson 1994) supports these ideas.
The development of a political economy is often associated with the
appearance of social institutions in complex societies that are supported by finance or
tribute (Earle 1994). Here, the emphasis is on the production and distribution of
surplus goods and services beyond the household level (see Arnold 2000; D’Altroy
and Earle 1985; Earle 1991, 1994, 1997, 2002; Hayden 1995; Johnson and Earle
2000). In this politically charged arena, enterprising individuals emerge and seek to
manage the production of a surplus for their own benefit (Arnold 2000; Hayden 1995;
Peebles and Kus 1977). To accomplish this feat individuals must effectively control
the means of production and distribution; in other words, to control the economy (see
Arnold 2000; Earle 1997; Hayden 1995 among many others). Within the political
economy two types of finance, staple and wealth, develop to support the political
activities of an elite segment (see D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1991; Peebles and
Kus 1977; Wright 1984 for discussions on finance systems).

25

Staple finance refers to the mobilization of food surpluses by leaders (Brumfiel
and Earle 1987; D’Altroy and 1985, Earle 1991, 1994). Food surpluses are then
redistributed back out to commoners for their support. Most often this control is
obtained by chiefly ownership of horticultural land and its improved facilities (e.g.,
irrigated and terraced fields), although other strategies have also been identified (e.g.,
ownership of whaling boats, elaborate canoes, highly productive fishing areas, drying
racks, and storehouses in some cases are equally important) (see Arnold 2000;
D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1991, 1994, 2000; Hayden 1995). Cobb (1993, 2000)
and Earle (1994) further suggest that control over access and use of utilitarian tools
could have possibly provided an alternative means by which food production could be
controlled and directed for staple finance.
Wealth finance is similar to staple finance, except instead of controlling food
surpluses, leaders control the manufacturing and distribution of valuables to support
their political maneuvering (e.g., Arnold 1992; Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Diehl 2000;
D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1991, 1997, 2002; Feinman 1991; Hayden 1995;
McGuire 1986). These items are often produced by craft specialists who may or may
not be attached to elites (see Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark 1995; Clark and Parry
1990; Costin 1991 for discussions on craft specialization). Types of wealth finance
are highly variable and include prestige-goods exchange (see Friedman and Rowlands
1978; Lightfoot and Feinman 1982; McGuire 1986; Steponaitus 1991:212 for
examples). Importantly, within systems of wealth finance “the value of wealth is
established in display and exchange, and wealth is given, received, and worn to
represent status” (Earle 1994:427).

26

Often the nature of wealth, prestige, and status signifying goods may be broken
down into two main primary categories: those produced from exotic nonlocal raw
materials and those with high production costs. These two categories are not mutually
exclusive, however, and may be combined as seen in the example of Mississippian
Mill Creek chert hoes (see Cobb 2000).

The Role of Exchange in Traditional Societies
The discussions presented in this chapter have briefly touched upon a number
of basic terms, concepts, and topics crucial for understanding exchange in various
types of traditional societies. Although it may seem that I have gone to undue lengths
to include additional information above and beyond exchange, it is this contextual
information that is necessary for comprehending the variety of roles associated with
exchange.
The above discussions have repeatedly highlighted the point that acts of
exchange or gift giving play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of
intersocietal alliances among traditional societies (see Blakeslee 1975, 1981 for
another strategy). Equally important, however, are the many social, political, and
economic incentives that lead to the development of these alliances in the first place.
Notably, these incentives vary considerably depending on the context and scale of
sociopolitical complexity. Oftentimes, alliances enable groups to maintain access to
food, rare and valuable resources, marriage partners, and are also a source for allies in
war. In other instances, exchange is a primary strategy by which aspiring leaders gain
or enhance their status.

27

Typically, exchange organized around the subsistence sphere of the economy
(i.e., as a means for maintaining access to food resources, raw materials, and marriage
partners) tends to characterize most exchange transactions among family-level and
local groups and often serves as a risk reduction strategy. While wealth exchange
occurs among all types of societies (Earle 1994), this type of exchange is perhaps best
known from examples provided by more “complex” societies. Here, wealth exchange
is often viewed as a strategy by which individuals seek to establish and maintain
institutions of social inequality.
As noted throughout these discussions, the acquisition of exotic wealth items
are seen as important means by which local and regional leaders or elites may enhance
their political careers. Mary Helms (1979, 1988, 1992) provides another dimension to
our understanding of the nature and significance of exchange by placing these
activities within a broader framework of political ideology.

Here, Helms looks

beyond long-distance interaction as simply a means by which nonlocal goods are
obtained and focuses on the meanings often attributed or associated with goods and
peoples from distant geographical areas. Typically, “geographically distant lands may
be perceived as part of the extraordinary, supernaturally powerful other realm that
surrounds the social or political heartland in all directions vertically and horizontally”
(Helms 1992:159; with quotations removed).

In addition, not only are goods and

peoples given special status, but those who make the journey to remote lands and
return are also held in high esteem.
Helms (1988, 1992) highlights a fascinating point of view held by many
traditional societies; the farther one moves across the landscape from areas that are

28

known and familiar, the more one is likely to encounter territories and peoples who are
seen as markedly contrasting to yourself and the members of your social group. As
such, contacts with such regions are regarded as exceptional activities reserved for
only those individuals with special abilities.

Helms (1992:159; with quotations

removed) suggests that these long-distance travelers should be regarded as “politicalideological experts or heroes who contact cosmically distant realms and obtain
politically or ideologically useful materials therefrom.” As a result, these individuals
are often given the status usually reserved for shamans or healers.
For many reasons highlighted here, the acquisition of wealth items through
exchange is often examined within frameworks of political economy (Helms
1992:157).

From this perspective, like substantivism, exchange is viewed as an

essential ingredient for maintaining social relationships, providing essential resources,
and establishing social inequality. Political economy as used here is broadly defined as
“an analysis of social relations based on unequal access to wealth and power”
(Roseberry 1989:44).
Political economists and their emphasis on inequality have highlighted the fact
that enterprising individuals use intersocietal exchange and/or the economy as means
to further their political careers as leaders. In other words, these strategies are used to
manipulate social relations and create social inequality. Generally speaking, these
leaders are successful in developing strategies that enable them to control the
production or acquisition and distribution of wealth (see Appadurai 1986; Preucel and
Hodder 1996:99-113 for discussions on value and wealth). While the vast majority of
political economists have studied stratified societies (i.e., state level societies), the past

29

15 years or so have witnessed a significant increase in research that examines the
political economy of nonhierarchical societies (e.g., Arnold 1996, 2000; Bender 1985;
Cobb 1993, 2000; Hayden 1995; McGuire and Saitta 1996; Muller 1997; Peregrine
1992; Plog and Upham 1983; Saitta 1994; as well as chapters in Moore 1993 and
Upham 1990).
In the case study presented here, Early and Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 5001500) societies of the Southern High Plains of North America are investigated. The
transition from the Early to Middle Ceramic period is characterized by considerable
cultural change including trends toward sedentism and a reliance on food production
and storage beginning around A.D. 1250. Coinciding with these changes is a dramatic
expansion of exchange networks. Overall, the development and intensification of
exchange is rapid and pervasive, and yet at the same time, is highly variable in terms
of the types and frequencies of trade items that are distributed among resident
communities.
This study seeks to understand the development of expanding exchange
systems and the reasons underlying the spatial variability in status related items.
Because the emergence of exchange coincided with a number of other significant
changes in local cultural systems, it is understandably difficult to attribute this
development to any one single cause. Nevertheless, previous studies of the region
have proposed that food shortages resulting from a deteriorating climate were the
primary factor stimulating exchange (Lintz 1986a, 1994; Spielmann 1982, 1983). As
noted above, this study underscores the importance a contextual approach as crucial
for understanding exchange. While the social setting strongly impacts the nature of

30

exchange, it is also apparent that the environment and climate exert limitations that
influence the basic structure of societies. As such, before the cultural context can be
established a basic understanding of the ecological setting of the region is necessary.

31

CHAPTER THREE
Environmental Setting

Traditionally, archaeologists working on the Plains have viewed the
environment as a major factor shaping the structure and appearance of cultural
systems, including exchange. In particular, a highly variable climate and its effect on
plant and animal resources has been emphasized. Although the climate of the Plains
can be quite variable from day to day, month to month, year to year, and from area to
area (a fact most residents take great pride in as they recommend that if you stick
around for a while it will change), such a perspective tends to emphasize the extremes.
While such a point of view is not limited to the Plains, the droughts of the 1930’s and
1950’s, coupled with more recent events (e.g., tornado outbreaks, ice storms, and
heavy snowfalls), undoubtedly has much to do with the development and persistence
of this environmental paradigm.
For many, the Plains environment is seen as an unrelenting force that dictates
what people can or cannot do. Subscription to the above perspective implies that
people of the region live a tenuous existence.

In fact, prior to the advent of

widespread irrigation in the 1950’s, the Plains were commonly referred to as the
“Great Desert” (see Eggan 1952:39-40; Ewers 1955:336-338; Kroeber 1939:76-88;
Lowie 1955; Secoy 1953). Generally, the region was viewed as unsuitable to human
occupation until the introduction of the horse by Europeans in the sixteenth century.
A preoccupation with the environment has resulted in a long history of Plains
archaeological studies organized under some form of an ecological framework. Here,

32

cultural systems, like other floral and faunal species, are viewed as adaptations to their
environment and most day-to-day decisions are seen as largely determined by
environmental conditions and biological factors (see Fawcett 1987:40-41).

In

addition, fluctuations in climate (i.e., especially wet to dry or dry to wet), and its
bearing upon plant and animal resources, have been used as the principal explanation
for many of the culture changes observed in the archaeological record.
While the use of environmentally based models is common for all areas and
time periods of the region, they have been especially prevalent during the time period
of interest here, the Early and Middle Ceramic periods (A.D. 500-1500). In these
periods, environmentally based models have been used to explain many changes in
human behavior, including immigration, emigration, mobility, subsistence economies,
settlement, and exchange (e.g., Anderson 1987; Baerreis and Bryson 1965; Blakeslee
1975; Bryson 1980; Bryson and Baerreis 1968; Bryson and Murray 1977; Dillehay
1974; Duffield 1970; Duncan 2002; Henning 1969; Lintz 1986a, 1991; Spielmann
1982, 1983, among many others). In reality, however, paleoenvironmental conditions
of the region are poorly known at this time and we do not have a good understanding
on just how different or similar conditions may have been in the past compared to
those observed today. Thus, models that rely heavily on hypothesized conditions
should be subject to considerable scrutiny (see Lensink 1993 for an interesting
discussion on these problems). While I would be the first to acknowledge that the
environment certainly plays a role in shaping human societies, I would also argue that
its perceived impact on the Plains has been overemphasized.

33

With these points in mind, the ensuing chapter presents an overview of the
environmental setting of the Southern High Plains and provides the ecological context
for the cultural systems examined in this study.

The first section provides a

description of modern conditions. This is followed by an overview of studies that
have attempted to reconstruct past conditions during the last 2000 years. In the end,
this information is summarized and sets the stage for an examination of the human
societies that inhabited the region between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500 in Chapter Four.

The Modern Setting
The Southern Plains is a large and ecologically diverse region. Traditionally,
the region extends from the Arkansas River in the north to the Edwards and Comanche
plateaus on the south. The Mescalero Escarpment defines the western boundary,
while the eastern margin essentially follows the contact between the tallgrass prairie
and the Ozark and Ouachita mountains. In all, the region includes parts of Kansas,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico (see Webb 1981). Generally, the
Southern Plains is broken down into two main provinces: the Rolling or Osage Plains
and the High Plains (Figure 3.1). Each of these provinces essentially corresponds to
the distribution of the tall and mixed grass prairies and the short grass plains,
respectively. The transition between these two provinces, often referred to as the
Plains Border (Fenneman 1923:118), can either be abrupt or gradual depending largely
on local topography, elevation, and other factors.

Given that this study focuses

primarily on prehistoric societies occupying the Southern High Plains, further
discussion emphasizes this province.

34

Figure 3.1 The Southern Plains of North America.

While the Southern High Plains is often portrayed as a vast featureless region,
these images generally apply only to the flat and uneroded interior of the High Plains
proper. Along the margins of the High Plains erosion has created topography that is
rolling, broken, jagged, and scoured (see Fenneman 1923, 1931; Flores 1990). Here,
escarpments between 50 to 200 m high are often present. These escarpments are
nearly vertical in some areas, while in other places they have become irregular due to

35

the extensive erosion of streams (Fenneman 1923:116). Several rivers traverse the
Southern High Plains from west to east and have cut extensive valleys across the
width of this level plain. Today, tributaries to these rivers continue to alter the shape
of the landscape as they erode headward and make their slow encroachment on the
High Plains. These Eroded Plains are frequently referred to as the “Breaks” and
comprise approximately one-quarter of the region.
Although the flat surface of the High Plains tends to dominate much of the
region, the High Plains and the Eroded Plains combine to create a landscape of
remarkable contrast and beauty. Indeed, it is almost startling at times to come out of a
deep valley or canyon to view the vast flatness that is the High Plains. Likewise,
every time I drive off the High Plains and into the canyon country of the Canadian
River I cannot help but be reminded of the words of Kurtis Blow (1994) “These are
the Breaks!”

These two basic subdivisions, the High Plains and Eroded Plains,

provide a convenient framework from which to describe the physiography of the
region.
Topography
The uneroded surface of the High Plains proper is an area characterized by
little topographic relief. South of the Canadian River, in an area referred to as the
Llano Estacado, vast expanses of this flat surface are present and remain essentially
unbroken. North of the Canadian, this surface is much less expansive and has been
eroded by the Beaver, Cimarron, and Arkansas rivers and their tributaries. Playas,
sand dunes, and south of the Canadian River Valley, dry stream valleys known as
draws, are the primary features that break up the uniformity of the High Plains

36

landscape.

Overall, the terrain, which represents a series of ancient overlapping

alluvial fans derived from the Rocky Mountains, is covered by short grasses and
gradually slopes from northwest to southeast at a rate of less than 2m/km (Fenneman
1931:11-12; Reeves 1976:214). Today, agriculture and ranching are the primary land
uses on the High Plains.
For those unfamiliar with the region, Pedro de Castañeda, a member of
Coronado’s entrada in 1541, provides a brief, yet accurate description of the terrain
and vegetation of the Southern High Plains as perceived by a newcomer:
“…in traversing 250 leagues, the other mountain range was not
seen, nor a hill nor hillock which was three times as high as a man.
Several lakes were found at intervals; they were round as plates, a
stone’s throw or more across, some fresh and some salt. The grass
grows tall near these lakes; away from them it is very short, a span or
less. The country is like a bowl, so that when a man sits down, the
horizon surrounds him all around at a distance of a musket shot. There
are no groves of trees except at the rivers, which flow at the bottom of
some ravines where the trees grow so thick that they were not noticed
until one was right on the edge of them. They are of dead earth. There
are paths down into these, made by the cows (i.e., bison) where they go
to the water, which is essential throughout these plains.” (Winship
1990:59).
The lakes described by Castañeda are known today as playas. Playas are
internally drained basins of the High Plains that provide the only naturally impounded
water in the region (see Gustavson et al. 1995; Holliday et al. 1996; Johnson 1901;
Randall 1993; Reeves 1966; Wendorf 1975). Presently, playas usually contain water
only seasonally (i.e., in the spring and early summer), although prior to modern
farming and pump irrigation they probably held water on more of a permanent basis.
These features are often small (<1.5 km²), circular to oval shaped depressions that
appear to have been formed by a number of processes, including deflation and

37

dissolution (Randall 1993). Playas occur by the thousands on the High Plains, but
their distribution is often variable. In some areas clusters of basins dot the landscape,
while in other areas they are much less common.
In this province marked by a noticeable shortage of water, playas would have
represented the only sources of potable water for much of the High Plains (Wendorf
1975:1).

Although some basins contain brackish water, the importance of many

playas as sources of water and other floral and faunal resources is demonstrated by
repeated occupation of these locations throughout prehistory (see Brosowske and
Bement 1998; Wendorf and Hester 1975). In fact, given the physiographic character
of the High Plains, playas likely represented island oases to early occupants of the
region.
Areas of sand dunes are present in many parts of the region. These occur as
extensive dune fields along reentrant valleys near the western escarpment, on
floodplains, and along the lee side of drainages and divides. Lunette dunes are small
hummock-like accumulations of sand along the margins of playas that appear to
represent the accumulation of deflated basin sediments (see Holiday 1995). In areas
where playas are abundant, lunettes can provide considerable local topographic relief
in the form of rolling sand hills or long linear ridges depending on the distribution of
basins. Overall, the majority of dunes in the region appear to have formed since the
end of the Pleistocene (i.e., 10,000 yrs B.P.), although some may have accreted
episodically over the last 30,000 years (Holliday 1995).
In the area south of the Canadian River, draws traverse the region from
northwest to southeast (Holliday 1995).

Today these valleys contain no flowing

38

water, but form the upper drainage basins of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado rivers that
were pirated by the Pecos River. Although the exact importance of these dry valleys
and the resources they provided to prehistoric occupants of the region is difficult to
assess, high numbers of sites along these corridors suggest that they probably served
to concentrate a number of valuable resources and provided natural routes across the
Llano (see Hester and Grady 1977).
Although occupants of the region certainly frequented playas, sand hills,
draws, and other areas of the High Plains, many of the major settlements are
concentrated along rivers and tributaries in the Eroded Plains or breaks. These areas
provide a variety of natural resources, including water, tool stone, and various plants
and animals, as well as protection from the elements. The overall diversity of the
Eroded Plains is extensive and is only examined summarily here. As such, the reader
is encouraged to examine the many other sources that discuss various aspects of the
Eroded Plains in greater detail (e.g., Brune 1981; Fenneman 1931; Flores 1990; Frye
1942; Green and Fairer 1995; Kindescher 1987; Latta 1948; Lintz 1986a; Marine and
Schoff 1962; Nicholson 1960; Rathjen 1998; Reeves 1966, 1976; Schoff 1939; Smith
1940; Tharp 1939; Twenhofel 1924).
The headwaters of the four major river systems of the region, the Canadian,
Beaver, Cimarron, and Arkansas rivers, are along the eastern flanks of the Rocky
Mountains. These rivers crosscut the High Plains from west to east, and like draws,
provide natural routes across the region. These valleys are 30 to 60 km wide and have
been eroded to 50 to 200 m below the surface of the High Plains. Numerous northsouth trending tributaries feed rivers of the region and have served to heavily dissect

39

the slopes of valleys. In general, tributary valleys are roughly parallel to each other
and are usually less than 35 km in length.
Steep erosional escarpments bound the eastern and western margins of the
Southern High Plains and along the margins of some of the major rivers and
tributaries. As noted earlier, these escarpments can vary from vertical cliffs 100-200
m high to more gradual slopes variously covered with rock, soil, and mixed
vegetation.

While the Mescalero escarpment on the west is essentially straight,

several deep and picturesque canyons, such as Palo Duro, Tule, Quitaque, Blanco, and
Yellow House, are present along the eastern margin south of the Canadian River.
These canyons cut deep into the heart of the High Plains and create jagged and abrupt
escarpments up to 200 m high.
North of the Canadian, Wolf Creek and the Washita, Beaver, and Cimarron
rivers are present, but their valleys are much less dramatic than those to the south.
Here, the transition from the High to Eroded Plains is gradual and rolling and often
takes place over a distance of several kilometers. That deeply entrenched valleys of
the region have served for millennia as natural traps for aeolian, colluvial, and alluvial
borne sediments are aptly demonstrated by the thick sandy deposits they often contain.
In addition, although most of the High Plains surface has been extensively dissected,
remnants of this surface are frequently preserved as lone mesas or buttes and isolated
ridges in many areas of the Eroded Plains. Today, the land of the Eroded Plains is
primarily used as pasture for cattle ranching. Overall, although unique in and of
themselves, portions of the Southern High Plains “Breaks,” particularly along the

40

Canadian, are reminiscent of badland-type country located elsewhere, such as in North
and South Dakota.
Geology
The oldest rocks of the region are represented by the Permian and Triassic red
beds. The redbeds consist of red sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as beds of
limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones, shales, and
sandstones overlie these rocks locally. Rocks of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age are only
exposed along the margins of the High Plains and in some of the more deeply incised
river valleys.

Combined they form the basal foundation of the Southern Plains

(Gustavson et al. 1990; Harbour 1975; Holliday 1995; Reeves 1976).
The famed Alibates silicified dolomite, the highest quality tool stone available
in the region, is derived from the Alibates Formation (Bowers 1975). This formation
consists of upper and lower dolomite members contained within Permian age deposits
exposed in the Canadian River valley. Although varying amounts of calcification and
chertification have occurred in both of these members, the best quality cherts are
available from locations near the southwest end of present day Lake Meredith. Today,
evidence for extensive prehistoric quarrying activities to obtain this highly prized
stone are preserved within the confines of the Alibates Flint Quarries National
Monument.
The Southern High Plains is constructed largely of extensive Cenozoic
deposits that overlie the Paleozoic and Mesozoic bedrock. The Miocene-Pliocene
aeolian and alluvial sediments of the Ogallala Formation comprise the bulk of these
Cenozoic deposits. As noted earlier, it is these sediments that were originally derived

41

from the mountains to the west. The top of the Ogallala is capped by a thick calcrete
known as the “Caprock Caliche”. The caprock is highly resistant to erosion and forms
the upper unit exposed along escarpments.
Importantly, the Ogallala Formation contains gravels of various cherts,
quartzites, and other materials suitable for stone tool production (see Banks 1990) and
also houses the Ogallala aquifer, the principal source of groundwater for the region
(see Hydrology below). Locally, the Pliocene age Blanco Formation represents a
lacustrine deposit of dolomite and sand deposited in large basins eroded into the
Ogallala. Like the Ogallala, a resistant calcrete caprock has also developed at the top
of this formation. By definition, the Ogallala and Blanco formations are eroded away
in the Eroded Plains exposing the underlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic bedrock.
The Ogallala, and where present, the Blanco Formation are overlain by the
Blackwater Draw Formation (Reeves 1976). The Blackwater Draw, formerly called
the “cover sands,” consists of extensive aeolian deposits and intercalated buried soils
laid down during the Pleistocene (see Frye and Leonard 1965; Holliday 1989; Reeves
1976). This formation represents the primary surficial deposit of the region and in all
areas its surface is marked by a strongly developed soil (Holliday 1995; Reeves
1976:213).
Hydrology
Although a wide variety of water sources are available in the region, the best
quality and most dependable sources are derived from springs emerging from
semiconsolidated deposits of gravel, sand, silt, clay, and caliche of the Ogallala
Formation (see Brune 1981:245, 293, 365, 345, 388; Marine and Schoff 1962:17).

42

Minor aquifers are also present in the Permian and Triassic formations; however, they
generally provide only small amounts of poor quality water (Marine and Schoff
1962:5). In addition, although several major rivers of the region are present in the
study area, they are often dry for extended periods of the year and generally contain
water that is not suitable for human consumption. For example, the Canadian, Beaver,
and Cimarron rivers contain amounts of chlorides, carbonates, and sodium that are
often much higher than the recommended limits for drinking water (Brune 1981;
Bureau of Reclamation 1979, cited in Lintz 1986a:59; Marine and Schoff 1962:Table
10).
Disregarding factors related to modern human activity, the overall quality of
ground water depends on a number of factors, including pressure, temperature, the
type of rock or soils through which the water has passed, and the length of contact
(Marine and Schoff 1962:53). Water obtained from the Ogallala aquifer (i.e., also
identified as undifferentiated Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits), although moderately
hard, is suitable for human consumption.

Prior to intensive agriculture and

groundwater pumping, springs from these deposits were quite common in the Eroded
Plains and it is likely that almost all of the springs important to prehistoric peoples in
this area originated from this formation (see Brune 1981:245, 293, 365, 345, 388;
Marine and Schoff 1962:17). Recharge to the Ogallala aquifer is gradual and is
largely dependent upon precipitation (Baker et al. 1963:39-41; Gustavson et al. 1995).
Overall, “water obtained from the redbeds generally is very hard; it is also too
high in sulfate and in some places is too in high chloride to be used for drinking”
(Marine and Schoff 1962:57). That water obtained from the Permian redbeds usually

43

far exceeds the recommended upper limit of sulfate concentration for drinking water
(i.e., 250 ppm; Brune 1981:20) is well demonstrated by five wells from this source in
Beaver County whose average concentration of sulfate was 1530 ppm (Marine and
Schoff 1962:Table 9). The high concentrations of chloride in the redbeds noted above
are due to the presence of salt (sodium chloride) layers. Lastly, water is also available
in some alluvium of the region. However, the water quality in alluvium is quite
variable from location to location and in some areas it is comparable to redbed
sources, while in others it is more like that obtained from Pliocene and Pleistocene
deposits.
In the study area tributaries to major rivers continue to erode at the margins of
the High Plains and expose the base of the Ogallala Formation. It is at this contact of
the Ogallala and the underlying resistant bedrock that many of the regions’ springs and
seeps are born. Overall, the amount of water flowing from springs and seeps greatly
affects whether adjacent stream channels contain surface water or not. Since most
drainages of the region contain abundant alluvium, at springs or seeps with low
outputs, the water quickly sinks into the ground and the channel contains little flowing
water except as runoff following thunderstorms (Redfield 1953:32). Likewise, springs
with greater outputs serve to saturate the ground and water is more likely to flow
perennially on the surface.
Overall, the drying up of springs as a result of a dropping water table from
irrigation practices, as well as springs choked off by increased sedimentation brought
about by historic farming practices are well documented throughout the region (see
Brune 1981 for his discussion on springs in the Texas panhandle). In addition, prior to

44

the modern era many playas of the region remained full for much of the year through
seepage from a high water table. Although the saturated thickness of the Ogallala
aquifer has increased since the 1980’s, many of the springs and seeps in western and
southern portions of the study area appear to be largely unaffected and streams
continue to remain dry for the entire year (e.g., tributaries to the Canadian River and
Goff, Coldwater, Frisco creeks in Texas County, Oklahoma). In contrast, although
springs along major streams in the northeastern portion of the study area have not
rebounded to earlier levels, many continue to remain perennial or at least contain
pooled water (e.g., Ochiltree and Lipscomb counties, Texas, Beaver and Ellis counties,
Oklahoma, and Meade, Clark, and Comanche counties, Kansas).
Climate
From the discussions provided above it should be apparent that water
represents a valuable, and at times, a rare commodity on the Southern High Plains.
Moisture is deficient throughout the region, although available moisture increases
from west to east (Blair 1950:110). The bulk of this rainfall (i.e., approximately 70%)
occurs during the months of April through September in the form of thunderstorms. In
particular, unlike areas east of the High Plains where spring (March, April, and May)
is the wettest season, the greatest amount of rain falls in the study area during the
summer months of June, July, and August. Since the majority of rain falls during the
growing season this rainfall pattern undoubtedly had important implications for
prehistoric horticulturalists.
Western portions of the study area are classified as semiarid and the east as
subhumid. On average, annual rainfall peaks at about 660 mm (26 inches) in the east

45

and drops to 406 mm (16 inches) in the west (Figure 3.2). In the Oklahoma panhandle
average annual precipitation sharply increases from west to east with 432 mm (17.0
inches) recorded at Goodwell, 541 mm (21.3 inches) at Beaver, and 623 mm (26.1
inches) at Buffalo (National Resource Conservation Service 2003). This is an increase
in annual precipitation of 231 mm (9.1 inches) in about 185 km (115 mi) or about 254
mm (1 inch) every 21 km (13 mi).

Figure 3.2 Annual Precipitation (Inches) for the Study Area.

To summarize annual precipitation for the Plains in terms of averages,
however, is often very misleading for seldom does any location receive their
“average”. For inhabitants of the region it is common during the summer months to
see it raining somewhere else or “smell the rain,” but never receive a drop. Extreme
variability in actual annual precipitation from one area to another is a major

46

characteristic of rainfall patterns in the region. This variability is aptly demonstrated
by examining actual precipitation amounts for a portion of the study area (Figure 3.3).
The actual precipitation amounts for 2000 and 2001 little resembles the previous
average precipitation map shown in Figure 3.2 and demonstrates that from year to year
it is very common for a given location to receive well above or well below their
“average”.
Also of importance is the fact that extreme variability in annual precipitation is
often very evident over short distances. For example, in both 2000 and 2001 annual
differences of 150 mm (6 inches) or more of rainfall frequently occurred in locations
less than 64 km (40 mi) apart. In particular, compare the 2001 annual precipitation for
the Garden City Airport and Experimental Stations (Table 3.1) (Kansas Library
Network Board 2003). Although clearly an extreme example, a difference of 361 mm
(14.21 inches) was measured at these two stations that are only about 13 km (8 mi)
apart. These vast differences in rainfall over short distances are a result of fortuitous
tracks of high precipitation thunderstorms.

In terms of precipitation variability,

similar observations have also been noted for other portions of the Plains (e.g.,
Blakeslee 1975; Wedel 1941). This phenomenon clearly has important implications
for prehistoric inhabitants of the region and its potential consequences for economic
strategies are examined in greater detail later in this study.

Similar to precipitation, temperatures of the study area also vary greatly from
season to season and from location to location.

In general, mean seasonal

temperatures increase from west to east in northern portions of the region and from
north to south in southern portions. Average mean high temperatures during July
increase from about 33º C (91º F) in the northwest to 36º C (96º F) in the southeast
(Bomar 1995:Table B-7; Rathjen 1998:12).

Mean minimum temperatures in the

region are less variable during the winter and average 10º C (50º F) in the northwest
and 11º C (52º F) in the southeast during January. The growing season is less than
168 days in the northwest corner of the Oklahoma panhandle and about 217 days in
southeast corner of the Texas panhandle (Johnson and Duchon 1995:Figure 3.11;
Rathjen 1998:12).
The seasons of fall through spring on the Southern Plains are often subject to
rapidly changing weather conditions. The highly variable climatic conditions occur
because the area is subject to influence by a number of different air masses. These air
masses include maritime polar, and tropical and continental polar, arctic, and tropical
(Bomar 1995:31). The frequent convergence of fronts over the region from fall to
spring may result in rapid changes in temperature often accompanied by the
development of thunderstorms or snowstorms depending on the temperature. During

49

warmer months afternoon heating coupled with unstable air masses frequently results
in the development of high precipitation thunderstorms that may result in local rain
totals of five to eight inches. Overall, fall represents a fairly rapid transition to the
cooler conditions of winter, while the spring represents a transition to the hotter
temperatures of summer.
Average annual snowfall totals for the region range from a high of 610 mm (24
inches) near Black Mesa, Oklahoma to a low of about 127 mm (5 inches) near
Midland, Texas (Johnson and Duchon 1995:Tables 4.21, 4.39, 4.47; Bomar
1995:Table F-1). The region is also well known for its windy conditions. Average
wind velocities range from 18-23 km/h (11-14 mph) and typically come from the
south or southwest; making it one of the windiest places on the continent (Bomar
1995:Table F-2; Webb 1981:23). Although the above discussions emphasize climatic
extremes, in general, rapid departures from normal conditions at any time of the year
are usually short-lived events and typically last a few days at the most.
Drought is a weather phenomenon that is often difficult to define (see Bomar
1995:152-154).

However, the effects of a drought are usually much easier to

recognize and include stress on native plants and crops, decreasing spring or stream
flow, and lower lake levels. Drought conditions are most often associated with a
deficiency of rainfall, although higher than normal temperatures accompanied by
increased wind velocities affect evapotranspiration rates and can certainly intensify
and worsen already arid conditions.

Although the region has been historically

characterized as drought prone, it must be recognized that most definitions of drought
or wetness reflect either a deficiency or abundance of moisture with modern

50

agricultural and ranching needs in mind. As such, correlating present needs with those
of the prehistoric past should be done cautiously.

Nonetheless, a few general

statements can be made.
As noted above, rainfall rates in the region vary a great deal between wet and
dry and seldom does any one place receive its average. Using Palmer Index data (i.e.,
an indicator of drought duration and severity) it is apparent that dry versus wet
conditions can also vary greatly from year to year in the region. For the period from
1951 to 1993 severe to extreme droughts are recorded on the High Plains of Texas in
29 of 168 yearly quarters (i.e., seasons) or about 17% of the time (Bomar 1995:Figure
88). Inversely, much or very much wetter than normal conditions occurred 11% of the
time (19 out of 168 seasons) during this same period. Except for the period between
1951-1956 and 1963-1967, which represent periods of prolonged drought in the
region, most droughts appear to be relatively short lived (i.e., a year or so) and are
frequently preceded or followed by periods of greater than average rainfall (Bomar
1995:Figure 88).

Conditions between moderately dry and moderately wet

characterized the region in 120 out of 168 seasons or about 71% of the time.
Flora and Fauna
In general, the natural vegetation of the region has been severely altered by the
historic Anglo activities. As such, floral composition drawn from modern surveys is
undoubtedly far from perfectly known. Nonetheless, for purposes here these surveys
are more than adequate to review the regions’ flora. The short-grass Plains district
characterizes almost all of the Southern High Plains (Blair 1950; Blair and Hubbell
1938). In this district buffalo grass (Buchlöe dactyloides) is the dominant constituent,

51

although various species of grama grasses (e.g., blue and hairy gramma) are also
common. These short grasses are well adapted to grazing by bison and provide a thick
protective cover for underlying soils that are very susceptible to erosion.

Areas

around playa lakes and dune sands are characterized by a greater diversity of flora and
include various species of beardgrass (Andropogon sp.), western wheat grass
(Agropyron smithii), sand sage (Artemisia filifolia), and shin oak (Quercus havardii
and other species). Prior to Historic times, natural stands of trees were essentially
nonexistent on the Southern High Plains.
The Eroded Plains contain a highly variable mix of different species whose
presence and abundance are dictated by local conditions. Recent surveys along the
Canadian River have documented at least 487 species of native plants representing
approximately 70 different families (Wright and Meador 1979; cited in Lintz
1986a:60). In general, however, important species include hairy gramma (Bouteloua
hirsute), buffalo grass (Buchlöe dactyloides), purple (Aristida purpurea) and Roemer’s
three-awn (Aristida wrightii), tumble grass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), three-awn grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumble lovegrass
(Eragrostis sessilispica), covered-spike drop-seed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), Plains
three-awn (Aristida oligantha), curly mesquite (Hilaria belanger), sideoats grama
(Bouteloua curtipendula), slim-spike windmill grass (Chloris andropogonoides),
black grama (Bouteloua eroipoda), and sandbur (Cenchrus longispinus) to name a few
(Tharp 1939:62-66).
The canyons and valley floors of the Eroded Plains support a number of
different woody species whose abundance and distribution is largely dependant on soil

52

type and available moisture. Well-drained sandy areas are dominant in this area and
stands of juniper (Juniperus monosperma and Juniperus pinchotii), and mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) are widespread. Better-watered valleys containing springs and
seeps are marked by groves of cottonwood (Populus deltoides), hackberry (Celtis
occidentalis and Celtis reticulata), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), wild chinaberry
(Sapindus drummondii), willow (Salix amygdaloides, Salix nigra, and Chilopsis
linearis), and chickasaw plum (Prunus angustifolia). Juniper, scrub oak (Quercus
mohriana), grape (Vitis rupestris), and stretchberry (Forestiera pubescens) are found
along the slopes and faces of valleys and escarpments (Rathjen 1998:15).
Lintz (1986a:Table 9) reviews the rich diversity of approximately 100
economically useful species for the Canadian River Breaks environs (i.e., for food,
medicinal, or commercial uses). Similarly, an extensive list of floral species is also
documented for the Dempsey Divide along the eastern margin of the Southern High
Plains (Thurmond 2001).

Here, more than 500 individual species were recently

documented. Also of interest is the identification of the latter area as an important
transition zone for numerous eastern and western species.
At least 59 species of mammalian fauna have been documented in the study
area.

These animals include bison (Bison bison), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus

virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra Americana),
elk (Cervus elaphus), several species of fox (Vulpes vulpes, V. velox, Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), coyotes (Canis latrans), gray and red wolves (Canis lupus, C.
rufus), cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), jackrabbits (Lepus californicus),
striped and spotted skunks (Mephitis mephitis), weasels (Mustela nigripes, M.

53

frenata), mink (Mustela vison), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beaver (Castor
canadensis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum), bobcats
(Felis rufus), prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), gophers (Geomys bursarius), voles
(Microtus ochrogaster), and several types of rats (Dipodomys ordii, Neotoma
floridana, Sigmodon hispidus), and mice (Perognathus spp., Peromyscus leucopus)
(Blair 1950:111).
The ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata) is the only land turtle native to the
region, although several aquatic turtles (Pseudemys scripta, Kinosternon flavescens,
Chelydra serpentina) are present in streams, rivers, and marsh areas. Other reptiles
are well represented and include 14 types of lizards and 31 species of snakes (Blair
1950:111-112). Fourteen species of frogs and toads and one salamander (Ambystoma
tigrinum) round out the amphibians found in the northern half of the Southern High
Plains.
The variety of birds on the Southern High Plains is extensive, and once again,
includes many eastern and western species.

A total of 293 species of birds are

documented for northern portions of the area (i.e, the Oklahoma panhandle; Shackford
et al. n.d.). Undoubtedly this number would increase substantially if species for the
rest of the region were included. For the Oklahoma panhandle portion of the study
area, contexts containing a particularly high avian diversity include Black Mesa and
wooded riparian and playa settings. Important taxa documented in the region include
28 species of waterfowl, 24 raptors, 30 shore or wading birds, and four native upland
game birds (Shackford et al. n.d.).

54

Overall, many of the floral and faunal species listed here are not limited to the
study area and may be found in adjacent regions. Also, river and stream valleys of the
area often provide westward and eastward extensions of border regions and their
associated plants and animals. In addition, while many of the above species are
typically thought of as being limited to certain settings (e.g., the High Plains, Eroded
Plains, short grass district, or riparian and marsh zones), a great deal of overlap exists
and many species can be found in multiple environmental zones. This is at least
partially a result of the fact that distinctly different habitat types may be in close
proximity to each other and are often separated by little transition. For example, the
short grass Plains surround playas and their distinct flora and fauna. Likewise, marshy
areas and riparian zones of the Eroded Plains often exist within a stones throw of
habitats that are almost desert-like. All of these factors serve to add to the ecological
diversity documented for the region (see Lintz 1986a:44-62).

biodiversity is documented for other regions (see Lundelius 1967) and presents
challenges for archaeologists when conducting ecological catchment analyses and
reconstructing past environments.

Paleoenvironmental Reconstructions
In general, past paleoenvironmental studies of the Southern Plains have
primarily focused on the delineation of major, long-term climatic events over the last
20,000 years or so (e.g., Bryant and Holloway 1985; Bryant and Shaeffer 1977;
Oldenfield and Schoenwetter 1964, 1975; Reeves 1965; Wendorf 1970).

These

studies have concluded that there have been no significant climatic changes during the

55

last 4000 years. As we shall see, the paleoenvironment on the Southern High Plains
for the late Holocene remains poorly understood because of the almost complete
absence of crucial classes of data necessary for reconstructing past climates.
Nonetheless, these incomplete reconstructions continue to be used as the basis for
explaining several important cultural changes that occurred during the last 2000 years.
This research is interested in the human record for the last two millennia, and
as such, the paleoenvironmental record for this period is examined here. In general,
paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the region during this period are based largely
on three primary sets of data: a) geoarchaeological information related to episodes of
soil erosion, deposition, and stability, b) vertebrate remains recovered from
archaeological sites, and c) pollen. Despite major limitations in the available data,
most studies conclude that during the period from 2000 to 1000 years ago climatic
conditions were significantly wetter than today (Hall 1988:203). Beginning sometime
around 1000 years ago a shift toward modern conditions began (Hall 1984, 1988;
Holliday 1985; Lintz 1986a; Lopez 1973; Speth 1983; Wilson 1980). During the latter
period a short spike in aridity is thought to have occurred from about 600 to 400 years
ago (Hall 1988:208; Lintz 1986a, 1991). In the discussion that follows the three above
data sets are briefly reviewed.
Geoarchaeology and geomorphology contribute information regarding past
environments through chronologically anchored studies of soil aggradation and
degradation, fill genesis, and landform reconstruction. Overall, these studies in the
region have focused almost entirely on alluvial settings (e.g., Artz and Reid 1984;
Ferring 1986a, 1986b; Fredrick et al. 1993; Hall 1984, 1988; Hall and Lintz 1984).

56

Unfortunately, “direct evidence for paleoenvironments, such as pollen, snails, and
plant macrofossils, is poorly preserved in alluvial sediments” (Ferring 1992:15). As
such, the geoarchaeological record often serves as the primary record of past
conditions with little correlative data from other sources. In addition, since floodplain
stability or instability can be related to highly localized conditions, geomorphic
controls for larger areas must be evaluated before data on soil formation can be
attributed to climate change. With these points in mind, significant effort has been
placed on identifying widespread correlations of soil deposition, erosion, and stability
as a means for developing regional models of past environmental conditions for the
Southern Plains (see Ruhe 1970, 1983 for discussions on regional modeling).
Previous studies in the region have been successful at identifying widespread
floodplain stability and soil formation across much of the Rolling Plains of Oklahoma
and Texas between about 2000 and 1000 years ago (Artz and Reid 1984; Ferring
1986b, 1992; Ferring and Hall 1987; Gustavson 1986; Hall 1977, 1982, 1988; Hall
and Lintz 1984; Pheasant 1982). This stability is indicated by the development of
soils named Copan, Caddo, West Fork, and Quitaque and suggests that wetter
conditions accompanied by a high water table prevailed at this time (Hall 1988).
The alluvial record following the development of the above soils is widely
considered to be representative of climatic conditions that were drier than those of the
previous 1000 years or so (Hall 1982, 1988:208). In general, alluvial deposition in
many valleys had resumed and it is thought that a drop in the water table may have
accompanied these conditions. While there is little doubt that these alluvial conditions
represent a return to drier conditions, the exact timing and magnitude of this event is

57

not well understood and it is apparent that conditions may have varied considerably
from area to area.

Importantly, it is not well understood how these conditions may

have compared to those observed today.
In southern portions of the region, moist conditions appear to have persisted at
Lubbock Lake until about A.D. 1250-1400 when development of the Lubbock Lake
soil ended and was subsequently buried by aeolian and colluvial sedimentation of Unit
5A (Holliday and Allen 1987:20). Similarly, Palo Duro Creek in the northern reaches
of the Texas panhandle “incised and then shifted to more active fluvial sedimentation
between 1400 and 600 years B.P. (i.e., A.D. 600 and A.D. 1400)” (Fredrick et al.
1993:435). In the latter area, however, long-term cyclical patterns of sedimentation
have been identified which suggest that climate might not be the primary factor
influencing sedimentation style (Fredrick et al. 1993:436). Lastly, a weakly developed
paleosol dating to A.D. 1350-1600, termed the Delaware Creek paleosol, has been
documented in west central Oklahoma (Ferring 1986b, 1986c; Hall 1977, 1982). This
paleosol suggests a slowing of valley sedimentation and the establishment of stable
floodplains in some areas (Hall 1988:208). Although unclear, the development of the
Delaware Creek paleosol is interpreted to represent a peak in the regional drying
period rather than a period characterized by wetter conditions.
An intensive radiocarbon dating program of dark organic stained soils dating
to the last 2000 years appears to have documented 400-year rainfall cycles for the
Southern Plains (Thurmond and Wyckoff 2002). In that study buried soils from 14
different exposures in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma were sampled.

Dark

organically stained soils (i.e., paleosols) thought to have formed during periods of

58

higher rainfall (termed pluvials) are separated from one another by sediments that are
not organically enriched. The latter are believed to have been laid down during
periods of lowered precipitation known as interpluvials. Correlation in episodes of
soil formation at several localities is interpreted as evidence for the existence of a
cyclical pattern of wet and dry periods lasting on the average of 185 years for pluvials
and 213 years for interpluvials (see Table 3.2). An examination of the 13C/12C ratios
from organic rich soils from the proposed pluvials indicates considerable variation in
the abundance of C3 and C4 plants contributing organic matter to soils (Thurmond and
Wyckoff 2002:Table 2). Although problematical to interpret, this may suggest that
stable surfaces conducive to soil formation occurred in both moist and dry settings.

Although processes of soil formation are useful for examining broad
environmental trends, as the above review indicates, it appears as though under the
best conditions this information is primarily useful for identifying patterns on the scale
of hundreds or thousands of years (Ferring 1992:30). The development of Copan-

59

Caddo-West Fork-Quitaque soils in the region appears to indicate that regional
climatic conditions between A.D. 0 and A.D. 1000 were moister than prior and
subsequent periods (Ferring 1992). In contrast, although a shift to dryer conditions
appears to have followed this period, the timing and magnitude of this event and how
these compare to modern conditions is not well understood.

Overall, given that

considerable local variation in soil formation processes appears to be represented,
short-term fluctuations in climate during the last 1000 years are much more difficult, if
not impossible, to document in the alluvial record. As a result, we must look to other
sources for this information.
Faunal remains from archaeological sites are frequently used to reconstruct
past environmental conditions. For example, the presence of bison and jackrabbit
remains at an archaeological site which today is outside the normal ranges of these
species is often interpreted as evidence for xeric conditions (i.e., dry) at the time of
occupation. Likewise, the same line of reasoning is often applied for the presence of
mesic (i.e., wet) species.

However, the use of macrofaunal materials from

archaeological sites for paleoenvironmental reconstructions is known to be
problematic and assumes that prey selection by human hunters is representative of
local resource abundances, and by extension, climatic conditions.

As such,

microfauna (i.e., mice, shrews, and voles) are usually considered to be more useful for
delineating local environmental conditions than macrofauna (i.e., bison, antelope,
deer, and rabbits) because they are less likely to be affected by prehistoric cultural
activities. However, because microfauna may be representative of highly localized

60

conditions (e.g., an oasis in the middle of a desert), these forms of data should be
correlated with other forms of evidence (Lundelius 1967).
Despite the cautions related above, the primary vertebrate evidence used as
indicators of past climate on the Southern Plains during the last 2000 years has largely
been limited to macrofaunal species, namely bison.

Based on the frequency or

presence of bison elements in archaeological sites, Dillehay (1974) and others (S.
Baugh 1986; Huebner 1991; Lynott 1979) suggest that bison were abundant in the
region prior to A.D. 500. Although few single component Early Ceramic sites dating
between A.D. 500 and 1250 have been systematically investigated on the Southern
High Plains (see Chapter Four), researchers suggest that bison populations in the
region were greatly reduced at this time.

Bison remains are common in the

archaeological record following A.D. 1250 and the onset of the Middle Ceramic
period. Under the assumption that human hunting strategies are correlated to climatic
conditions and that bison are more abundant during drier periods and scarcer during
wet periods, this information can be interpreted to mean that the climate was dry until
about A.D. 500, wetter from A.D. 500-1250, and drier again after A.D. 1250.
Changes in the frequency of bison and deer through time in the archaeological
record are also frequently used as evidence for perturbations in past climate. Here,
bison and deer are equated with drier and wetter conditions, respectively.

For

example, Hall (1988:208) interprets the presence of bison, along with badger and
Hispid pocket mouse, at the Wybark site (A.D. 1350-1600) in eastern Oklahoma as
evidence for drier conditions for this area at that time. In contrast, Drass and Flynn
(1990:Table 3) note that deer outnumber bison in seven of nine sites in central and

61

western Oklahoma occupied between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1500. These sites all lay
west of the sites examined by Hall (1988) and following the logic used above would
appear to suggest moist conditions for central and western Oklahoma at that time.
Overall, these examples serve to highlight the fact that a great deal of
variability exists in the frequency and types of macrofaunal remains recovered at
archaeological sites. Currently, there does not appear to any clear correlation between
these remains and past climatic conditions (see Chapters Four and Seven; Drass and
Flynn 1990).

In addition, depending on which faunal assemblages one elects to

consider dramatically different environmental scenarios can be proposed.
In general, although it is widely accepted that microfaunal remains are perhaps
some of the best indicators of past climate (Graham and Lundelius 1984; Toomey
1989, 1993 Toomey et al. 1993), they are seldom used by archaeologists in the study
area. Of all the microfaunal species available, the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogastor)
has been most widely used (see Duffield 1970:231-232; Hall 1988:208; Johnson
1987:76, 87). Its presence in early and late Holocene contexts on the Southern High
Plains is typically presented as evidence for higher precipitation and lower annual
temperatures.

A recent survey of playas in the Oklahoma panhandle, however,

documented Prairie Vole remains in every modern hawk pellet (n=15) recovered at
Eva playa in northwest Texas County (Brosowske and Bement 1998). Although
unclear at this time, it appears as though their presence on the Southern High Plains is
more widespread than previously thought.

If so, their potential value as key

paleoenvironmental indicators may not be as helpful as is generally considered.

62

Overall, the use of faunal remains recovered from archaeological sites as a tool
for reconstructing past climates of the region is clearly wrought with a number of
problems.

Given the variable distribution of many species, coupled with the

environmental diversity noted earlier and the bias introduced by human hunting
strategies, it seems unlikely that these data by themselves can provide information
regarding short-term climatic events sought by archaeologists to explain rapid cultural
change. Therefore, while precise paleoenvironmental trends of wet versus dry may
eventually be distinguished using multiple data sets, reliance on macrofaunal remains
from a small sample of sites will probably always be tentative.
On the Southern High Plains pollen is often poorly, if at all, preserved in
sample localities (Bryant and Larson 1968; Bryant and Schoenwetter 1987:39). For
example, at Lubbock Lake, Bryant and Schoenwetter (1987:39) note that palynologists
were either not able to find identifiable pollen or pollen was poorly preserved in
sediment samples from this locality. Similar results have been obtained elsewhere in
west Texas (see Bryant and Larson 1968). Unfortunately, there are many reasons why
pollen may be poorly preserved at sites in the region and it is difficult to isolate or
identify specific conditions that may be more conducive to its preservation at this time
(see Holloway 1981; Bryant and Schoenwetter 1987:39; Hall 1995). On the bright
side, playa basins may, however, represent a setting in which pollen records are
preserved; unfortunately these contexts have yet to be extensively studied.
The extant pollen record currently available from the Southern Plains for the
Late Holocene is extremely sparse, but appears to reflect a gradual succession from
the dry arid grasslands of the Middle Holocene to the modern vegetational

63

communities present today (see Bryant and Holloway 1985 for an overview). Perhaps
the best pollen record for the region comes from over 300 km to the east of the
Southern High Plains at Ferndale Bog in southeastern Oklahoma (Albert 1981). The
record from this location indicates that a moist open forest characterized the area from
700 B.C. to A.D. 300. From A.D. 300 to about A.D. 1450 the forest became closed
and consisted of an oak-hickory-pine forest. Fluctuations in arboreal taxa at Ferndale
Bog from A.D. 1200-1300 and A.D. 1500-1600 were originally presented as evidence
for climate instability (Albert 1981). More recently, however, these data have been
reevaluated and are thought to be representative of a “series of secondary vegetational
secessional patterns resulting from local forest fires” (Bryant and Holloway 1985:64).
Overall, the pollen record from Ferndale Bog and other sample localities provides
little evidence for any dramatic climate change during the last 2000 years and that an
essentially modern plant community, and presumably climate, were established
sometime around A.D. 800 (Albert 1981; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Hall 1982).
From the preceding paleoenvironmental review there are several points that
need to be emphasized. First, and perhaps most importantly, there is little basis to
support the existence of any extraordinary, long-term climatic fluctuations that equally
effected all parts of the Southern Plains during the last 2000 years. At best, the current
data may indicate moister conditions prior to A.D. 1000, followed by a gradual
transition to modern climate and floral and faunal communities.
Second, it is apparent that the current paleoenvironmental record is sufficiently
incomplete enough that either dry or wet conditions can be proposed depending on the
types of data one elects to emphasize. Because there are numerous interpretational

64

problems with individual data sets, as a rule, multiple sources of data should be used
for delineating meaningful climatic patterns. Although broad trends on the scale of
millennia may be discernable at present, clear evidence needed to demonstrate
dramatic, short-term instability in climate, such as that provided by dendrochronology
(see Rose et al. 1981), is currently not available for the region.
Third, there are numerous problems evident in using macrofaunal remains for
reconstructing past climates of the region. Even though it is common knowledge that
prey selection by people is subject to a number of different cultural processes, the
frequency of bison, deer, and antelope and other macrofaunal remains from
archaeological assemblages continue to be used to reconstruct past climates. A review
of faunal assemblages from archaeological sites of the region display considerable
diversity in the taxa represented (see Chapters Four and Eight; Drass and Flynn 1990).
I suggest that these patterns are largely unrelated to climate and reflect variability in
human hunting economies.
Lastly, a review of the major paleoenvironmental studies for the region
suggests that previous reconstructions of climate have been strongly influenced by
known events observed in the archaeological record (see Lensink 1993 for a similar
scenario).

While this has not been an exhaustive review of every source, these

discussions do not support the conclusion that the Southern Plains experienced any
striking climatic changes over the last 2000 years. As such, I would argue that we do
not have a firm basis for supporting climate change as the primary explanation for the
emergence of horticultural economies, shifts in hunting economies, or increases in
regional exchange.

65

Overall, the points made here should not be construed to suggest that the
structure of past climate is not important, for many fundamental issues regarding the
ecological setting and its natural resources are certainly central to this research.
Unfortunately, the current paleoenvironmental record does not enable us to precisely
model how past conditions may have varied from those observed today. As a result,
anthropologically based models are emphasized in this study as the primary means for
explaining variability among prehistoric human societies.

Summary
The preceding review documents a modern grassland environment
characterized by precipitation and temperature patterns that vary from day to day,
season to season, and year to year. On a spatial scale, fairly dramatic variability is
also documented for geology, topography, wet versus dry habitats, and the distribution
and abundance of natural resources over short-distances. Undoubtedly, this variability
has had profound effects on economic strategies of the region and our ability to
reconstruct fine-scale models of paleoenvironmental conditions for the last 2000 years.
A review of paleoenvironmental reconstructions highlights numerous problems
in the way existing data sets have been interpreted and argues that dramatic shifts
between wet and dry conditions are not well supported by the current record. Instead,
it is proposed that the best interpretation that can be made at this time is a fairly
gradual transition from wetter to modern conditions or possibly a shift to more
variable precipitation and temperature patterns during the last 2000 years. As such,
although future studies may eventually provide more conclusive data, it is argued that

66

it is premature to invoke climate change as the primary explanation for the variability
observed in the archaeological record from A.D. 500-1500.
Despite the fact that past climates and environmental conditions of the region
are poorly known, previous studies have long proposed that dramatic long-term
climate change did occur during the last 2000 years and that people responded in
dramatic fashion to these changes (i.e., they abandoned regions, colonized new areas,
drastically altered subsistence strategies, and developed interdependent exchange
relationships). It is interesting to note that many similar types of events and behaviors
are also documented for the Historic period. However, because we have a much better
handle on the details surrounding this time we know that many of these events were
seldom the sole result of climate change, but were related to other factors, such as the
adoption of new technologies, warfare, endemic diseases, and the movement of social
groups.
At the risk of appearing to argue against the use of ecological or
environmentally based models, I would propose we have placed too much of an
emphasis on paleoenvironmental data that are very incomplete and subject to a
number of interpretations. Although it is likely that models of cultural behavior
derived from such data are flawed not only because we presume to know what
climatic conditions were like, but also because we presume to know how various
plant, animal, and human societies were affected by various climatic conditions.
In sum, this chapter has provided a description of the environmental setting of
the study area. While past conditions are poorly understood, at the very least, there is
little reason to doubt that the study area was not characterized by the climatic and

67

environmental diversity observed today. This is not to say that conditions in the past
were exactly like those of today, but rather that the Plains have always been variable.
If this is true, one would expect that a given species, be it floral, faunal, or human,
might develop adaptations that sought to minimize the impact of this ecological
variability. In fact, this may be the case for a number of plant and animal species of
the region, as Johnson (1987:161) notes that although the paleoenvironmental record
of the last 1000 years appears to suggest short-term departures toward drought on the
Southern High Plains, these perturbations “were apparently not severe enough to
affect adversely the faunal and floral communities.” If so, is seems possible that the
same might be true for human societies of the region. Overall, while I do not propose
to have the answers to many of the questions raised here, they do at least provide food
for thought as we examine the nature of societies that inhabited the Southern High
Plains and adjacent regions during the last 1500 years.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Contextual Setting of Exchange: The Southern High Plains (A.D. 400-1500)

This chapter seeks to establish a cultural context surrounding the development
of exchange on the Southern High Plains.

Two distinct perspectives, one

diachronically oriented and the other spatial, are emphasized and provide the
contextual information crucial for understanding the structure of exchange. Overall,
the ensuing discussion lays the foundation for a basic understanding of the prehistoric
cultural setting of the Southern High Plains between approximately A.D. 400 and A.D.
1500 and sets the stage for a study of regional exchange in Chapters Five and Six.
In order to provide both contextual and historical dimensions to this study, this
overview examines Early and Middle Ceramic period entities that occupied the region
from about A.D. 400 to A.D. 1500. Overall, each of the archaeologically defined
entities examined here embody distinctive material characteristics which set them
apart from other contemporaneous groups of the region and it is presumed that these
similarities also equate to differences in other less tangible realms as well (e.g.,
economic, social, political, religious, etc.). While these discussions concentrate on
populations occupying the Southern High Plains, other groups that influenced and
interacted with local cultural groups, but which lived outside this area, are also briefly
examined.
Previously, prehistoric cultural phenomena on the Southern High Plains
between A.D. 400-1500 have been described using a number of different designations,
including Plains Woodland, Neo-Archaic, Transitional Archaic, Late Prehistoric I (LP

69

I), Plains Village, Late Prehistoric, Neoindian, and Late Prehistoric II (LP II) among
an assortment of others (Boyd 1997; Drass 1997; J. Hughes 1991). Because many of
these terms have their origins in other regions and imply meanings that may not be
entirely appropriate for the study area, this research elects to use the terms Early
Ceramic and Middle Ceramic to denote societies that occupied the region from A.D.
400-1200 and A.D. 1200-1500, respectively. The following review of the region’s
culture history is presented in the traditional format of earliest to latest as is typical of
most previous treatments.

However, one must bear in mind that while these

discussions are organized chronologically to provide a historical perspective to this
study, evidence for long-term cultural continuity between Early and Middle Ceramic
societies of the region remains in doubt and has yet to be satisfactorily demonstrated.
Lastly, it is not entirely appropriate to state that the following discussions are
simply a review of earlier studies; otherwise a brief summary of previous work would
suffice and the reader could be directed to important sources for detailed discussions.
Generally speaking, most major studies of the Early and Middle Ceramic periods of
the Southern High Plains have been concerned with constructing a regional cultural
chronology (Boyd 1997; Campbell 1969; Krieger 1946; Lintz 1986a). Although the
present research certainly relies to a great extent on this preceding work, the
orientation of this research requires greater emphasis on topics, such as subsistence
economies and settlement patterns, which have only been examined in a cursory
fashion by earlier studies. As a result, because a basic understanding of these topics is
essential to the present research, a great deal of space is devoted to establishing a

70

baseline of information for these and other related topics using existing and newly
acquired datasets.

Early Ceramic Period (A.D. 400-1200)
The term Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-1200) refers to a series of poorly known
cultural complexes identified for the region that have previously been attributed to the
Plains Woodland, NeoIndian, or LP I periods (Boyd 1997; J. Hughes 1991; Vehik
1984). These groups essentially represent a continuation of the foraging lifestyle
documented for the preceding Archaic period with a few important changes (J. Hughes
1991; Thurmond 1991). As the name denotes, the Early Ceramic period on the
Southern High Plains marks the earliest documented appearance of ceramics in the
region. A second important development of the period is the bow and arrow. While
evidence for food production is documented at a few sites (Carmichael 2004; McKay
et al. 2004) it is apparent that horticulture was of limited importance to the diet until
the subsequent Middle Ceramic period (see Adair 2003; Boyd 1997).
Fortunately, ceramics and arrowpoints produced at this time are fairly distinct
from other time periods and coupled with information on settlement location and lithic
raw material use often enables identification of sites belonging to this period.
Although many sites undoubtedly remain undocumented, it is estimated that less than
80 Early Ceramic sites are currently recorded for this 800 year long period in the
Texas and Oklahoma panhandles (Boyd 1997:Table 66; Carmichael personal
communication 2004; Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site Files 2002; Texas
Archeological Site Atlas 2003). Key cultural markers of the period are thick conoidal

71

shaped ceramic vessels and corner and basally notched arrowpoints. The following
provides a brief overview of Early Ceramic period societies of the Southern High
Plains. Useful summaries for the period have been previously presented by Boyd
(1997) and others (Cruse 1992; J. Hughes 1991; Hofman and Brooks 1991; Thurmond
1991; Vehik 1984) and the following is largely derived from these sources.
At present, two Early Ceramic cultural complexes have been identified in the
study area. These include the Lake Creek and Palo Duro complexes (Figure 4.1). The
Lake Creek complex was originally identified by Jack Hughes (1962) following test
excavations at the type site in Hutchinson County, Texas in 1953 (Figure 4.1). Based
on diagnostic artifact types, Hughes (1962:82) concluded that both Early and Middle
Ceramic occupations were represented at the Lake Creek site. Unfortunately, no
discrete features were identified and nearly all cultural debris from the site was from
mixed or surface contexts. As a result, attributing individual artifacts to specific
components is problematic at best.
While Hughes (1962) acknowledged the poor stratigraphic integrity at the
Lake Creek site, it is also clear that he recognized corner notched projectile points and
thick, coarse tempered conoidal ceramics as distinct from forms produced by later
Middle Ceramic populations. In addition, while not noted in the 1962 article, it is
likely that Hughes had observed similar types of projectile points and pottery forms
during his many years of work with private collections and from survey and
excavation at other sites in the Texas panhandle. Therefore, while delineation of
specific details regarding these Early Ceramic populations was not possible at the time
(Hughes 1962:83), the widespread co-occurrence of thick cordmarked ceramics and

72

corner notched projectile points at numerous sites of the region justified the formal
identification of an Early Ceramic complex known as Lake Creek. Unfortunately,
subsequent work in the region has done little to further our understanding of these
groups.

Figure 4.1 Early Ceramic Sites of the Southern High Plains.

73

A total of 13 Lake Creek complex sites have been recorded since 1962 and
delineate a spatial distribution for the complex (Figure 4.1). These sites include
Greenbelt (41DY17), Duncan Ranch Site 1 (41HC124), Tascosa Creek, 41MO5,
41PT29, Night Storm (41RB21), Sandy Ridge (41HP5), and possibly, Swift Horse
(34RM501). Unfortunately, most, if not all, of these Lake Creek sites have multiple
cultural components (Boyd 1997). Since later populations frequently reoccupied these
same settings and significantly modified the landscape through the construction of
residential facilities, it is often impossible to attribute specific artifacts and features to
Early Ceramic occupations. Only four of the 13 Lake Creek sites listed by Boyd
(1997:282-289), “have sufficient contextual integrity and quality of published data” to
be used to define the Lake Creek complex. These sites include Lake Creek, 41PT29,
Swift Horse, and Block A at Sandy Ridge. Currently, the Lake Creek complex is not
well dated, but is thought to have begun sometime around A.D. 400. The few dates
available are concentrated between A.D. 400 and A.D. 900, although the complex is
assumed to have lasted until the appearance of Middle Ceramic populations around
A.D. 1200 (Boyd 1997:Table 67).
Given the paucity of systematically excavated data, a very limited
reconstruction of Lake Creek lifeways is possible at this time. Nevertheless, the
available evidence indicates a mobile foraging lifestyle that included the exploitation
of locally available plant and animal resources from short-term or possibly seasonally
occupied campsites. Importantly, recent work by Carmichael (200 4) at the Patsy’s
Island site has demonstrated that some Early Ceramic groups along the northeastern
margins of the region were experimenting with horticulture by A.D. 750. However,

74

considering that residential structures and storage facilities have yet to be identified
for any sites, this development appears to have had little impact on existing lifestyles.
Overall, given the nature of available data sets, previous discussions have been limited
to consideration of settlement mobility, the subsistence economy, and technological
organization. As such, foraging models, such as those proposed by Binford (1980)
and Kelly (1995), provide useful frameworks for describing these groups.
Concentrations of cultural materials have been documented at some Early
Ceramic sites, which at first glance, appear to indicate fairly sizeable occupations of
some length.

However, it is more likely that these represent the archaeological

signature produced by reoccupation of a general locale over several hundred years by
small groups of foragers rather than large aggregations of groups (Thurmond
1991:129). Indeed, a recent examination of single component Early Ceramic sites
suggests that sites or camps are generally quite small and suggest occupation by
nuclear or extended families (see Bement and Brosowske 2001:31, 41, 61). That the
settlement locations of Late Archaic and Early Ceramic sites remain virtually
unchanged lends further support for considerable continuity between the two periods
(J. Hughes 1991:26; Thurmond 1991:120).
Assemblages associated with Early Ceramic sites exhibit a number of
similarities to those of the preceding Late Archaic period and suggest a persistence of
a broad-spectrum foraging economy (Thurmond 1991).

Like the preceding Late

Archaic, bison are well represented at all Lake Creek sites, although a wide variety of
other faunal resources are also typically recovered (see Boyd 1997). As discussed
later, Early Ceramic sites in western and central Oklahoma exhibit increased

75

frequencies of groundstone and fire cracked rock. Together these items suggest that a
variety of floral resources were collected and processed. Although floral assemblages
are essentially nonexistent from Lake Creek complex sites, it is likely acorns, prickly
pear, plums, grapes, nuts, and other native plants were exploited (see discussion below
of plant use among Palo Duro complex groups).
Overall, artifact assemblages, subsistence, and settlement suggest that little
substantial change occurred between 500 B.C. and A.D. 1000 and that the Early
Ceramic was simply an Archaic adaptation with the addition of bow and arrow,
ceramics, and in some cases, limited food production. This suggests continuity in
cultural tradition rather than the replacement of one group by another (Boyd
1997:282). Nonetheless, some relatively important changes can be observed between
each of these periods.
First, the large communal bison kills well documented for the Late Archaic are
not known for the Early Ceramic period (see Bement and Buehler 1994; Buehler 1997;
Hughes 1977).

The absence of large kills during the Early Ceramic has been

interpreted to mean that bison were less abundant because the region was experiencing
a wetter than usual climatic episode rather than other equally plausible explanations
(see Boyd 1997; Dillehay 1974). In contrast, a similar environmental scenario is
thought to result in an increase in communal bison hunting on the Northern Plains (see
Reher 1978; Reher and Frison 1980). The idea that the abundance of bison kills may
not be related to climate is suggested by the fact that kills are equally rare for the
Middle Ceramic period; a time when we know that societies were actively hunting
bison.

76

Secondly, the accumulation of midden deposits at several Early Ceramic sites
(see Bement and Brosowske 2001; Boyd 1997; Carmichael personal communication
2003; Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site Files 2002) suggest that some sites were
occupied for longer periods of time than before. Boyd (1997:294) has suggested that
foods derived from plant resources become more important during Early Ceramic
times. If correct, an intensification of existing plant resources may have effectively
increased the density of food resources and allowed longer occupation at settlements.
Despite potential trends toward economic intensification, the general paucity and size
of sites suggests that these changes did not lead to noticeable increases in regional
populations at this time.
To the south, the Palo Duro complex (A.D. 500-1100) has been identified for a
series of Early Ceramic sites in west Texas and the southern panhandle region that
contain corner notched and stemmed arrowpoints and brownware ceramics (Boyd
1995, 1997). Current reconstructions of the Palo Duro complex are based on research
conducted at a few systematically excavated sites. These studies suggest a foraging
lifestyle essentially the same as that described above for the Lake Creek complex. In
particular, work at the Kent Creek (41HL66) and Sam Wahl (41GR291) sites have
provided important details regarding Palo Duro architecture, subsistence, and
technology (e.g., Boyd 1997; Boyd et al. 1994; Cruse 1992). Other notable sites
include Deadman’s Shelter, Chalk Hollow, Blue Clay, Gobbler Creek Bridge, South
Ridge, and South Sage Creek (Boyd 1997).
A wide variety of site types have been recognized for the Palo Duro complex
including seasonal habitations and hunting and plant processing campsites. The Kent

77

Creek and Sam Wahl sites have been interpreted as villages (Boyd 1997:300).
However, occupation by more than one or two families has yet to be satisfactorily
demonstrated and it seems unlikely that these sites are villages as they are generally
defined. Excavated features at these two sites include hearths, roasting pits, burials,
burned rock features, and three rectangular to oval houses (Boyd 1997:298, 321). In
addition, there are several shallow pits approximately 50 to 80 cm deep at the Sam
Wahl site that are interpreted as subterranean storage features. Plants and animals
documented at the Kent Creek site include deer, antelope, bison, skunk, prairie dog,
turtle, mussels, acorns (Quercus), pigweed (Amaranthus), goosefoot (Chenopodium),
and purslane (Portulaca) (Cruse 1992:142 -145).
Overall, material assemblages from Early Ceramic period sites of the region
suggest that these populations were mobile, broad-spectrum foragers. In particular,
lithic assemblages are characterized by the use of local raw materials for tool
production (Boyd 1997:292; Brosowske et al. 2000), although some nonlocal sources
may be used at times for the production of projectile points. In addition, except for
projectile points, there is little evidence for the production of specialized tool forms.
In general, site assemblages are characterized by a wide variety of expedient tool
forms.
Early Ceramic groups appear to have been scattered across the landscape in
nuclear family or extended family groups.

These populations probably occupied

distinct territories and emphasized locally available raw materials and food resources.
The absence of bison kills so prevalent in preceding periods and the abundance of
small residential sites may suggest a decline in community organization above the

78

family group at this time. It is possible that low population densities coupled with an
increase in plant use may have enabled greater economic autonomy among resident
groups. Although minimally discussed here, nonlocal trade items are rare. This
suggests that intersocietal contact, beyond the need to insure access to important
resources, was poorly organized and of little socioeconomic importance (see Chapter
Six). Also of importance are numerous Early Ceramic burials that indicate that the
period was characterized by “widespread violence” (Boyd 1997:508). These burials
often contain diagnostic arrowpoints of the period embedded in bone and provide
convincing evidence for conflict. Despite the apparent economic autonomy and low
population densities, these data appear to indicate significant competition among local
groups (see Boyd 1997; Wilkens 2001). While unclear at this time, local disputes over
land-use may have arisen as formal claims to specific locations and their resources
were made by groups (see Chapter Seven).
Lastly, Lake Creek and Palo Duro complex sites are still essentially identified
by the presence of particular arrowpoint forms and thick coarse tempered ceramics.
However, because additional cultural traits beyond a generalized foraging lifestyle
have yet to be clearly defined for these complexes, essentially any settlement within
the region containing these types of artifacts is attributed to one of these taxonomic
entities. In Kansas, sites containing similar types of artifacts are attributed to the
equally ambiguous Keith focus (Hofman and Brooks 1991; Kivett 1953; O’Brien
1984). Unfortunately, these artifacts do not appear to be diagnostic of any one Early
Ceramic entity and may be representative of populations that occupied vast portions of
the Central and Southern High Plains between A.D. 400 and A.D. 1200 (see Hofman

79

and Brooks 1991; Kivett 1953; O’Brien 1984). As such, until systematic excavations
geared toward the complete recovery of artifact assemblages are conducted at single
component sites (or multi-component sites with good stratigraphic control), Early
Ceramic entities, such as Lake Creek and Keith, will remain ambiguous.

The Middle Ceramic Period of the Southern High Plains (A.D. 1200-1500)
The Middle Ceramic period denotes horticultural groups that occupied the
region from about A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500. Elsewhere the terms Plains Village, Late
Prehistoric, and LP II have been used to designate this time period (e.g., Boyd 1997;
Drass 1997; Lintz 1986a). These populations are broadly described as sedentary to
semi-sedentary groups who practiced a mixed economy of hunting, foraging, and
horticulture. Although the Middle Ceramic is perhaps the best known of all prehistoric
periods on the Southern High Plains, it is readily apparent that a great deal of very
basic information about these societies still remains unknown.
Although highly variable among resident groups, the Middle Ceramic period of
the Southern High Plains is marked by a number of important cultural developments
including dependence on cultivated foods, storage, intersocietal exchange, rapid
growth in regional populations, decreased mobility, changes in ceramic technology,
the widespread appearance of permanent settlements, distinct forms of residential
architecture, specialized tool economies, the control of crucial resources, and in some
cases, the formation of villages and economic specialization. It is likely that each of
these developments did not occur fortuitously, but in fact were all highly reinforcing

80

events. Given the extent of these changes it is not surprising that the period was
characterized by greater social complexity than earlier periods.
The Middle Ceramic period and all of its associated cultural changes appear
very abruptly in archaeological record of the Southern High Plains region. That these
developments appear very rapidly and that there is little evidence for in situ growth
out of preceding cultural complexes suggests that these changes are set into motion by
increased social interaction and/or the immigration of groups into the region following
A.D. 1200. Overall, cultural migration as a primary explanation for the dramatic
changes associated with the onset of the Middle Ceramic period has certainly not been
popular among researchers of the region for the last 30 years or so and models
invoking migration (e.g., Campbell 1969, 1976) have been met with severe criticism
(e.g., Lintz 1978). Regrettably, rebuttals have focused largely on refuting models of
migration and little actual research has been carried out to demonstrate that the
observed cultural developments arose out of existing populations. Although I do not
attempt to resolve this issue here, I think it is safe to conclude that at the very least the
Middle Ceramic period of the Southern High Plains is characterized by the rapid
adoption of ideas and technologies that are previously unknown in the region.
Whatever the case may be regarding the origins of various societies of the
region, it is clear that the development and fluorescence of interdependent exchange
was a Middle Ceramic event. Since exchange is extremely multifaceted and can serve
a number of different purposes, all of which are tightly interwoven into the fabric of
society, in order to understand this development it is essential to understand the
contextual setting in which it emerges. In the case study to be examined, it is apparent

81

that the emergence of exchange on the Southern High Plains coincides with a number
of other significant cultural changes. Unfortunately, many of these developments
remain minimally investigated at present. As a result, it is necessary to examine these
in greater detail.
Middle Ceramic cultural complexes currently recognized for the Southern
High Plains region include the Antelope Creek and Odessa phases. These two phases
are the focus of this discussion, although other peripheral groups, such as those of the
Red Bed Plains Variant and the eastern Pueblos, are also examined to a limited extent.
These discussions rely on both previously published information and unpublished
results provided by investigations conducted as a part of this research.

Primary

sources utilized in this section include Brosowske and Bevitt (n.d.), Cordell (1989),
Drass (1997), Lintz (1986a), and Spielmann (1996).

These discussions focus

primarily on the spatial and temporal distribution, subsistence economy, architecture,
settlement, and mortuary practices.

Overall, because the material economies of

Middle Ceramic groups of the Southern Plains are so similar, little attention is given to
this area. As a result, the reader is encouraged to consult the sources listed above for
more specific details on diagnostic artifact classes of the period. In addition, because
evidence for involvement in intersocietal exchange as indicated by the presence of
nonlocal trade items for each of the taxonomic entities considered here are the focus of
Chapters Five and Six, little time is spent here discussing these data. Overall, these
discussions serve only as a general overview of societies of the region as particularly
important trends and developments are examined in greater detail in Chapters Seven
and Eight.

82

The Antelope Creek Phase (A.D. 1250-1500)
The Antelope Creek phase and its highly distinctive stone architecture
represents one of the most intensively studied and widely recognized Middle Ceramic
period complexes found on the Southern Plains. Unfortunately, given that the vast
majority of previous investigations at these sites were conducted many decades ago, it
also represents one of the more enigmatic, and at times, most misunderstood cultural
complex of the region. Overall, because most excavations were conducted prior to the
advent of many modern sampling, documentation, and collection strategies now
commonplace, reconstructions of the phase have been limited largely to issues related
to chronology, architecture, and material assemblages (Brooks 2004). Regrettably,
few investigations have been conducted in the last 30 years to supplement earlier
studies.
Christopher Lintz’s Architecture and Community Variability within the
Antelope Creek Phase of the Texas Panhandle (1986a) published nearly 20 years ago
still provides the most thorough overview of the phase currently available. Although
no fieldwork was conducted as a part of his research, Lintz (1986a) pulled together a
large number of important, and often rare, sources pertaining to the phase in an effort
to understand the nature of Antelope Creek architectural variability. While the results
of this research are largely cultural historical in nature (Brooks 2004), the immense
volume of supplemental data contained within this study has proven extremely useful
to Middle Ceramic researchers. All in all, Lintz’s (1986a) work continues to serve as
a landmark study for the region and is extensively relied upon here.

83

In the discussion that follows a much needed up-to-date overview of the
Antelope Creek phase is presented. Since active field data collection at these sites
essentially ended some 30 years ago (see Lintz 1986a:5-22 for a history of
investigations prior to 1980) modern researchers have been forced to make do with
extant data sets. During this period of inactivity numerous ideas regarding the phase
have been proposed. Unfortunately in the absence of systematic field research, most
of these ideas have not been sufficiently tested or are based on incomplete data. As
such, they still remain hypotheses. Nonetheless, as is commonly the case, if read and
quoted enough times, untested hypotheses seem to have a life of their own, and often,
eventually become regarded as established facts. Therefore, with these limitations in
mind, a major purpose of this discussion is to objectively as possible examine the
Antelope Creek phase and determine what conclusions can or cannot be drawn at this
time (see Brooks 2004). Characteristics of the phase as defined by Lintz (1986a) are
used as a starting point from which to begin this review.
Distribution
The geographic distribution of the Antelope Creek phase as originally
proposed by Lintz (1986a:Figure 1, 29-30) includes all of the Texas panhandle, the
eastern two-thirds of the Oklahoma panhandle, the westernmost tier of counties in the
main body of Oklahoma, and northeastern New Mexico. A review of site records and
published sources, however, clearly indicates that two distinct concentrations of sites
are localized within a much smaller area. These two clusters occur along the Canadian
and Beaver rivers of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, respectively (Figure 4.2).
In the following, the distribution of permanent habitation sites with residential

84

architecture and material assemblages that can be firmly tied to the Antelope Creek
phase are emphasized.
A northern cluster of sites occurs almost exclusively in Texas County,
Oklahoma, along the Beaver River and its tributaries (see Bement and Brosowske
2000; Duncan 2002; Johnston 1934; Lintz 1976; Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site
Files 2002; Schneider 1969; Watson 1950). Here, a total of 12 sites have been
documented that contain or were likely to have contained habitation structures with
stone foundations and can be characterized as permanent settlements of the Antelope
Creek phase (see Appendix VI). Equally important, but rarely noted in the literature,
are a number of sites in this area that almost surely represent seasonal camps or
logistical resource procurement locales for groups of the phase (Oklahoma
Archeological Survey Site Files 2002).

These sites typically occur on playas or

ephemeral drainages, lack permanent living structures, and contain abundant Borger or
Stamper ceramics and diagnostic chipped stone tools of Middle Ceramic age produced
almost exclusively from Alibates silicified dolomite (see White 1987).
The second concentration of Antelope Creek sites occurs on the Canadian
River and its tributaries in the Texas panhandle. Sites within this cluster have received
a great deal of research attention in the past and are among the best known of the
phase (Baker and Baker 2000; Duffield 1964; Green 1986; Holden 1929, 1930, 1931,
1932; Keller 1975; Krieger 1946, Lintz 1986a, 1990; Moorehead 1931; Studer 1931a,
1931b, 1934, 1955). Twenty-eight sites found in and around the Lake Meredith area
were the focus of Lintz’s (1986:Figure 4) study.

Additional sites with stone

architecture are further documented in and around this area by others (e.g., Bousman

85

1974; Etchieson 1981; Keller 1975; Lintz 1990; Texas Archeological Site Atlas 2003).
This dense concentration of sites is centered around the famed Alibates quarries and is
often referred to as the core area of the Antelope Creek phase.

Figure 4.2 Antelope Creek Phase and Other Sites Discussed in Text.

To the west, south, and east of the core area the affiliation of Middle Ceramic
sites is less definite. Lintz (1986a:30) “tentatively” places the western boundary of the
phase near the western escarpment of the Llano Estacado, but notes that the cultural
affiliation of sites this far west remains uncertain. As such, Landergin Mesa (see Lintz

86

1990), Saddleback Ruin (Holden 1933), and other sites in Oldham County, Texas,
appear to represent the westernmost permanent habitation sites that can be securely
attributed to the phase at this time.
South of the Canadian River valley, Lintz (1986a:30) suggests that the
southern boundary extends as far south as Tule Canyon (see Hughes 1979). Although
a review of site files for counties south of the Canadian River drainage basin seems to
suggest that permanent habitation sites of the phase are not present in this area (Texas
Archeological Site Atlas 2003), two Middle Ceramic age sites with stone architectural
features are known for the upper reaches of Palo Duro Canyon. These sites, Currie
and Palisades Shelter, are frequently mentioned in the literature largely because they
have yielded radiocarbon dates (e.g., Baerreis and Bryson 1966:Table 2; Lintz
1986a:Table 3). Currie has yielded three dates (A.D. 1218, A.D. 1297, and A.D.
1434) and Palisades Shelter has four dates (A.D. 1304, 1367, 1385; A.D. 1327, 1346,
1393; A.D. 1438; and A.D. 1522, 1573, 1627). Unfortunately, besides these dates, all
other details about these sites remain unpublished. As such, although Currie and
Palisades are usually attributed to the Antelope Creek phase, since so little is known
about these two outlying sites they are not further considered in the discussions that
follow.
To the east of the core area the distribution of Antelope Creek sites remains
poorly understood at this time.

Recent pedestrian surveys conducted by Doug

Wilkens, an archaeological steward of the Texas Historical Commission, has
documented or relocated sites containing stone architecture and artifact assemblages
typical of the phase as far east as Government Canyon in northwestern Roberts

87

County, Texas. East of this area sites which lack stone architecture, but contain house
forms characteristic of the phase are documented (see Boyd and Wilkens 2001;
Brosowske 2002a; Hughes et al. 1977; Wilkens personal communication 2002). Even
though architectural forms found at some sites, such as Hank, Cantonment (Site
A439), Zimms, and Hedding, are very similar to those of the Antelope Creek phase,
various aspects of their material assemblages suggest that they may not be closely
related to the phase (Boyd 2002; Brosowske 2002a; Flynn 1984; Shaeffer 1965;
Wilkens personal communication 2002).

Therefore, until additional work is

completed these sites are not included in the Antelope Creek phase.
Generally, the 80 km expanse that separates the two concentrations of sites
described here is included within the spatial distribution of the Antelope Creek phase
(Figure 4.2). Much of this area is High Plains and is devoid of creeks, and previous
surveys suggest that permanent habitation sites of the phase are absent (Bement and
Brosowske 2001; Fredrick et al. 1993:466; Peterson 1988; Texas Archeological Site
Atlas 2003; Wilkens personal communication 2002). As such, it is not apparent
whether it is appropriate to assume that this area was under the territorial control of
groups of the phase and was used during logistical foraging trips. Inclusion of this
area within the phase effectively triples the distribution area of the phase and implies a
much higher population than likely existed. As a result, this area is not included here
as part of the Antelope Creek distribution.
In sum, a review of Antelope Creek site distributions suggest that settlements
containing stone architecture that can be linked with some certainty to the phase occur
in an area much smaller than that tentatively proposed by Lintz (1986a:29-30). It is

88

concluded that the two concentrations of sites identified here most accurately reflects
the spatial distribution of the phase.
Temporal Span
Chronological control for the phase is provided by 48 radiocarbon dates, four
obsidian hydration samples, and three archaeomagnetic samples from 13 settlements
(Baerreis and Bryson 1965; Duncan 2002; Keller 1975; Lintz 1986a:Table 3, 1990).
These dates indicate a temporal span from A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1500 for the phase
(Table 4.1). Also listed in Table 4.1 are the types of residential structures documented
at each site. The term “freestanding” refers to isolated habitation structures and
“both” refers to the presence of freestanding habitation structures and structures
containing multiple residential rooms. These architectural types are later examined in
greater detail under discussions of Antelope Creek architecture.
An additional seven radiocarbon dates have been obtained from two sites:
Black Dog Village and Two Sisters (Table 4.2).

Previous researchers, however,

indicate that these dates are problematic and should be disregarded (Lintz 1986a:378380; Duncan 2002:160). The four earliest of these dates span the period from about
A.D. 900 to A.D. 1200. The earliest date from Black Dog Village (Tx-1498b) is a
bone collagen date and is clearly in error. The remaining three assays are based on
wood charcoal and have yielded calibrated dates that are 100 to 300 years earlier than
others from these sites. For obvious reasons, these dates were considered erroneous.
It is possible that the latter dates are related to problems frequently associated with
dating juniper.

Traditionally, the termination date for the phase has been regarded as A.D.
1500 (e.g., Boyd 1997:343; Brooks 1989:80; Drass 1998:415; Lintz 1986a). Three
dates, all from Black Dog Village, yielded calibrated ages later than A.D. 1500. Lintz
(1986a:378-380) concludes that these dates are either contaminated or document later
components.

University of Washington Quaternary Isotope Lab; Radiocarbon Calibration Program 4.3

Of the four large Antelope Creek settlements for which we have multiple
radiocarbon dates there are two temporal trends that may be tentatively proposed
(Table 4.3). First, it is apparent that two of the largest settlements in the “core area” of
the phase, Alibates Ruin 28 and Coetas Creek, were occupied for considerable lengths
of time (i.e., at least 163 and 189 years).

Likewise, Landergin Mesa, a large

settlement in a highly defensive setting along the western margins of the phase,
appears to have been inhabited for about two centuries (i.e., at least 213 years).
Although absolute dates are not available for many of the other large settlements along
the Canadian River, overlapping residential structures, multiple occupation floors
within structures, and middens of considerable depth (some nearly 3 m thick; see
Holden 1933:46) all suggest that these sites were also inhabited for similar lengths of

91

time (see Green 1986; Holden 1933; Lintz 1986a; Studer n.d.). In contrast, the length
of occupation at Roy Smith, a small multiple family settlement along the northeastern
periphery of the Antelope Creek phase world, may have been only a generation or so
in length (Table 4.3; see Schneider 1969). The calibrated age intercepts for six
radiocarbon dates available from this site span a period of only 12 years and only one
of the habitation rooms has more than a single floor (i.e., Room A has two floors).

Excluding sites such as Hank, Currie, and A439 for which the cultural
affiliation is not entirely clear, there are currently 13 different Antelope Creek
settlements that have yielded absolute dates using the radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic,
and obsidian hydration methods (Table 4.1). These sites have yielded a total of 54
dates (note: the excluded sites have yielded eight dates). Using the dates available for
the phase it is also possible to examine some fairly general trends regarding Antelope

92

Creek settlement through time and across space. Using calibrated ages, Table 4.4
provides the total number of dates for three arbitrary periods of time: A.D. 1250-1300,
A.D. 1300-1400, and A.D. 1400-1475. Delineation of the middle period was derived
by grouping all dates which cross the calibration curve in three places during the
fourteenth century. This period is bounded by early and late periods. The onset of the
early period (A.D. 1250) represents the earliest dates available for the Antelope Creek
phase, while the termination of the late period (A.D. 1475) represents the latest dates
available for the phase. It should be noted that these periods are not intended for any
formal division of the phase, but are simply used here for discussion purposes. Use of
these figures assumes that the dates currently available are at least broadly
representative of general temporal trends for the phase as a whole, although it should
be noted that this may not be the case for Antelope Creek settlements in the Oklahoma
panhandle where only three sites are dated.

In Table 4.4 the number of dates refers to the total number of dates available
for each period.

The number of sites dated refers to the total number different

settlements that have yielded dates. Thus, for the period A.D. 1250-1300 there is a
total of 14 dates from six different sites. Since each period of time differs in length,

93

standardized figures are also presented for the number of dates and sites. These data
are standardized to represent three periods 75 years in length (i.e., 14 dates in 50 years
= 21 dates in 75 years). Combined, the total number of new sites established (N=13)
refers to the number of different Antelope Creek settlements that have been absolute
dated.
The distribution of dates within these three periods do not display any
particularly striking trends, such as a dramatic shift in the number of new settlements
established or occupied during the duration of the phase. The initial period, A.D.
1250-1300 witnessed the establishment of six different settlements that have yielded
14 dates. Except for Roy Smith, all these settlements are in the Canadian River valley.
These six sites account for nearly half of the total number of different sites (N=13) for
which we have dates. Standardizing these data to account for differences in the length
of period, these dates comprise 37% of the entire sample of dates. Altogether, these
data appear to suggest a fairly rapid establishment of Antelope Creek settlements in
the region during the first 50 years of the phase. The middle period, A.D. 1300-1400,
appears to have witnessed sustained growth as six new settlements were established,
including Stamper and Two Sisters in Oklahoma. A total of eight different settlements
were occupied at this time. The final period, A.D. 1400-1475, is marked by the
establishment of only one new site (i.e., Spring Canyon), although six previously
established sites continue to be occupied. As a whole, following the apparent rapid
establishment of Antelope Creek sites between A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1300, settlement
appears to have been relatively stable until the abandonment of sites sometime around
A.D. 1475 or A.D. 1500.

94

Beyond establishing a time span for the phase and the trends presented above,
more specific developments are essentially impossible to discern at this time given the
paucity of dated sites and insufficient numbers of dates from larger settlements. In
addition, although it is apparent the “core area” was certainly occupied throughout the
duration of the phase and contained the highest density of settlements (see Settlement
below), the nature of occupation for the Oklahoma portion of the distribution is not as
clear.

Subsistence Economy
The subsistence economy of the Antelope Creek phase is described as a dual
economy of horticulture and foraging. Unfortunately, few researchers have sought to
systematically collect and analyze faunal and floral samples that would allow a
detailed characterization of the economy (see Adair 2003; Brooks 2004; HabichtMauche et al. 1994:291). It should be noted that an earlier study by Duffield (1970)
has for some time served as the primary source for characterizing that portion of the
Antelope Creek diet provided by terrestrial, aquatic, and avian animal species.
However, Lintz (1986a:243-244) and Spielmann (1982:288) have suggested that this
study should be used with considerable caution since it relies on faunal samples from
early excavations that were not systematically collected.

Following these

recommendations, the results presented by Duffield (1970) are not relied upon here to
any great extent. With these limitations in mind the following description of the
Antelope Creek subsistence economy is presented.

95

Even though extensive excavations have been conducted at dozens of Antelope
Creek sites, comprehensive faunal analyses have only been completed for Landergin
Mesa (DeMarcay 1986) and Two Sisters (Duncan 2002). These sites are along the
western and northern peripheries of the phase, respectively. These studies utilize
faunal samples from well-dated contexts and provide a starting point from which to
characterize the importance of various species to the diet as well as information
regarding hunting and processing strategies for the occupants of these sites. Later in
Chapter Seven faunal data from these two settlements are examined in greater detail as
part of a comparative analysis of regional hunting economies.
Several major points can be derived from the studies presented by DeMarcay
(1986) and Duncan (2002, 2003). First, the diversity of faunal species represented
indicates a fairly broad-based hunting economy in which virtually every animal
available in the region was utilized at one time or another. For example, a total of 39
and 28 different taxa were identified at Two Sisters and Landergin Mesa, respectively,
and indicate that all available environmental zones were utilized. Although bison
remains are certainly more numerous than other species (DeMarcay 1986; Duncan
2002), the abundance of other species at these sites does not support the existence of a
specialized hunting economy for the phase as has often been emphasized in the
literature (see Chapter Seven).
Recovered bison elements at Landergin Mesa and Two Sisters suggest that
meat packages transported back to settlements were stripped of meat and the
remaining bone was intensively processed for marrow and bone grease extraction
(DeMarcay 1986:99-113; Duncan 2002:259, 281). Similar conclusions have been

96

suggested for other Antelope Creek sites (e.g., Duffield 1970; Lintz 1976:87).
Overall, the systematic reduction of bones from bison, and other large mammals, into
small splinters further emphasizes the need for detailed faunal studies as a means for
identifying prey selection and transport and processing decisions. Seasonality studies
using bison remains have the potential for providing several types of important
information (see Bement 1999; Davis and Wilson 1978; Frison 1991; Frison and Todd
1987; Fuller 1959; Savage 1995; Speth 1983; Todd 1991; Todd et al. 1992), but
remain vastly understudied from Antelope Creek phase sites at this time. As a result,
it is not possible to determine the scheduling of bison hunts, seasonal variability in
processing strategies, and at times, the length of occupation for most sites. In sum,
because so few faunal studies have been carried out at Antelope Creek sites, we are
not able to determine whether differences in the subsistence economy exist between
sites or whether the above results are broadly applicable to all settlements of the phase.
Whereas even without a systematic faunal study some general ideas regarding
the contribution of various animals to the diet may be gleaned by observations made
during excavation, the importance of wild and domesticated plants to the diet is not as
easy to determine without a detailed analysis of preserved botanical remains.
Regrettably, previous studies of the botanical remains from Antelope Creek sites are
virtually nonexistent and the use of native and domesticated plant species is largely
unknown (see Dean 1986; Duncan 2002; Habicht-Mauche et al. 1994). Despite the
dearth of studies that have systematically sought to recover plant remains, a few sites
have yielded native and domesticated plant remains, including hackberry, mesquite,
buckwheat, various grasses, cattail, sand plums, persimmons, prickly pear, Indian

97

mallow, corn, squash, and beans (see Dean 1986; Duffield 1964; Green 1986; Holden
1933; Johnston n.d; Keller 1975; Lintz 1986a:33; Studer 1934). However, since the
above list of plants is derived almost entirely from a single site (i.e., Black Dog
Village), their abundance and ubiquity at other sites of the phase is not yet known.
Although charred corncobs, cupules, and kernels have been noted at several
sites and suggest that maize was grown locally at some sites, numerous researchers
suggest that horticulture may not have been a particularly important or reliable
component of the diet for many Antelope Creek groups (Adair 2003:317-318; Duncan
2002, 2003; Habicht-Mauche et al. 1994:301; Hard 1990; Hard et al. 1996; Robinson
2001).

This conclusion is based on several forms of evidence.

Combined, the

relatively rare occurrence of bison scapula hoes and tibia digging sticks, the sporadic
nature of precipitation in the area, a lack of emphasis on settlement near soils
favorable for horticulture, and characteristics of groundstone assemblages all suggest
that farming was not likely emphasized to the same extent as observed among other
Plains Village tradition groups (e.g., Washita River, Custer, and Odessa phases; and
Little River and Lower Walnut foci). Although problematic in some respects, a recent
use-wear analysis by Huhnke (2001) may also indicate a limited reliance on
horticulture. This study suggests that many of the bone tools from Alibates Ruin #28
which have long been presumed to represent horticultural implements (i.e., bison
scapula hoes) may not have been used solely for farming. Although conjectural at this
time, the close proximity of this settlement to the Alibates outcrops may eventually
indicate the use of some of these items in tool stone quarrying activities.

98

Lastly, although the cultural affiliation of Hank’s site (41RB109) remains
unclear at this time, it represents one of the few Middle Ceramic sites in the Canadian
River valley for which plant remains have been systematically collected and studied
(Dering 2002:Table 1). This permanent habitation site, along the eastern periphery of
the Antelope Creek phase (see Figure 4.2), is marked by low ubiquity rates of
domesticated plant species in floral assemblages from this site (i.e., 19% or 4 of 21
samples). Corn, the only domesticated species identified at the site, represented only
13% of all plant remains (Figure 4.3). Interestingly, wild sunflower accounts for
nearly 80% of all botanical materials recovered at the Hank site (Dering 2002:Table
1). Overall, data from Hank may suggest that occupants of the Canadian River valley
did not rely as extensively on horticulture as Plains Village societies elsewhere.
Combined, all of these data would appear to indicate that most Antelope Creek
groups were primarily foragers whose diet consisted of wild plant and animal
resources sporadically supplemented with domesticated species (Adair 2003:317-318;
Duncan 2002). The conclusion that Antelope Creek groups were primarily foragers
and practiced only limited amounts of horticulture goes against what has long been
assumed to be the case for the phase. In the past, the sparse recovery of horticultural
tools and charred corn has led researchers to readily conclude that these populations,
like other Plains Village tradition groups, practiced an economy dependent on corn
production. However, to presume that Antelope Creek phase groups were heavily
dependent on horticulture cannot be supported from the multiple forms of evidence
currently available. As such, it may be appropriate to interpret the C4 signature noted
by Habicht-Mauche et al. (1994) for Antelope Creek skeletal populations as resulting

99

from of a diet high in wild plants and animals (i.e., cactus, amaranth, grasses, and
bison) rather than corn.

Figure 4.3 Edible Plant Remains Recovered at Hank’s Site (Dering 2002:Table 1).

Accurately reconstructing the subsistence economy for the Antelope Creek
phase is extremely important since the economy provides the basic foundation for
traditional societies.

As such, the manner in which we interpret the subsistence

economy often has major consequences for how the rest of the cultural system is
interpreted or perceived. For instance, whether a group practiced a foraging lifestyle
or were horticulturalists certainly has important implications for reconstructions of
settlement, mobility, population estimates, social and political organization, the nature
of intersocietal interaction, and so on. In short, if our subsistence reconstructions are
inaccurate, then it is likely that other reconstructions are also probably incorrect.

100

Architecture
Lintz (1986a) documented in great detail the stone and non-stone architectural
features associated with the Antelope Creek phase.

Using a sample of 223

architectural units from 28 sites in the core area, 11 different classes of architectural
units and six room aggregate types were identified. Although Lintz (1986a:86-132)
frequently notes the difficulty in ascribing specific functions to these features,
generally speaking Unit types 1 and 2 are habitation structures, Unit types 4, 5, 8, and
9 probably represent sheltered activity areas or above ground storage areas, and Unit
types 7, 10, and 11 are subterranean roasting pits or storage facilities. The function of
Unit types 3 and 6 is less certain, but when they occur as the dominant architectural
feature at sites and contain interior hearths it is likely that they also represent
habitation structures. Although a wide range of architectural forms and configurations
are documented by Lintz (1986a), Unit types 1 and 8 (Figure 4.4) are most common
and comprise 63% (141 of 223) of the sample (N=47 and N=94, respectively).
The architectural taxonomic framework defined by Lintz (1986a) is certainly
useful for explicitly defining and discussing Antelope Creek architecture, however, it
is unwieldy for general overviews. As a result, only two broad functional classes are
delimited and examined here: habitation structures and non-habitation rooms or
storage facilities. Special attention is paid to the various types of habitation structures
documented for the phase and sets the stage for later discussions of Antelope Creek
settlement patterns.

It should be noted that the terms residential and habitation

structure and house are often used interchangeably here and refer to structures in
which it is assumed that family groups slept. The assumption that these structures
housed either nuclear or extended families is supported by floor sizes generally greater

101

than 23 m2 and the presence of tool classes presumed to be representative of male and
female activities (see Flannery 1972). Overall, because this discussion provides only a
cursory overview of Lintz’s (1986a) original study, the reader is encouraged to consult
this source for additional details.

Figure 4.4 Primary Architectural Forms of the Antelope Creek Phase (adapted from Lintz
1986a:Figure 10).

Typically, most habitation structures of the Antelope Creek phase are
rectangular to square shaped houses with eastern entryways (Figure 4.5). Often, these
houses are roughly aligned to the cardinal directions, have stone foundations, and are
essentially surface structures or are set in shallow depressions. These houses are
usually between 23 m2 and 30 m2 in area and likely housed a single family. These
structures often have central depressed floor channels, interior storage pits or bins,
central hearths, and four central support posts. Although these descriptions tend to
characterize most Antelope Creek houses, as noted above, many of the larger circular

102

to oval structures that contain hearths, such as those at Sanford, Roper, Pickett,
Zollars, Coetas, Conner, Spring Canyon, Turkey Creek, and Medford Ranch, also
undoubtedly represent domestic habitation structures (i.e., some Unit types 3 and 6).
These houses usually lack many of the architectural features that are heralded as
“hallmarks” of the phase, such as central floor channels, four center support posts,
raised benches, and extended entryways.

Although seldom acknowledged, these

houses are very similar to those documented for the Apishapa phase and Graneros
focus in southeastern Colorado (see Campbell 1969, 1976). Overall, freestanding
single-family houses are by far the most common form of residential architecture
documented for the Antelope Creek phase (Lintz 1986a:145).
Large structures containing long, linear arrangements or blocks of adjoining
habitation rooms are also documented for the phase (Figure 4.5). These structures
housed between two and eight families and are often compared to the layout of
pueblos of the American Southwest. These multi-family structures are frequently
highlighted in the literature, but are actually quite rare when compared to the number
of freestanding houses that are known. In fact, of the approximately 110 residential
sites recorded for the phase (Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site Files 2002; Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas 2003) there are only about 10 recorded localities with room
blocks containing more than two adjoining habitation rooms (e.g., Coetas, Antelope
Creek 22 and 24, Alibates Ruin 28, Saddleback Ruin, Arrowhead, Tarbox, Roy Smith,
and possibly, Chimney Rock Ruins 51).

103

Figure 4.5 Antelope Creek Phase Habitation Structures (adapted from Duffield 1964:Figures
8 and 10; Green 1986:Figures 6 and 37; Lintz 1986a:Figures 38, 45, and 57; Schneider 1969:Figure 2).

As noted in Table 4.1, it is apparent that adjoining and freestanding residential
structures are not mutually exclusive architectural forms.

For example, while

freestanding houses frequently occur as the only residential architectural form at many

104

sites, they are also present at nearly every site where adjoining habitation structures
are documented. Previously, it has been argued that the latter represent an early
architectural style (Lintz 1986a, 1991), but it is clear that the existing chronological
control for individual architectural forms is so poor that it is not possible to evaluate
this hypothesis.
Among the many non-habitation Unit types described by Lintz (1986a), two
distinct classes may be recognized. The first class includes surface Units types 4, 5, 8,
and 9. These rooms or structures, depending on whether they are attached to houses or
are freestanding, may be square, rectangular, circular, or oval. They are typically
between two and four meters in diameter and usually lack internal hearths. Although
it is often implied that these Unit types represent storage facilities or “cysts” for
horticultural products, given their large size it is likely that these structures were used
as sheltered activity areas or as storage for nonfood items (i.e., seasonal hunting and
plant processing gear, ceramics, firewood, etc.). The second class (Unit Types 7, 10,
and 11) may be distinguished from the first class in morphological and functional
terms. These Unit types are usually about one meter in diameter, circular in shape,
subterranean, and in some instances are lined with rocks. While the function of these
features has not been examined, given their size and shape it is likely that they
represent either subterranean roasting pits or storage facilities.
Despite the intensive study undertaken by Lintz (1986a), it is apparent that
many functional, temporal, and spatial trends of Antelope Creek phase architecture
still remain to be worked out. This is not a reflection on that study, but rather it
highlights three main points. First, as Lintz’s (1986a) research aptly demonstrates,

105

Antelope Creek architecture is highly variable through time and across space. Second,
the lack of controlled excavations in the modern era has greatly limited our ability to
understand the function of many architectural forms and the occupational history of
many sites. Third, even though the Antelope Creek phase is certainly “one of the best
dated cultural manifestations of the Southern Plains” (Lintz 1986a:30), the fact that
only 13 of the approximately 110 sites currently documented have been dated only
provides a basis for identifying the duration of the phase. Combined, these points
greatly limit our ability to understand the spatial, temporal, and functional variability
underlying Antelope Creek architecture at this time.
Settlement
In a most basic sense, human settlement patterns refer to the way in which
people are dispersed across the landscape (Willey 1953:1). By themselves, these
patterns are nothing more than descriptive accounts of site locations. On the other
hand, to ask why settlements were located where they were forces us to examine the
wide array of social and environmental factors that influence settlement. As a result,
human settlement patterns are frequently used as a starting point from which to gain a
better understanding of how people interacted with their cultural and physical
surroundings (see Chang 1972).
Because previous work has focused largely on architectural or cultural
historical issues, settlement patterns of the Antelope Creek phase have garnered little
formal attention in the past. To date, the most thorough investigation of settlement has
been presented by Lintz (1986a).

Although that study specifically addressed

architectural variability of the phase, a settlement analysis was also conducted.

106

Unfortunately, the sample selected by Lintz was restricted to a small number of
previously excavated sites, which as a whole do not accurately reflect settlement for
the phase. Organized under an ecological approach, that study concluded that the
location of settlements functioned to place consumers near sources of potable water
and areas where a wide variety of plants and animals could be found (see also Duncan
2002).

A key assumption of Lintz’s (1986a) study was that the environment

deteriorated following A.D. 1300 and that this hypothesized event played a crucial
role in shaping most aspects of Antelope Creek life (e.g., subsistence, settlement,
exchange, and intergroup competition and warfare).
Although brief, the above discussion intends to impart the idea that previous
research on Antelope Creek settlement has been extremely limited in scope. As such,
considering the research interests of the present study, a more in-depth treatment of
settlement is warranted. While previous studies are certainly of limited utility because
they have not considered factors other than the distribution of basic subsistence
resources as influencing settlement, an even more pressing concern is that many
fundamental data regarding Antelope Creek settlement have yet to be assembled up to
this point. For instance, even though several researchers have recently suggested that
literally “hundreds” of Antelope Creek sites are present in the Texas panhandle (see
Bell and Brooks 2002:213; Drass 1998:418; J. Hughes 1991:31), it is apparent that no
one really knows “since the number, density, distribution, and kinds of sites…are
largely unknown” (Lintz 1986a:193; see also Brooks 1994a:3). As a result, before a
summary of Antelope Creek settlement can be presented, the number of known sites
and their distribution must be determined.

As Lintz’s (1986a) study of architecture has demonstrated, Antelope Creek
settlements are characterized by a great deal of variability. As such, it is imperative
that this study consider the range of settlement size and density represented. Although
it is not feasible to examine each and every site here in detail, the following provides
distributional data for nearly all of the Antelope Creek sites currently recorded in the
Oklahoma and Texas panhandles. On a more specific level, the number of households
that may have occupied settlements is also estimated using the number of habitation
structures present at a sample of settlements. Although fairly general, settlement is
described along a continuum of dispersal and aggregation.
A review of recorded sites in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles in which
Antelope Creek sites are found demonstrates that extensive pedestrian survey has been
conducted in this area (Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site Files 2002; Texas
Archeological Site Files Atlas 2003). This work has resulted in the recording of 1600
archaeological sites in the seven counties for which Antelope Creek sites are
documented (Table 4.5). This is an average of 228 sites per county. Although an
exhaustive study of Antelope Creek settlement patterns is not attempted here, it is
clear that the data necessary to examine this topic in greater detail are available.

In the Oklahoma panhandle only 12 permanent habitation sites are documented
(Oklahoma Archaeological Survey Site Files 2002).

Excluding Roy Smith, a

noticeable outlier, sites in this cluster are contained within an area of about 1900 km2
in size (55 x 35 km). Most of these sites are along the Beaver River and are dispersed

108

at a fairly regular interval of about 6 km (Figure 4.6). In contrast, Roy Smith and the
other four remaining sites are along tributary streams and are often more than 18 km
from the nearest adjacent settlement. Although complete survey coverage is lacking,
current data suggest that the latter sites represent isolated settlements or outposts of
some kind. Overall, most of the sites in the Oklahoma panhandle represent singlefamily homesteads, although, based on the number of habitation structures present,
Stamper, Casto-Nash, and Roy Smith are settlements that likely contained three to
seven family groups (Schneider 1969; Watson 1950).

Figure 4.6 Antelope Creek Settlements in the Beaver River Drainage, Oklahoma.

As noted earlier, while Antelope Creek sites in the Texas panhandle have
received a great deal of research attention in the past, basic information, such as total
numbers of settlements and their distribution, is not known. Table 4.6 provides an
overview of recorded sites for five counties in the Texas panhandle for which
Antelope Creek sites are known (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2003).

These

records indicate that approximately 100 Antelope Creek permanent habitation sites

109

containing stone architecture are currently recorded for Oldham, Potter, Moore,
Hutchinson, and western Roberts County. The site files for neighboring counties were
also examined, but they failed to contain any sites with stone architectural that could
be firmly tied to the phase. Overall, these site distributions support the contention
originally forwarded by Krieger (1946:50) that Antelope Creek settlements of the
Texas panhandle are restricted to the Canadian River valley.

Includes six unrecorded stone architectural sites in Hutchinson (N = 2) and Roberts Counties, (N = 4)

These figures indicate that Antelope Creek sites along the Canadian River are
eight times more numerous than those in the Oklahoma panhandle (101 versus 12) and
certainly warrant designation of this area as the “Core Area” of the phase. Figure 4.7
shows the distribution of 93 Antelope Creek sites found in the Texas panhandle.
Although sites along Canadian River valley are dispersed over an area from western
Oldham County in the west to western Roberts County in the east (about 170 km in
length), it is apparent that 93 or 92% of the settlements are densely concentrated in the
Lake Meredith area. Excluding one or two outliers, these sites are contained within an

110

area about 1600 km2 (80 x 20 km) in size. This distribution indicates that Antelope
Creek settlements are seven times more densely concentrated in the core area than
along the Beaver River valley (i.e., 0.042 km2 versus 0.006 km2).
In the Texas panhandle, approximately 70% of the known settlements are
within the Canadian River valley or along the valley rim (Figure 4.7). Given that the
Canadian is a highly braided stream whose channel is subject to frequent lateral
movement across a wide sandy floodplain, the nearest topographic landforms suitable
for occupation are usually at some distance from the river. Thus, while in many
instances settlements may not appear to be oriented to the river and its resources, site
visits indicate that they are often as close to the river as is feasible, yet avoid the risk
of flooding (see Holden 1933:41). As a whole, site distances to the river increase as
you proceed downstream and the floodplain widens.
Notable exceptions to the above pattern, however, are clusters of sites, such as
those along Antelope, Big Blue, Turkey, and Plum creeks and relatively isolated sites
along Spring and Corral creeks and at the upper end of McBride Canyon. These sites
are located between 4 and 8 km from the river and truly represent settlements that are
oriented toward lateral tributaries and resources outside the Canadian River valley
proper. Overall, considering that most sites are near the Canadian River suggests that
there were advantages or benefits to settlement within the valley. Most obviously, the
dense concentration of settlement observed near the Alibates quarries clearly indicates
that populations were drawn to this important resource.

Figure 4.7 Antelope Creek Phase Settlements in the Canadian River Valley, Texas (Note: does not include eight outlying

Throughout the distribution shown in Figure 4.7, sites are densely
concentrated, and for the reasons noted above, are almost always atop topographic
rises of some kind. Accordingly, in the wide-open expanses of the Canadian valley
several settlements are usually visible from each site location. Previously, Studer
(1931c:13) and Kreiger (1946:42) have argued that many of the highly elevated
Antelope Creek settlements were selected for their defensive qualities.

Lintz

(1986a:250) downplays this proposition and suggests “most settlement locations seem
to have been chosen with little concern of the consequences from possible outside
raiding.”

While this is undoubtedly the case for some sites, especially small

homesteads situated low on the landscape, it is difficult to explain the location of
several larger settlements on elevated promontories without invoking models of
defense (see Brooks 1994b).
It is readily apparent that Antelope Creek settlements atop or adjacent to
isolated mesas or along the Canadian valley rim were not selected solely for ecological
reasons. In other words, it is unlikely that these locations facilitated access to water or
food resources (e.g., Saddleback; Landergin; Lookout Ruin; Chimney Rock 51;
Arrowhead Peak; Alibates Ruin 28, 28A, 30; Coetas Ruin; Antelope Creek 22;
Cottonwood; Tarbox; Medford Ranch; Sanford; and many others). In general, these
elevated or upland locations are exposed to the elements (particularly the wind), often
require dangerous vertical descents of 20 to 100 m down steep rocky talus slopes to
reach the valley floor, and are frequently several hundred meters from the nearest
riparian or spring settings.

Assuming that proximity to crucial resources and

protection from the elements were important considerations, site visits demonstrate

113

that locations better suited for occupation than the ones selected are often present in
most of these areas.
Overall, it is difficult to envision elevated Antelope Creek phase settlements as
beneficial for anything except defense. For example, it seems unlikely that elevated
sites were selected to monitor herd movements. Lintz (1986a:250) cites the lack of
evidence for fortifications (i.e., palisades, ditches, ramparts, and other defensive
features) at sites as support for the idea that Antelope Creek groups were not overly
concerned with defensive strategies. However, fortifications are generally quite rare
except among complex tribes, chiefdoms, and states, and thus, are not to be expected
in the study area (Keeley 1996:55-58; Table 3.2). Therefore, it is concluded that many
of the Antelope Creek settlements incorporated defensive strategies into settlement
decisions and that sites situated on promontories reflect a concern for intersocietal
warfare. The numerous decapitated trophy skulls at the Footprint site in the Antelope
Creek core area clearly demonstrates the gruesome reality of intergroup warfare and
raiding during Middle Ceramic times on the Southern High Plains (see Brooks 1994b;
Green 1986).
The above discussion of settlement provides a brief and fairly general
description of the density and distribution of Antelope Creek phase settlements in the
Oklahoma and Texas panhandles. What is apparent, however, is that the size of
settlements can vary considerably (see Lintz 1986a).

Using the total number of

residential structures documented at a sample of sites, estimates for the maximum
number of family groups that may have occupied Antelope Creek settlements is
tabulated. Table 4.4 provides counts of isolated habitation structures or habitation

114

rooms within adjoining room block structures at 31 Antelope Creek settlements for
which we have fair to excellent information on site layout (see Lintz 1986a). It should
be noted that in certain examples the number of structures at an individual site is
adjusted to account for overlapping houses (e.g., Two Sisters, Black Dog Village, and
Alibates Ruin #28).
The number of families occupying individual sites varies from single-family
residences (e.g., Two Sisters, Lookout Ruin, Antelope Creek Ruin 22A and 23,
Pickett, Marsh, and Spring Canyon) to settlements inhabited by four or more families
(e.g., Antelope Creek 22 and 24, Alibates Ruin 28 Units I and II, Cottonwood Creek,
Roy Smith, Chimney Rock, Stamper, and Coetas Creek). The figures presented here
are obviously imperfect as it is unlikely that all residential structures were occupied
simultaneously. Nevertheless, they do provide a general idea as to the maximum
number of families that may have occupied individual settlements.
Although precise counts of residential structures in many instances cannot be
reliably tabulated from the Texas and Oklahoma site forms for a number of different
reasons, site records do indicate that most of the remaining 83 Antelope Creek sites
not included in Table 4.7 probably represent residences of one or two families (Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas 2003). A few larger sites were noted, however, and include
Landergin Mesa and Saddleback Ruin in Texas and Casto-Nash in Oklahoma. As
such, it is clear that many of the largest Antelope Creek sites are unequally represented
in the sample shown in Table 4.7. This is not particularly surprising, considering that
large settlements have traditionally attracted greater research attention.

Figures indicate that either one or two or six or seven residential structures are present

Based on site records, descriptions from published sources, and site visits by
the author it is estimated that approximately 73% (N=83) of all Antelope Creek
settlements were home to one or two families and only 16% (N=18) of the sites
contained three or four families. Given the extensive pedestrian survey conducted in
the area coupled with the increased visibility afforded by large sites, it is likely that
most, if not all, of the largest settlements have been documented. Based on the
number residential structures present, these settlements probably contained between

116

five to 12 families. There are only about 12 known sites (11%) that fall into this
largest settlement category.
Figure 4.7 shows that clusters of three to six individual settlements are present
along many tributaries to the Canadian River. Bell and Brooks (2002:207) refer to
these clusters as “settlement districts.” Generally, sites within clusters are separated
by one hundred to several hundred meters and have been recorded as individual sites.
If occupied contemporaneously, however, these sites could represent dispersed
hamlets inhabited by several families.
While a paucity of radiocarbon dates generally precludes our ability to address
issues of contemporaneity among sites within these clusters, to treat them as isolates
could in some cases greatly underestimate the actual size of Antelope Creek phase
settlements. In other words, to use the number of habitation structures present at
individual sites as a final measure of settlement size may be misleading in some cases
(e.g, Table 4.7). In particular, given their placement and close proximity to one
another, it is likely that many of the sites along Antelope Creek and near the Alibates
quarry were occupied contemporaneously (see Lintz 1986a, 1986b). Considered as
single settlements, rather than clusters of temporally unrelated sites, the maximum
number of families at each of these localities is approximately 14 families along
Antelope Creek and 25 families in the Alibates Ruin cluster (Figure 4.8). If these
assumptions are valid, then these are among the largest settlements currently
documented for the phase.

117

Figure 4.8 Alibates Ruins and Antelope Creek Settlements (adapted from Lintz
1986a:Figures 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 50, 52, and 53).

118

It is also important to note that the number of individual Antelope Creek
family groups occupying dispersed settlements can be highly variable. For example,
dispersed sites found in the study area can either represent single-family residences
(e.g., Jack Allen) or an aggregation of households (e.g., Roy Smith and Saddleback).
Likewise, in instances where several individually recorded sites are closely spaced
along a single drainage, settlements may include single-family homesteads, multifamily settlements or a combination of both.
The Archie King Ruins along Couch Creek provides a typical example of
Antelope Creek settlement in the Canadian River valley (Figure 4.9). These sites have
recently been relocated by Doug Wilkens and represent a series of 14 permanent
habitation structures with stone foundations scattered along a 5 km section of Couch
Creek in Roberts County, Texas. These 14 structures are roughly clustered into four
settlements separated from one another by 840 m, 3360 m, and 650 m. Each of these
sites sits atop prominent knolls overlooking the valley bottom and contains two to four
freestanding habitation structures. It should be noted that the position of structures as
shown for each site in Figure 4.9 do not represent precise locations.
The Archie King Ruins are comparable in size and composition to many of the
settlement clusters shown in Figure 4.7. These examples do not conform to a dual
framework of dispersed and aggregated settlements and highlight another problem that
often plagues settlement studies: determining the contemporaneity of residential
structures and settlements. In many of the examples examined here, it is not possible
to verify whether houses at an individual site or among adjacent sites should be treated
as serially or contemporaneously occupied habitation structures.

119

While there is

currently no way of resolving this issue, it is not appropriate to broadly assume that
either all settlements were occupied at the same time or that individual sites along a
drainage are a result of short-distance residential moves by a single family or a group
of families. It is likely that examples of both scenarios are represented.

Figure 4.9 The Archie King Ruins.

The preceding examination of Antelope Creek settlement has been aided
immensely by the high visibility afforded by the stone architectural features
constructed by these groups. Unfortunately, this high visibility has also resulted in the
widespread destruction of sites. Ultimately, these discussions have sought to identify
the manner in which settlements and the households that occupied them were

120

distributed across the landscape. As such, this study may be aptly described as a
spatial or locational analysis.
When viewed as a whole, these results demonstrate that a great deal of
variability exists in the way in which Antelope Creek family groups were dispersed
across the landscape. Nearly three-quarters of the known settlements contained only
one or two families. However, it is apparent that many of these sites are often loosely
aggregated along a single drainage with several other households to form dispersed
communities or hamlets. Larger isolated settlements or extended villages composed
of several individually recorded sites are not very common (N=12). From a regional
standpoint, these settlements were not particularly large and usually contained
between five and 14 households. The Alibates Ruins, consisting of Alibates Ruin 28,
28a, and 30, is a notable exception to this pattern and may have contained as many 25
families. Considering the small size of most Antelope Creek sites, it is likely that the
Alibates Ruins and other large settlements of the phase dominated the social
landscape.
The reasons underlying Antelope Creek settlement variability are not well
understood at this time. Nonetheless, the predominant pattern of dispersed households
or loose clusters of family groups seems to fit well with reconstructions that suggest
these groups were largely foragers who occupied fairly permanent residences. This
settlement strategy would have enabled groups to effectively and efficiently exploit
the regions’ natural resources. Quite anomalous to this pattern, however, are larger
settlements of the phase. Considering that water or food resources are often distantly
located from these sites, it is apparent that the emergence of these settlements cannot

121

be adequately explained using ecological models. In fact, like the previous work
undertaken by Lintz (1986a), with the exception of the Alibates silicified dolomite
quarries, this study also failed to identify any resource that was clearly associated with
large settlements (e.g., arable land).

It is concluded that settlement variability,

particularly the presence of large settlements, is related to important differences in the
way that individual communities were organized socially, economically, and
politically.

Support for the existence of inequalities among large and small

settlements of the region is demonstrated by the distribution of exotic exchange items
and the organization of economies (Chapters Six and Seven).
So what do settlement locations and their size tell us about the nature of
conflict for this area? These data are somewhat contradictory and can be interpreted
in a number of different ways. First, differences in settlement size and the degree of
aggregation may indicate that the threat of conflict may have varied either through
time or from one settlement to another. Unfortunately, chronological information
currently available for the phase is not detailed enough at this time to model these
changes through time. Nevertheless, instances where homesteads are dispersed along
drainages certainly appear to suggest that warfare was not a major concern for the
occupants of these sites. In contrast, larger settlements situated along the valley rim or
atop high mesas and far from important resources seem to indicate that the threat of
violence was very real. Indeed, these data as well as evidence for widespread burning
of residential structures and skeletal remains with evidence for traumatic death suggest
that warfare was prevalent.

122

Mortuary Practices
Burials of the Antelope Creek phase occur both on sites and on promontories
overlooking sites (Baker and Baker 2000; Green 1986; Lintz 1986a; Watson 1950).
Interments on sites occur in abandoned structures and midden deposits. Often burials
were covered with a pavement of stone to form rock cairns approximately 1 x 1 m in
size. These features were frequently placed on promontories or knolls overlooking
sites, and in some instances, are marked by ceremonially “killed” cordmarked vessels.
Most burials represent single interments, although multiple grouped burials at
some sites, such as Big Blue, Footprint, and Antelope Creek 22a suggest the
development of cemeteries at some localities (see Couzzourt and Schmidt-Couzzourt
1996; Green 1986:75-82; Lintz 1986a:318, 375-376; Summers 1997).

Overall,

locations containing more than four to six individuals are rare. Generally, burials are
semi-flexed and were not typically placed in any formal or patterned orientation. In
addition, burials were usually not accompanied by grave goods, although a few
examples contain utilitarian items or jewelry produced from exotic materials (Chapter
Six).

In general, the lack of associated grave items with most burials has led

researchers to suggest that the phase was characterized by “little to no status
differentiation” among individuals (Brooks 1994b; Lintz 1986a:32).

The Odessa Phase (A.D. 1250-1475)
In the discussion that follows a description of the Odessa phase is provided.
Although much work remains to be completed with this recently defined Middle
Ceramic entity, a fairly detailed description of the temporal and spatial distribution of
sites, subsistence economy, site architecture and features, settlement patterns, and

123

mortuary behavior is possible at this time (see Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.). Key
characteristics of Odessa phase settlements include the occupation of circular to oval
pithouses, settlement adjacent to highly fertile floodplain soils, high percentages of
ceramics with distinctively decorated rims, chipped stone assemblages that contain a
combination of Alibates silicified dolomite and Smoky Hill jasper, and almost always,
nonlocal trade items derived from the Southwest. Although the origin of Odessa
phase remains unclear at this time, the available data strongly suggests that these
populations moved northeast following A.D. 1400 and formed a substantial part of the
Little River focus of the Great Bend aspect (Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt
n.d.).
Middle Ceramic sites at the Buried City locality are also included in the
Odessa phase (Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.).

This well-known

locality represents a concentration of Middle Ceramic sites along an 8 km stretch of
Wolf Creek in Ochiltree County, Texas. Previously, these sites have been attributed to
the Antelope Creek focus of the Panhandle aspect (Krieger 1946), the Antelope Creek
phase of the Upper Canark variant (Lintz 1986), and most recently, the Buried City
complex (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). In the latter formulation it is generally
presumed that the Buried City complex is included in the Upper Canark variant (e.g.,
Brooks 1989:80; Drass 1997:418), although this relationship has never been formally
clarified (see Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987).

Recent investigations have shed

considerable light on the taxonomic relationship of Buried City to surrounding cultural
complexes. These data indicate that the existing taxonomic scheme, which places the

124

Buried City sites in the Upper Canark variant, is in need of modification. Justification
for placement of the Buried City sites in the Odessa phase is addressed here.
The Buried City sites were first formally investigated by T. L. Eyerly of the
Canadian Academy, Canadian, Texas, in 1907 (see Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:723 for a review of investigations).

Subsequent excavations at the locality were

conducted in following decade by Jesse Fewkes, Fred H. Sterns, C. B. Franklin, and
Warren K. Moorehead. The results of these investigations provided few important
details beyond the existence of a sizeable Middle Ceramic period settlement
containing square to rectangular structures with wall foundations comprised of
unmodified caliche boulders and a Plains Village tradition cultural assemblage
(Moorehead 1931:94-106).
Except for a brief investigation by Tom Ellzey (1966), no systematic
investigations were conducted at Buried City from 1920 until 1985. Beginning in
1985, four field seasons of excavations were conducted under the direction of David
Hughes (Hughes 1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). These investigations also
concentrated on the excavation of stone foundation houses and other related habitation
features. Immediately following the second field season a new cultural unit known as
the Buried City complex was defined for small number of sites along Wolf Creek
(Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987).

Although key traits of Buried City complex,

including architecture, settlement pattern, material culture, burial practices,
chronology, and distribution, were defined, its taxonomic relationship to the Antelope
Creek phase, was not explicitly addressed.

125

Overall, the differences between these two cultural units seem quite minor.
Architecturally, the stone foundation houses present at Buried City were essentially
identical to those of the Antelope Creek phase, except that they were noticeably larger
(60-130 m2 of floor space) and had wall foundations consisting of unmodified caliche
boulders rather than cut stone placed on edge as is typical among Antelope Creek
phase sites (see Hughes 1991:101; Moorehead 1931:102). A major difference was the
high percentages of decorated ceramics at Buried City (decorated ceramics are rare at
Antelope Creek phase sites). Hughes (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:103, 105)
suggested that additional sites might be eventually be attributed to the Buried City
complex.

Since that time, however, sites containing stone architecture, similar

quantities and types of decorated ceramics, as well as presenting other key traits
identified for the complex have not been documented.

As such, the original

distribution, an eight km stretch of Wolf Creek near Lake Fryer, still remains
applicable.
To many, the differences between the Buried City complex and the Antelope
Creek phase seem relatively slight; hence the inclusion of the Wolf Creek sites in the
Upper Canark variant. Nevertheless, the act of formally defining the Buried City sites
as a separate and distinct Middle Ceramic entity clearly indicates that D. Hughes
viewed these sites as unique from those of the Antelope Creek phase. With additional
fieldwork at related sites to the north and east and further work at Buried City since
1987 the nature and extent of variation between the two complexes has become much
clearer. In particular, it is apparent that the presence of stone architecture as a key
cultural trait of the Buried City complex is less important than previously thought.

126

These findings force us to alter many long-held ideas about this important locality and
its taxonomic relationship to other sites in the region.
From 1989 to 1994 Drass and Turner (1989) and Brooks (1994a) reported on
research conducted at Middle Ceramic sites in western Ellis and northern Beaver
counties, Oklahoma. These site locations are about 80 km northeast and 75 km east of
Buried City, respectively. Based largely on the types of decorated ceramics present, it
was concluded that these localities were most closely related to the Buried City
complex. However, since these sites lacked stone architecture, a key attribute of the
complex, the cultural historical placement of these sites remained unclear.
Since 1998 considerable fieldwork and analysis of private collections has been
conducted by author from the Arkansas River drainage in western Kansas to the
Canadian River in the Texas panhandle.

In particular, these investigations have

focused on the geographic area between Buried City and the research areas examined
by Drass (Drass and Turner 1989) and Brooks (1994). Similar to the findings of the
latter researchers, these investigations also documented Middle Ceramic sites which
lacked stone architecture, but had an abundance of decorated ceramics. Comparative
analyses of these assemblages indicated that significant differences between these
newly recorded sites and Antelope Creek phase sites in the Oklahoma panhandle
(Brosowske 2000). These differences included the use of Alibates silicified dolomite
and Smoky Hill jasper for chipped stone tool production, high percentages of
decorated ceramics, and the common occurrence of Southwestern trade items at the
new sites. Later, excavations at the Odessa Yates site documented ovate to circular
semi-subterranean pithouses which bear no resemblance to the stone architectural

127

structures of the Buried City complex or Antelope Creek phase. Discussions with
other researchers and a review of site records indicated that pithouses were also
present at other nearby related sites, but had remained unrecognized (see Bevitt 1999;
Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site Files 2002).
Beginning in 2000 the author became actively engaged in field research at
Buried City. To my surprise, an initial analysis of the Buried City cultural assemblage
indicated that all aspects of these assemblages were nearly identical to the sites noted
above (Note: I had not previously viewed these materials). Given these similarities it
was hypothesized semi-subterranean structures were also present at Buried City, but
for unknown reasons had remained undocumented. Subsequent discussions with D.
Hughes did indeed indicate that while stone architectural features were the primary
focus of his 1985 to 1991 investigations, several pithouses were recorded.

For

example,
“Excavations in 1985 and 1986 showed a basic architectural sequence
beginning with a small, roughly circular pit that may represent a
pithouse with a central hearth, but no evidence of wall posts. This was
overlain by the main Courson B house, which was about 8 meters
square, inside the nearly 1-meter thick stone wall bases” (Hughes
1991:120).

A similar architectural sequence involving pithouses overlaid by stone structures also
appears to be described much earlier by Moorhead (1931:101):

“Our party extended a trench outside the west wall, full length of the
building (a large stone foundation structure known as the Temple or
Gould Ruin), finding near the center a large ash pit or fireplace, 5 or 6
feet in extent. It was long in use, being hard burned, and its base was
some 5 feet below the present surface, and extended under the wall.
With this discovery, we were led to the conclusion that a lodge site

128

existed before the walls of the Gould ruin were erected. Indeed, 2 or 3
ruins presented similar conditions”.

These findings appeared to support the initial hypothesis that pithouses were present at
Buried City. Nonetheless, the abundance, distribution, and temporal relationship of
these house forms to the more visible stone structures still remained poorly
understood.
In 2000 and 2001 shallow, subsurface geophysical surveys were conducted at
several locations at the Buried City locality in hopes of further clarifying an
architectural sequence. These investigations identified numerous features thought to
represent semi-subterranean pithouses. The presence of oval and circular pithouse
forms were confirmed by subsequent excavations carried out in 2001 and 2003
(Brosowske et al. 2003). In sum, recent investigations suggest that semi-subterranean
pithouses are the dominant house form at Buried City and may outnumber stone
foundation houses by as many as ten-to-one (Brosowske et al. 2003; Brosowske and
Maki 2002). Like the pithouses described above, the Buried City pithouses do not
contain any of the distinct architectural features associated with stone foundation
structures (e.g., extended entries, central floor channels, raised benches, etc.).
Analysis of cultural materials recovered from pithouses and stone foundation
structures at Buried City clearly indicate occupation by a single population of Plains
Villagers rather than the replacement of one group by another. Radiocarbon dating of
architectural forms demonstrates that semi-subterranean pithouses predate the earliest
stone foundation houses.

Available radiocarbon dates demonstrate occupation of

pithouses from about A.D. 1250 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1380. The earliest square

129

stone foundation houses may have appeared as early A.D. 1330. The latest dates
suggest that the Buried City locality was abandoned sometime around A.D. 1400.
Altogether, these data indicate that pithouses were the original house form at Buried
City and that the stone foundation structures were a later development. Overall,
except for the appearance of stone structures later in the sequence, it is clear that all
other aspects of the Buried City locality closely parallel those of Odessa phase
settlements to the north and east.
For reasons presented here it is suggested that the existing taxonomic
framework of the region be modified to include the Buried City sites in the Odessa
phase. While it is recognized that the Buried City complex as defined by D. Hughes
(Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987) precedes the framework presented here, it is
proposed that the Odessa phase be used instead.

The idea that the Buried City

complex could be elevated to the status of a phase and its key traits redefined to
include other related Middle Ceramic sites to the north and east was also carefully
considered. It is likely, however, that such a framework would always invoke an
association between these sites and stone architecture, a situation that only occurs at
the Buried City locality. In addition, given that the Buried City locality has long been
viewed as closely related to the Antelope Creek phase, a situation that now seems less
likely, it is probable that retention of the Buried City label would result in the
persistence of these ideas. Current data suggests that a close ancestral relationship did
not exist between Odessa and Antelope Creek phase societies.
As described in more detail below, the Odessa phase refers to a Middle
Ceramic period population that occupied portions of southwest Kansas southward to

130

the Wolf Creek valley from A.D. 1250 to about A.D. 1475. These horticultural
societies produced ceramics that display a variety of decorations, used tool stone
derived from the Southern and Central Plains, were actively involved in intersocietal
exchange, and occupied permanent settlements containing ovate to circular pithouses.
These cultural characteristics also clearly apply to the Buried City locality. What
remains unclear, are the reasons why the Buried City locality was the only Odessa
phase community that elected to emulate the architecture of neighboring populations
after nearly 100 years of living in pithouses. Although this question may never be
fully answered, the location of this settlement near the margins areas occupied by the
Antelope Creek phase and other related populations is a likely place to witness such a
development.
Distribution
Pedestrian survey, the recording of sites undertaken while documenting private
collections, and excavation are used to identify the distribution of Odessa phase sites
(e.g., Bement and Brosowske 1998, 2001; Bevitt 1999; Brooks 1994a; Brosowske
2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.; Brosowske et al. 2000; Drass and Turner 1989; D.
Hughes 1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). Sites occur in a north to south band
along the High Plains border from southern Kansas into the Oklahoma and Texas
panhandles (Figure 4.10). Sites are found in Meade County, Kansas, Beaver and Ellis
counties in Oklahoma, and Ochiltree and Lipscomb counties in Texas. To the east, in
Harper County, Oklahoma and Clark, and Comanche counties in Kansas, the cultural
affiliation of Middle Ceramic age sites is less clear due to the paucity of investigations
and/or the limited sizes of assemblages from these sites. Nonetheless, as additional

131

work is completed some of these sites will eventually be included in the phase or some
other closely related entity.

Figure 4.10 Distribution of Odessa Phase Settlements.

Currently, approximately 85 permanent habitation sites are documented and
cover a geographical area of approximately 160 km north to south and 140 km east to
west. Combined, these sites represent a sizeable Plains Village population. Key sites
include Odessa Yates (34BV100), Lundeen (14MD306), Lonker (34BV4), Sprague
(34BV99), Schwab (34BV130), Miller (34EL25), 34BV130, sites previously included

132

in the Buried City complex, and Watson, one of several unrecorded settlements in
Lipscomb County, Texas (see Bement and Brosowske 2001; Brosowske and Bevitt
n.d.; Drass and Turner 1989; Ellzey 1966, 1985; Eyerly 1907a, 1907b, 1912; D.
Hughes 1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987).
As seen in Figure 4.10, Odessa phase sites in southern Kansas do not seem to
be very common. This pattern may be more apparent than real, as little of this portion
of the distribution has received systematic survey. Presence of the Lundeen site and
other related settlements along Crooked Creek, however, clearly indicates that Odessa
populations occupied this portion of the region. Overall, sites presently included in
this distribution are quite homogenous and clearly warrant their inclusion in the phase.
Temporal Span
Currently, there are a total of 34 dates from 10 different Odessa phase sites
(Table 4.8) (Bevitt 1999; Brooks 1994a; Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt
n.d.; Drass and Turner 1989; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). Although the vast
majority of known sites remain undated, dates are available from both small and large
settlements across the entire distribution. Of these dates, only two are clearly in error
or date a component later than the Middle Ceramic period (WIS-97, DIC-3280). A
third date is also inaccurate (Beta 20277). The latter was obtained from the central
hearth in the Kit Courson house. An additional date obtained from this same hearth
(Beta-20871) coupled with additional dates from along Wolf Creek suggest that this
house was occupied during the fourteenth century and that the earlier date is in error.
Disregarding these three dates, which are all from the Buried City locality, the
remaining dates indicate occupation of the region by Odessa phase societies from

133

about A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1475, a period of 225 years (Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske
and Bevitt n.d.).

Excluding the three erroneous dates from Buried City, these data enable
various temporal trends in Odessa phase settlement, the length of occupation for
communities, and changes in residential architecture for the phase to be examined.
Although the available dates are from 10 individual sites, six of these are part of the

134

Buried City locality (i.e., 41OC1, 41OC26, 41OC27, 41OC29, 41OC43, 41OC48) and
should be considered as areas within a single large settlement. There are seven dates
from the Clear Creek locality, but all of these are from an individual site (i.e., Odessa
Yates). Thus, the available dates are actually derived from five different Odessa phase
settlements.

Two of these settlements represent large extended Odessa phase

communities along Wolf and Clear creeks while the remaining three represent small
settlements (i.e., Lonker, Lundeen, and Miller).
Currently, there are 16 dates from the Buried City locality (spanning A.D.
1256 to about A.D. 1400) and six dates from the Clear Creek locality (A.D. 1280 to
A.D. 1476). These dates document the establishment and long-term occupation of
pithouse villages of the Odessa phase.

Assuming that these settlements were

continuously occupied, the length of occupation of these communities (at least 144
and 196 years) is comparable to that noted above for the Antelope Creek phase.
Despite the limited number of dates, using the same periods defined earlier for the
Antelope Creek phase (see Table 4.4) it is possible to tentatively examine a few broad
temporal trends in settlement for the phase (Table 4.9).

These data are also

standardized using the same methods applied above.

In contrast to the patterns noted above for the Antelope Creek phase, over half
of the available dates for the Odessa phase appear to document occupation between
A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1300. Although less meaningful since so few settlements have
been dated, when these figures are standardized it is apparent that approximately 66%
of all the Odessa phase dates are from this early period. These patterns also appear to
indicate rapid settlement of the region by Odessa phase groups. Through time the
number of dates declines fairly rapidly from an apparent peak during the first period.
Examining the standardized figures, the number of dates decreases from 66%, to 23%
in the middle period, and finally, to 11% during the last period. The available data
indicate that four of the five dated settlements (80%) were established prior to A.D.
1300 (i.e., Buried City and Clear Creek localities, and Lonker and Lundeen). During
the fourteenth century three of these settlements were still occupied (i.e., Buried City
and Clear Creek localities, and Lundeen) and a fourth was established (i.e., Miller).
Following A.D. 1400, only the Clear Creek locality and Miller appear to have been
occupied. Whether or not these data indicate that Odessa phase populations were
experiencing trends toward increasing aggregation at large settlements or a decline in
population through time is not known.

It is clear that many more dates from

additional sites are needed for Odessa phase sites to help clarify temporal and spatial
trends in settlement.

Subsistence Economy
Using multiple forms of evidence a fairly accurate reconstruction of the
subsistence economy of Odessa phase populations is possible at this time. Faunal and

136

floral remains have recently been recovered during systematic excavations at several
sites (i.e., Odessa Yates, Lonker, Lundeen, Miller, and several sites along Wolf Creek)
and provide excellent information on the subsistence economy for these groups (see
Bevitt 1999; Brooks 1994; Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.; Brosowske
et al. 2000, 2003; Drass and Turner 1987; D. Hughes 1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones
1987). Additional support for economic reconstructions is derived from settlement
patterns, storage features, and material assemblages.

This information strongly

supports the idea that Odessa groups practiced an economy of intensive horticulture,
hunting, and foraging. Unfortunately, precise determinations of the contribution of
each these strategies to the overall diet are difficult to assess. Current information,
however, appears to suggest that all Odessa phase subsistence economies were heavily
reliant on horticulture, but that hunting strategies may have varied among settlements.
Flotation analyses, tool types, abundant storage features, and settlement
patterns all indicate that horticulture was an important component of the diet for all
Odessa phase societies. Table 4.10 provides a list of cultivated and native plants
recovered from Odessa phase sites. In general, corn is ubiquitous in all features at
sites and represents the most commonly recovered plant species. Fragments of beans
and squash have also been recovered, but their true importance to the diet is difficult
to assess since they are seldom preserved. A wide variety of wild plant remains are
also recovered and include goosefoot, sunflower, marshelder, various grass seeds,
purslane, bulrush, prickly pear, and little barley. The size of marshelder and sunflower
seeds at some sites suggests that Odessa populations were also cultivating these plants.

The presence of deep storage pits (e.g., bell-shaped and straight-sided
examples), coupled with abundant bison scapula hoes and tibia digging sticks and
settlement on highly fertile soils all suggest a marked dependence on horticulture.
Oftentimes, groundstone tools are relatively rare at many Odessa phase sites (Brooks
1994a:6; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.). Although fragments of metates and a few one
and two-handed manos ranging in size from 13 to 22 cm in length been recovered, the
infrequency of groundstone suggests that Odessa phase groups used another method,
such as wooden mortars and pestles, for processing domesticated and wild plant foods.
The data presented above indicate that a variety of tropical cultigens and native plants
provided an important contribution to the diet of these Plains Villagers. Overall, these

138

groups appear to have engaged in a multicropping strategy, and in some cases it is
likely that some settlements structured bison hunting around the demands of farming.
The faunal inventories recovered from Odessa phase sites suggest that two
different types of hunting economies may have been practiced: broad-scale hunting
and specialized bison hunting. Broad-scale hunting strategies appear represented at
small, relatively isolated homesteads (Lundeen and Lonker) and some large villages
(Buried City locality). At these sites, virtually every available terrestrial, aquatic, and
avian animal species was hunted or collected (Bevitt 1999; Brooks 1994a; Brosowske
et al. 2003). Also of interest is the fact that deer and antelope remains typically
outnumber or equal that of bison.
These data suggest that broad-scale hunting strategies were more widespread at
Middle Ceramic sites of the region than is usually recognized (see Chapter Seven). In
general, even though minimum number of individuals (MNI) or number of identified
specimens (NISP) indices may indicate that bison outnumber other large mammals at
many sites of the region, it is probable that the importance of non-bison species to the
diet have been underemphasized. In these cases, to broadly suggest that bison were
the most important resource can be misleading and potentially ignores important
differences in economic and social organization among sites.
The second hunting strategy represented at Odessa phase sites is an almost
complete reliance on bison. Currently, this strategy is only documented at a single
settlement, Odessa Yates. Bison comprise 93 to 99% of all faunal remains from
excavated features at this site (see Chapter Seven; Appendix II). The season of kills
determined from eruption and wear patterns of tooth rows and the presence of fetal or

139

new born individuals at Odessa Yates also indicate that most kills took place from fall
through spring (Table 4.11). These data suggest that spring kills were most common,
although it is possible that the ease in which fetal or new born animals are identified
(i.e., the porosity and small size of elements) may exaggerate the actual importance of
these events. Whatever the case may be, the paucity of evidence for summer kills
(MNI=2) suggest that bison hunting was organized around the demands of farming.
While hunting was clearly important during the colder months of the year, the
presence of animals killed during every season indicates that bison were locally
available throughout the year.

Analyses of bison remains from Odessa Yates also indicate that kills took
place close to the site. This is supported by the consistent presence of nearly all
skeletal elements, including those of low utility from every excavated feature at the
site (Figure 4.11; see Emerson 1993).

If entire bison carcasses were typically

transported back to villages for processing, it does not seem likely that kill sites will
be found in the area. Once the meat was stripped, elements were smashed to remove
marrow and boiled to extract bone grease. The intensiveness of processing is aptly
demonstrated by the fact that nearly 97% of all bison bone recovered is less than 50
mm in maximum length (Table 4.12). The processing strategies resulted in few
burned elements (see Appendix II).

Architecture
Excavation at Odessa phase sites has documented two primary types of
features: domestic habitation structures and storage facilities. Although many other
types of features were undoubtedly present, historic agricultural activities at many
sites appear to have destroyed most shallowly buried features. This appears to be case
at sites, such as Odessa Yates, where most of the aboriginal ground surface has been
plowed away and only cultural features excavated into the subsoil are preserved.
Elsewhere, such as along Wolf and Kiowa creeks, many sites have not been plowed
and may eventually provide a more complete picture of site features (see Bement and
Brosowske 2001; Brosowske and Maki 2002; Brosowske et al. 2003).
The most common residential structure at Odessa phase sites is the semisubterranean pithouse. Although their presence has been noted at several sites (e.g.,
Bement and Brosowske 2001; Bevitt 1999; Brosowske 2000; Brosowske and Maki
2002; Brosowske et al. 2003; D. Hughes 1991; Hughes-Jones 1987:96; Oklahoma
Archeological Survey Site Files 2002), very few examples have been completely
excavated. As a result, many of the specific architectural details of pithouse forms

142

remain unknown. Excavated and cored examples indicate that circular to oval forms 4
to 8 m in diameter and whose floors were 0.8 to 1.8 m below the aboriginal surface are
most common (Figure 4.12). Small closely spaced posts 5 to 10 cm in diameter are
typically found around the perimeter, and within the pit itself. Single or pairs of larger
central posts supported the roof. Internal features documented include shallow basin
shaped hearths, small antechamber rooms, and shallow depressions of unknown
function. Entry to houses is currently not known. Additional information regarding
wall and roof construction remains an enigma as all of the houses investigated appear
to have been dismantled and materials salvaged. After abandonment, pithouses were
typically filled with trash debris. Although many details surrounding these pithouses
are not known, it is readily apparent that these houses are in no way reminiscent of the
square to rectangular shallow surface structures documented at Antelope Creek,
Zimms, or other related sites.
A second house type has been documented at Odessa Yates and at several sites
along Wolf Creek, including Courson A (41OC26), Courson B (41OC27), and
Courson D (41OC29). These houses are also circular to oval, but are usually much
smaller and shallower than the house forms discussed above (Figure 4.12). Of the
four examples known, house forms are about 2.5 to 4.0 m in diameter and were only
about 40 to 60 cm below aboriginal ground surface.

Shallow basin hearths are

typically found in the eastern half of these houses.

Once again wall and roof

construction remain unclear, although a small central post and wall posts are
documented in two examples. Dates obtained for these structures suggest that they
were used throughout the duration of the phase. This house form is identical to

143

structures found at several Little River focus sites in central Kansas (e.g., 14PA307
and 14RC306).

Figure 4.12 Odessa Phase House Forms (adapted from Hughes 1991:Figures 5, 7 and 21).

144

The last type of house documented for Odessa phase is the square to
rectangular surface structure with stone foundations (see D. Hughes 1991; Hughes and
Hughes-Jones 1987; Moorehead 1931:94-106). This form of residential architecture is
virtually identical to those of the Antelope Creek phase, only much larger (Figure
4.12). These structures typically range between 60 and 130 m2 in size (see Moorehead
1931) and are often characterized by central floor channels, four central posts,
extended entryways, plastered hearths with collars, and adjoining external rooms. As
noted earlier, these house forms are present only at the Buried City locality.
Additional Odessa phase sites are documented approximately 10 to 15 km downstream
from Buried City, but stone foundation structures are not present at these sites.
Pithouses and surface stone foundation houses are both well documented at the
Buried City locality (see Brosowske and Maki 2002; Brosowske et al. 2003; D.
Hughes 1991). Although the chronological relationship between these house forms is
not entirely clear at this time, the available dates indicate that stone foundation house
forms are a later development (Table 4.13). Presently, six dates are available for five
pithouses along Wolf Creek. Five of these dates document pithouse construction from
about A.D. 1270 to 1300 and the other dates to the fourteenth century. Cache pit
features associated with a pithouse at 41OC27 that dated to A.D. 1271 also yielded
dates before A.D. 1300 (i.e., DIC 3228; DIC 3300; DIC 3301). All of these features
underlie and predate a later stone structure. Currently, there are only two acceptable
dates that directly date large stone foundation structures at the Buried City locality.
Each of these dates documents construction of these architectural forms during the
fourteenth century (Table 4.13).

As discussed earlier, the available evidence clearly indicates that semisubterranean pithouses are the earliest house form along Wolf Creek and at other
Odessa phase settlements. At present, the few available dates suggest that stone
foundation houses are a later development and are first built in the fourteenth century.
It is not known whether the latter totally replace pithouses or if the two forms continue
to be used simultaneously until Middle Ceramic groups abandoned the Buried City
locality sometime after A.D. 1400.
Storage facilities in the form of subterranean cache pits represent the most
abundant cultural feature encountered at Odessa phase sites. Both bell-shaped and
cylindrical varieties have been documented and excavated (see Bevitt 1999; Brooks
1994a; Brosowske et al. 2000; Brosowske et al. 2003; Drass and Turner 1987; Hughes
and Hughes-Jones 1987). These features are usually at least one meter in diameter and
at least that deep, although bell-shaped varieties tend to be larger (i.e., 1.5 m in
diameter and depth) and often have caliche-plastered interiors. Presumably, these
features only occur on permanent habitation sites and are associated with residential
architecture. The abundance of subterranean storage facilities at sites is difficult to
ascertain, but approximately 200 cache pits have been documented in a relatively

146

small portion (i.e., about 20%) of the Odessa Yates site through the identification of
positive crop marks, magnetic and resistance survey, and coring (Brosowske et al.
2000; Maki et al. 2003).
Settlement
Much of what is currently known about Odessa phase settlement patterns is
derived from large-scale pedestrian survey projects and site recording undertaken in
conjunction with the documentation of private collections (Bement and Brosowske
2001; Brosowske and Bement 1997, 1998; Brosowske et al. 2000). As noted above,
while some portions of the study area have been extensively surveyed, other areas still
remain virtually unknown.

Therefore, while many sites undoubtedly remain

unrecorded, the present information provides a reliable sample from which to
characterize settlement patterns for the phase.

In addition, it is clear that our

knowledge of Odessa phase settlement is biased toward permanent habitation sites.
However, if current reconstructions which suggest that Odessa phase settlements were
permanently occupied throughout the year are accurate, then non-site locations used
for short periods of time may be difficult to discern.
Permanent habitation sites for the Odessa phase include homesteads, hamlets,
and villages 20 to 40 hectares in size (e.g., Odessa Yates, Dicky Yates, 41OC1, and
34BV130). Settlements are almost always on the second terrace of streams, but unlike
other Middle Ceramic sites of the region, settlement locations are not documented atop
high bluffs, mesas, or valley rims overlooking streams. As a result, the use of salient
landforms as a guide for predicting or locating sites has yielded poor results. Initially,
why one site location was selected over another was not readily apparent.

147

Nonetheless, over time it has become fairly obvious that two ecological factors
influenced settlement locations: potable water and arable land.

Although the

importance of these resources have long been recognized by researchers of the Plains
Village tradition, the abundance and quality of these resources in the study area is
quite variable and appears to have influenced, and in some instances constrained,
settlement (see Chapter Seven).
By and large, the majority of Odessa phase settlements are in the upper
portions of spring fed tributaries. Selection of these locations was influenced by the
local bedrock geology and the impact it has on water quality. In the study area, water
may be obtained from the Permian age redbeds, Pliocene and Quaternary age deposits,
and alluvium. Groundwater available from the redbeds occurs primarily as springs or
seeps exposed in deeply incised streams of the study area. Water obtained from these
sources “is too high in sulfate and in some places is too high in chlorides to be used
for drinking” (Marine and Schoff 1962:57). Pliocene and Quaternary age deposits
overlie the Permian age redbeds and water obtained from these deposits, although
moderately hard, is suitable for human consumption. Lastly, alluvium is present in the
channels, floodplain, and low terraces of major rivers (e.g., the Beaver and Cimarron
Rivers) and the lower portions of some of the larger tributary streams (e.g., Clear,
Crooked, Duck Pond, Kiowa, and Wolf creeks). The quality of water obtained from
these locations is highly variable.
Odessa phase sites of all sizes are found primarily along drainages where the
redbeds have not been exposed through valley dissection and the down cutting of
streams. These settings most often occur in the upper portions of drainages that

148

originate on or near the margins of High Plains. It is in these locations that the
majority of Odessa phase sites are concentrated. There are, however, exceptions to
this rule. A few small homesteads have been documented along streams with poor
water quality. Each of these locations is adjacent to good springs and suggests that
sufficient amounts of potable water were available at these locations to meet the needs
of family sized groups. At this time it is unknown whether the latter settings were
only used after other better-watered locations were already occupied.

Although

quality drinking water was clearly a crucial resource to these Plains Villagers,
settlement was also influenced by the distribution of highly fertile soils.
The best soils available to prehistoric horticulturalists are generally assumed to
have occurred along drainages (see Wedel 1986; Will and Hyde 1964).

This is

certainly true of the study area, although the perimeters of some upland playa basins
and other upland settings may have also contained some fairly attractive soils.
Nonetheless, given the semiarid climate of the region, when located far from
permanent water sources it is unlikely that these areas would have been selected for
settlement. Soils suitable for prehistoric horticulture may be identified using the
capability classification system found in many county soil survey reports. This system
ranks the suitability, limitations, and risks of various soils under most farming
conditions (Allgood 1962:28).

Other measures, such as range productivity or

estimated yields per acre, are typically derived from yields of forage or crops whose
requirements are much different than that of maize. As a result, these are less useful
and are often misleading when presented as analogous measures for estimating
prehistoric horticultural productivity potential.

149

Using the capability classification system, it is apparent that soils adjacent to
Odessa phase settlements are consistently among the highest ranked in the region (i.e.,
Capability Class II soils). These soils (e.g., Spur, Bippus, or Canadian series soils)
have few limitations and are usually characterized as deep, dark, friable, loamy
floodplain soils that are easily worked, well drained, have a high moisture holding
capacity, and are rarely flooded (Allgood 1962). Given that the annual precipitation in
this portion of the Southern Plains is about 20 to 23 inches, bottomland soils with such
qualities were probably crucial for consistent horticultural yields. Another important
feature of these soils is that they tend to make up a very small percentage of all
available soils. For example, in most counties of the area these soils comprise about
1% of the entire county.
In sum, the selection of settlement locations by Odessa phase populations
appears to have been restricted largely to areas where both potable water and highly
fertile soils were available. Because geological factors within the study area are such
that locations containing both of these resources are fairly rare, settings fulfilling both
these requirements probably represented valuable resources that were worth defending
or fighting over (Chapter Seven). Settlement in the upper ends of tributaries is also
attractive to horticulturalists because the risk of flooding is greatly diminished in these
areas. Combined, each of these environmental factors has been used to predict the
location of Odessa phase settlements with some degree of accuracy (see Bement and
Brosowske 2001).
Thus far I have briefly mentioned that sites of varying sizes have been
documented for the phase. In the northern half of the distribution sites are generally

150

small and probably represent single-family homesteads. Lonker and Lundeen are two
examples in this class that have received fairly substantial to extensive subsurface
investigations (see Bevitt 1999; Brooks 1994a). Sites in this area are generally well
dispersed, although site densities are higher in some settings and likely represent
hamlets containing several families. In contrast, sites in the southern half of the
distribution are much more densely clustered and often include very large individual
settlements. Such settlement patterns appear to represent aggregated villages from 4
to 12 km in length. Villages are currently documented along Clear, Wolf, Coon,
Kiowa, and possibly, Duck Pond, creeks (Figure 4.13). Occupation along these creeks
is reminiscent of the villages described by Coronado on his visit to Quivira in 1541
(Bolton 1949:290-298).

Although site contemporaneity is always difficult to

demonstrate, multiple dates obtained from several sites in the Wolf Creek cluster
suggest that at least some of these sites were occupied contemporaneously. Likewise,
contemporaneous dates from the Buried City and Clear Creek localities indicate that at
least some of these large villages were occupied at the same time.
Documentation of other site types is limited primarily to mortuary sites (see
Mortuary Practices). A survey of playas has documented, albeit poorly, use of these
settings by Odessa groups (see Brosowske and Bement 1998). Identification of these
locations is based on the recovery of diagnostic materials and suggests short-term use
possibly for the procurement of unknown native plant resources (Brosowske and
Bement 1998).

151

Figure 4.13 Odessa Phase Extended Villages.

As mentioned earlier, the nature of Odessa settlement, subsistence, and
technological systems makes the identification of non-habitation sites particularly
difficult.

For example, an emphasis on high quality nonlocal lithic materials to

produce tools makes the documentation of the use of local sources of poorer quality by
these groups unlikely. In addition, while Odessa phase groups often relied heavily on
bison to meet their subsistence needs, pedestrian surveys focusing on locations
suitable for kills have failed to record any of these site types (see Buehler 1997).
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, current evidence suggests that Odessa phase

152

peoples were sedentary horticulturalists who may have been effectively tethered to
stored resources and cultivated fields at permanent habitation sites. Under these
conditions it seems less likely that additional site types were frequently used and
would be highly visible in the archaeological record.
Presently, the number of family groups occupying Odessa phase sites is poorly
understood given the limited visibility afforded by semi-subterranean pithouses. As
noted above, small sites, such as Lonker, Lundeen and others in the northern half of
the distribution, however, are very likely to represent settlements of one or two
families. In other cases, three or four households may be loosely clustered along a
single drainage to form hamlets.
The number of family groups that occupied the large extended villages of the
Odessa phase cannot be accurately determined at this time. As related above, these
villages are 4 to 12 km in length and contain many individually recorded habitation
sites that altogether frequently total one to several hundred hectares in size.
Radiocarbon dates from several sites along Wolf Creek (N=16) clearly indicate that
several of these individually recorded settlements were contemporaneously occupied
(see Table 4.8). Likewise, at 41OC26, 41OC27, and 41OC29, several adjacent sites in
the Buried City cluster, many residential structures have yielded dates that are
statistically the same. A somewhat similar scenario is documented at Odessa Yates, a
single large settlement within the Clear Creek locality. Of the small number of
residential structures that have actually been radiocarbon dated at Odessa Yates (N=5)
several suggest that at least some of these pithouses were inhabited at the same time
(see Table 4.8).

153

Geophysical survey, mapping of positive crop marks, and excavation at Odessa
Yates and the Buried City locality document comparable densities of residential
structures at Odessa phase extended villages. The minimum density of houses derived
from four different areas at the Odessa Yates site average about one residential
structure per 2000 m2 or five houses per hectare (Brosowske et al. 2000; Maki et al.
2003). At 41OC29, recent investigations have documented a minimum density of
residential structures of one house per 1500 m2 or about seven structures per hectare
(Brosowske and Maki 2002; Brosowske et al. 2003; Maki et al. 2003). These results
appear to indicate a slightly higher density of domestic structures along Wolf Creek
than Clear Creek.
Barring complete excavation of settlements coupled with an exhaustive
radiocarbon dating program, any means used to estimate the total number of family
groups that may have occupied Odessa phase extended villages is obviously fraught
with problems. Simply multiplying the number of residential structures per hectare by
the size of a single settlement produces population estimates that seem too high. For
example, at Odessa Yates, which is about 40 ha in size, the minimum density of figure
of five houses per hectare would suggest that approximately 200 houses were present.
It is possible, however, that these figures may represent portions of settlements that
were most intensively occupied and that lower densities characterized other portions.
Nonetheless, considering the residential structure density figures presented above and
accounting for the fact that only a relatively small percentage of the total houses
documented at a given site were occupied simultaneously, a conservative estimate for
the number of family groups occupying these Odessa phase settlements is five family

154

groups per linear kilometer of stream valley. Using this figure, estimates of between
20 and 60 families are suggested for each of the four currently documented Odessa
phase villages. Although these figures seem entirely reasonable, it is admitted that
many settlement variables still remain unknown at this time. Nonetheless, like the
settlement estimates provided earlier for the Antelope Creek phase, these figures do
provide some indication as to the probable size of settlements.
Mortuary Practices
Overall, the mortuary practices of Odessa phase remain poorly known.
Although burials are documented from several sites, the vast majority of these are not
well reported and are known primarily through discussions with avocationalists and
landowners. To compound this situation, a few sites, such as those along Wolf Creek,
are characterized by multiple occupations and some burials may actually represent use
by later groups. This almost certainly appears to be the case for burials excavated
from within the Courson B (41OC27) stone structure along Wolf Creek, which yielded
a date on human bone of A.D. 1656 (DIC-3280).
Numerous bluff top burials are documented along Wolf and Clear creeks (i.e.,
34BV19) and other drainages in Beaver County (Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site
Files 2002). Although most of these burials are near Odessa phase sites and are
probably associated with the phase, their age remains uncertain in the absence of
diagnostic artifacts and dating. As a result, only those examples that are clearly
associated with the phase are discussed here.
Burials associated with Odessa phase have been documented at several
residential sites along Wolf, Coon, Clear, Sand, and Kiowa creeks (Bement and

155

Brosowske 2001:32; L. Bussard 2003, personal communication; Courson and Wilkens
2000, personal communication; Eyerly 1912; D. Hughes 1991; Hughes and HughesJones 1987; Moorehead 1931; Oklahoma Archaeological Survey Site Files 2002).
Eyerly (1907a, 1907b, 1912) and Moorehead (1931) encountered human burials in
nearly every house structure they tested at the Buried City locality.

All of these

burials represent the interment of single individuals, however, as mentioned above, it
is possible that some of these are related to later occupations. Other burials at Buried
City which are definitely of Middle Ceramic age are interred in what may be
abandoned storage pits. In several instances, burial pits containing females are capped
with a pavement of stone and have ceramic vessels smashed on top of them
(Brosowske

2002b;

Brosowske

and

Maki

2002;

Bussard

2003,

personal

communication; Wilkens 2000, personal communication). These features, commonly
described as “pot drop” burials (see Figure 4.14), frequently contain bison tibia
digging sticks, ceramic vessels, marine shell and exotic stone jewelry, and mussel
shells as associated grave items. Burials of adult males are noticeably rare.
Despite the extremely limited number of well-excavated examples, evidence
for violent death is represented by two burials. Eyerly (1912:2) notes an individual
with an arrowpoint embedded in an unidentified bone at Buried City. A second burial
found during the grading of a borrow ditch near 34BV103 also had a Washita
arrowpoint embedded in the chest cavity (Kachel 1999, personal communication).
Overall, although the frequency of intertribal violence is difficult to assess for the
period, it is likely that warfare was much more common these societies than is
generally thought (see Brooks 1994b; Green 1986; Keeley 1996; LeBlanc 1999).

156

Assemblage Characteristics
In general, the material assemblages associated with Odessa phase sites contain
many of the diagnostic artifacts that serve to identify the Plains Village tradition as a
whole (see Lehmer 1971).

These items include globular cordmarked ceramics,

alternately beveled knives, triangular arrowpoints, distal endscrapers, drills, bison
bone hoes, digging sticks, and rasps, and others (see Lehmer 1971; Lintz 1986a;
Watson 1950 for lists of assemblage traits). However, because some features of
Odessa phase artifact classes are quite distinct from other Plains Village populations
of the region and because the phase has only been recently defined, the certain aspects
of assemblages are briefly examined here (see Brosowske and Bevitt n.d. for
additional discussion). In particular, these discussions focus on ceramics and lithic
raw material use.

Evidence for regular intersocietal exchange, a third important

characteristic, is examined in Chapter Six.

157

Odessa phase ceramic assemblages are characterized by a great deal of
variability. Sources of variability include the frequency and variety of decorated
vessels, temper, and surface treatment.

Decorations on ceramics occur almost

exclusively on the rim and neck portions of vessels (Figure 4.15). A few examples of
decorated shoulders are known, but these are relatively uncommon and usually consist
of incised chevron designs (Bevitt n.d.; Brosowske et al. 2000; Hughes and JonesHughes 1987). At most sites, rims are decorated 50% and 100% of the time. This is
in contrast with Antelope Creek sites where decorations on Borger cordmarked vessels
are not common (Lintz 1986a), but may increase in frequency at sites in the Oklahoma
panhandle. For example, the Stamper site has the highest frequency of decorated rims
(i.e., nearly 25%) of any known Antelope Creek phase site (Brosowske 2002b).

Figure 4.15 Odessa Phase Decorated Rim Sherds.

The types of rim decorations present at Odessa phase varies considerably, a
fact that has been previously noted for the Buried City locality (Bevitt n.d.; D. Hughes

158

1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987), although pinching and impressed designs are
most common. Single and multiple rows of pinching typically occur along the upper
half of the rim. Common impressed designs include diagonal stick or tool impressions
along the lip and shallow concave or cupped impressions at the lip/rim juncture. Strap
handles and lip tabs occur at some sites and may or may not be decorated with
incising. Other decorations include crenulated rims, appliqué, fillet, and punctations.
In general, all of these decorative elements are usually thought to be much more
common on the Central Plains rather than the Southern Plains.
The surface treatment of vessels is dominated by smoothed over cordmarks
and plain examples.

Unmodified cordmarks generally comprise less than 5% of

samples (see Bevitt n.d.). The temper of vessels is most commonly sand or sand
combined with bone or scoria. Sand as the sole temper agent often represents greater
than 80% of samples from Odessa Yates and most other sites. The rim diameter of
vessels is typically (i.e., roughly 50%) between 13 and 17 cm. Larger and smaller
diameters round out samples and are about equally represented. It is also worth noting
that although thick cordmarked sherds are commonly attributed to the Early Ceramic
period, recent excavations at Buried City (i.e., 41OC29) document numerous vessels
thicker than 15 mm from well-dated Middle Ceramic contexts (Brosowske et al.
2003).
Overall, considerable variability in decoration elements and surface treatment
of ceramics among Odessa phase sites is well documented (Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.;
D. Hughes 1991; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987). Currently, the source of this
variability is not clear, and potential factors, such as intergroup exchange and post-

159

marriage residence rules, remains unstudied. Differences between ceramics of the
Odessa and Antelope Creek phases are limited primarily to the frequency of decorated
rims and plain vessels.

While these differences appear fairly obvious at times,

designation of site affiliation should ideally be made using multiple forms of evidence.
Lithic raw materials used by Odessa phase populations are very distinctive,
especially in comparison to other Plains Villagers of the area who primarily used
Alibates silicified dolomite and/or locally available materials (see Chapter Six,
Appendix IV). Antelope Creek phase lithic assemblages generally contain between
80% and 100% Alibates silicified dolomite from bedrock sources along the Canadian
River in the Texas panhandle (Bandy 1976; Brosowske 2002c; Duncan 2002; Lintz
1976, 1986a). Redbed Plains variant groups most commonly utilized Frisco chert
from south-central Oklahoma and quartzites and cherts from the expansive Ogallala
formation (Drass 1997). In contrast, Odessa phase relied heavily on a combination of
Alibates and Smoky Hill or Niobrara jasper whose nearest source area is in northwest
Kansas (Brosowske and Bement 1997, 1998; Brosowske 1999, 2002b; Brosowske et
al. 2000). In particular, use of the latter material is very distinct for the region and its
frequency on Plains Village sites in or near the study area often denotes its affiliation
with the phase.

Typically, Alibates comprises between 50% and 80% of lithic

assemblages and Smoky Hill about 20% to 35%. Other local and nonlocal lithic
materials typically comprise less than 10% of assemblages.

160

Red Bed Plains Variant (A.D. 800-1450)
The following provides a brief overview of groups attributed to the Red Bed
Plains variant (Figure 4.16). These groups are somewhat peripheral to the primary
study area discussed above (i.e., the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles), and as such,
the following represents only a general overview of basic cultural trends identified for
the region. As a result, these groups are not examined as intensively as the preceding
Antelope Creek and Odessa phases. These discussions are derived almost entirely
from the work by Drass (1997) and the reader is encouraged to consult this excellent
source for additional details.

Figure 4.16 Distribution of Red Bed Plains Variant Societies.

The primary focus of this section is to summarize some of the more important
temporal and spatial trends in the subsistence economies, material assemblages, and
settlement patterns for groups of the Red Bed Plains variant. It should be noted that

161

while cultural continuity from the Early to Middle Ceramic periods on the Southern
High Plains is essentially nonexistent or has yet to be demonstrated in any meaningful
way, it is readily apparent that very strong ties exist between Early and Middle
Ceramic cultural traditions for the main body of Oklahoma (see Drass 1997). In fact,
differentiating Early Ceramic from Middle Ceramic sites during pedestrian survey can
sometimes be difficult because only subtle differences may exist in the material
assemblages and settlement of groups representing these two periods. As such, while
the Early and Middle Ceramic periods for the Southern High Plains were presented
separately, these two periods are examined collectively, from earliest to latest for
western and central Oklahoma.
The onset of the Red Bed Plains variant as recently defined by Drass (1997)
denotes the appearance of horticultural groups in central and western Oklahoma (see
discussion below for the appearance of horticulture in the area). This variant is
divided into early (A.D. 800-1250) and late (A.D. 1250-145) periods and each of these
temporal periods contain western and eastern components. Table 4.14 provides an
overview of the four phases identified for the Red Bed Plains variant and their
associated temporal spans.

As is typical for the entire region, the Early Ceramic period for western and
central Oklahoma remains poorly understood. This is primarily a result of the fact that

162

permanent sites, with substantial residential structures, middens, and subterranean
storage facilities and the data they usually contain, are absent. Most sites contain
relatively sparse concentrations of cultural materials and are interpreted as small
hunting or base camps. Important sites include Roulston-Rogers, Barkheimer, Austin
Sand Pit, Ayers, Rose-Fast, Thunderbird Dam, and components at Duncan-Wilson,
Quillan, Spring Creek, 34CD257, and 34CD258 (Drass 1979, 1984a 1984b; Ferring
1982, 1986b; Hughes and Briscoe 1987, Lawton 1968; Mayo 1982; Moore 1988, Neel
1984). Identified Early Ceramic period site features are limited to those attributed to
short-term food processing activities and include hearths and roasting pits.
Material culture also reflects a generalized lifestyle of hunting and gathering.
Lithic assemblages are dominated by corner notched dart and arrowpoints and
informal flake tools produced from locally available materials. Ceramics are almost
always present in small numbers (i.e., less than 20 sherds) and represent thick conoidal
shaped cordmarked vessels. Overall, the archaeological record for the Early Ceramic
period of western and central Oklahoma suggests that mobile groups who relied on
seasonally available plants and animals occupied the region. Although increased
frequencies of groundstone are present at some sites and suggest that groups were
using plant resources more intensively than during the preceding Late Archaic period,
as a whole, it is apparent that lifestyle changes from the Archaic to Early Ceramic are
relatively minimal compared to those that occurred later with the appearance of
horticulture.
As noted above, the primary distinction used by Drass (1997) to differentiate
the Early Ceramic from the beginning of the Middle Ceramic period in western and

163

central Oklahoma is the appearance of corn horticulture. Importantly, the appearance
of domesticated crops in the archaeological record of the area also coincides with the
appearance of the first permanent villages. The fact that both these two events seem to
arise at approximately the same time suggests that they were closely related and were
mutually reinforcing developments. That groups became more sedentary at this time
is further supported by substantial increases in the number of subterranean storage
facilities and the accumulation of sizeable midden deposits at many settlements. In
most cases, settlements were adjacent to floodplains and terraces with fertile soils.
Although evidence for corn horticulture has been documented at all Paoli and some
Custer phase sites, it should be emphasized that foraging was still very important, and
the density of cultivated plant remains is much lower than that observed at sites of the
following phases (Drass 1997:109-113).
The material assemblages at early Middle Ceramic sites (i.e., Custer and Paoli
phase sites) contain many of the same chipped stone artifacts documented for the
preceding Early Ceramic period and include corner notched dart and arrowpoints,
scrapers, ovate knives, and drills.

While notched and unnotched triangular

arrowpoints do make their appearance at this time, and eventually become as common
as corner notched forms, beveled knives are noticeably rare. Ceramics at the onset of
the Middle Ceramic period show considerable continuity from the preceding period
and include conical or globular cordmarked vessels with pointed, rounded, or flat
bottoms. One important difference, however, is that ceramics are noticeably more
abundant at these sites than during the Early Ceramic period. Bone hoes and digging

164

sticks rarely occur, although they do become more common at sites dating to about
A.D. 1200 or 1250.
Settlement for early Red Bed Plains variant groups is characterized by the
occupation of hamlets or small villages during the growing season and frequent
movement in and out of short-term habitation sites throughout the rest of the year
(Drass 1997:13).

Overall, it is thought that groups were essentially tethered to

permanent villages and their associated horticultural fields during the growing season.
These localities were abandoned in favor of hunting and gathering pursuits from late
fall until early spring.
The late Middle Ceramic phases identified for the area include Turkey Creek
and Washita River. Delineation of these phases is marked primarily by important
changes in settlement, subsistence, and material economies.

As a whole, these

changes are thought to reflect organized strategies to increase economic production
(Drass 1997). While bison were hunted by western Oklahoma groups throughout the
Early Ceramic and Middle Ceramic, following A.D. 1250 bison remains became much
more common at Washita River sites in central Oklahoma and suggests a shift away
from a broad hunting economy to more of an emphasis on bison. Other important
changes also noted for this time include dramatic increases in the frequency of
alternately beveled knives, bison bone hoes and digging sticks, and as mentioned
above, increases in the frequency of corn at sites.
It is suggested that full sedentism developed following A.D. 1250 as groups
intensified farming and bison hunting activities (Drass 1997).

While short-term

habitation sites are documented for the Turkey Creek and Washita River phases, it is

165

likely that these sites reflect logistical movement from permanent settlements.
Although residential structures have been particularly difficult to identify within the
entire distribution of the Red Bed Plains variant, an increase in settlement size is noted
for the two late phases and is thought to reflect fairly dramatic increases in population
during this time. In general, increases in human population are thought to be the
primary factor that led to efforts to increase economic production (Drass 1997).
Because few residential structures have been excavated at Turkey Creek and
Washita River phase sites, models of settlement are based largely on the distribution
of sites. Nonetheless, identification and excavation of houses at a few sites, such as
Arthur (Brooks 1987), suggest that late Red Bed Plains variant settlements may have
contained anywhere from five to 20 family groups. More importantly, extensive
survey of areas, particularly in central Oklahoma, provides useful information related
to settlement of the region. Although it is unlikely that settlement density was the
same for the entire area in which Red Bed Plains variant sites are found, it is apparent
that settlements were most concentrated along the Washita River in central Oklahoma
(see Drass 1997:Figure 43). In this area, settlements occur at one or two sites per
linear km.
Although the earliest Red Bed Plains variant phases of western and central
Oklahoma (i.e., Custer and Paoli phases) are noted as beginning around A.D. 800, it is
apparent that domesticated plant remains (i.e., maize) are rare from contexts earlier
than A.D. 1050, and more often occur after A.D. 1100 (see Drass 1997:Table 5; Figure
7). In fact, Drass (personal communication 2003; see Drass 2003:29) notes that an
AMS date on corn of A.D. 1040 from 34CU306 represents the earliest date on corn for

166

the area. This point is particularly crucial for the present research because western and
central Oklahoma are often considered a likely point of origin from which horticulture
and the Plains Village tradition lifestyle in general are thought to have spread to the
Southern High Plains. The available information suggests that these developments
were not widespread on the Rolling Plains until sometime following A.D. 1050.

Rio Grande and Pecos River Valleys (A.D. 600-A.D. 1600)
Social interaction and exchange between Plains groups and Puebloan
populations of the Rio Grande and Pecos River valleys is a topic of long-standing
interest among Southern Plains researchers (see Baugh 1982; Lintz 1986a:5-16, 1991;
Mason 1929; Sayles 1932 [in Lintz 1986a:11]; Speth 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983;
Studer 1931a, 1939, 1963).

Although the recovery of durable items, primarily

obsidian, at Southern Plains sites demonstrates a long history of contact between these
two culture areas (e.g., Bement and Brosowske 2001:109-112; Johnson et al. 1985), it
is apparent that regular contact between groups of the Plains and Southwest is a
relatively late development (i.e., post A.D. 1200) (see Baugh 1982; Lintz 1986a, 1991;
Spielmann 1982, 1983).
The ensuing discussion provides a brief, and admittedly, generalized summary
of cultural sequences for the Rio Grande and Pecos River valleys of New Mexico
between A.D. 600 and A.D. 1600. For the archaeologist unfamiliar with the culture
history of the American Southwest, sorting through the various chronological
frameworks used to describe archaeological phenomena of the region can certainly be
a daunting task (e.g., Cordell and Gumerman 1989; Glassow 1980; Kidder 1927;

167

Wendorf and Reed 1955; Wetherington 1968). In the area of interest here, most
researchers have applied either the Pecos Classification (Kidder 1927) or a scheme
proposed by Wendorf and Reed (1955).
The temporal span examined here closely correlates to the Pueblo I through
Pueblo IV periods of the Pecos Classification scheme (Table 4.15).

Particular

emphasis is placed on the later periods following A.D. 1100 when regular exchange
between the Plains and Southwest became more common. Previously, Cordell (1984,
1989), Kelley (1984), and Spielmann (1996) have presented overviews for this broad
and culturally variable area and these studies are relied upon to a great extent here.
Because there is considerable temporal and spatial variability across the region,
previous overviews have grouped sites into archaeological districts to clarify broad
trends and for comparative purposes (e.g., Cordell 1989; Spielmann 1996). For the
same reasons, this review also makes use of the same districts (Figure 4.17). Overall,
these discussions establish a cultural context for the eastern Pueblo area prior to and
during the period in which interdependent exchange between the Plains and Southwest
develops.

In contrast to many other portions of the American Southwest where
agricultural economies first make their appearance before A.D. 300, researchers

168

working in the Rio Grande and Pecos River valleys have repeatedly noted the paucity
of farming settlements before A.D. 1000 (Cordell 1989; Dickson 1979; Glassow 1980;
Spielmann 1996; Wendorf and Reed 1955). Currently, the two earliest horticultural
sites in the region have been dated between A.D. 550 and A.D. 600 and are found in
the upper Cimarron and Pecos drainages (Dickson 1979:30; Glassow 1980:113). In
the centuries that follow additional evidence for the presence of horticultural groups in
the region remains sparse and only a few sites in the Cimarron, Pecos, Albuquerque,
and Sierra Blanca districts have been dated between A.D. 800 and 1000 (Cordell
1989:304; Kelley 1984; Spielmann 1996).
In general, sites are widely dispersed and are indicative of low population
densities. Settlements typically contain one or a few circular pithouses and suggest
occupation by one or possibly two families. The ephemeral appearance of sites and
the lack of associated storage facilities suggest that these small settlements were
occupied on a seasonal basis (Cordell 1989:305). It is also interesting to note that the
earliest ceramics in the region coincide with the appearance of these early pithouse
villages.
The period between A.D. 1000 and 1200 is characterized by a gradual increase
in population across much of the entire region (Cordell 1989:308-309). While the
period marks the first evidence for horticultural communities in the Taos and Gallinas
areas, in other districts, such as Chama, Galisteo, and areas east of Santa Fe, there is
still little or no evidence for resident farming populations (Cordell 1989:309; Lang
1977; Spielmann 1996:182). In the Cimarron district, which previously contained

169

some of the earliest horticultural sites in the region, Glassow (1980:113) notes that this
area experienced a decrease in population.

Figure 4.17 Archaeological Districts of Central and Northern New Mexico.

Although the period is noted as one of expansion, it is apparent that population
densities remain low.

Settlements are small, usually consisting of one or two

pithouses, and possibly, a few jacal surface structures. Red Mesa Black-on-white is
the “hallmark” ceramic type of the period, although corrugated gray utility wares are
present and abundant at most sites (Cordell 1989:310). In general, the variability
noted in the degree of sedentism, settlement, and subsistence orientation for the region

170

at this time may reflect a period of “settling in” as groups practicing a mixed economy
of foraging and horticulture expanded into previously unoccupied areas.
It is also during this period that the Chacoan system, based in the San Juan
basin, reached its zenith. The potential impact that this burgeoning system may have
had on populations in the Rio Grande and Pecos river basins remains unclear and is
disputed among researchers (see Cordell 1984, 1989). Nonetheless, the evidence for
population expansion and the widespread distribution of Red Mesa Black-on-white
wares (a common type at Chacoan sites) at many sites are thought by some to be
related to the developments occurring in the nearby San Juan basin (see Cordell
1989:310; Lang 1982).
Compared to earlier periods, most of the entire region is marked by significant
transformations in demography, settlement, and architecture between A.D. 1200 and
A.D. 1300. While a dramatic increase in the number of sites recorded is certainly a
dominant trend for the period, distinct differences can be discerned in the way that
populations and settlements were organized from area to area. For instance, in the
Gallisteo and Santa Fe areas, population increases are reflected by the emergence of
large numbers of moderate size pueblos containing 13 to 30 rooms (Cordell 1989;
Spielmann 1996:181). In contrast, although population increases are also noted in the
Taos and eastern Rio Abajo districts, rather than occupying numerous medium sized
sites, groups are aggregated into fewer, but much larger villages (Cordell 1989;
Spielmann 1996). Elsewhere, such as in the Chama and Galisteo areas, although the
general pattern is one of relatively low numbers of medium sized settlements,

171

individual large pueblos containing 100 to 150 rooms are also present in each of these
districts (Cordell 1989; Spielmann 1996).
The above settlement patterns suggest that the rate of population increases and
the concomitant organizational responses varied from district to district. Although the
appearance of large settlements tends to dominate the literature, it should be stressed
that most researchers note that moderate sized settlements consisting of pueblos with
13 to 30 rooms are still most common throughout the Rio Grande and Pecos region at
this time (Cordell 1989:315). With this being said, except for the Cimarron district,
which is essentially abandoned by A.D. 1300 (Glassow 1980:113), the fact that
pueblos with more than 100 rooms are established in all parts of the eastern border
between A.D. 1250 and 1300 (Spielmann 1996:183) is certainly a noteworthy
development.
Coinciding with dramatic increases in population and the emergence of large
aggregated communities is the widespread advent of surface pueblo architecture
throughout the region. Although early masonry and adobe pueblos were previously
built in the Rio Abajo and Cimarron districts as early as A.D. 1100, villages
containing pithouses and jacals were the dominant architectural forms in all areas prior
to A.D. 1200 (Spielmann 1996:Figure 12.4). While pueblos certainly became common
following A.D. 1200, as a whole, architectural forms throughout the region remained
diverse and still included pithouses and jacals (Spielmann 1996:183). In addition to
new forms of architecture, the earliest water control features (i.e., check dams and grid
alignment) also made their appearance at this time in the Española and Taos areas
(Cordell 1989:317). Ceramic assemblages of this time are dominated by Santa Fe

172

Black-on-white wares or local Black-on-white variations, such as Chupadero, Taos,
Wiyo, Pindi, and Poge (Cordell 1989:316).
The dramatic events described here for the latter half of the Pueblo III period
coincided with the collapse of the Chacoan system.

Although many of the

demographic, architectural, and ceramic developments noted for the Rio Grande and
Pecos areas at this time are often attributed to population influxes from the San Juan
basin, large-scale migrations from the latter region have yet to be demonstrated
(Cordell 1989).
The final period of interest here corresponds to the Pueblo IV period (A.D.
1300-1600). The initial trends of population aggregation and the emergence of large
pueblos observed in the region between A.D. 1200 and 1300 continued and became
even more pronounced following A.D. 1300. Cordell (1989:314) also notes that the
period is characterized by the abandonment of high elevation settlements and the
formation of large aggregated pueblos along major floodplains. Overall, large pueblo
settlements are documented in the Chama, Taos, Upper Pecos, Albuquerque, Rio
Abajo, Santa Fe, Galisteo, and Sierra Blanca districts (Cordell 1989; Spielmann 1996).
It is clear that aggregation into larger communities during the Pueblo IV period
certainly would have required considerable modification of existing cultural systems.
However, the available settlement and architectural evidence may also suggest that the
pace of social, economic, political, and demographic change may have been even
more rapid than in preceding periods, and that in many instances, the initial responses
to these changes may not have provided viable long-term solutions. Cordell (1989)
and Spielmann (1996) note that few of the large Puebloan communities established

173

during Pueblo IV are occupied for any significant length of time. For example,
Spielmann (1996:183) notes that only seven of the 19 large pueblos in the Salinas
district established by A.D. 1300 continued to be occupied into the fifteenth century.
Similar patterns are observed in the Galisteo and Sierra Blanca areas (Cordell 1979;
Spielmann 1996:183). Overall, the regional trend of escalating aggregation is perhaps
most clearly shown in the Upper Pecos area.

Here, eight large pueblos (i.e.,

Arrowhead, Dick’s Ruin, Forked Lightning, CA 267, CA 680, Loma Lothrop, Pecos,
and Rowe) were established between A.D. 1250 and 1325, but only Pecos Pueblo
remained after A.D. 1450 (Cordell 1980:10; Spielmann 1996:183).
Of the pueblos that do persist after A.D. 1450, evidence suggests that
substantial rebuilding projects were often carried out to accommodate additional
populations attracted to these large settlements (Spielmann 1996:183). Although some
pueblos have well-organized layouts, often consisting of multiple quadrangular room
blocks organized around a plaza, others do not and suggest they experienced periods
of unplanned population growth (Cordell 1989:322). The relocation of settlements
from high to low elevations also suggests a shift to intensive horticulture. The fact
that food production rates increased substantially over earlier periods, probably at
surplus levels, is also supported by the construction of large storage facilities at most
sites and the increased numbers of water control features documented for this period
(see Cordell 1989:Table 10).

Finally, the Pueblo IV period is marked by the

appearance of Glaze wares. These ceramics are produced from the fourteenth to
seventeenth centuries and early Glaze wares were traded widely.

174

Concluding Thoughts
The preceding reviews have established a cultural context for the Early and
Middle periods for the Southern High Plains. These discussions have emphasized the
two major Middle Ceramic entities: the Antelope Creek and Odessa phases.
Contemporaneous groups in western and central Oklahoma and populations of the
eastern border pueblos were also briefly examined. Even though evidence for cultural
continuity from the Early to Middle Ceramic period is variable in each of these areas,
discussions of preceding Early Ceramic groups provide an important historical
dimension to this study.
These discussions demonstrate that the Southern High Plains was occupied by
mobile foraging groups until about A.D. 1250. These populations, recognized as Lake
Creek and Palo Duro complexes, were characterized by low population densities, use
of local resources, and habitation of short-term camps occupied by family groups for a
few days to as long as a season. Settlements were small and a mobile foraging
lifestyle of frequent residential moves is supported by the rarity or absence of
substantial features at most sites (i.e., houses and storage facilities).

In general,

population densities were quite low. Some sites do contain midden deposits and
sizeable quantities of groundstone and burned rock which suggest that some sites were
occupied for longer periods possibly to procure and process seasonally available plant
resources. Overall, except for the addition of the bow-and-arrow and small amounts
of ceramics, site assemblages and settlement suggest very little modification from Late
Archaic times. Somewhat surprisingly, very similar trends are also indicated for

175

western and central Oklahoma and the Rio Grande and Pecos River drainages at this
time.
The onset of the Middle Ceramic period on the Southern High Plains is marked
by a series of dramatic cultural events. These include major increases in regional
population, the emergence of permanent settlements, the appearance of horticulturally
based economies, distinct forms of residential architecture, a reliance on long-term
subterranean food storage, use of specialized chipped stone and bone technologies,
specialized subsistence economies, increased use of ceramics, and probably early
examples of craft specialization and land tenure systems. All of these developments
coincide with the development of interdependent exchange and appear very abruptly
on the Southern High Plains around A.D. 1250. An overview of Middle Ceramic
groups in western and central Oklahoma documents a similar sequence of evolutionary
developments. One major difference, however, is that this transition appears less
abrupt, occurring over a period of about two centuries.
In New Mexico, horticultural settlements do not appear to have become
widespread in the Rio Grande and Pecos drainages until around A.D. 1000 or A.D.
1100. Following A.D. 1200 major trends of population aggregation are demonstrated
by the appearance of medium and large villages. Following A.D. 1300, aggregation
further intensified as many smaller settlements were abandoned and replaced by large
pueblos containing hundreds of people. Some of these settlements were occupied into
the Historic period and were described by early Spanish explorers.
On the Southern High Plains, the population distribution during the Middle
Ceramic period is quite variable. Along the Canadian River valley, the vast majority

176

of individual settlements were comprised of only one or two family groups. Although
these sites appear fairly concentrated and some clustering was noted, they essentially
represent a dispersed settlement of family groups across the landscape. For example,
even though several homesteads were present along a single drainage, several hundred
meters usually separated them.

A few larger settlements clearly representing

aggregations of family groups were also documented in this area.

In general,

however, most of these settlements were relatively small and probably contained about
five to 10 families, although a handful of larger villages are also documented near the
Alibates quarries and a few other areas (e.g., Chimney Rock Ruin 51 and Coetas,
Cottonwood, and Antelope Creeks).
The subsistence economies of Antelope Creek phase groups are not
particularly well understood at this time. However, the available evidence provided
by floral, faunal, and tool assemblages coupled with settlement data strongly suggest
that most of these groups were chiefly foragers and that corn horticulture played only
a minor role.

A fairly dispersed settlement pattern in which family groups were

distributed along the Canadian and Beaver rivers and their tributaries probably enabled
populations to efficiently exploit seasonally available plant and animal resources in
these areas. In addition, the dispersed settlement strategy observed may also indicate
that the carrying capacity of these environs effectively constrained the ability to
aggregate into larger communities for any length of time. As such, the presence of a
few larger settlements, which do not appear to have been horticulturally based, are
obviously enigmatic (see Chapter Seven). Oftentimes, these villages are in defensible

177

settings, and at least in the case of the Alibates quarries, some are near resources that
were of obvious economic importance.
Along the northeast margins of the Southern High Plains were populations
attributed to the Odessa phase. Among these societies settlement and subsistence
economies appear much less variable than for Antelope Creek phase. Along the
southwest and southern margins of their distribution, Odessa phase groups were
aggregated into large extended villages containing 20 to 60 families. North and
northeast of these large communities were smaller settlements consisting of one to
four households.

Settlement near fertile soils, abundant horticultural tools and

subterranean storage facilities, and recovered floral assemblages all indicate a
substantial commitment to horticulture by Odessa phase populations. A broad range
hunting economy is suggested at smaller settlements, while a few larger villages
placed an emphasis on specialized bison hunting.
Although specific details regarding the cultural sequence vary somewhat for
each of the areas examined here, it is apparent that the general trend was much the
same. In each of these regions permanent settlements, population increases, and the
use of storage appear to be closely related to an increased reliance on cultivated foods.
It is likely that these developments combined with other sociopolitical factors also
resulted in the emergence of widespread systems of interdependent exchange
involving crucial resources as well as prestige items. Evidence for the exchange of
these items as indicated by their distribution and frequency among settlements of the
Southern High Plains is the topic of the two ensuing chapters.

178

CHAPTER FIVE
Nonlocal Items and Their Source Areas

The preceding chapter established a cultural context for the two primary
Middle Ceramic (A.D. 1200-1500) populations documented for the Southern High
Plains as well as additional groups more peripheral to the area. This information is of
key importance to the present study because as emphasized in Chapter Two, the social
scale of societies has tremendous consequences for the nature and character of
exchange. In this chapter we will begin to examine the intersocietal relationships that
were established at this time. The basic foundation for demonstrating contact between
these populations is provided by a study of nonlocal trade items recovered at
settlements in the region. Of course, any study of prehistoric exchange is handicapped
by the fact that only a small percentage of the items actually traded are preserved
archaeologically. Nonetheless, the distribution, quantity, and types of durable items
certainly provide an important basis for reconstructing the framework and function of
exchange.
Source areas for durable items of nonlocal origin recovered at Middle Ceramic
age (A.D. 1250-1500) sites of the Southern High Plains are the focus of these
discussions. Chapter Six examines the distribution of these items among sites. The
primary emphasis is on those commodities, which based on their quantity and
distribution, suggest that they were most intensively traded. Other items occur less
frequently, but are also highlighted because they may provide important insights into
the nature and function of intersocietal relationships.

179

The items examined here

include tool stone, marine shell, turquoise, pipestone, and decorated ceramics. These
discussions provide a necessary foundation for Chapter Six, which examines the
distribution of these items among settlements of the Antelope Creek and Odessa
phases. Altogether, these data facilitate the reconstruction of interaction networks that
developed among resident societies of the region and between the Plains and
Southwest following A.D. 1250 (see Chapter Eight).
Tool Stone Source Areas
The Southern High Plains has long been characterized, particularly by those
studying early Holocene foragers (e.g., Hofman 1991, 1992), as a region where high
quality lithic resources suitable for chipped stone tool production are incongruously
distributed. As such, it is not surprising that, in terms of overall quantities, nonlocal
lithic materials comprise the greatest portion of items proposed to have been traded
throughout the region (see Vehik and Baugh 1994). In particular, however, it is
readily apparent that exchange in high quality tool stones increased dramatically
beginning around A.D. 1250. Since these resources factor prevalently into Middle
Ceramic exchange, a brief discussion of source areas and descriptions for a few of the
more important lithic materials is warranted.
Attributing source areas for most lithic materials recovered in the region is
usually fairly straightforward and can be accomplished with the aid of a comparative
collection and an ultraviolet light. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For
instance, various cherts and gravels obtained from secondary sources can be highly
variable and can produce materials that are macroscopically similar to other betterknown lithic materials (see Bement and Brosowske 1999:33; Hofman et al. 1991).

180

Also, some bedrock sources can produce varieties of tool stone that are nearly
identical to that obtained at other sources. Nonetheless, at least 95% or more of the
chipped stone materials present in most assemblages can typically be attributed to
specific sources areas. These discussions focus on three primary lithic raw material
types that were imported into settlements of the region during the Middle Ceramic
period: Alibates silicified dolomite, Smoky Hill jasper, and obsidian. Other local and
nonlocal tool stones are also briefly examined. Figure 5.1 identifies source locations
for the tool stones described here.

Figure 5.1 Tool Stone Source Areas Discussed in Text.

181

Without a doubt Alibates silicified dolomite is the most commonly recovered
tool stone type in Middle Ceramic assemblages of the Southern High Plains. The
appearance of Alibates is very distinct, but it can be red, gray, pink, white, maroon, or
purple and specimens are frequently banded with a combination of two or three of
these colors. The primary bedrock source for this material is along the Canadian River
in the Texas panhandle (see Bandy 1976; Banks 1984, 1990; Bowers 1975; Shaeffer
1958; Studer 1931b).

Hundreds of quarry pits and production debris middens

approximately a meter thick aptly demonstrate extensive use of this resource. The
main quarry areas are contained within the present boundaries of the Alibates Flint
Quarries National Monument (see Chapter Seven) and are limited to a long, narrow
horizontal outcrop approximately 1200 m long by 200 m wide between Turkey and
Alibates creeks (see Shaeffer 1958:189-190). Additional outcrops of Alibates are also
exposed in nearby areas to the north and east (e.g., along Plum Creek and Devil’s
Canyon), although these materials are “inferior to that of the Alibates quarry and there
is much less evidence of working” (see Bowers 1975; Shaeffer 1958:190). The near
absence of settlements in the vicinity of these secondary source areas suggests that
they were of little importance.
Cobbles of Alibates are also available in the alluvium of several rivers of the
region (Banks 1984; Wyckoff 1993). In particular, Alibates cobbles can be found at
considerable distances downstream from the quarries in alluvium of the Canadian
River. In general, however, the abundance, size, and quality of Alibates materials
decrease with distance from the primary source (Banks 1984:91; Wyckoff 1993).

182

The Day Creek dolomite has a fairly widespread distribution across
northwestern Oklahoma and adjacent areas of southern Kansas and is often thought to
represent a lateral equivalent of Alibates (see Bailey 2000; Bowers 1975:17-19).
Although a few small specimens of Day Creek can be indistinguishable both
macroscopically and when examined under ultraviolet light from Alibates, as a whole,
this material “is not comparable to the Alibates in quantity, quality, or size” (Banks
1990:92). From my experience, while researchers have often emphasized the potential
problems in differentiating Day Creek from Alibates (e.g., Bailey 2000), this is not as
serious a problem for the present research for two reasons. First, the amount of Day
Creek that actually resembles Alibates in color and quality is generally quite low (i.e.,
less than 2%). Second, recent surveys suggest that Day Creek sources were used
almost exclusively by local Archaic and Early Ceramic populations of the area and
that later groups placed more of an emphasis on other high quality tool stones (e.g.,
Alibates, Smoky Hill, and Flint Hills cherts) (see Bailey 2000; Banks 1984:74;
Bement and Brosowske 1999; Bement et al. 2002).
Smoky Hill jasper, also known as Niobrara, Graham, or Republican River
jasper, is derived from the Smoky Hill Formation of the Central Plains.

This

formation outcrops over a fairly widespread area across Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado,
and Wyoming, although the highest quality chert-bearing deposits are limited
primarily to locations from west-central Kansas to southwest Nebraska (see Hattin
1982). Smoky Hill jasper is a highly siliceous material that varies in color from
caramel to dark brown, tan, black, white, green, yellow, and red. These materials
frequently occur as flat, tabular cobbles banded with several of the above colors.

183

Concentrations of quarries have been located in Graham, Trego, and Gove counties in
Kansas (see Banks 1990:96; Stein 1997). In general, most of the known Smoky Hill
quarries are attributed to members of the Upper Republican phase or variant, A.D.
1000-1350 (Stein 1997).
Previous studies have documented the use of obsidian for tool production by
inhabitants of the Southern Plains (e.g., Baugh and Nelson 1987; Mitchell et al. 1980).
Fortunately, several decades of geochemical studies have demonstrated that individual
volcanic sources producing obsidian have distinct chemical signatures (Baugh and
Nelson 1987; Glascock et al. 1999). As a result, it is usually possible to identify
specific source areas for most obsidian artifacts recovered from the region.
Although several distinct sources are documented for northern New Mexico
(Figure 5.2), geochemical studies suggest that the two most important source areas for
obsidian recovered on the Southern Plains are the Cerro Toledo and Valle Grande
calderas in the Jemez Mountains (Baugh and Nelson 1987; Brosowske 2004; Mitchell
et al. 1980). Because Valle Grande obsidian never eroded outside the Valles Caldera
proper, which is approximately 20 x 25 km in size, it can only be procured from this
primary source area (Shackley 2000).

In contrast, Cerro Toledo obsidian has a

broader distribution and can be obtained from primary source areas just northeast and
southeast of the Valle Grande Caldera rim as well as in the alluvium of the Rio Grande
River. Generally, obsidians obtained from the Valle Grande Caldera are usually
referred to as either Cerro del Medio or simply Valle Grande, while materials whose
source of origin is the Cerro Toledo Caldera are identified as either Obsidian Ridge,
Rabbit Mountain or Cerro Toledo Rhyolite (see Baugh and Nelson 1987; Glascock et

184

al. 1999:863; Shackley 2004). A third obsidian source, El Rechuelos, is located north
of the Valle Caldera and occurs in limited frequencies in the region.
In addition to the New Mexico sources, isolated specimens of obsidian have
also been documented from more distant sources in Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah
(Baugh and Nelson 1987:Table 3). The limited number of items originating from
these sources suggests that contact (i.e., networks of interaction and exchange)
between these two regions were not maintained on a regular basis.

Figure 5.2 Obsidian Source Areas of the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico.

185

Although Alibates and Smoky Hill comprise the greatest percentage of tool
stones at Middle Ceramic sites in the study area, other source areas are also
represented. A few of these are briefly examined here in the approximate frequency in
which they occur. Various colored orthoquartzites (e.g., yellow, gray, black, green,
white, rust, maroon, brown, tan, and gold) are often observed in fairly low frequencies
in Middle Ceramic assemblages (compared to either Alibates or Smoky Hill). These
are usually identified as Ogallala, Dakota, or Tesesquite quartzites and are associated
with the Ogallala, Dakota, and Morrison formations. The Ogallala formation is the
surficial unit of the High Plains, and thus, quartzites, as well as petrified woods and a
wide variety of cherts, obtained from this formation are widely available across the
study area (Figure 5.1).

These materials are from the lowermost portion of the

formation (Banks 1984:71) and are usually exposed through the dissection of stream
valleys.

Quartzites derived from the Dakota and Morrison formations are also

widespread on the plains, but are limited to areas generally northwest and north of the
study area (i.e., they are essentially nonlocal sources). With this being said, Bevitt
(1999:6) notes quartzites visually similar and identified as Dakota may be obtained
from the Cheyenne sandstone in southern Kansas. Overall, tool stone derived from the
Ogallala, Dakota, and Morrison formations are all of poorer quality than Alibates,
Smoky Hill, and obsidian.
Banks (1984:71, 1990:95) and Peterson (1988:286) mention a material
variously referred to as opalite, opaline, silicified caliche or Ogallala chert that occurs
locally within the Ogallala Formation (see also Hughes 1976:29). This distinctive
material is of poor quality, but is available along several stream valleys in the study

186

area, particularly in Hansford, Ochiltree, and Lipscomb counties, Texas and Beaver
and Texas counties, Oklahoma. This material is translucent to light brown in color,
but becomes brittle and changes to cloudy translucent and eventually opaque white, as
it weathers.
Various high quality cherts are derived from the Flint Hills region of central
Kansas and north-central Oklahoma (Figure 5.1). These fossiliferous cherts include
Wreford, Neva, Oologah, Foraker, although Florence A and Florence B or Kansas
Gray Permian cherts are the best quality and were most widely used. Florence A
cherts are limited to southern portions of the Flint Hills, while Gray Permian cherts are
available in central and northern portions. Wedel (1959:476-480) and Vehik (1986,
1990) discuss localities in Cowley County, Kansas, and Kay County, Oklahoma, with
evidence for extensive prehistoric quarrying of Florence A chert.

This material

benefits greatly from heat treatment and widespread exchange of this material
occurred following A.D. 1400 (Vehik 1986:153). Florence chert is naturally tan, gray
or white in color, but takes on a distinctive pinkish to reddish hue with some banding
following heat-treating. Kansas Gray Permian chert is finer grained than Florence A
and does not require heat-treatment. This material is blue to gray in color.
Knappable quality quartz crystal is frequently recovered in several portions of
the study area. These materials are usually clear and can be virtually identical to clear
glass. In addition, some smoky quartz crystal indistinguishable from obsidian (except
by chemical studies) is also known to occur. Quartz crystal is found in many portions
of the United States (e.g., the Rocky, Ouachita, and Wichita mountains), but remains
poorly documented (see Reher and Frison 1991). The specific source area for quartz

187

crystal recovered on the Southern High Plains is not entirely clear, although its fairly
common occurrence at Protohistoric period (A.D. 1450-1700) sites in west-central
Oklahoma may suggest procurement from the Wichita Mountains, particularly areas
around Quartz Mountain (Figure 5.1).
These discussions have provided a brief description of source areas for some of
the more important tool stones present in the study area during the Middle Ceramic
period. Although tool stones certainly represent the largest portion of exchange items
present in the region (see Chapter Six), a wide variety of other nonlocal goods are also
documented. Here, a few of these items and their source areas are examined. Specific
resources include marine shell, turquoise, pipestone, and ceramics. It should be noted
that for some of the items mentioned here, a source of origin can refer to either a
location where a raw material is procured (e.g., stone, shell, clay) or to a production
locale (e.g., pottery, jewelry). In the case of marine shell jewelry, source areas and
probable production locales can frequently be defined.
Marine Shell
Marine shell derived from the Gulf of California, Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf
of Mexico was frequently imported into sites of the region. Although these locations
represent the ultimate source areas for the particular species of molluscan fauna
represented, given that each of these sources are over 1000 km away, it is probable
that marine shell was not directly procured by local groups. As such, the following
discussion first identifies the various species of molluscan shell recovered from
settlements of the region and their likely sources areas. This is followed by a brief

188

overview of settlements that are known to be production and distribution centers for
marine shell jewelry recovered in the region.
At least five or six taxa of marine shell have been documented at Middle
Ceramic settlements of the Southern High Plains. In their order of frequency, these
include Olivella sp., Conus sp., Oliva sp., Busycon sp. or Strombus sp., and Haliotis
sp. (Figure 5.3). Shell disk beads are also recovered from many sites of the region and
may be produced from marine shell (e.g., Laevicardium elatum or Glycymeris sp.).

Figure 5.3 Marine Shell Taxa Discussed in Text (adapted from Handy 2004).

189

Spire-lopped beads produced from dwarf olive shells (genus Olivella) have a
wide distribution throughout the Plains and adjacent regions (i.e., Southwest,
Southeast, and Midwest United States). Shells of the genus Olivella can be obtained
from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California (Olivella biplicata, O. dama, O.
baetica, and O. gracilis) and the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico (Olivella nivea
and Jaspidella jaspidea). To my knowledge I am not aware of any study that has
identified the species of Olivella shell recovered from sites of the Southern High
Plains (see Howard and Brown 1973). Therefore, although the exact species, and thus,
the ultimate source, for Olivella shell recovered from sites of the study area remain
unknown, previous studies have identified source areas for marine shell found in
adjacent regions.
In the American Southwest Olivella shell recovered from A.D. 0-1600 contexts
has been identified as Olivella dama from the Panamic province (i.e., the central coast
of Baja California southward through the Gulf of California down to northern Peru) or
as Olivella biplicata or Olivella baetica from the California province (i.e., from the
coast of Baja California northward along the coast of California) (Nelson 1991:15).
At Pecos Pueblo, Bradley (1996) identified beads associated with a burial at Pecos as
Olivella dama. At Arroyo Hondo, 175 Olivella dama shell beads were recovered
(Venn 1981:Table 29). On a related note, Brand (1938:7) identified 90% of the
marine shell from Pecos Pueblo, including Olivella, as originating from western
sources.

In general, it is apparent that Olivella shell beads recovered from

southwestern settlements are derived primarily from the Gulf of California (i.e., the
Panamic province) or the Pacific Ocean (i.e., the California province).

190

To the east, nearly 15,000 Olivella beads have been recovered from the Spiro
site in eastern Oklahoma. Recently, Kozuch (2002) identified these beads as dwarf
olive shells (Olivella dama) from the Gulf of California. Previously, they had been
identified as West Indian dwarf olive from the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean.
However, the fact that Olivella shell beads are more abundant at Spiro than Casas
Grandes or any other site in the Southwest makes the identification of these Olivella
shell beads as O. dama suspect (see Kozuch 2002:705). Other marine shell recovered
from Spiro is derived from the Gulf of Mexico (see below). One would think that if
Spiroans were indeed obtaining massive quantities of Olivella from the Southwest that
additional exotics from this region would also be well represented. Except for the rare
occurrence of a few items, this does not appear to be the case (see Brown 1996).
In south and central Texas dwarf olive shell beads are commonly recovered at
sites dating as early as the Archaic period (Steele 1987). Given their proximity to the
Gulf of Mexico, it is not surprising that these are identified as coming from this source
(Olivella dealbata) (see Hall 1981). As a whole, however, Olivella shell, and marine
shell in general, in Texas appears to drop off considerably with distance from the Gulf
Coast. While marine shell species are fairly abundant within 150 km of the coast,
these items are noticeably much rarer farther inland (see Steele 1987). In general,
much of the marine shell from central Texas appears to be associated with Archaic
contexts.
Although far from extensive, this brief overview suggests that except for
examples along the Texas Gulf Coast, Olivella shell beads recovered from inland sites
west, and possibly east, of the study area are derived from western sources and are

191

identified as Olivella dama. Currently, there are no sites in central or north-central
Texas that contain the frequencies of Gulf Coast marine shell that would suggest the
existence of distribution, and certainly not production, centers in these areas (see
Steele 1987). As a result, judging from the other nonlocal items present at sites of the
region, which are clearly of southwestern origin, it is likely that Olivella shell beads
recovered in the study area are Olivella dama and were obtained through exchange
with groups along the eastern periphery of the Southwest. In addition, considering
that sites in the study area are at least 1000 km from the Gulf Coast and less than half
this distance from the nearest Puebloan sites, the latter settlements would have
essentially represented a much closer source area for these and other marine shell
items.
Assuming that the Olivella shells are derived from western sources, additional
information regarding this species is warranted. First, this bead type is among the
most common form of bead recovered at southwestern sites and Bradley (1999:Table
16) and Nelson (1991:58) document hundreds, if not thousands, of Olivella shell beads
from settlements throughout the region.

The distribution of raw shell and

manufacturing tools and debris clearly suggest that the production of beads was
concentrated in Hohokam and Casas Grandes areas. For instance, Kozuch (2002:705)
notes that nearly 12,000 Olivella dama beads were recovered from Casas Grandes
alone. Nelson (1991:58) notes that Olivella shell beads are about evenly dispersed
between domestic and mortuary or offertory contexts.

In regards to mortuary

contexts, Kidder (1932:186) notes that these shell beads are most commonly
associated with infants and children rather than adults at Pecos. Overall, the wide

192

distribution of shell beads both among sites and within various site contexts suggests
these marine shell beads were widely available to most members of southwestern
society, but that they may have served a number of different non-utilitarian and ritual
functions.
Like Olivella shell, Conus and Oliva shells recovered from sites in the study
area have received little formal research attention (see Figure 5.3). Although species
identifications have not been made for these items, it is assumed here that they also
were derived from western sources and were obtained through exchange with the
eastern Pueblos. The genus Conus is native to the Panamic (Conus regularis, C.
perplexus, C. ximenes, C. princeps, C. fergusoni) and the California provinces (C.
purpurascens and C. Californicus). The genus Oliva can be obtained from either the
Gulf of California or the Atlantic Ocean (Kozuch 2002:702). Oliva obtained from
southwestern contexts are usually identified as Oliva incrassata.
Conus shell is used to produce cone-shaped shell tinklers. Tinklers have been
described as rattles, shaking instruments, or idiophones and are produced by removal
of the spire at the point of maximum width (see Nelson 1991:55). Once again, Conus
shell tinklers are concentrated at Hohokam sites and Casas Grandes, although the
enormous quantities recovered from the latter site may suggest that this settlement was
the primary distribution center for the entire Southwest (Nelson 1991:55).
Overall, although found at a number of sites, pendants produced from Oliva
shell are generally quite scarce in the Southwest compared to other marine shell
species (Nelson 1991:51). Interestingly, although rare at southwestern sites, Nelson
(1991:52; see Kidder 1932:190-192) notes that Oliva pendants recovered from Pecos

193

Pueblo outnumber the total number of those recovered from all of the Hohokam sites
combined. In general, these shells are similar in appearance to Olivella, but are
significantly larger and have thicker shells (Kidder 1932:190; Kozuch 2002:702).
Like Olivella shell beads, Oliva pendants are also produced by the removal of the spire
tip by abrasion.
Large marine shell pendants or gorgets produced from the body whorl of the
Conch (genus Busycon) have been recovered at a few sites on the Southern High
Plains (Figure 5.3). These ornaments are much more common at sites to the east (e.g.,
Spiro) and to the south along the Texas coast. In both of these areas, these shells are
identified as either Busycon perversum or Busycon contrarium (e.g., Hall 1981;
Phillips and Brown 1978; Steele 1987). The source for these species is the Gulf of
Mexico from the Florida Keys to the straits of the Yucatan (Phillips and Brown
1978:26).

To the west, nearly identical pendants have been recovered at Pecos

Pueblo, but here they are attributed to the genus Strombus (Kidder 1932:183, Figure
165a). Nelson (1991:Table 2.1) notes two species of Strombus (S. galeatus and S.
gracilior) recovered from Hohokam sites. Both of these species are available only
from the Panamic province (i.e., the Gulf of California).
In central and western Oklahoma marine shell, including a few large pendants
produced from body whorls of genera such as Busycon or Strombus are documented.
Generally, these items are thought to originate in the Southwest, although engraved
gorgets with obvious Mississippian iconography are attributed to contact with groups
to the east (see Drass and Peterson 1980; Hofman 1977). To the north, marine shell
ornaments produced from large whelks (Busycon sp.) are also documented from

194

Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, and the Dakotas (Blakeslee 1997; Carlson 1997; Fosha
1997; Jaynes 1997; Lippincott 1997; Picha and Swenson 1997). Generally, these are
thought to result from contact with eastern or southeastern groups.
Currently, the ultimate source for the large marine shell pendants recovered in
the study area is not entirely clear. Considering that other marine shell ornaments and
additional exotics obtained from the southwest are very common in the study area, it is
possible that some of the large body whorl ornaments were obtained through exchange
with Puebloan groups. However, even though other forms of evidence for contact
with groups to the east is generally quite rare, the fact that these objects are clearly
much more common to the east at Mississippian sites than at southwestern sites may
suggest that they were derived from this area (see Nelson 1991; Phillips and Brown
1978).
Disk beads are also frequently recovered in the study area (see Chapter Six).
Although the large “washer” type beads produced from freshwater mussels are fairly
common at Early Ceramic sites of the region, the beads I am referring to here are
much smaller, about 4 or 5 mm in diameter, and are usually associated with Middle or
Late Ceramic period contexts. The intensive modification necessary to produce these
beads often makes species identification, and thus, a source of origin difficult to
determine. Although it would seem possible to produce these beads from freshwater
mussels available in the study area, a review of the literature failed to identify any
Middle Ceramic sites in the region with clear evidence for the production of disk
beads (see Picha and Swenson 2000:106 and references therein for a discussion on
Naiad disk bead production in the Missouri Trench). In addition, in several areas of

195

the region many of the freshwater species available have shells that are too thin to
produce these bead types. Therefore, considering this evidence coupled with the
staggering quantities of disk beads recovered at southwestern sites it seems most likely
that most of these beads were produced from marine shell and were obtained through
exchange with groups to the west.
Disk beads are by far the most common type of bead recovered in the
southwest (Nelson 1991:59). In fact, Nelson (1991:Tables 2.3 and 2.4) documents
over 65,000 shell disk beads from 45 sites in southern Arizona.

Large strings

containing thousands of disk beads were also recovered at Pecos (Kidder 1932). In
general, disk beads recovered from the study area are usually tan or white and may be
Laevicardium elatum or Glycymeris sp. The former species is available from both the
Californian and Panamic provinces and the latter is only found in the Panamic (Nelson
1991:Table 2.1). It is not known whether red, orange, and purple disk beads have
been recovered in the research area, but in the Southwest, it is likely that the genera
Spondylus or Chama were used to produce these beads (Nelson 1991:59). Saucershaped beads have found at Pecos and Casas Grandes in large quantities, however, to
the best of my knowledge they have yet to be documented on the Southern Plains.
These beads were produced by perforating sections of thin walled shells (e.g.,
Vermetus, Olivella or Alectrion) and smoothing the ends.
Lastly, a few cut shell pendants have been recovered from the study area,
which, due to their size and thickness, are also likely derived from marine contexts.
These pendants are typically flat, oval, triangular or rectangular in shape, and
frequently have a hole drilled near the margin. Although ornaments produced from

196

freshwater species indigenous to the region are fairly widespread, these are generally
quite distinct from the shell items described here. The latter are often more than 2 mm
thick and their overall size makes it unlikely that they are produced from locally
available freshwater bivalves. Morphologically similar artifacts are documented for
many areas of the Southwest (e.g., Kidder 1932; Nelson 1991; Venn 1981).
Oftentimes, these ornaments have been extensively modified from original forms, but
the genus Haliotis (abalone) is most commonly noted as the shell used for the
production of these simple geometric pendants (e.g., Kidder 1932:190-194; Nelson
1991:54). Other genera are used for cut shell pendants in the Hohokam region (e.g.,
Laevicardium elatum, Glycymeris, Spondylus, Pecten, Argopecten, Pteria, and
Pinctada), however, many of these are decorated with a wide variety of geometric or
zoomorphic design motifs (Nelson 1991:54). The latter have yet to be documented in
the study area and it seems most likely that the simple, undecorated forms recovered
from the Plains may be Haliotis obtained from the Pacific Ocean. These simple forms
were produced both in the Hohokam area and by various California groups and likely
represent the primary source area for those items recovered on the Southern Plains
(Nelson 1991:54).
With the exception of the large pendants probably produced from Busycon sp.,
all of the marine shell jewelry documented from the study area was almost surely
obtained through contact with groups in the Southwest.

From the discussions

presented here it should be obvious that a great deal of research has been conducted
regarding the production and distribution of marine shell artifacts in the Southwest
(e.g., Bradley 1996, 1999; Brand 1938; Nelson 1991). As noted throughout these

197

discussions, two primary areas of marine shell jewelry production have been identified
for the prehistoric Southwest: the Hohokam area and Casas Grandes.
In general, Casas Grandes, a large complex community in northwestern
Mexico and Hohokam sites of the Phoenix and Santa Cruz-Tucson basins and Gila
Bend area of southern Arizona (e.g., Snaketown, Grewe, Casa Grande, and Pueblo
Grande), contain by far the greatest concentrations of marine shell ornaments and
debris and tools associated with the manufacture of these items (see Bradley 1996,
1999; Nelson 1991). The wide distribution of marine shell throughout the Southwest
demonstrates widespread intersocietal contact between about A.D. 1250 and 1450
(locally the Medio and Classic Hohokam periods).
Recently, Bradley (1996, 1999) and Nelson (1991) have examined
distributional patterns of marine shell in the Southwest. Their findings essentially lend
support to the shell trade routes originally proposed by Brand (1938) (Figure 5.4). Of
importance to these discussions are the linkages between the shell ornament
production centers noted above and settlements in the Rio Grande and Pecos River
valleys around A.D. 1250-1500.

Brand (1938) and Bradley (1999:Figure 16.7)

suggest that the latter settlements were connected to shell production centers by trade
routes from the Zuni region to the west, the Mogollon area to the southwest, and from
the south through the Alamogordo district. Support for existence of these connections
is provided by the recovery of durable trade items, including shell, ceramics, and other
items, at the eastern border Pueblos. As is discussed later in Chapter Six, many items
from each of these areas also make their way out onto the Southern High Plains. It is
also of interest to note, however, that the particularly ornate shell items (i.e., bracelets,

198

rings, and effigy pendants) produced at Casas Grandes and the Hohokam areas are not
known from the Southern Plains. Rather, fairly simple beads and pendants dominate
the record. Venn (1981:245) also notes this general pattern at Arroyo Hondo and
suggests that a western route which largely bypassed the major Hohokam communities
of southern Arizona brought marine shell to the Eastern Pueblos.

Figure 5.4 Southwestern Marine Shell Trade Routes (adapted from Brand 1938).

Turquoise
Compared to some portions of the Southwest, turquoise ornaments occur
infrequently in prehistoric contexts in the study area. Generally, the term “turquoise”

199

is used in two different manners (Weigand et al. 1977:16). Chemically, the term refers
to a specific class of phosphates known as hydrated copper aluminum phosphate (i.e.,
chemical turquoise). At a more general level, the term is used to refer to a whole
range of blue to blue-green stones, such as malachite, azurite, chrysocollas in addition
to turquoise. In general, all of these materials are widely dispersed across New
Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, California, and Mexico. Despite early claims which
were highly optimistic about chemically differentiating turquoise obtained from
discrete source areas (e.g., Weigand et al. 1977), recent studies have determined that
considerable variability exists in the chemical composition of turquoise, both among
and within individual source areas (Milford 1995). As such, it is not possible to
determine specific source areas for turquoise recovered from the Southern Plains at
this time.
The closest well known source of turquoise to the study area is the famed
mines of the Cerrillos district (Figure 5.5). Within the Cerrillos district are 10 areas or
mines with evidence for prehistoric mining activity (see Warren and Mathien 1985).
The best known of these are Turquoise Hill, the Castillian, Mount Chalchihuitl,
Tiffany Mine, O'Neil's Blue Bell, and the O'Neil Turquoise Mine site (Milford 1995).
Several pueblo sites are in the general area of these sources, but San Marcos and La
Cienega are clearly the closest (within 5 km). Currently, it is not known whether the
quarries were open to all or if access was limited. Whatever the case, it is likely that
one or both of these settlements played a key role in the mining, production, and
distribution of turquoise beads and pendants.

Pipestone and Pipes
Pipes, generally elbow varieties, are a common artifact type recovered at
Middle Ceramic sites of the Plains.

In general, few researchers have sought to

systematically identify discrete geologic source areas for the pipestones used to
produce these items. Currently, the best-known variety of pipestone is a red argillite
known as “Catlinite.” This pipestone is obtained from the famed pipestone quarries of
southwestern Minnesota (see Catlin 1996). Generally, red pipestone, no matter its find
locality, is incorrectly identified as this material by most researchers (Gundersen

201

1988).

Gundersen (1988, 1999) has determined that red argillites used for pipe

manufacture may include four types of chemically distinct stone. These materials
include true “Catlinite,” and South Dakota, Kansas, and Wisconsin pipestones. As the
names imply, each of these materials are obtained from different source areas (Figure
5.6).

Figure 5.6 Pipestone Sources Discussed in Text.

Presently, it is not known whether access to any of these source areas was
under the control of any known society during Middle Ceramic times, although

202

Kansas pipestone, which is most commonly recovered at settlements in the study area
(Brosowske and Bement 1998), is widely distributed in glacial till deposits from
southeastern South Dakota to northeastern Kansas. This broad distribution would
seem to preclude social control of this resource. A wide variety of other pipestones
are also documented in the study area. Generally, these are produced from fairly nondistinctive materials and may suggest that they are available from local bedrock and
gravel sources. Lastly, stylistic elements may also indicate that pipes recovered from
the Southern Plains were obtained from a nonlocal source. In particular, clay tubular
or “Cloudblower” pipes were widely produced in the Southwest and are quite distinct
from typical Plains elbow pipes (see Kidder 1932; Lintz 1991).
Southwestern Decorated Ceramics
Decorated sherds of southwestern origin have been recovered at a number of
Middle Ceramic age settlements of the Southern High Plains. Previous researchers
have identified specific types, ages, and general areas of production (e.g., central,
eastern, western, and southern New Mexico) for many of these items (e.g., Crabb
1968; Lintz 1991).

Although the general chronological framework for Anasazi

ceramics has remained relatively unchanged over the last 40 years, the production
districts for many of these types have become much better understood (see HabichtMauche 1993; Vint 1999). Using results recently presented by Vint (1999:Figure 7.7),
ceramic production districts for the Rio Grande and Pecos River valleys of New
Mexico are presented in Figure 5.7. Age ranges for most of the major decorated wares
are provided in Table 5.1. Overall, these data are self-explanatory, and considering
that the primary goal of these discussions is to identify source areas for these items,

203

little supplementary information regarding these artifacts is presented here. Additional
details regarding specific types and their production areas are provided as the
distribution of these items at settlements in the study area is examined in Chapter Six.

Summary
In closing, these discussions have concentrated on various nonlocal items
which are relatively widespread across the study area and whose source areas are
fairly well understood.

These items include tool stone, marine shell, turquoise,

pipestone, and Southwestern decorated ceramics.

Additional items are also

documented in the study area, but are discussed in the following chapter on an
individual basis. Overall, these data provide the crucial baseline information needed
for establishing the existence of intersocietal relationships between Middle Ceramic
settlements of the Southern High Plains and other adjacent areas or societies. As such,
these results are frequently referred to in the discussions that follow.

CHAPTER SIX
Nonlocal Trade Items of the Southern High Plains:
The Middle Ceramic Period Evidence

The process of describing prehistoric exchange involves three primary steps
(Earle 1982:3). The first of these steps, to identify the source of exchange items, was
accomplished in Chapter Five. The second step is to describe the spatial patterning of
nonlocal trade goods across the landscape; this is the focus of this chapter. These data,
combined with the contextual information presented in Chapter Four, lays the
foundation necessary for examining the emergence and structure of intersocietal
exchange.
The ensuing discussions document the distribution and frequency of nonlocal
trade items at settlements of the Southern High Plains. In particular, emphasis is on
items recovered at Antelope Creek and Odessa phase settlements, although a brief
discussion on nonlocal trade goods recovered from Early Ceramic period sites is also
presented to provide a historical perspective on the evolution of exchange in the
region.

For organizational reasons, the distribution of nonlocal trade items is

examined separately for each of these archaeologically defined Middle Ceramic
entities. Each section begins with an overview of the range of items associated with
each phase. This is followed by a more detailed discussion of individual classes of
trade goods recovered at settlements. Lastly, the chapter concludes with a discussion
of the major trends noted in the spatial pattering of nonlocal trade items.

207

Early Ceramic Period (A.D. 500-1200)
Previously, Vehik and Baugh (1994) compiled information from a wide variety
of sources to provide a broad overview of Plains exchange.

In this study they

conclude (1994:256-257) that the exchange of nonlocal items on the Southern High
Plains was extremely limited during the Early Ceramic period. Similar conclusions
are reached by others who have also examined the period in some detail (see Boyd
1997; Drass 1997; Hofman and Brooks 1989; J. Hughes 1991; Summers 1997;
Thurmond 1991). Overall, most researchers agree that an emphasis on local resources
seems to be a major characteristic of the period (see Boyd 1997; Drass 1997; Hofman
and Brooks 1989; J. Hughes 1991; Thurmond 1991).
Trade items are only rarely noted among settlements of the period, although
small percentages of projectile points produced from high quality, nonlocal tool stones
(i.e., Alibates silicified dolomite, Edwards chert, and Smoky Hill jasper) are noted in
most areas. Overall, the presence of high quality tool stone for the production of
chipped stone tools is widely observed among mobile foraging societies of the Plains
and adjacent regions, especially during the Early Holocene. Generally, these items are
traditionally thought to have been obtained as part of an embedded procurement
strategy rather than by exchange (see Binford 1980; Meltzer 1989).
Even though the procurement of nonlocal trade items through intersocietal
exchange seems to have been a relatively rare event, there are a few isolated examples
which provide evidence for the movement of some exotics over long-distances
between about A.D. 0 and A.D. 1000.

Bement and Brosowske (2001) have

documented obsidian derived from northwestern Plains and Jemez sources in Archaic

208

or Early Ceramic contexts of the Oklahoma panhandle (see Baugh and Nelson 1987).
To the south, Boyd (1997:319) mentions several petrographic studies conducted on
brownware ceramics recovered from Palo Duro complex sites in west Texas that attest
to contact with Eastern Jornada groups that inhabited southern New Mexico and
portions of west Texas.
Lastly, and perhaps the most widely cited evidence for intersocietal exchange
at this time is provided by examples north of the study area in the Central Plains.
Here, the presence of marine shell, copper, mica, and other exotic items recovered
from mortuary or ossuary contexts in northwestern Kansas and western Nebraska
document interaction with Hopewellian or other related groups in the Midwest (see
Kivett 1953; Wedel 1986:86-91). The latter examples are outside the study area, but
document participation in the far reaching exchange networks that developed in the
American Midwest and adjacent Plains around A.D. 0-200. Evidence for similar
developments is not observed on the Southern High Plains.
Except for the few isolated instances noted above, evidence for intersocietal
exchange during the Early Ceramic period is sparse. As a whole, the vast majority of
nonlocal items documented are limited primarily to chipped stone tools produced from
high quality tool stone which may or may not have been obtained through trade.
Finally, even during periods seemingly characterized by a paucity of evidence for
intersocietal contact, one might expect mortuary contexts to contain at least some
exotic items.

Recent work by Summer (1997) and Boyd (1997), however,

demonstrate that this is not the case as ornaments and utilitarian tools produced from
local materials dominate Early Ceramic burial contexts.

209

Middle Ceramic Period (A.D. 1250-1500)
Even though exchange is generally thought to be pervasive among all societies
(Earle 1994:420), it is surprising that evidence for intersocietal trade is as poorly
represented in the Early Ceramic record of the Southern High Plains as it is. In
general, exchange during the Archaic and Early Ceramic periods seems to have been
erratic at best and evidence for contact is limited largely to the sporadic transfer of raw
materials used for the production of basic utilitarian items.

The Early Ceramic

evidence stands in stark contrast to the exchange networks that emerged following
A.D. 1250. Here, exchange involved the regular and organized transfer of what
represent astounding quantities of utilitarian and exotic items compared to earlier
periods. These socioeconomic networks developed rapidly and coincide with the
appearance of highly distinctive Middle Ceramic period societies.

Antelope Creek Phase
Previous treatments of nonlocal trade items recovered at sites attributed to the
Antelope Creek phase have concentrated on objects obtained from the Southwest U.S.
Generally, these items have been much easier to identify than items obtained from
other Plains societies for two primary reasons. First, in stylistic terms, southwestern
trade items, such as ceramics and pipes, are generally quite distinct from traditional
Plains forms. Second, these items are often highly visible because they are commonly
produced from materials, such as obsidian or turquoise, which contrast markedly with
the raw materials usually recovered at Plains sites. Although these two observations
explain why trade goods from the Southwest are more visible and have garnered a

210

great deal more research attention in the past, as the following discussion imparts, it is
also apparent that durable trade items obtained from other Plains groups are not
particularly well represented at Antelope Creek phase sites (see Lintz and ReeseTaylor 1997).
These discussions focus on five primary classes of trade items that have been
recovered from Antelope Creek sites.

These include ceramics, chipped stone,

turquoise, marine shell (i.e, beads, tinklers, pendants, and gorgets), and Puebloan pipes
(see Baker and Baker 2000; Couzzourt and Schmidt-Couzzourt 1996; Crabb 1968;
Green 1986; Lintz 1986a:Table 31; 1991; Spielmann 1982; Watson 1950). Since
identifiable ceramic types provide a great deal of information regarding sources of
origin, particular emphasis is placed on this class of artifacts. Table 6.1 provides a
listing by settlement for the quantity of each of these objects at all of the Antelope
Creek sites for which this information is fairly well known and reported. It should be
noted that many of these site totals are calculated from Lintz (1986a:Table 31).
Underlined items in Table 6.1 refer to associated funerary objects.
Ceramics
A literature review documents approximately 339 southwestern sherds from
Antelope Creek settlements in the Canadian and Beaver drainages (see Baker and
Baker 2000; Couzzourt and Schmidt-Couzzourt 1996; Crabb 1968; Holden 1930,
1933; Lintz 1976, 1986a, 1991; Watson 1950).

This total number is substantially

lower than the “at least 465” figure suggested by Lintz (1991:94-95), but his total may
include data from additional sites that remain unpublished and are unknown to this
author.

Table 6.1 demonstrates that nearly all of the southwestern sherds are
concentrated at the largest settlements documented for the phase (i.e., as indicated by
the number of residential structures). In particular, the 188 Southwest sherds from

212

Alibates Ruin #28 (units I and II combined) near the Alibates Quarries clearly stands
out in comparison to all other settlements. Other sites, such as Alibates Ruin 28a and
30, are relatively small settlements, but still have fairly abundant nonlocal sherds
totals compared to other sites. Their proximity to Alibates Ruin #28 and the frequency
of these and other nonlocal items lend further support to the idea that these
settlements, along with Alibates Ruin #28, are part of a single large community (see
Figure 4.8). If so, then this large settlement accounts for 209 (61.7%) of the 339
Puebloan trade sherds in the sample. It should be noted that compared to locally
produced cordmarked wares, Southwest sherds make up a very small percentage of
assemblages at all sites.
Overall, only two sherds in the entire sample were recovered from settlements
that were probably home to four or fewer family groups (i.e., McGrath, Arrowhead
Peak). These data indicate that nonlocal sherds are very rare at small settlements
(Lintz 1991:95), which as discussed in Chapter Four, represent approximately 90% of
all Antelope Creek settlements. The remaining 128 (37.8%) sherds are from other
large communities (e.g., Chimney Rock 51, Saddleback, Landergin, 41MO35, and
Antelope Creek 22 and 24).
Crabb (1968) and Lintz (1991) have previously presented information on the
ceramic types, ages, and general source areas for 104 Puebloan sherds recovered from
Antelope Creek settlements in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These sherds
represent 19 Puebloan ceramic types from 11 different settlements and two isolated
find localities (Table 6.2).

Of these sites, McGrath, Stamper, Saddleback Ruin,

Alibates Ruin 28, Antelope Creek 22, Big Blue, and Landergin Mesa are fairly well

213

documented in the literature. Little is known, however, about the other four remaining
settlements (Chicken Creek, CR-1a, Ozier, and Floyd Ranch). Of these, CR-1a, Ozier,
and Floyd Ranch contain a large percentage of the ceramics in the sample (N=69 or
66%) and 12 of the 19 identified ceramic types. The significance of these nonlocal
items is difficult to assess since so little is known about these sites. Martha Crabb
(1968, 2004, personal communication), a student of Jack Hughes, has provided about
the only information available for these settlements and this information is worthy of
brief mention here.
Of these sites, CR-1a produced the largest number of Puebloan sherds (N=49).
This site and a related site immediately across the creek (CR-1) are on Running Water
Creek about 12 km northwest of the Canadian River in Moore County, Texas. Given
their proximity, it is likely that both of these sites combined to form a single
settlement. This site has produced abundant artifacts of the Middle Ceramic age, but
lacks stone architecture. Besides the nonlocal sherds, CR-1a has produced a number
of unusual artifacts, including discoidal stones covered in red ochre, clay figurines,
and eagle or hawk talons (Crabb 1968:84). Glasscock and Glasscock (1955) also note
that approximately 1000 disk beads were associated with a burial at this site. Half of
the cordmarked rim sherds from this site are collared and suggest substantial
interaction with Odessa phase or unknown groups from the Central Plains (see Lintz
and Reese-Taylor 1997). Both CR-1a and CR-1 were apparently destroyed as a result
of investigations carried out by Glasscock (Martha Crabb 2004, personal
communication; see Glasscock and Glasscock 1955).

Ozier Ranch Ruin (41MO96) is a sizeable settlement containing “numerous”
stone structures on the north side of the Canadian River near the mouth of Evans
Canyon (Texas Archeological Site Atlas 2003). This site is on a low bench adjacent to
the river and has both Antelope Creek and later, possibly Apache, components (Crabb

215

1968:85). As such, some of the Puebloan sherd types (e.g., San Lazaro) found here
might be associated with the later component.
The Floyd Ranch Ruin is on a high promontory along the south side of the
Canadian River. This site is near the New Mexico border and has two adjoining
rooms with flat laid stone masonry. Although diagnostic artifacts Antelope Creek
phase have been recovered at this small site, its west location, unique architecture, and
a relative abundance of Puebloan items, such as obsidian, a fibrolite stone axe,
turquoise, and painted and utilitarian wares, may also indicate short-term occupation
by Puebloan groups (Crabb 2004, personal communication).
Except for the San Lazaro Polychrome and Jeddito Yellow ware (a generic
name that includes several sequent types) sherds at the Ozier site, which are likely
related to a later component, all of the ceramic types recovered at Antelope Creek
settlements were produced within the accepted temporal span for the phase (i.e., A.D.
1250-1500) (Figure 6.1). As such, they are almost surely related to occupation of
these localities by Antelope Creek societies. Several of the types represented were
first produced around A.D. 1300 and suggest that exchange relationships with the
Puebloan groups were established about this time. However, both Santa Fe Black-onwhite and St. Johns Polychrome were produced as early as A.D. 1175 and may
indicate that contact began earlier. Although several types continued to be produced
after A.D. 1400, only the Largo Glaze-on-yellow and Largo Polychrome were first
produced after this date and clearly indicate that exchange between the two regions
continued into the fifteenth century. Given the limited sample sizes and because many
of the ceramic types were produced over 75 to 100 years, it is not possible to identify

216

hiatuses in exchange or periods of increased interaction between the two regions.
Instead these data only allow one to conclude that exchange relations were probably

Figure 6.1 Date Profiles of SW Ceramic Types from Antelope Creek Settlements.

Using the information presented in Chapter Five, it is possible to identify
probable production districts for the ceramic types recovered at Antelope Creek
settlements. Even though all of the ceramic types identified here were produced in
two or more districts (see Figure 5.7.), this information is certainly an improvement
over earlier studies which provided general statements regarding sources of origin for
these items (i.e., northern, western or southern Pueblos).
Cienguilla Glaze-on-yellow, Agua Fria Glaze-on-red, Largo Glaze-on-yellow,
and Santa Fe Black-on-white wares are the most widespread ceramic types among

217

settlements and occur at seven, five, three, and three sites, respectively (Tables 6.3).
The other remaining types occur less frequently. Although previous studies have not
specified whether the sherds recovered are from jars or bowls, the presence of Santa
Fe and Wiyo Black-on-white wares and Abiquiu Black-on-gray suggest that bowls, in
addition to jars, were obtained through exchange (see Honea 1973:79; Vint 1999:421).

The ceramic production districts most frequently represented at Antelope
Creek settlements are Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Pajarito (Table 6.4). Española,
Chama, Socorro, Pecos, and Sierra Blanca districts are represented by two or three
types. Lastly, no ceramics in the sample were derived from the Taos (e.g., Vadito and
Talpa Black-on-white types), Gallina (e.g, Gallina Black-on-gray), or Jemez districts
(e.g., Jemez Black-on-white) and suggest no contact with settlements in these areas.
The lack of ceramics from the latter two areas makes sense since the Gallina area
appears to have been abandoned by A.D. 1300 and most pueblos in the Jemez district
were not occupied until Glaze D times (ca. A.D. 1500) (Crown et al. 1996).

It is possible to further narrow down potential source areas for the ceramic
types discussed here in two ways. First, one can consider only those areas identified
in Table 6.4 as primary production districts and disregard those where individual types
were rarely produced. Second, specific portions of districts which are recognized as
probable centers of production can be emphasized and used (e.g., northern
Albuquerque and southern Santa Fe for the Glaze B Largo wares). Of course it is
recognized that each of these strategies is reasonable only if one assumes that
Antelope Creek settlements obtained these ceramics directly from primary production
districts and not through exchange networks with other pueblos.
It is apparent that the full range of ceramic types represented at Antelope Creek
settlements could not have been obtained from a single pueblo. As such, it is likely
that trade relationships with eastern pueblos were established and maintained by
individual settlements. In addition, as the following demonstrates, it is also evident
that settlements were not exclusively in contact with so called “gateway” communities
on the eastern fringes of the Anasazi world, but also were in contact with settlements
farther west.
So were the occupants of each individual settlement in contact with one or
several Puebloan settlements? In other words, at settlements where several ceramic
types have been recovered, would it have been possible to obtain all of these wares
from a single settlement? The answer appears to be yes in some cases, but no in
others. Except for the one Jeddito Yellow ware, all six types found at the Ozier Ranch
site could have been produced at single settlement in the southern Santa Fe district.

220

Likewise, at CR-1a, which had four types represented, exchange with a single pueblo
in the Pajarito district could have provided all the ceramics recovered here.
In contrast, at Alibates Ruin 28 and Antelope Creek 22 contact with at least
one community in either the Santa Fe or Pajarito districts and another in either the
Sierra Blanca or Socorro districts would have been minimally necessary to account for
all of the ceramic types present. Also of note is the remarkable redundancy in types
represented at these two settlements. Agua Fria Glaze-on-red, Cienguilla Glaze-onyellow, St. Johns Polychrome, and Lincoln Black-on-red were all recovered at both of
these sites. These parallels may indicate that close trade ties existed between these
settlements and/or that both communities had established exchange relationships with
Puebloan societies occupying the same districts, possibly even the same pueblos.
At Floyd Ranch it appears as though contact with settlements in the Santa Fe,
Pajarito, and either the Sierra Blanca or eastern Socorro districts would have been
necessary to obtain the types present. Similarly, at Saddleback it appears as though
groups were in contact with communities in each of the following districts: either the
Santa Fe or Pajarito districts, another in the Española or Chama districts, and finally
another in either the Albuquerque or Socorro districts. In addition, several of the
settlements mentioned here also contained wares that were derived from source areas
in eastern Arizona or western New Mexico (i.e., St. Johns Polychrome, Heshotauthla
Polychrome, and Jeddito Yellow ware) (Table 5.3). The type “Little Colorado Glaze
I” listed by Lintz (1991:Table 6.1) from Antelope Creek 22 was probably also derived
from this area, but does not equate to any known formal type (Wiseman 2004,
personal communication). Presently, it is not clear whether these wares were obtained

221

directly or through down-the-line contact with settlements in the Rio Grande and
Pecos river valleys, although the latter seems most likely (compare with Figure 5.4).
Overall, given the enormous amount of past research that has focused on
Anasazi decorated ceramics, it is clear that these items have the potential for providing
detailed information regarding the structure of prehistoric interaction and exchange
networks at present than perhaps any other class of artifacts (see for example HabichtMauche 1993; Vint 1999). While this has long been recognized in the Southwest,
little sustained interest in Puebloan ceramics has been generated among Plains
researchers. Currently, these data have little to offer regarding a detailed chronology
of Plains-Pueblo exchange, but as demonstrated here, they can certainly provide fairly
detailed information about potential Pueblo communities with which groups in the
study area may have been in contact.
The preceding discussions have identified specific districts that served as
sources for decorated ceramics recovered at Antelope Creek settlements. Most often
these districts included Santa Fe, Pajarito, and Albuquerque, but contact with
communities in the Española, Chama, Socorro, Sierra Blanca, and Pecos areas are also
indicated. Table 6.5 provides a listing of a few of the larger settlements occupied
between A.D. 1250-1500 in each of these areas (see Adler 1996:Appendix; Cordell
1989; Crown et al. 1996; Spielmann 1996).

These sites represent some of the

Puebloan communities where decorated ceramics may have been produced.

Obsidian
Whereas decorated sherds obtained through exchange with eastern Anasazi
groups were clearly concentrated among the largest Antelope Creek settlements, the
distribution of obsidian indicates that access to other items from the Southwest was
much more widespread among sites. With this being said it is still apparent that
obsidian is clearly much more abundant at large settlements. Although researchers
working on Antelope Creek phase have long noted the presence of this exotic resource
at settlements, little systematic analysis has been conducted to identify the specific
source areas for obsidian from these sites. This problem has been somewhat amended
by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses conducted as a part of this research (see
Appendix V). This discussion primarily identifies patterns in obsidian distribution
among settlements, although the results of recent XRF analyses are also presented and
provide information regarding sources of origin. Unfortunately, even though source
areas have been determined for some of these artifacts, it is not possible at this time to

223

identify specific settlements in New Mexico that may have ultimately supplied this
resource to societies in the study area. Figure 6.2 shows examples of obsidian from a
few select sites. All of these artifacts are unmodified flakes except for six projectile
points from Chimney Rock Ruins 51.

Figure 6.2 Obsidian from Select Antelope Creek Settlements.

Obsidian is present at 17 of 27 (63%) Antelope Creek settlements for which we
have good data (Table 6.1). Additional sites such as Alibates Ruin 30, Saddleback
Ruin, Coetas Creek Ruin, Tarbox Ruin, and Antelope Creek 22 also had obsidian, but

224

specific frequencies from these sites remain unknown (Baker and Baker 2000; Holden
1933; Studer 1934). While obsidian is present at most sites, except for a few large
sites, this resource is generally not very abundant at settlements of the phase. Of these
sites, Chimney Rock 51 and sites within the cluster near the Alibates quarries (i.e.,
Alibates Ruins) clearly have the highest frequencies of this resource with quantities
numbering in the thousands (Lintz 1986a:Table 31, 1990; Studer n.d.:4). Of the
remaining sites, only 41MO35 and Landergin Mesa have what may be considered
fairly sizeable quantities of obsidian (i.e., 99 and 111 pieces; Couzzourt and SchmidtCouzzourt 1996; Lintz 1990, 1991). Each of the major source areas for obsidian used
by Middle Ceramic populations of the Southern High Plains was presented in Chapter
Five.
Currently, source data are available from eight different Antelope Creek
settlements in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.

Previously, trace element

analysis (XRF) had only been conducted on nine pieces of obsidian from three sites
(Lintz 1990; Mitchell et al. 1980). Six samples of obsidian from Landergin Mesa
were all identified as Cerro Toledo Rhyolite (Obsidian Ridge).

Originally, the

samples from Tarbox Ruin (n=1) and the McGarraugh Ranch site (n=2) were
tentatively identified as Valle Grande obsidian (Mitchell et al. 1980:304). However,
further examination of the element abundances presented by Mitchell et al. (1980)
indicates that these artifacts were definitely not derived from the Valles Caldera, but
were probably obtained from Cerro Toledo sources (Shackley 2003, personal
communication). This reinterpretation fits well with the recent XRF results from
obsidian recovered at other Antelope Creek sites in the region (Table 6.6).

As a part of this research, obsidian source areas were identified for 57 samples
of obsidian from Alibates Ruin #28 (units I and II), Chimney Rock Ruin 51, Roy
Smith, Stamper, and the Archie King Ruins (see Figure 6.2). Sourced items included
flake debris (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes) and finished tools (i.e.,
projectile points).

These results, combined with those from earlier studies,

demonstrate that nearly all (i.e., 57 of 58 samples) of the obsidian obtained from six
Antelope Creek settlements in the Canadian River valley of the Texas panhandle (i.e.,
Tarbox, McGarraugh Ranch, Landergin Mesa, Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock 51,
and the Archie King Ruins) were obtained from Cerro Toledo sources (Table 6.6).
Additional analysis is required to determine if this same pattern holds true for other
settlements in this portion of the distribution.
The sample from Antelope Creek sites in the Oklahoma panhandle is quite
meager, but then again, obsidian is quite rare at sites in this area. The eight samples
from Roy Smith and Stamper include materials from New Mexico (i.e., Cerro Toledo
and Valle Grande), Wyoming, and Idaho (Table 6.6). The small sample available

226

from these settlements certainly limits our ability to interpret these results, however,
the presence of materials from Cerro Toledo and Valle Grande, as well as source areas
in the northwestern Plains, is similar to that observed for the nearby Odessa phase.
The three samples from Two Sisters shown in Figure 6.2 were also sent in for source
analysis, but were too small for accurate measurement.
Obsidian recovered at Antelope Creek phase sites occurs almost exclusively as
nonmodified flake debris, although a few projectile points, scrapers, and utilized
flakes do occur at times. Primary and secondary flakes with cortex are fairly abundant
and indicate procurement from both bedrock and gravel sources. The presence of
early stage production debris at permanent habitation sites in the study area also
indicates that these materials were transported to settlements in cobble form and not as
finished objects. Although precise proveniences are almost entirely lacking for these
items, it is apparent that they occur in general surface contexts and as midden debris.
Obsidian is not documented from mortuary contexts.
In sum, although obsidian has been recovered at a variety of settlements, it is
clearly most abundant at the largest communities of the phase (e.g., the Alibates Ruin
Villages and Chimney Rock 51). Also of interest is the concentration of obsidian at
some sites along the Canadian River and its rarity at settlements in the Oklahoma
panhandle. A similar trend was noted in the distribution of southwestern ceramics.
All but a small percentage of obsidian was derived from sources of Cerro
Toledo Rhyolite. These materials can be obtained both as gravels in the Rio Grande
River and in landslide deposits resulting from the collapse of the Toledo Caldera
(Shackley 2000). A review of the literature suggests that there is little evidence to

227

support the proposition that any eastern Anasazi settlement controlled source areas
and/or were actively involved in the mining, production, and exchange of obsidian
prior to A.D. 1500 (see Head 1999:528-534). The presence of early and late stage
obsidian production debris at sites in the study area also seems to support such a
conclusion.

In addition, the fact that Cerro Toledo Rhyolite obsidian is widely

distributed (i.e., from primary source areas in the Jemez Mountains and in the
alluvium of the Rio Grande River) also means that it would have represented a
resource that would have been difficult for any one community to claim exclusive
rights to access. This would not have been the case for obsidian obtained from the
Valle Grande source since these materials are only available within the caldera proper.
The latter source, however, is only represented by a single flake from the Roy Smith
site.
Early stage production debris and the recovery of obsidian flakes containing
cortical surfaces indicative of bedrock and gravel sources clearly suggest that these
materials were obtained in cobble form and not as finished objects.

These raw

materials could have been obtained either by 1) direct procurement at the caldera or
from alluvial contexts, 2) through exchange with settlements near the Toledo Caldera
(e.g., Jemez and Pajarito districts) or 3) through exchange with settlements located
farther downstream along the Rio Grande (e.g., eastern Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and
Socorro districts).

If indeed obsidian was obtained through exchange, then the

ceramic data presented earlier would appear to suggest that contacts were with groups
in the Pajarito and Santa Fe or Albuquerque districts.

228

Other Nonlocal Lithic Materials
Overall, evidence for exchange of other lithic materials used for chipped stone
tool production at Antelope Creek settlements is fairly rare. This, however, is not
particularly surprising considering that bedrock and gravel sources of Alibates
silicified dolomite are readily available along the Canadian River and were used by
groups throughout the distribution of the phase. In general, analysis of collections
indicates that Alibates comprises over 95% of chipped stone assemblages for Antelope
Creek sites in the Texas panhandle (Baker and Baker 2000:83; Bandy 1976;
Brosowske unpublished data). The remainder consists primarily of Dakota or Ogallala
quartzites. Smoky Hill or Niobrara jasper is rare (i.e., <0.1%) or absent from sites in
this area.
The abundance of Alibates at Antelope Creek sites in the Oklahoma panhandle
indicates that these groups developed and maintained exchange relationships with
related populations near the Alibates quarries along the Canadian River (see Duncan
2002; Lintz 1976; Schneider 1969; Brosowske unpublished data). These settlements
are at least 125 km from the Alibates Flint Quarries National monument, but still have
lithic assemblages that usually contain of over 80% Alibates (Figure 6.3). Chipped
stone items of Alibates at each of these settlements occur primarily as formal tools,
large tertiary flakes, and retouch debris. Very few cores and little production debris
are present. All of this suggests that this material entered the site as finished tools and
large flake blanks suitable for the production of nonspecialized tools.

Figure 6.3 Lithic Raw Material Use at Antelope Creek Sites in Oklahoma.

Remaining portions of the chipped stone assemblage are primarily comprised
of locally available quartzites and cherts obtained from exposures of the Ogallala
formation. In terms of quality, these materials are inferior to Alibates. Nonetheless,
these local materials frequently occur as debitage reflecting all stages of lithic
production and some finished tools at many sites. In general, although these materials
were used at times to produce projectile points, beveled knives, and scrapers, more
often they are limited to informal tool types, such as utilized flakes and crude bifaces.
As observed at sites along the Canadian River, Smoky Hill jasper occurs infrequently
at Antelope Creek sites in the Oklahoma panhandle.

Altogether, this material

comprises 2% or less of all chipped stone items (see Duncan 2002; Lintz 1976;
Schneider 1969).

230

Marine Shell
Marine shell artifacts

at Antelope Creek

settlements include disk

(Laevicardium elatum or Glycymeris) and spire-lopped beads (likely Olivella dama),
and rarely, tinklers (Conus), gorgets and pendants (Busycon or Strombus, and possibly
Haliotis). Table 6.1 shows the distribution of marine shell artifacts at settlements of
the region.
Including the results presented by Glasscock and Glasscock (1955) and Lintz
(1986a:Table 31) it is estimated that approximately 2174 disk beads were recovered
from 10 different sites in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles (Table 6.1). While
these beads are certainly more numerous than other forms and appear to be widespread
among settlements, it should be noted that nearly all of these were associated with a
single burial at CR-1a and two burials at Antelope Creek 22A (N=2056 or 94.6%). At
the latter, disk beads were associated with a young adult female (N=940) and a young
child (N=116) in an abandoned habitation structure at the site (Lintz 1986a:Table 34;
Summer 1997:Table 5.2). This house is the only habitation structure documented at
this site and it contained a total of 16 interments. Lintz (1986a:317) suggests that
following abandonment this structure was used as a formal cemetery by the occupants
of the adjacent Antelope Creek 22 settlement. Glasscock and Glasscock (1955) notes
that approximately 1000 disk beads were recovered from a burial context at CR-1a.
Shell disk beads were also included with burials at Footprint (N=65) and Stamper
(N=5) (Green 1986; Watson 1950) (see Figure 6.4). Small quantities of these beads
(N=48) were also recovered in general settlement refuse at Alibates Ruin 28,
Landergin Mesa, Antelope Creek 22, Roy Smith, Two Sisters, and McGrath.

231

Figure 6.4 Marine Shell from Burial Pits A and B at Footprint (adapted from Green 1986).

Although shell disk beads can be found in small frequencies at both large and
small settlements of the phase, it is clear that they are overwhelmingly associated with
mortuary contexts (i.e., 97.8% of the time).

In some cases, such as CR-1a and

Antelope Creek 22A sizeable quantities (i.e., strings of several hundred marine shell
beads) of these beads were interred with certain members of society, usually women
and children.

As such, the pattern noted earlier for southwestern ceramics and

obsidian (i.e., dispersed among midden and general surface debris) is not observed for
this class of nonlocal items. Overall, however, given the small size of these artifacts it
is possible that unless fine screening of soil matrix was conducted during fieldwork,
many of these items would not be recovered. The recovery of enormous quantities of
disk beads at some settlements strongly supports the idea that these items were derived

232

from the Southwest where they were mass produced at shell ornament production
centers.
Approximately 170 Olivella shell beads are documented for 11 of the 30
(36.7%) Antelope Creek settlements shown in Table 6.1. An additional 56 Olivella
beads were recovered from Coetas Ruin (Studer 1934:94) for a total of about 226
beads. Overall, these ornaments occur in both general site debris (125 or 55.3%) and
in mortuary contexts (101 or 44.7%). Excluding the 128 Olivella beads recovered at
Chimney Rock 51 and Coetas Ruin, it is apparent that these items are not particularly
abundant at settlements of the phase; in fact, as a whole, they are less numerous than
southwestern ceramic sherds. On a general level, however, Olivella beads do seem to
be more common at larger sites (Table 6.1). This pattern especially holds true if one
considers the fact that the 22 Olivella beads associated with female and child burials at
Antelope Creek 22A were probably derived from occupants of Antelope Creek 22.
All of the beads from Coetas Ruin (N=56) and Alibates Ruin 28 (N=10) are
from burial contexts for which we have fairly good information. At Coetas Ruin the
Olivella beads were interred with a child of unknown age and at Alibates Ruin 28 they
were recovered with a child approximately 10 years old (Baker and Baker 2000: 154).
The association of these items with children is similar to that observed above for disk
beads
Conus tinklers and other marine shell are quite rare at Antelope Creek
settlements.

A total of seven Conus tinklers are documented from three sites

(Footprint, N=5; Chimney Rock 51, N=1; Alibates Ruin 28, N=1). The five tinklers
from Footprint are all from burial pit A, which was in an abandoned habitation

233

structure (i.e., Room I) (Figure 6.4).

This feature contained the remains of two

infants, one juvenile, and four adults (Green 1986:78). Unfortunately, it could not be
determined with which burial or burials the shell tinklers were associated.

The

remaining two tinklers from Chimney Rock 51 and Alibates Ruin were apparently
recovered within general midden deposits (see Baker and Baker 2000:246).
Other marine shell artifacts include conch shell gorgets, a conch shell pendant
and one item simply identified as marine shell (Lintz 1986a:Table 34; Summers
1997:Table 5.2). Two conch shell gorgets (see Green 1986:Figure 45) were recovered
from burial pit B at Footprint (Figure 6.4). This feature is also within Room I (see
above description of burial pit A) and it contained the remains of one infant, two
juveniles, and four adults (Green 1986:80).

The third conch shell gorget was

recovered from the adult female burial at Antelope Creek 22A that also contained the
940 disk beads and four Olivella beads (Lintz 1986a:Table 34). A conch pendant was
also recovered with the two to four year old child mentioned above that contained 116
disk beads.

This pendant was complete and also had a turquoise inlay (Lintz

1986a:173). The unknown marine shell ornament was recovered with an adult male at
Antelope Creek 22A. In addition, Studer (1934:91) notes that besides Olivella shell,
other Pacific coast shell was recovered from midden and burial contexts at Coetas
Ruin. Unfortunately, these marine shell species and their quantities for this site are
not known.
It is apparent that nearly all of the Conus and conch shell artifacts found at
Antelope Creek settlements are recovered almost exclusively from mortuary contexts.
Although the exact association of these items in burial pits A and B at Footprint is

234

unclear, it is possible that all of these types of marine shell ornaments were included
as grave items with either females or children. A similar pattern was noted above for
disk and Olivella beads.
Turquoise
Turquoise and other types of blue-green stone (e.g., malachite, amazonite,
azurite) derived from the Southwest are generally quite rare at Antelope Creek
settlements (i.e., only 16.6% of the sites). Approximately 30 turquoise beads and
pendants are documented at five settlements (Landergin Mesa, N=7; Alibates Ruin 28,
N=12; Chimney Rock 51, N=>4; Stamper, N=2; Antelope Creek 24, N=1; and
Antelope Creek 22A, N=5).

These data indicate that turquoise jewelry is

concentrated, albeit in small numbers, at the largest settlements of the phase. In
contrast to other exotic items discussed above, these trade goods are not primarily
associated with mortuary contexts, but seem to be dispersed among general site debris.
With this being said, however, all of the turquoise items recovered at Antelope Creek
22A were associated with the two burials noted above (i.e., the adult female and
child).
Pipes and Pipestone
Very little information is currently available regarding pipes and the raw
materials used to produce these items at Antelope Creek sites. A few tubular or
“Cloudblower” Puebloan pipes are documented in the literature from Footprint (N=1),
Alibates Ruin 28 (N=5), Chimney Rock Ruin 51 (N=9), and Coetas (N=unknown)
(see Baker and Baker 2000:309, 310, 312; Green 1986:93; Harrison n.d.; Studer
1934:94). Studer (1934:94) notes that several “Cloudblower” forms were recovered

235

from Coetas Ruin, but does not provide specific information about their precise
number or provenience. Lintz (1991:98-99) also notes that a stone “Pecos” pipe was
recovered from the McGarraugh Ranch site and provides a drawing of another tubular
(stone?) pipe from the Matthews Ranch Ruin. No additional information regarding the
context of these artifacts is given by Lintz (1991). Overall, at least 16 tubular style
Puebloan pipes of either clay or stone are documented from four different settlements.
Precise details regarding the context of these trade items are not known.

The

remaining pipe forms represented at sites of the phase are typical Plains varieties (i.e.,
Elbow pipes) (see Figure 6.5).

Figure 6.5 Select Pipes Recovered from Antelope Creek Sites (redrawn from Harrison n.d.).

236

Information regarding the raw materials used to produce pipes is equally poor.
Harrison (n.d.) has provided limited details about raw materials for a sample of 25
pipes from Antelope Creek Ruin 22 and 24, Alibates Ruin 28, and Chimney Rock 51.
All of these pipes were produced from either clay (N=12) or a red pipestone (N=13).
A visual inspection of the latter at the Panhandle-Plains Museum in Canyon, Texas,
suggests that many of these items may be Kansas pipestone from the glacial till in
eastern Nebraska and Kansas. Of the 49 total pipes examined by the author from
Alibates Ruin 28, only 9 (18.4%) were of red pipestone (Brosowske unpublished
data). Although specific source areas for other raw materials represented are not
known, it is probable that they are local in origin.
Summary
The preceding discussions have reviewed the major classes of nonlocal trade
items recovered at Antelope Creek settlements of the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles. Additional items of nonlocal origin are also documented and include
mica scraps, ground coal artifacts, soapstone and red stone beads, and one fibrolite axe
(Lintz 1991). These items have not been previously discussed in detail elsewhere in
print (see Baker and Baker 2000; Lintz 1986a, 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983). This
suggests that they are quite rare and represent isolated examples of items also derived
from the eastern Pueblos. As such, these artifacts were not discussed here.
The distribution and frequency of exotic items presented here demonstrates
that nonlocal trade goods, which were almost entirely derived from the Southwest, are
concentrated at the largest communities of the Antelope Creek phase. The most

237

abundant trade items were southwestern ceramic sherds, disk beads, and obsidian.
Other items occurred less frequently, but were still associated with larger settlements.
Besides the association of the sizeable quantities of exotic items at large
settlements, several other patterns were observed. First, nearly all of the artifacts
documented here are items that are related to the political sphere of exchange (e.g.,
ceramics, marine shell jewelry, turquoise, and pipes). In addition, although obsidian
was used to produce tools that are generally thought to be associated with subsistence
activities, given the distances at which these materials were derived it could be argued
that this class of artifacts is also related to the political realm. Other nonlocal lithics
obtained through contact with other Plains groups were very rare (e.g., Smoky Hill
jasper) and were limited primarily to settlements in the Oklahoma portion of the
distribution. The latter were used and discarded in utilitarian contexts.
Of the trade items examined here it is obvious that the southwestern decorated
sherds provide the greatest amount information regarding intersocietal trade
relationships. As such, a great deal of time was spent discussing likely source areas
and age ranges for these artifacts. Southwestern ceramics recovered at Antelope
Creek sites indicate that decorated jars and bowls were obtained through exchange
with several potential settlements in the Rio Grande and Pecos river valleys. These
items suggest that contact with these communities could have begun as early A.D.
1250 and continued until the end of the phase (i.e., A.D. 1500). Previously, Lintz
(1986a, 1991) has proposed that exchange with the eastern Pueblos increased
dramatically following A.D. 1350, however, as discussed earlier, the current

238

chronological control for the phase is so limited that it is not possible to support or
refute such a proposition at this time.
Nonetheless, the ceramic data suggests that many of the largest Antelope
Creek communities had established contact with one or more Puebloan settlements
sometime following A.D. 1250. Most frequently these communities appear to have
been in the Santa Fe, Pajarito, and Albuquerque districts, although contact with
pueblos in the Española, Chama, Socorro, and Sierra Blanca districts were also noted.
The location of these communities indicates that trade relations were not limited to the
so called “Gateway” settlements frequently described in the literature (e.g., Taos,
Pecos, Gran Quivira, etc.). Equally important was lack of evidence for contact with
populations in the Taos, Gallina, and Jemez areas.
While the recovery of turquoise and obsidian do not provide precise
information regarding specific pueblos which may have served as source areas, it is
highly likely that these items would have been available at those same pueblos where
the above ceramics were obtained (e.g., particularly in the Santa Fe, Galisteo Basin,
Española, and Albuquerque areas). Hence, they serve to compliment the ceramic data.
In regards to marine shell at Antelope Creek settlements, it is apparent that
nearly all of these items, except for some Olivella shell beads, were limited almost
exclusively to mortuary contexts present at large settlements. For example, while
marine shell beads were rare or absent from general site contexts, it was not
uncommon to see hundreds of these artifacts interred with burials. In addition, it was
also noted that these items were usually associated with the burials of some females

239

and children. In general, there was little evidence for exotic items associated with
adult male burials (see Lintz 1986a:Table 34; Summers 1997:Table 5.2).

Odessa Phase
In comparison to sites of the Antelope Creek phase, which have been
extensively investigated through numerous, large-scale excavation projects over the
last 80 years, settlements of the Odessa phase have for the most part received very
little formal investigation. As a result, precise information regarding the distribution
and frequency of nonlocal trade is limited and known for very few settlements (Table
6.7). In general, except for Odessa Yates, Lonker, Lundeen, and sites of the Buried
City locality, which have all received some formal investigation in the past, many of
the settlements discussed here are known only from small surface collections made by
avocational archaeologists. Given the small sample sizes currently available, the
abundance of nonlocal items at Odessa phase settlements is difficult to assess. Despite
these problems it is apparent that nonlocal trade goods at Odessa phase settlements
comprise a higher percentage of assemblages and have a broader distribution among
sites than is documented above for Antelope Creek phase sites. In many instances,
however, the frequency of these items is undoubtedly higher than is presented here.
In the ensuing discussion nonlocal trade items are presented for Odessa phase
settlements that have been formally investigated or for which surface collections of
more than 50 items are available (Table 6.7). Artifacts emphasized here include
nonlocal chipped stone, ceramics, marine shell, turquoise, and Kansas pipestone.
Additional items are also documented, but they occur in relatively few instances. As

240

such, the latter are examined on a case by case basis throughout the following
discussion.

This information, although less abundant and detailed than what is

available for the Antelope Creek phase, still provides key information regarding the
role of intersocietal interaction and exchange among Odessa phase societies. Because
many of the trade items examined here are known primarily from private collections,
precise counts for many of these artifacts are often not possible. By necessity, many
of the quantities presented in Table 6.7 simply represent conservative estimates. In
other cases, it is only possible to note whether specific classes of items are present or
absent at settlements.

Figure 6.6 shows the general locations for Odessa phase

settlements discussed here.

It should be emphasized that the greatest majority of nonlocal items recovered
at Odessa phase settlements are from surface contexts. As such, it is reasonable to

241

question whether these materials can be reliably attributed to Middle Ceramic
occupations (A.D. 1250-1500). Except for perhaps some of the sites along Wolf
Creek, all of the Odessa phase settlements that are discussed here represent, as best as
can be determined, single component Middle Ceramic sites and lack diagnostic
artifacts that would suggest occupation by later groups. In addition, the recovery of
similar types of trade items, albeit in smaller frequencies, from excavated contexts
which have been dated also strongly suggests that these items are of Middle Ceramic
age.

Figure 6.6 Odessa Phase Settlements discussed in Text.

242

Obsidian
Obsidian is commonly recovered at Odessa phase settlements of all sizes (i.e.,
extended villages and homesteads) (Figure 6.7). Of the 10 settlements presented in
Table 6.7, obsidian is documented at eight or 80% of these sites. Even though this
resource is present at most sites, and its complete absence at sites is fairly rare, there
are notable differences in its frequency from settlement to settlement. In general,
although exceptions exist, this variability appears to be largely related to settlement
size. Of the sites presented in Table 6.7, all of the examples with high quantities of
obsidian are large settlements.

Figure 6.7 Obsidian from Select Odessa Phase Settlements.

As a whole, more obsidian has been recovered at Odessa Yates (34BV100)
than at any other Odessa phase settlement or any other site in the state of Oklahoma.

243

Although precise counts are not available, at least 2000 obsidian flakes have been
observed by the author in private collections from this site. Because countless people
have intensively surface collected enormous quantities of artifacts, including obsidian,
from this site over the last 100 years, it is clear that the overall amount is substantially
higher than that reported in Table 6.7 (i.e., 2000).
The quantity of obsidian at other large Odessa phase sites is much less than
what is observed at Odessa Yates. Obsidian is remarkably rare at settlements that
comprise the large extended village along Wolf Creek known as the Buried City
locality. Even though these sites form a settlement at least equal in size to the village
on Clear Creek and is located only 48 km to the south, there are only about 200
obsidian artifacts known from private collections and formal excavations at Buried
City (Brosowske et al. 2003; D. Hughes n.d.; D. Witt 2003, personal communication).
Likewise, Sprague and Watson are two additional settlements that contain at least 150
obsidian artifacts. Both of these settlements also comprise portions of large villages
along Duck Pond and Kiowa creeks. Lastly, the quantity of obsidian from small,
single family homesteads (e.g., Lundeen, Lonker, Skull Springs, and Miller) seems to
be quite small. Even though the amount of systematic research carried out at the latter
settlements varies from small to relatively large-scale, the limited amount of obsidian
and other nonlocal trade items recovered at these sites seems to be accurate.
A total of 65 obsidian artifacts from 10 Odessa phase settlements have been
subjected to XRF analysis (Figure 6.7). At least five different obsidian source areas
are documented for this sample (Table 6.8; see Appendix 2). The sample studied
includes debitage (N=50) and projectile points (N=15).

244

Although Cerro Toledo

Rhyolite does not dominate the sample to the extent observed among Antelope Creek
settlements, it still comprises 80% of the obsidian examined in this study (i.e., 52
artifacts from nine settlements). Obsidian from the Valles Caldera is represented by
seven artifacts (10.8%) from four settlements.
The remaining obsidian artifacts were sourced to Malad, Idaho (N=1); Fish
Creek, Wyoming (N=1); and unknown sources (N=2). The latter exhibit a chemical
composition with high strontium values similar to obsidian from the Yellowstone
region; as such, it is likely that they were obtained from sources in this area whose
elemental signatures remain uncharacterized (Shackley 1999). Each of these source
areas document contacts with unknown populations in the Northwestern Plains.

Also of interest are two artifacts that are visually identical (both macro and
microscopically) to obsidian. These items are not obsidian, but appear to be some
highly cryptocrystalline variety of smoky quartz. I am not aware of any other study on
the Plains that has documented this material, but unless trace element analysis is

245

conducted it is not likely to be recognized and would be simply identified as obsidian.
Nonetheless, this material makes up a small percentage of the overall sample (3.5%)
and was only recovered at Odessa Yates. Although the geological origin of this
material is not entirely clear, the Wichita Mountain area of southwest Oklahoma may
be the most likely source (see discussion below on quartz crystal).
As noted above, samples submitted for XRF analysis included both debitage
and formal tools. As observed among the obsidian from Alibates Ruin 28, unmodified
debris generally comprises greater than 95% of the obsidian observed at Odessa phase
settlements. As a whole, debitage present at the latter sites are smaller than that
recovered at Alibates Ruin 28 and suggests more intensive working. The flake debris
present includes material indicative of all stages of production (i.e., primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes), although late stage production debris overwhelmingly
dominates. Presently, the only formal tools of obsidian that I have observed are
projectile points. These include primarily Washita and Fresno varieties, although a
few corner notched projectile points are also represented. The presence of production
debris indicates the procurement and transportation of obsidian nodules rather than
finished items to Odessa phase villages. Although some obsidian is recovered from
midden deposits in abandoned habitation structures and cache pits, the majority of this
material appears to occur as general surface debris.
There are many observations regarding obsidian artifacts at Odessa phase
settlements that were also noted earlier for the Antelope Creek phase. First, the
production of obsidian tools occurred at Odessa phase villages and not at settlements
near the source areas. As a whole, this material appears to have been used primarily

246

for the manufacture of projectile points; other formal tools are rare to nonexistent.
Second, production and resharpening debris comprises the greatest proportion of
obsidian recovered from sites. Third, obsidian present at both phases was obtained
from both bedrock and secondary sources. Fourth, most obsidian has been recovered
from general surface or midden contexts.
In general, the high ratio of unmodified debitage to projectile points at both
Odessa and Antelope Creek settlements is intriguing. This ratio is much higher than
what is observed for other tool stones and is estimated to be at least 100 to 1. It is
unclear why more finished items are not represented, but it is possible that obsidian
artifacts are concentrated in contexts that remain poorly sampled at this time (e.g.,
bison kill sites).
The primary difference that may be noted between obsidian recovered at
Odessa and Antelope Creek phase sites is its distribution among settlements. While
obsidian was concentrated almost entirely at a few of the largest Antelope Creek
settlements, it seems to consistently occur at both villages and homesteads of the
Odessa phase. Similar distributional patterns are also noted for other highly exotic
materials as well.

Although this material is widely dispersed, albeit in small

quantities, among all settlements, it is still apparent that it is most abundant in portions
of large extended villages. This is most apparent at Odessa Yates where several
thousand pieces of obsidian from several different source areas are documented.
Nearly 91% of the obsidian recovered from Odessa phase settlements was
derived from the Cerro Toledo and Valle Grande sources in the Jemez Mountains of
New Mexico. The former is represented by materials obtained from both bedrock and

247

alluvial sources, while the latter is only available from primary source areas in the
Valles Caldera.

The presence of these materials suggests contact with Puebloan

communities in Pajarito, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Salinas districts. These source
areas are different than those documented for the Antelope Creek phase and may
indicate separate, non-cooperative trading expeditions to the Southwest by settlements
of each phase. Likewise, the presence of Northwestern Plains obsidian at the Odessa
phase settlements further documents the existence of trade relationships that were
apparently not established by villages of the Antelope Creek phase.
Other Nonlocal Tool Stone
Raw materials used for utilitarian chipped stone tools by the Odessa phase
provide important information regarding intersocietal exchange.

As noted in the

preceding chapter, sources of high quality chipped stone are not locally available in
the area occupied by the phase. Although the area is not devoid of knappable sources
of stone, locally available material from the Ogallala Formation are of much poorer
quality than either Alibates silicified dolomite or Smoky Hill jasper.
Whereas Antelope Creek chipped stone assemblages reflect an almost
complete reliance on Alibates silicified dolomite, Odessa phase settlements almost
always show a balance between several source areas (Figure 6.8). These sources
usually include Alibates, Smoky Hill jasper, and other materials (see Figure 5.1). The
latter consists largely of locally available materials (e.g., Ogallala quartzite and
silicified caliche), although some additional exotic materials are also included (e.g.,
Flint Hills and Edwards cherts and quartz crystal).

Figure 6.8 Lithic Raw Material Use at Select Odessa Phase Settlements.

In general, the most distinctive characteristic of Odessa phase chipped stone
assemblages is the abundance of Smoky Hill jasper from northwest Kansas and
southwest Nebraska. This material usually comprises between 15-30% of all chipped
stone artifacts (i.e., debitage and finished tools) at settlements throughout the
distribution, except for sites along Wolf Creek, such as the Gould Ruin and Courson
B, where it usually comprises a lesser percentage (Bevitt 1999; Brosowske 2002b; D.
Hughes n.d.). From the Odessa Yates site (34BV100), which is centrally located
within the distribution, the nearest sources of Smoky Hill are about 250 km to the
north. Debitage for this material shows up largely as late stage and resharpening

249

debris, although some cortical debris does occur (Table 6.9). This suggests that
Smoky Hill items arrive at sites primarily as late stage or finished tools.
Even though the relative abundance of Smoky Hill jasper serves as a key
diagnostic marker of Odessa phase settlements, Alibates silicified dolomite is still the
most common type of tool stone at these sites. This material usually comprises
between 45% and 65% at most settlements, although it is often higher among some
sites at the Buried City locality (e.g., Gould Ruin and Courson B). Flake debris is
limited almost entirely to late stage production and resharpening debitage and suggests
that little to no production of Alibates tools occurred at Odessa phase settlements
(Table 6.9).

In general, even though little cortical debris has been recovered at

settlements it is likely that most of this material was ultimately derived from primary
quarry locations. This conclusion is supported by the high quality of material present
and the overall size of select tools, such as beveled knives, scrapers, and other flake
tools, recovered at settlements. It is expected that poorer quality material and smaller
tools would be represented if the Alibates present was derived largely from secondary
alluvial sources along the Canadian River. This pattern is observed for Archaic and
Early and Middle Ceramic sites in central and western Oklahoma (see Drass 1997).

Other important nonlocal lithic materials recovered at Odessa phase
settlements include knappable quality quartz crystal and cherts derived from the Flint
Hills region of Kansas. The quartz crystal recovered at Odessa phase settlements
follows many of the patterns noted for obsidian. For example, this material occurs
primarily as debitage and all stages of production debris are represented. Finished
items, however, are even rarer than was noted for obsidian, but include projectile
points and pendants. Quartz crystal occurs in both midden deposits and as site surface
debris. In general, although found at most sites of the phase, abundant production
debris has only been documented at Odessa Yates (R. Tibbetts 1998, personal
communication). Overall, the similarities observed for obsidian and quartz crystal
suggests that these two types of stone may have represented material equivalents.
On the Southern High Plains, quartz crystal is limited almost entirely to
settlements of the Odessa phase. Outside of these sites, the author has observed only a
few flakes of this material in two Antelope Creek assemblages in the Oklahoma
panhandle (i.e., Roy Smith and Stamper). This material is, however, fairly abundant at
some Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700) sites in west-central Oklahoma and lends
support to the idea that it was derived from source areas in the Wichita Mountains.
Cherts derived from the Flint Hills of Kansas that are recovered at Odessa
settlements are limited primarily to gray Permian varieties (i.e., Florence B). This tool
stone seems to be most common at Odessa phase settlements along the eastern and
northern margins of the distribution. For instance, at Price and other settlements in
these areas (i.e., along the lower reaches of Wolf Creek and the headwaters of Kiowa
Creek), gray Permian cherts may comprise 15% to 20% of chipped stone assemblages.

251

Elsewhere, finished tools of Florence B, usually beveled knives and scrapers, are
present, but occur in low frequencies. It is interesting to note that Florence A is
extremely rare at Odessa phase settlements. This is not surprising considering that
most Odessa settlements appear to predate the occupation and control of the Florence
A quarry areas (see Vehik 1986). Although Florence A chert artifacts are purported to
come from some Odessa phase sites (e.g., Brooks 1994a; Hughes n.d.; Hughes and
Hughes-Jones 1987), these items are usually Smoky Hill jasper or Laverne chert,
another fossiliferous chert locally available in eastern Beaver County, Oklahoma. For
example, a reanalysis of the material from the Lonker (34BV4) site indicates that a
projectile point previously identified as Florence A is actually Smoky Hill jasper.
Other lithic raw materials documented in small quantities from Odessa phase
settlements include Edwards chert from central Texas, Flattop chalcedony from
northeastern Colorado, Tiger chert from southwest Wyoming, and others.

The

recovery of these materials, particularly those from the northwest, is not unexpected
and parallels the occurrence of obsidian from this general area. However, while
certainly documenting long-distance contact with the Northwestern Plains, their
restricted occurrence suggests that intersocietal contact and exchange with societies in
these areas was sporadic and of limited socioeconomic importance.
Marine Shell
The spatial distribution of marine shell at Odessa settlements is similar to that
described previously for obsidian. Marine shell items documented include Olivella
shell beads, disk beads, pendants likely produced from Busycon or Strombus and
Haliotis, and large beads made from shell columella or Conus.

252

Whereas the

distribution of these items at Antelope Creek phase sites was limited primarily to
mortuary contexts, marine shell is most commonly documented from midden and
surface contexts at Odessa phase settlements.
Olivella shell beads are present at most Odessa phase settlements for which
fairly sizeable samples of artifacts are available. These items are found at nine of the
10 (90%) sites (Table 6.7). In general, while these beads are widely distributed among
sites, they are clearly most abundant at larger settlements (i.e., Odessa Yates and
Buried City). Odessa Yates has the highest frequency of these artifacts with several
hundred recovered from that portion of the Clear Creek extended village.

It is

estimated that approximately 100 Olivella shell beads have been recovered from sites
at the Buried City locality (Witt 2004, personal communication). As a whole, these
items are found as general surface debris and in trash filled cache pits and pithouses.
While most Olivella beads are undecorated, a few examples with engraved designs are
known from Odessa Yates and Watson (Figure 6.9).

Figure 6.9 Olivella Shell Beads from Odessa Yates.

253

Although rarely recovered, disk beads are the second most abundant type of
marine shell. As noted earlier, identification of these beads as a southwestern trade
item, and hence, marine in origin, is based largely on their size (i.e., thickness), the
evidence for mass production in the Southwest, and the lack of production debris at
settlements on the Southern Plains. Generally, these items are recovered in low
frequencies at all Odessa phase settlements (22.2%), although their small size makes it
less likely that these beads would be found. On Wolf Creek, where water screening
with fine mesh cloth has been employed, more of these small beads have been
recovered and suggests that they may be more common than is currently thought. As
a whole, the problems mentioned here make it difficult to assess the distribution and
abundance of disk beads at Odessa phase settlements.
Other marine shell artifacts are poorly documented in the study area, but
appear to occur only sporadically at both large and small settlements. These items
occur primarily as pendants and beads. Pendants of either Strombus or Busycon and
Haliotis are documented from Lundeen, Odessa Yates, and some of the settlements
along Wolf Creek (Bevitt 1999:157; Brosowske 2002b; Hughes n.d.:104).

Large

circular beads produced from shell columella are documented at Lundeen and Buried
City. A single Conus bead was recovered from 41OC27 in the Buried City locality
(D. Hughes 2004, personal communication).
Southwestern Decorated Ceramics
Southwestern decorated sherds are noticeably rare at all Odessa phase
settlements. Currently, these items are known only from Odessa Yates, Sprague,
Millikan (34BV105), Skull Springs (34BV55), and Buried City (Brosowske and

254

Bement 1998; D. Hughes 2004, personal communication; Oklahoma Archeological
Survey Site Files 2002; D. Wilkens 2004, personal communication; D. Witt 2004,
personal communication). As observed at Antelope Creek settlements, all of these
nonlocal sherds were recovered from either surface contexts or trash filled features.
Currently, there is very little information available regarding these nonlocal sherds.
At least 10 southwestern sherds are documented from the Odessa Yates site.
These include six decorated sherds and four sherds of corrugated gray utility ware.
Two of the decorated sherds were analyzed for temper and provide information
regarding likely production locales (Spielmann 2000). The first sherd is tempered
with augite-latite and suggests production at San Marcos pueblo in the Santa Fe
district. The second appears to be sherd tempered and may be derived from Quarai
pueblo in the Salinas district.

Currently, no additional information is available

regarding the remaining decorated sherds from this site.
The gray utility wares recovered from Odessa Yates have not been analyzed,
but Regge Wiseman (2000, personal communication) has viewed some of these items
and suggests that these wares were common throughout the Upper Rio Grande and
Pecos areas as late as A.D. 1350. Even though the difference between these and local
cordmarked wares seems rather obvious, it is likely many additional nonlocal utility
vessels are present at settlements of the region, but remain unrecognized.

The

presence of utility wares may indicate that these items were not the specific trade
items themselves, but were simply vessels used for transporting other commodities.
Approximately 12 decorated sherds have been recovered from the Skull
Springs site in Beaver County, Oklahoma (A. Laverty 2004, personal communication).

255

These include two Black-on-red glazeware sherds and 10 redware sherds. The temper,
thickness, and style of all of these sherds suggest that they may be from a single
untyped vessel (i.e., a jar). These sherds contain a hornblende-latite temper and were
likely produced in Galisteo Basin or possibly the Tonque Valley (Warren 1973, 1982).
This vessel appears to represent an intermediate glaze-polychrome ware and was
probably produced between A.D. 1400 and 1500 (Warren 1982).
Southwestern decorated sherds appear to be about as common at Buried City
as the two above sites and number between eight and 10 (D. Hughes 2004, personal
communication; D. Wilkens 2004, personal communication; D. Witt 2004, personal
communication). Unfortunately, specific types, and thus, potential source areas for
these are not known at this time. As such, given the intensity of human occupation
during subsequent periods along Wolf Creek, it is possible that some of these items
could relate to later occupations. Additional decorated sherds are known from two
other Odessa phase settlements. These items include unidentified Black-on-white
sherds from the Millikan and Sprague sites (Oklahoma Archeological Survey Site
Files 2002). As a whole, it is not known whether jar and bowl forms are both
represented in the sample of decorated sherds from Odessa phase sites.
Turquoise
Jewelry produced from turquoise or other similar blue-green gem stones (i.e.,
amazonite, azurite, malachite) derived from the Southwest are about as rare as
decorated ceramics at Odessa phase settlements.

These items have only been

recovered from Odessa Yates, Buried City, Sprague, and the Monty Cates site
(Brosowske 2002b; D. Hughes 2004, personal communication; P. Terrell 2004,

256

personal communication). Turquoise is generally represented by small pendants or
pieces of inlay, although one small bead is also known (Figure 6.10). These items
occur almost exclusively within midden deposits, although one pendant was associated
with a burial at 41OC1 (D. Hughes 2004, personal communication).

Pipes and Pipestone
As a whole, typical Plains elbow style pipes dominate assemblages from these
sites and there is only a single southwestern style pipe documented from Odessa phase
settlements. This example represents a stone tubular pipe recovered from the Watson
site. Red argillites were most commonly utilized to manufacture elbow pipes used by
Odessa phase populations. More than 40 red pipestone pipes or pipe fragments are
documented from both large settlements and homesteads (Brosowske and Bement
1998; Drass and Turner 1989). A sample of Odessa phase pipes (N=9) representing

257

the full range of pipestones was submitted to James Gundersen of Wichita State
University for trace element analysis (Brosowske and Bement 1998) (Figure 6.11).
All of the red argillite pipes (N=3) were identified as Kansas pipestone. A single
white and red banded pipe that was broken and reworked into an ornament was
identified as South Dakota pipestone. This material can be obtained from glacial tills
around Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The nearest settlements containing this variety of
pipestone are those attributed to Little River Focus villages of central Kansas
(Gundersen and Blakeslee 2002). As such, this example appears to represent the
farthest south occurrence of South Dakota pipestone currently documented (D.
Blakeslee 2002, personal communication). The sample submitted for trace element
analysis also includes a variety of other pipestones that were derived from unknown
sources (N=5).

Figure 6.11 Pipe Fragments from Select Odessa Phase Settlements.

Although Kansas pipestone is recovered at most Odessa phase settlements, it
appears to be most common at sites along the eastern margins of the distribution (see
Drass and Turner 1989:Apendix A). The recovery of manufacturing debris and pipes
broken during manufacture at Odessa Yates, Watson, and Price indicate that Kansas

258

pipestone was obtained in cobble form and not as finished items. A high perceived
value for this material is suggested by the fact that Kansas pipestone is frequently
recycled into ornaments and other items after their use as smoking pipes.
Other Nonlocal Items
Other items of nonlocal origin recovered from Odessa phase settlements
include greenstone celts, mica, and a Hohokam style lip plug. Celts documented
represent typical Plains forms and may have been produced from either nonlocal or
local materials.

Greenstone celts seem to have been produced most often from

nonlocal stone. Two of these celts in particular were manufactured out of a very
distinctive type of greenstone native to the Gila River valley area of southwestern New
Mexico. This stone is light green to jade in color and contains numerous gray to white
circular inclusions. Both of these items were recovered from surface contexts at
Odessa Yates and Gate Lake in Beaver County, Oklahoma. The latter was recovered
from a prominent sandy knoll purported to have contained human remains near the
lake margin. As such, this object may have been originally interred as a grave item.
Other greenstone celts have been recovered from the Buried City locality along Wolf
Creek. David Hughes (2004, personal communication) suggests that these items were
produced from a greenstone derived from the Wichita Mountains of southwestern
Oklahoma.
Small fragments of mica have been recovered from several excavated contexts
at the Odessa Yates site. It is thought that this material was ultimately derived from
the Southwest, although specific source areas remain unidentified. Another artifact of
nonlocal origin is a lip plug also recovered from surface contexts at Odessa Yates

259

(Figure 6.12). This item is identical to lip plugs recovered from Hohokam settlements
in southern Arizona and is produced from a translucent purple variety of fluorite
containing light green bands.

Summary
This discussion has served to provide a description of the spatial distribution of
various nonlocal items recovered from Odessa phase settlements. Although these sites
remain only minimally investigated at this time, it is apparent that some trade goods
are very common and are widely distributed among settlements, albeit in significantly
different amounts. As a whole, while the trade goods documented here are dominated
by items related to the subsistence sphere of the economy, a more restricted range and
quantity of items related to the political spheres of exchange are also represented.
By far, the largest quantities of nonlocal items are chipped stone materials
imported from the south (i.e., Alibates silicified dolomite) and north (i.e., Smoky Hills
jasper). Other materials are also documented (i.e., Florence B and Edwards cherts),

260

but occur much less frequently. Alibates and Smoky Hill represent sources of high
quality lithic materials located approximately 145 and 300 km from the Odessa phase
area. Although these materials were used to produce the full range of utilitarian tools
used by these Plains Villagers, the rarity of production debris suggests that most of
these items arrived at settlements as finished implements or late stage flake blanks.
Nonlocal tool stone recovered at Odessa phase settlements document intensive
use and reworking (see Appendix IV). The thoroughly exhausted state of discarded
tools, the high percentage of resharpening debris, the high incidence of recycling, and
the general rarity of chipped stone at Odessa phase sites all suggest that stone were
used as intensively as possible. These patterns are widespread among settlements and
suggest that shortages of tool stone were pervasive among Odessa populations.
The remaining nonlocal trade items document the movement of goods related
to the social/ritual/political sphere of exchange.

These items include decorated

pottery, turquoise and marine shell jewelry, and pipestone. Although obsidian and
quartz crystal are generally considered items associated with the subsistence sphere,
the distribution of these commodities is in many ways more similar to items of the
political realm. The reasons for this apparent pattern are not clear. Similar to the
distribution patterns observed for nonlocal chipped stone, it is apparent that all of
these exotic items are widely dispersed among settlements. With this being said,
however, it is readily evident the highest quantities of nonlocal trade items are
concentrated at the largest settlements. While one would certainly expect to see
higher quantities of exotics at large settlements, simply as a result of their size, the

261

disparity in nonlocal items observed among the communities examined here suggests
that settlement size is not the sole factor responsible for this pattern.
Unfortunately, southwestern ceramic wares are not commonly recovered at
Odessa phase sites. As a result, it is not possible to identify in great detail potential
settlements in the Southwest that may have served as source areas for these and other
exotics. Two sherds recovered from Odessa Yates appear to have been produced at
San Marcos pueblo in the Santa Fe district and Quarai in the Salinas district.
Additional sherds from Skull Springs also document contact with Galisteo Basin or
possibly the Tonque Valley. The vast majority of obsidian (90%) recovered also
suggests contact with populations in these districts or the Española area. Marine shell
jewelry is dominated by beads produced from Olivella sp. Undoubtedly these items
must have been more abundant at some settlements in the Rio Grande and Pecos river
valleys than others.

Currently, however, it is not possible to identify specific

settlements that have marine shell in sufficient quantities to suggest that they may
have served as distribution centers. Other items, such as greenstone celts, mica, and a
single Hohokam style lip plug, document the movement of exotic raw materials or
finished goods from other portions of the Southwest.
Northwestern Plains obsidian and Kansas pipestone document contact and
exchange with other Plains societies to the north. Although not known, it is likely that
these items were obtained from the same society or societies that provided Odessa
phase groups with Smoky Hill jasper.

Previous archaeological work in western

Kansas (Stein 1997) suggests that Smoky Hill jasper was intensively quarried and
traded by Upper Republican variant groups. However, this variant ended around A.D.

262

1350 and yet Smoky Hill jasper continues to remain abundant at Odessa phase
settlements after this date.

Discussion
This chapter has examined nonlocal trade items recovered at Middle Ceramic
age Antelope Creek and Odessa phase settlements. These discussions serve to identify
the distribution, quantity, and context of these items. Previously Middle Ceramic
period exchange on the Southern High Plains has been characterized as a system with
little socioeconomic importance (e.g., Spielmann 1982, 1983). However, from the
data presented here it is readily apparent that nonlocal items of Plains origin were
obtained in sizeable quantities. Exotics from the Southwest, although not as common,
still number in the thousands and document regular and sustained contact with
communities in this region. From the data examined here, it is clear that several fairly
dramatic differences in quantities and types of exotics may be noted between the
Antelope Creek and the Odessa phases and amongst individual settlements of each
phase.
Excluding those Antelope Creek phase communities near the Alibates quarries,
it is apparent that utilitarian tools produced from high quality tool stones were
regularly traded over long-distances by groups in the study area. That Antelope Creek
phase people in the Oklahoma portion of the distribution maintained exchange
relationships with Antelope Creek phase communities in the Canadian River valley is
aptly demonstrated by the quantity of Alibates recovered in the former setting. In
contrast, lithic assemblages at Odessa phase settlements suggest that high quality tool

263

stone was in short supply. Although Alibates represents the highest percentage of
lithic raw materials recovered at Odessa phase sites, another high quality material (i.e.,
Smoky Hill jasper) was also imported. This material occurs in small amounts at
Antelope Creek settlements in the Oklahoma panhandle and only rarely at Antelope
Creek sites along the Canadian River.
The spatial distribution of exotics derived from the Southwest display different
patterns among Antelope Creek and Odessa phase settlements. Although these items
clearly occur in higher quantities at the largest settlements of both phases, several
divergent trends are noted. First, southwestern exotics are not only associated with the
largest settlements of the Odessa phase, but are also relatively frequent at small
homesteads. Among the Antelope Creek phase, except for obsidian, southwestern
trade items as a whole are only rarely noted at smaller settlements. A second pattern
noted is that marine shell and turquoise jewelry among Antelope Creek sites are
concentrated in mortuary contexts. In contrast, while turquoise is rarely recovered,
marine shell was abundant in general surface and trash contexts at settlements of the
Odessa phase. It is not possible to identify the frequency and variety of trade items
present in Odessa phase mortuary contexts since very few burials have been
excavated. Lastly, it is also apparent that the relative frequencies of various types of
exotics vary greatly between each of these two phases. Although obsidian is well
documented at sites of both phases, Southwest ceramics and disk beads are much more
common at Antelope Creek settlements, but are rarely recovered at Odessa phase sites.
In contrast, Olivella shell beads seem to be much more common at Odessa phase
settlements.

264

Evidence for contact and exchange with groups in the Central Plains also
varies considerably between the two phases. Kansas pipestone, in addition to Smoky
Hill jasper, is abundant at Odessa phase settlements, but is much less common or rare
among sites of the Antelope Creek phase. The complete absence of obsidian from
Northwestern Plains source areas at Antelope Creek settlements further supports the
conclusion that these groups had little or no contact with societies to the north.
In sum, this chapter has presented the spatial distribution of nonlocal trade
items among settlements of the Antelope Creek and Odessa phases.

The data

presented here demonstrate that several significant differences exist between each of
these societies. Overall, the distinctions noted here suggest that the organization and
function of exchange within these societies was quite different.

By themselves,

however, these data are not self explanatory and simply document the distribution of
these items. In the ensuing chapter the concept of an emerging political economy is
used to interpret and explain the trends identified here. Organized under an economic
perspective, the contextual setting of this development is emphasized and provides the
key information necessary for reconstructing the institutional framework of Southern
High Plains exchange during the Middle Ceramic period.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Trends toward Social Complexity:
Competition, Resource Control, Economic Intensification, and Redistribution

The preceding chapters have demonstrated the existence of considerable
cultural variability among Middle Ceramic age settlements of the region.

This

variability is manifest by differences in settlement size and location, architecture,
material culture, and the subsistence economy. These differences are evident both
between cultural complexes and among sites that historically have been considered to
be closely related (see Brosowske 2002a; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.; Lintz 1986a). In
particular, this study is interested in understanding why the communities of Chimney
Rock Ruin 51, the Alibates Ruins, and Odessa Yates have vastly higher quantities of
exotic items than other sites of the region. An examination of environmental settings,
the timing or length of occupations, and changes in regional climate suggests that none
of these factors provide suitable explanations for the dramatic disparities observed.
Likewise, although these communities do represent some of the largest settlements in
the region, the fact that other similarly sized communities do not have analogous
frequencies of nonlocal trade goods suggests that settlement size was not the primary
factor responsible for these patterns.
Besides having abundant exotics, it is apparent that these three settlements also
differed in other significant ways, namely in the organization of their economies.
Since ecological and temporal explanations are also insufficient for explaining the
cultural variability documented among settlements, several topics traditionally

266

examined by political economists are explored here.

These are competition and

resource control, economic specialization, and redistribution. As these topics suggest,
the major emphasis of these discussions is the economy and how it was organized.
While certainly a challenge to discuss within the confines of a single chapter, it should
be apparent that these topics are interrelated. Equally significant, however, is the fact
that increasing competition, resource control, economic specialization, and
redistribution are all important developments that also clearly denote trends toward
increasing social complexity within these small-scale societies.
Because virtually all details regarding the settlement of Chimney Rock Ruin 51
remain unknown, these discussions center primarily around the Alibates Ruins and
Odessa Yates as case studies for investigating these issues.

Within comparative

frameworks, additional sites are used to further clarify particular points or trends. The
topics examined here provide the foundation necessary for understanding how these
economic strategies combined with other aspects of ecological and social systems to
provide evidence for the emergence of political economies; that is the focus of Chapter
Eight.

Competition and the Control of Valued Resources
At a basic level, the Southern High Plains is a region characterized by
considerable environmental diversity (see Chapter Three). This variability stems from
two primary sources. First, contrasting ecological and geological characteristics of the
High and Eroded Plains result in fundamental differences in the types and frequencies
of resources available from one area to the next. Second, an erratic climate brings

267

about dramatic discrepancies in local rainfall patterns, often over short distances.
These patterns also have a major influence on the distribution, abundance, and
predictability of resources. As societies of the region became more sedentary and
more densely populated with the transition from the Early to Middle Ceramic periods,
by necessity, systems of resource use and rights of access also changed.

These

developments were closely tied to changes in subsistence economies that occurred
around A.D. 1250 (i.e., more intensive foraging supplemented by horticulture among
Antelope Creek groups and intensive horticulture by Odessa phase populations).
Taken together, these developments dramatically altered traditional relationships
between people and resources.

Within the context of these social changes,

competition over important resources must have undoubtedly increased substantially.
Here, evidence for increasing competition over resources and its archaeological
signature is examined.
From an evolutionary perspective, the appearance of the first permanent
communities (i.e., sedentary to semi-sedentary populations) on the Southern High
Plains around A.D. 1250 had numerous far reaching consequences for patterns of land
and resource use. These consequences were probably even more substantial if the
establishment of these communities was as rapid as it seems to have been (i.e., less
than 50 years). Previously, the Southern High Plains was occupied during the Early
Ceramic period by societies likely organized at the family level of political integration
(Johnson and Earle 2000). These family groups appear to moved in an annual round
to procure economically important resources. Sites or camps at this time were small
and are indicative of short-term, probably seasonal, occupations. Nevertheless, access

268

to various resources or preferred locations were probably constrained by human
occupation during certain times of the year.

As such, even though considerable

residential mobility characterized cultural systems and regional populations were still
relatively low at this time, it is likely that use rights to these resources or locations
were maintained by a number of options.
As discussed in Chapter Two, strategies used by family level groups to
maintain access to crucial resources included the establishment of intergroup alliances,
reciprocal rights of access, and residential mobility patterns that included periods of
group dispersal and aggregation (Johnson and Earle 2000). As a whole, current
evidence seems to indicate that little substantial cultural differentiation characterized
Early Ceramic foragers of the region (see Boyd 1997; Carmichael 2004; Cruse 1992
for a description of Lake Creek and Palo Duro complex groups). The existence of
considerable social unity at a regional level may be interpreted to mean that the
options listed above were indeed important strategies for local foraging societies.
That the above strategies were not always entirely successful for coping with
problems related to land use and competition over important resources during the
Early Ceramic period, however, is aptly demonstrated by the violent death
documented in Dykema Canyon in Roberts County, Texas (Wilkens 2001, 2004).
Here, the chest cavity of an adult male between the ages of 33 and 39 years of age
contained eight arrowpoints, several of which were embedded in vertebra.

This

individual, dating to about A.D. 650, also exhibited additional perimortem injuries
sustained by a blow to the chest with a blunt weapon, possibly a stone axe. Overall,
“Dykema Man” does not represent an isolated example of Early Ceramic warfare as

269

evidence for violence and conflict are fairly common for the Southern Plains during
this period (see Boyd 1997; Brooks 1994b; Wilkens and Boyd 2000). These examples
suggest that intersocietal competition, ultimately resulting from incongruent resource
distributions, was prevalent even during periods when the region was sparsely
inhabited by foraging societies.
Placed in this light, given the reduction in settlement mobility, the
establishment of permanent settlements, and the rapid increases in the size and density
of population observed during the Middle Ceramic period, suggests that social
strategies employed by Early Ceramic period foragers to maintain access and limit
competition over crucial resources would not have been sufficient after A.D. 1250.
While the developments noted for the onset of the Middle Ceramic period certainly set
the stage for increased conflict over important resources, they were also accompanied
by significant shifts in perceptions regarding the economic importance of various
natural resources. These trends are particularly evident in changes that occurred in
regional settlement systems and patterns of tool stone use.
Pedestrian survey in the study area documents a significant shift in settlement
patterns from the Early to Middle Ceramic periods. Previously, Early Ceramic sites
were fairly well distributed across the landscape, but are most notably concentrated
along ecotonal zones near the High Plains-Eroded Plains margin (Bement and
Brosowske 2001; Brosowske 2002b; Thurmond 1991; Wilkens 2004, personal
communication; see Epp 1984, 1986, 1988 for similar patterns of land use by foragers
on the Northern Plains). Occupation of these settings is interpreted from an optimal
foraging perspective to mean that family groups positioned themselves in locations

270

where a variety of resources from each environmental zone could be effectively and
efficiently exploited (Thurmond 1991).
Later in time, Odessa phase settlements exhibit a dramatic shift away from the
High-Eroded Plains margins to stream valleys containing abundant fertile soils
amenable to horticulture (Brosowske 2002b). As a result, stream valleys or portions
of stream valleys that were previously unoccupied during the Early Ceramic period
were preferentially selected for horticultural settlements following A.D. 1250. Since
Odessa phase groups were much more dependent upon horticulture than their
Antelope Creek neighbors, this shift is much more evident among these settlements.
Elsewhere on the Southern Plains similar shifts in settlement are also noted for the
Early to Middle Ceramic transition (see Drass 1997; Moore 1984, 1988; Thurmond
1991:138-140).
Another equally dramatic shift in resource use that indicates a change in the
perceived value of resources during Middle Ceramic times is provided by tool stone
use. As noted earlier in Chapters Four and Six, chert and quartzite gravels obtained
from local outcrops of the Ogallala formation were extensively used by Archaic and
Early Ceramic groups for the production of chipped stone tools. The onset of the
Middle Ceramic period coincides with the appearance of several specialized tool
forms, such as distal endscrapers, triangular arrowpoints, and diamond-shaped,
alternately beveled knives.

These tools were produced almost exclusively from

Alibates silicified dolomite and Smoky Hill jasper during Middle Ceramic times.
Traditionally, the use of high quality tool stone is thought to be related to the
technological advantages provided by these materials (see Andrefsky 1994),

271

Combined, decreasing residential mobility, the occupation of permanent
settlements, dependence on cultivated foods and high quality tool stones, and
escalating populations all likely resulted in increased competition over crucial
resources during the Middle Ceramic period. Although competition over many types
of resources likely occurred (e.g., bison, clay sources, potable water, trade routes,
wood), the ensuing discussions focus on two in particular: bedrock sources of Alibates
silicified dolomite and improved arable lands. An examination of changing settlement
patterns through time as well as the distribution of Middle Ceramic period settlements
across the landscape provide the primary evidence for the emergence of communities
which claimed exclusive rights to access and use of valued resources. Before these
case studies are presented, however, the concepts of property and resource control are
briefly considered.
Property and Resource Control
Vehik (1986, 1990), Earle (2000), and others (see chapters in Hunt and Gilman
1998) have examined property and resource control among prehistoric societies. In
foraging societies these same topics are often studied under evolutionary or ecological
frameworks as territoriality studies (e.g., Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978;
Winterhalder and Smith 1981). Together, these and other related studies provide a
theoretical framework for interpreting the interrelationship between resources, landuse, and settlement in the present study.

In the ensuing discussion fundamental

concepts regarding these issues are examined using the concept of property (see Earle
2000; Hunt and Gilman 1998). Of particular importance are landed property and
resource characteristics that encourage or facilitate the development of social systems

272

that incorporate exclusive rights of access and use of resources (i.e., property). A
short review of archaeological techniques used to study property and resource control
is also provided. These discussions enable the significance and use of the Alibates
quarries and improved arable land to be assessed.
Property determines exclusive rights to things and refers to something that is
possessed (Earle 2000:40). It also embodies a sense of ownership; that an owner or
owners have the authority over the use of things. Importantly, whether envisioned as
property or territory each of these concepts involves exclusive use of something by
“means of repulsion through overt defense or advertisement” (Wilson 1975:256;
quoted in Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978:23). Arable land and the Alibates quarries
represent examples of landed property.

The definition of landed property is

straightforward and refers to resources that are set in space.

These differ from

moveable property, such as chipped stone tools, cultivated food products, bison robes,
and so on, which are all items that are extracted, manufactured or produced, and can
be transferred from one person to another through exchange.
Dyson-Hudson and Smith (1978) and Vehik (1990) outline resource conditions
that are involved in the decision to control or limit access and use of landed resources.
These factors include whether or not a particular resource is: a) critical to survival, b)
of high cultural value, c) geographically or seasonally restricted, and d) whose density
and predictability are high. These researchers conclude that if a resource meets these
conditions there is a high probability “that the costs of exclusive use and defense of an
area are outweighed by the benefits gained from resource control” (Dyson-Hudson and
Smith 1978:21). Although neither is seasonal, the Alibates quarries and improved

273

arable land are clearly resources that meet each of the other requirements. Both of
these resources are characterized by spatial distributions that are geographically
restricted and whose distributions are highly concentrated and predictable. Assessing
the criticalness or cultural value of these resources is more ambiguous, however, since
these are largely social constructs. Nonetheless, the widespread use of Alibates for the
production of utilitarian tools and the inclusion of caches of Alibates tools in mortuary
contexts indicates considerable import of this resource to both the subsistence and
political realms. Likewise, preferential settlement adjacent to fertile soils indicates the
importance of arable land as a means for providing a reliable source of staple foods in
a semiarid environment (see Netting 1993).
Techniques used to study property and identify the presence of exclusive rights
to resources in archaeological contexts include settlement patterns, labor investment,
visible markers of ownership, and warfare (Earle 2000:39; see Gilman 1998). By
necessity, the appearance of permanent communities and the transition to intensive
foraging and horticulture results in fundamental changes in existing land tenure and
ownership systems (see Kim 2003). Because permanent communities are marked by
numerous labor investments, such as habitation structures, agricultural fields, drying
racks, and storage facilities containing food resources, exclusive rights of access and
use must be established and maintained (Netting 1993:47). While exclusive property
rights to land and its resources are obviously crucial for sedentary horticultural
societies, examples from the Northwest Coast demonstrate that seasonally abundant
and predictable food resources can be subject to the same rules among huntersgatherers.

274

Given the incongruent resource distributions noted above for the region and the
social changes that arose at the onset of the Middle Ceramic period, it is reasonable to
presume that property rules maintained by force emerged at this time. Two case
studies, bedrock outcrops of Alibates chert and arable land, are examined here in
greater detail and lend support for this conclusion. In these examples, property rights
ensured access to resources that not only were limited in their distribution, but also
represented crucial resources that were superior to others in the region. In addition,
labor investments made to the social landscape further reinforced these systems and
served as visible claims of ownership. Overall, the case studies presented here provide
convincing data for the strategic placement of communities as a means of controlling
access to scarce and valued resources. Besides the general labor investments noted
above, other evidence for asserting or communicating these rights is less apparent.
For example, other visible markers of ownership, such as constructed mounds or
burial cairns, although present in the study area are poorly understood at this time, and
in some cases, are no longer preserved (see Lintz 1986b).
The Alibates Quarries
Geologically restricted to a small area along the Canadian River in the Texas
panhandle, bedrock sources of Alibates silicified dolomite represent the primary
source of high quality tool stone available to inhabitants of the Southern High Plains.
As noted in Chapter Five, Alibates was also available from secondary sources along
the Canadian River, but gravels obtained from these areas are relatively small in size,
are of variable quality, and their spatial distribution is unpredictable (Hofman 1991;
Katz and Katz 2004; Wyckoff 1993). As such, bedrock sources of Alibates represent

275

a landed resource whose distribution was highly predictable and concentrated. Also
important is the fact that Alibates obtained from quarry pits was higher in quality and
was available in larger sizes than that from secondary deposits (Katz and Katz 2004).
As noted earlier, all of these resource characteristics were important factors that
determined whether or not access and use of a given resource was limited or
controlled (see Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978; Earle 2000; Vehik 1990).
Today, the primary bedrock sources of Alibates are preserved within the
Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument. The main quarry areas are limited to a
long narrow outcrop approximately 2.0 km in length (Katz and Katz 2004; Shaeffer
1958:189-190). More than 730 quarry pits and production debris a meter or more in
thickness aptly demonstrate extensive use of this outcrop during the Middle Ceramic
period (Katz and Katz 2004). Other bedrock sources are also known to the north and
east of the monument (Bowers 1975; P. Katz, personal communication 2004), but as
noted earlier, these locations generally contain materials that are poorer quality and
show less evidence of quarrying activity (Shaeffer 1958:190). That bedrock sources in
these areas were of little importance during the Middle Ceramic period is also
supported by the absence of numerous or sizeable settlements of the Antelope Creek
phase (Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas 2003).
Prior to the Middle Ceramic period access to bedrock sources of Alibates was
unrestricted and procurement occurred as part of an embedded strategy by local
foraging groups (Brosowske 2002c; Katz and Katz 2004). The idea that access to
bedrock sources of Alibates was open or that settlement near the quarries was
prohibited prior to A.D. 1250 is supported by the absence of habitation sites

276

attributable to the Archaic and Early Ceramic periods on or near the Alibates Flint
Quarries National Monument (Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas 2003). A review of
site records for areas within 3 km of the quarries indicates large numbers of sites
which lack diagnostic artifacts and whose age cannot be determined (Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas 2003). These sites represent procurement and early stage
reduction locales where ledges and cobbles of Alibates were exposed through erosion
(Katz and Katz 2004; Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas 2003). Although the precise
age of these sites are not known, it is likely that they represent procurement activities
by foraging groups from Paleoindian to Early Ceramic times.
The absence of camps containing substantial quantities of trash debris and
tools reflecting a broad range of activities support an interpretation of short-term, task
specific use by mobile foraging societies prior to the Middle Ceramic period. The fact
that camps were not established prior to A.D. 1250 near the monument also suggests
that other important resources may not have been sufficiently abundant enough near
the quarries to support seasonal settlement by resident foragers. Indeed, except for the
Canadian River which probably contained water of poor quality, an inspection of a 1
km area immediately surrounding the quarries indicates a noticeable lack of potable
water and riparian settings containing important food resources.
In contrast to earlier patterns of land and resource use, beginning around A.D.
1250, numerous areas surrounding the primary outcrops of Alibates became inhabited
by permanent settlements attributed to the Antelope Creek phase (Figure 7.1). The
absence of earlier habitation sites, suggests that Middle Ceramic age settlements near
the Alibates National Monument were established to facilitate access to tool stone.

277

Access to water and other important resources seem to have been of secondary
importance. For instance, in reference to the Alibates Ruins, Lintz (1986a:323) notes
that the nearest drainage is distantly located (i.e., approximately 1 km) from this, the
largest settlement in the area. He (Lintz 1986a:323) further indicates that prior to
modern irrigation practices seep springs may have been available in some locations
near the settlement, but “that specialized collection devices were necessary to obtain
and store water”.
A total of seven permanent habitation settlements of the Antelope Creek phase
are present within about 3 km of the Alibates quarries (Figure 7.1). Except for
41PT77, which I suspect is actually part of 41PT75, most of these settlements fall
within the medium to large community range for the phase. Based on counts of
habitation structures present at sites (see Table 7.1), a maximum of 40 to 50
households may have occupied a 3 km radius around the quarries (see Lintz 1986a;
Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas 2003). Combined, these settlements would have
represented the largest aggregation of Antelope Creek phase groups at this time.
These sites essentially surround the Alibates quarries and offer unrestricted views in
all directions.

While additional settlements certainly would have increased the

effectiveness of restricting access to the quarries, the populations present would have
been more than sufficient to monitor, limit, and defend access to surface outcrops and
quarry pits excavated to obtain this valuable tool stone. Given the paucity of water
and other important resources near the quarries, it is possible that the carrying capacity
of the area may have been strained by the number of families present. Lastly, while
the frequent placement of Antelope Creek settlements in defensive settings certainly

278

suggests the existence of competition among resident groups, sites in these locations
also probably served to represent a visible claim to the Alibates quarries.

Coinciding with the establishment of settlements concentrated around the
quarries after A.D. 1250 we also witness an enormous increase in Alibates use as
evidenced by its spatial distribution throughout the Southern Plains and adjacent
regions (Chapters Four and Six). Earlier it was noted that the quantity of Alibates in
chipped stone assemblages of earlier periods is generally less than 10% or 20% and
are often represented by highly formalized and curated tool forms, such as projectile
points. Following A.D. 1250 use of this tool stone increased dramatically and over
95% of all chipped stone at settlements in the Texas panhandle and 50% to 90% at
sites over 100 km to the north and northeast are of this material.
Previously, numerous researchers have suggested that Antelope Creek
settlements near the quarries effectively controlled access to Alibates silicified
dolomite and were extensively involved in the mining, production, and distribution of
this important resource (see Bandy 1976; Baugh 1994:280; Boyd 1997:343;
Brosowske 2002b; Drass 1998:421; Green 1986:54; J. Hughes 1991:31: Lintz
1991:98).

Similar strategies involving economic control of high quality lithic

resources are also observed for other portions of the Plains and adjacent areas during
the Late Prehistoric period (Ray 2004; Vehik 1986, 1990). These examples also

280

involve organized quarrying and surplus production of specialized forms of chipped
stone tools for exchange.

In general, however, the full extent, importance, and

consequences of resource control, economic specialization, and export has yet to be
systematically examined among Plains societies (Brosowske 2002b; Ray 2004; Vehik
1986, 1990).

Although evidence for exclusive use of the Alibates quarries by

Antelope Creek phase has been briefly examined here, production related topics,
which are clearly tied to these developments are discussed in greater detail later in this
chapter.
Horticulture and the Control of Arable Lands
Generalized patterns of settlement for Middle Ceramic groups of the Southern
High Plains were presented in Chapter Four. In particular, these discussions noted that
Odessa phase settlements were closely tied to highly fertile floodplain soils and
sources of potable water. The existence of these patterns is not particularly surprising
since both water and arable land are obviously crucial resources for horticultural
societies.

A closer examination of environmental characteristics of the region,

however, suggests that when it came to establishing permanent settlements, Odessa
phase populations were highly selective when discriminating among the various types
of soils that were available. Once again, these patterns are not unexpected since these
groups occupy a portion of the plains that receives about 510 to 590 mm (20 to 23 in.)
of precipitation and has high evapotranspiration rates (Bomar 1995; Johnson and
Duchon 1995). Because these conditions are generally considered marginal for corn
horticulture (see Wedel 1986), it is likely that cultivation of highly fertile soils were
necessary to provide reliable and consistent horticultural yields.

281

Given the climatic constraints of the area, the ideal soils for dryland
horticulturalists using bison bone digging sticks and hoes are those that are sufficiently
friable to be worked with these tools and yet have high moisture holding capabilities.
As a whole, bottomland soils of the region are typically very sandy, excessively welldrained, and are not amenable to horticulture (e.g., Lincoln series soils). In addition,
although some of these soils may be subirrigated, meaning they contain water within
600 mm (24 in.) of the ground surface, they are also not suitable for horticulture
because the root systems of deeper rooted plants would have been susceptible to
rotting (e.g., corn for example). The discussions presented in Chapter Four noted a
strong correlation between Odessa phase settlements and the most fertile soils in the
region (Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.).

In nearly every case

settlements were immediately adjacent to productive silt loam or clay loam soils (e.g.,
Spur or Canadian series).

These soils represent rare resources and as a whole

comprise less than 1% to 2% of all soils in the region (see Allgood 1962; Wheeler
1973; Williams 1975).
Figure 7.2 is a map of Beaver County, Oklahoma. The land area of this county
is approximately 464,746 ha. (1,147,520 acres). This map shows the distribution of
Odessa phase settlements that are currently known in this county and their spatial
proximity to the fertile soils discussed above. This map is not well detailed and
simply shows those sections of land (i.e., 259.1 ha. or 640 ac.) for which Spur and
Canadian series soils are present. Generally, a single isolated section, shown in gray,
contains less than 2 ha of fertile soils. Those areas along streams which contain many
adjoining squares with these soils, however, represent areas with abundant arable land.

282

This map also shows those streams or portions of streams, shown in dark gray, that
contain impurities which render the water unfit for human consumption. Although the
entire county has not been completely investigated by systematic survey, those areas
examined to date indicate that portions of streams where the water is potable and
fertile soils are present almost always have Odessa phase horticultural settlements.
Similar patterns are also noted for adjacent counties containing Odessa phase
settlements (e.g., Meade County, Kansas; Ochiltree and Lipscomb counties, Texas;
and Ellis County, Oklahoma).
Given the environmental constraints that today, and by extension, the past,
adversely affect dryland horticulture on the Southern High Plains it is not unexpected
that Odessa phase communities selected those soils that were most amenable to
farming.

Currently, irrigation is not documented for the region, suggesting that

dryland horticulture was sufficient for producing crops. Since settings containing the
critical combination of fertile soils and potable water are rare, these locations were
undoubtedly regarded as highly valued resources and almost surely served as sources
of intervillage competition and conflict. In addition to the land itself, improvements to
the land, such as cleared horticultural fields, permanent habitation structures, and
storage facilities, were labor investments that further strengthened claims to these
locations.

While certainly permitting permanent occupation, stored foods also

represented a concentrated resource that likely served to further exacerbate intervillage
raiding.

283

Figure 7.2 Relationship between Soils, Potable Water, and Odessa Phase Settlements.

The distribution of Odessa phase settlements (Figure 7.2) indicates that dense
concentrations of settlements are associated with the largest patches of fertile soils. In
Beaver County, Oklahoma, these large communities are found on Clear and Kiowa
creeks. To the south and southeast in Ochiltree and Lipscomb counties, Texas, and
Ellis County, Oklahoma, other large settlements are present in comparable settings
along Wolf Creek and its tributaries (Brosowske 2002b; Bussard 2003, personal
communication; D. Hughes 1991). Although absolute dates are somewhat limited,
those currently available suggest long-term occupation of these large villages (i.e., 150
to 200 years; see Chapter Four).
A closer examination of the extended village along Clear Creek provides a
more detailed picture of the relationship between settlement and soils (Figure 7.3).
This figure depicts large patches of fertile soils concentrated in this valley and the
strong association of Odessa phase settlements. Although the settlement map for
Clear Creek is limited to only that portion of the valley that contains dense
concentrations of Odessa phase sites, if the map was expanded to show areas
immediately upstream and downstream of the settlement one would observe a pattern
of interest: fertile soils and settlements are essentially absent both upstream and
downstream from the Clear Creek locality.

In other words, the length of this

settlement nearly coincides exactly with the distribution of Spur and Canadian series
soils. Similar patterns are observed for other Odessa phase sites including Buried
City, a large Odessa phase village along Wolf Creek.

285

Figure 7.3 An Odessa Phase Village along Clear Creek, Beaver County, Oklahoma.

As noted in Chapter Four, large Odessa phase communities occur in the form
of extended villages several km in length. While these settlements could have just as
easily been organized into tightly aggregated villages, they are not and households or
clusters of family groups are dispersed up and down the valley and mirror the
distribution of arable land. Although difficult to fully demonstrate at this time without
additional excavation and radiocarbon dates, I suspect that these are not fortuitous
patterns of settlement, but rather represent planned strategies to effectively control and
limit access to fertile soils through occupation. Unfortunately, the data needed to fully
understand the evolution of these villages through time is currently not available.
Similar to earlier discussions of Antelope Creek settlements near the Alibates
quarries, Odessa phase communities are distributed across the landscape in highly
patterned ways that effectively enabled the control of highly valued resources that are
limited in distribution and abundance. Likewise, given the size of these Odessa phase
communities, it is likely that the population density represented at these settlements

286

was in most cases sufficient to defend arable land and stored resources against
intersocietal raiding. As noted earlier, Antelope Creek settlements in the Canadian
River valley are frequently situated in highly elevated settings and suggest heightened
conflict among resident groups over Alibates and other resources. In fact, based on
archaeological and bioarchaeological evidence, Brooks (1994b:320) concludes that
Antelope Creek populations participated in moderate to large-scale conflict.

In

contrast, Odessa phase settlements are not placed in defensive locations. Nonetheless,
evidence for violent deaths is clearly demonstrated by two Odessa phase burials
(Chapter Four).
Summary
In all likelihood, the widespread emergence of land tenure systems on the
Southern Plains coincided with the appearance of the first permanent settlements of
the Middle Ceramic period. Initially, exclusive claims to land probably arose from
increased competition over resources as societies became more sedentary and the
region became more densely populated. Under these conditions, the control of land
and its resources is generally seen as a viable strategy to ensure that the basic
subsistence needs of a group are met. Thus, while broadly applicable to all societies
of the region in one way or another, evidence for competition and resource control
were examined using the Alibates quarries and the proximity of Odessa phase
settlements to arable land as examples. Although both of these resources represent
examples of landed property, they were selected because they represent fundamentally
different types of resources claimed by societies organized in significantly different
ways.

Despite these differences, the strategies used to establish and maintain

287

exclusive rights of access to these resources were very much the same and involved
the strategic placement of settlements.

These two cases were also helpful for

highlighting changes in the perceived value of key resources, such as tool stone and
arable land, as the region underwent considerable social, economic, and political
change.
From a historical perspective, the development of land tenure systems during
the Middle Ceramic period was probably necessary to maintain social stability in a
stochastic environment (i.e., ensured the procurement or production of staple foods
necessary for survival). However, besides being two cases that were perhaps the most
obvious and easiest to identify, they also highlight another important development.
While claims to resources seem to be linked to economic systems characterized by
production for personal consumption, notable differences in the organization and
productivity of economies are evident at some settlements.

In particular, the

economies of both the Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates exhibit unmistakable signs of
intensified production.

Trends toward Intensification: Economic Specialization
Although somewhat circular in reasoning, the presence of unusually high
quantities of trade items at the Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates suggest that these
communities were capable of producing a surplus of products for use in intersocietal
exchange. Previous studies of exchange in the region have hypothesized that food
products were the focus of regional exchange systems and that social transactions
served as a risk reduction strategy against periodic shortages (e.g., Spielmann 1982,

288

1983; see Vehik 2002 for an alternative view). These studies emphasize exchange
relationships between Plains and Southwest societies that were separated by 100 to
500 km (e.g., Baugh 1982; Lintz 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983, 1991). However, the
fact that clear evidence for trade in staple foods has yet to be demonstrated in these
instances and that exchange in bulk goods, such as food, over long distances is
unlikely without efficient transport systems, seriously weakens these arguments (see
D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1994).
If the concentration of nonlocal exotic trade items at some settlements, such as
Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates, implies a surplus production of some class of items
for exchange, then how were these economies organized and what items were being
produced for export? Earlier chapters have suggested that considerable economic
variability seems to have characterized settlements of the region (see Chapter Four;
Drass and Flynn 1990; Speth 2004). Previously it has been argued that variation in
Middle Ceramic economies of the region were largely related to differences in
settlement size (Brosowske 2002b; Brosowske and Bevitt n.d.)

The evidence

presented in this research, however, suggests that it is not necessarily this
straightforward.

Considering the numerous potential sources of environmental,

demographic, and cultural variability in the region, it should not be unexpected that
economies also varied significantly. Along the same lines of reasoning, it should not
be unexpected that potential strategies employed to produce a surplus of commodities
for exchange may have also been equally variable.
In the following discussions evidence for the specialized production of highly
valued commodities at Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates are explored. In particular, it

289

is proposed that chipped stone tools, along with bison hides and dried meat were
produced at these communities for export. Before these case studies are presented,
however, it is necessary to define the key concepts of economic production and
specialization. Special emphasis is placed here on production strategies and behaviors
frequently associated with craft specialization (see Arnold 1984, 1987; Brumfiel and
Earle 1987; Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 1991; Muller 1984; 1987; Rice 1981;
Torrence 1986).
Production and specialization
Production and specialization, although obviously related, are not the same
thing. Production is a general concept and simply refers to manufacture of finished
objects from raw materials. In contrast, specialization refers to the manner in which
production is organized. While many definitions of specialized production have been
presented, one of the more useful is: “a differentiated, regularized, permanent, and
perhaps institutionalized production system in which producers depend on extrahousehold exchange relationships at least in part for their livelihood, and consumers
depend on them for acquisition of goods they do not produce themselves” (Costin
1991:4). Brumfiel and Earle (1987:5) suggest that specialization may be envisioned as
a continuum along which any economy can be measured. At one end of the scale is
the Domestic Mode of Production (DMP) (Sahlins 1972). While all households are
characterized by sharing and exchange among related kin, families practicing a DMP
are essentially self-sufficient and produce most of the goods they use and consume.
At the other end of the spectrum is the modern market economy. The latter is a highly

290

specialized system where nearly all of the goods used and consumed by households
are produced by others.
A key component of specialization is “differentiated” since the presence of
variability in production serves as the primary means for identifying the existence of
specialized production in the archaeological record. It follows that specialization is a
relative state that can only be discerned through comparative analysis (Costin 1991:2).
Thus, to suggest that a production system was specialized, but not to demonstrate how
production varied along some scale of analysis is of little use. In addition, since a
division of labor is known to exist along age and sex lines in all societies, differences
in production along these lines does not in and of itself constitute specialization.
Another important part of the definition is the idea that specialists do not produce all
of the goods they consume. In other words, specialists obtain goods in return for items
which they produce. This process is quite variable and includes reciprocal exchange,
the use of currency, and all points in between.
The presence of specialized production, as demonstrated by differences in
production activities, can be recognized by direct and indirect forms of evidence (see
Costin 1991:18-43). Direct evidence includes facilities associated with production as
well as variability in the distribution of raw and waste materials, tools, and finished
items among some unit of analysis. The latter can be households, settlements, social
classes, or time periods. Specialized production can also be inferred even when the
exact location of manufacture cannot be identified. Referred to as indirect evidence,
the presence of large numbers of items which are highly standardized or require a
great deal of skill to manufacture can also indicate the presence of specialized

291

production. Variation in the spatial distribution of objects with these characteristics is
often used to infer, albeit indirectly, the presence of specialized systems.
Now that we have some idea as to what specialization entails, how does one go
about describing specialized production? Because all economic systems consist of
three primary components, production, distribution, and consumption, any attempt to
describe specialized production must address each of these topics.

Since earlier

chapters have discussed distribution and consumption of items in some detail (see
Chapter Six), the following emphasizes the production component. In the examples
examined here, variability in economic production is examined at the level of the
settlement.

Specifically, evidence for specialized production of two classes of

commodities is examined: chipped stone tools and bison products. It is proposed that
specialized production of chipped stone tools was conducted by the occupants of the
Alibates Ruins, while the inhabitants of Odessa Yates were heavily involved in the
production of bison products. In both of these examples, it is suggested that a surplus
was produced for trade. The existence of specialization is derived from comparative
analyses of contemporaneous settlements and identifies differential quantities of
production related debris (e.g., manufacturing implements, finished products, waste
debris).
Specialized Chipped Stone Tool Production
As noted earlier in this chapter, numerous researchers have suggested that
Antelope Creek groups were extensively involved in the mining, production, and
distribution of Alibates silicified dolomite (see Bandy 1976; Baugh 1994:280; Boyd
1997:343; Brosowske 2002c; Drass 1998:421; Green 1986; J. Hughes 1991:31: Lintz

292

1991:98). These conclusions are based on a number of different types of evidence,
including intensive occupation near the Alibates quarries, the excavation of hundreds
of quarry pits to obtain this resource, astonishing quantities of lithic production debris,
and finished and unfinished chipped stone implements at some sites. For example,
Lintz (1991:98) notes that the Alibates Ruins “are within a one-kilometer radius of the
Alibates agatized dolomite quarries, and the presence of sizeable biface caches in
rooms, coupled with the staggering quantities of debitage at these sites, indicates that
the Antelope Creek peoples were actively engaged in mining, shaping, and probably
trading the locally available agate resource”.
Although many researchers have stated, almost nonchalantly, that the
occupants of the Alibates Ruins were heavily involved in the extraction, production,
and exchange of Alibates, until recently the economic importance of these activities, at
both the local and regional scales, had yet to be explored in any detail. Brosowske
(2002b) has examined lithic materials recovered from Antelope Creek settlements in
both Texas and Oklahoma and has concluded that the inhabitants of the Alibates Ruins
and other communities near the quarries were part-time craft specialists producing
chipped stone tools for export. This study identified differential distributions of waste
debris, primarily manufacturing failures, tools associated with production (i.e.,
hammerstones and antler billets), and finished items, among a sample of Antelope
Creek settlements. In the discussions that follow the results of this unpublished study
are briefly summarized.
The Alibates Ruins consist of three individually recorded settlements: Alibates
Ruin 28, 28A, and 30.

Earlier it was argued that these settlements were

293

contemporaneously occupied and should be considered a single community (Chapter
Four).

To review, it is estimated that approximately 19 residential structures were

excavated at Alibates Ruin 28, four at Alibates Ruin 30, and one at Alibates Ruin 28A
(Lintz 1986a:338, Figures 45, 50). It should be noted that at Alibates Ruin 28 two
areas, Units I and II, contain distinct types of architectural features. Unit I is a large
contiguous room structure containing six habitation rooms and Unit II consists of 13
freestanding habitation structures. These data suggest that as many as 24 families
occupied the Alibates Ruins, although considering that this settlement was occupied
for at least 200 years it is likely that the number of families at any given time was
actually lower.

Altogether as many as 40 to 50 families may have occupied

communities that essentially surrounded the quarries. Earlier, it was argued that these
communities represented a visible claim to this important resource and that they
controlled access to the quarries. If these propositions are correct, then it should not
be unexpected that these same communities may have also participated in specialized
lithic production.
As Lintz (1986a) has pointed out, the Alibates Ruins and most of the other
Antelope Creek settlements in the Canadian River valley were excavated many
decades ago using excavation and sampling techniques that by today’s standards are
less than ideal.

As a result, it is unfortunate that various analyses that rely on

systematically collected samples and precise provenience information are seriously
impeded. Therefore, with these limitations in mind the following analysis which seeks
to identify the presence of specialized production of chipped stone tools at Antelope
Creek phase communities near the Alibates quarries is presented.

294

Because “specialized production is a relative state” the material correlates of
these activities can only be identified when multiple data sets are examined within a
comparative framework (Costin 1991:2). Following Costin (1991) and others (e.g.,
Arnold 1985; Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Muller 1984; Rice 1981; Tosi 1984) this
analysis examines evidence for differential participation in chipped stone tool
production among a sample of Antelope Creek phase communities. This study is
fairly coarse grained and primarily seeks only to demonstrate the existence of craft
specialization not a thorough analysis of the entire production system. As such,
although this study examines specialization at the settlement level, it is not suggested
that production was comparable among all families within each community. The data
used in this analysis are primarily derived from Lintz (1986a:Table 31) and Green
(1986:Table 6), although additional supporting information was collected by the
author at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas, the primary
curatorial facility for most of the assemblages examined here. Before the evidence for
part-time lithic craft specialization is presented a brief description of the Antelope
Creek lithic production system is presented.
Nearly three decades ago, Bandy (1976) provided a description of the lithic
reduction sequence of Alibates silicified dolomite by Antelope Creek phase groups.
His study was based on a sample of lithic waste debris recovered from the Turkey
Creek site (41PT8), a small settlement approximately 1.5 km north of the Alibates
quarries (see Figure 7.1; Green 1986). Even though only 44 m2 were excavated at this
site, an estimated total of 57,000 waste debris flakes were recovered during excavation
(i.e., density = 1300 flakes per m2). Based on its location and the density of chipped

295

stone debris at the site, Bandy (1976:79) concluded that “the aboriginal occupants of
41PT8 without question acquired flint material from the nearby quarries, and biface
cores were transported to 41PT8 where they were chipped into thin bifaces and other
items for trade”. The reduction process for the Turkey Creek site as described by
Bandy (1976) is essentially identical to that identified by the author (2002c) for the
nearby Alibates Ruins.
The production sequence began with the procurement of Alibates nodules from
pits excavated at the quarries. Over 730 quarry pits representing five morphological
types have been documented following the 1998 fire at the Alibates quarries (Katz and
Katz 2004). Excavated quarry pits at the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument
are usually circular or oval in shape and contain sizeable debris rings around their
perimeters. On average, quarry pits are about 3 m in diameter, although some nearly
10 m across are also documented (Katz and Katz 2004). Quarry pits were excavated
through dolomite and caliche to obtain high quality nodules present at least 0.8 m
below the ground surface. Katz and Katz (2004) note that gravels, nodules, boulders,
and ledges of Alibates chert are available as surface exposures, but that weathering
seriously reduces the quality of these material. Thus, quarried tool stone is more
predictable in quality.
The reduction process began with the production of large bifacial cores often
20 to 30 cm in length from quarried nodules. The abundance of early stage flakes with
weathered bedrock cortex at the quarries and their rarity at settlements indicate that the
production of large bifacial cores occurred at the quarries (Bandy 1976:47, 79;

296

Brosowske 2002c; Katz and Katz 2004). These cores were transported to permanent
settlements where they were further reduced.
The primary items produced during bifacial core reduction were large flakes
blanks, scrapers, and bifaces (Bandy 1975; Brosowske 2002b). Initially, reduction
involved the removal of large flakes from bifacial cores. These flakes included both
flat and curved examples, each appropriate for specific types of tools. Flat flakes
served as blanks for the manufacture of a variety of unifacial and bifacial tools (i.e.,
projectile points, drills, etc.), while curved flakes required little to no modification for
use as end and side scrapers. Judging from the materials present at settlements, ovate
knives and scrapers appear to have been the only formal tools manufactured.
Evidence for the manufacture of other tools from flake blanks does not appear to be
represented (Brosowske 2002b). That flake blanks were not reduced into finished
implements for exchange is supported by the presence of sizeable caches of these
objects at locations far from the quarries (see Bevitt 2001; Hurst 2002; Lintz n.d.b).
Overall, the bifacial core technology described here is similar in many respects to that
hypothesized for Southern Plains Folsom groups (ca. 10,900-10,200 B.P.) (see
Boldurian et al. 1987; Hofman 1992; Stanford and Broilo 1981).
While the production of large flake blanks and scrapers was certainly
important, knappers were simultaneously laboring to produce a large, thin ovate biface
or knife from each bifacial core (Bandy 1976; Brosowske 2002c). These bifaces were
traded widely throughout the region during the Middle Ceramic period, although most
archaeologists are only familiar with these tools in their exhausted state: Harahey or
diamond-shaped, alternately beveled knives.

297

A distinct curvature to some ovate

knives does indicate, however, that some specimens were also produced at times from
flake blanks. Figure 7.4 shows examples of ovate knives, both prior to use and
throughout various stages of the resharpening process. Initially, these tools were as
large as 15 to 20 cm in length, 4 to 7 cm wide, and 0.5 to 1.0 cm in thickness. Given
that Alibates gravels obtained from secondary sources are usually less than 10 cm in
length, it is likely that these impressive tools could only be produced from tool stone
procured from the quarries.

Figure 7.4 Ovate Knives with Various Amounts of Resharpening.

298

An additional stage that appears to be represented in the Alibates production
process is heat treating. Currently, this step is poorly understood and only a single
study has examined effects of heat treatment on Alibates (Joyce 1985). That study
attempted to quantify alteration resulting from heat treatment, both in terms of visual
changes and improvements in material quality. The results indicate that the optimal
temperature for heat treating Alibates was 250° to 350° C. Samples heated within this
range showed increased luster, red and pink colors became more prominent, and all
specimens were much easier to work (Joyce 1985:37, 39).

Lower temperatures

showed little change in color or knappability, while higher temperatures produced
material that was brittle, crazed, and/or potlidded (Joyce 1985:37). Overall, compared
to other types of stone, Alibates requires a fairly low temperature range to obtain
optimal results from heat treatment (see Luedtke 1992:Table 7.1 for a comparison with
other materials).

Experimentally heat treated specimens were compared to 200

Alibates artifacts recovered from Antelope Creek settlements and concluded that 70%
of these artifacts were heat treated (Joyce 1985:38).
An examination of the chipped stone assemblages from sites, such as the
Alibates Ruins, displays remarkable redundancy in reduction strategies (i.e., cores,
bifaces, and flake forms. Although not formally investigated and based largely on
qualitative assessments at this time, the materials present suggest a highly
standardized and efficient system of production. These patterns are perhaps most
evident when scraper forms are examined, although manufacturing failures associated
with biface production and finished items also suggest that the manufacture of these
items was highly standardized. Overall, despite the present limitations, the massive

299

quantities of cores, hammerstones, and waste debris, including debitage and
manufacturing failures at sites near the quarries are truly spectacular and appear to
indicate production above and beyond normal household consumption.
While, the above summary is obviously quite limited in scope, it is sufficient
for establishing a basic understanding of the Alibates production sequence. Key
points of this system worth emphasizing are briefly mentioned here. It should be
apparent that Alibates ovate knives represent an item that required a great deal of skill
to manufacture. That these items were highly valued as utilitarian tools is visibly
demonstrated by their abundance and wide distribution. The inclusion of ovate knives
as associated grave objects in many instances also points toward their considerable
value in the socio-political realm as well (see Green 1986:93; Summers 1997:Table
5.2).

Standardization in the production sequence of Alibates, both in terms of

reduction and the types of items manufactured (i.e., ovate knives, flake blanks, and
scrapers) is also suggested, but remains largely uninvestigated at this time. Heat
treatment of Alibates also appears to have been an important step in the production
process. Interestingly, while this step does not appear to have been necessary since
raw Alibates is generally considered a high quality material, it likely facilitated the
reduction process and may have been seen as a means by which higher quality
products were produced.
Overall, many of the characteristics identified here, including intensive
quarrying, heat treatment, standardization in the production process, and the types of
chipped stone items manufactured, as well as evidence for strategic settlement near the
quarries, embody many of the traits typically exhibited with craft specialization (see

300

Arnold 1985, 1987; Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 1991;
Muller 1984; 1987; Rice 1981; Torrence 1986). In the discussion that follows the idea
that part-time lithic craft specialization was concentrated among a few Antelope Creek
settlements near the quarries is examined. Using a comparative framework, evidence
for differential distributions of production related items and finished objects are
presented.
Considering the spatial relationship between some Antelope Creek settlements
and the Alibates quarries it is expected that those settlements near the quarries should
show evidence for involvement in the specialized production of chipped stone tools.
The logic of this study is straightforward; to identify significant differences in the
quantities of specific classes of artifacts associated with chipped stone tool production
among Antelope Creek settlements. Artifact classes selected included production
related objects (i.e., cores and hammerstones) and finished items (bifaces and
scrapers). Because we are dealing with quantitative rather than qualitative data within
a comparative framework, it is necessary to determine an objective method for
measuring the frequency of artifacts at sites. Since settlements used in the sample
were studied by different researchers using diverse excavation and sampling
techniques, determining an objective calculation of artifact density is problematic.
Ideally, a measure of frequency for some fixed unit of volume, such as quantity per
m3, would be best. However, since the m3 excavated at most Antelope Creek sites is
not known, frequencies per m2 are used instead (see Green 1986:Table 6; Lintz
1986a:Table 31). Table 7.2 provides the frequencies for select artifact classes per m2
for 18 Antelope Creek settlements.

Artifact densities are multiplied by 100 to

It should be noted that data from Antelope Creek 24, a well known Antelope
Creek site, are not included in this analysis for two reasons. First, the size of the area
excavated at this site is not known. Second, although an estimated five habitation
structures are thought to have been present at Antelope Creek 24, these were destroyed
by natural processes prior to excavation (i.e., they had eroded away), and thus, could
not be sampled. In addition, since artifact counts and the total area excavated are
known for specific areas within the Alibates Ruins (i.e., Alibates Ruin 28 Unit I and
Unit II, 28A, and 30), these data are presented individually.

302

Settlements with the five highest density scores for cores, bifaces, and scrapers
per excavated m2 are shown in bold in Table 7.2. The settlements of Turkey Creek,
41MO7, and Footprint all rank in the top five for each of the three classes examined,
Alibates Ruin 28 Unit I and Arrowhead Peak rank in the top five for two classes, and
Pickett Ruin and Medford Ranch each rank in the top five for one class. Overall, these
results are fairly ambiguous and difficult to interpret primarily because there does not
appear to be any noticeable relationship between artifact density and settlement
distribution or size, m2 excavated, or as we shall see, distance to the Alibates quarries.
Although there are many possible explanations for the lack of patterning in the
data, it is apparent that there is a relationship between artifact densities and the degree
to which excavations at each site targeted cultural features (e.g., houses, middens, and
storage facilities) and nonhabitation areas. For example, one would expect that the
density of artifacts per m2 to be higher at sites where excavations focused on cultural
features containing abundant cultural materials, while exterior areas containing sparse
habitation debris were only minimally examined. Likewise, it is anticipated that sites
investigated using large open block excavations, which sampled both domestic
features and large areas relatively devoid of habitation debris, should contain lower
densities of artifacts per m2. The relationship between each of these factors and their
potential for biasing the data are shown in Table 7.3 as a measure of the total area
excavated divided by the total number of residential structures excavated for a select
number of sites. Lower indices indicate an emphasis on houses and middens, while
higher scores reflect less of an emphasis on features containing high densities of

303

artifacts.

Here, artifact densities per m2 are once again multiplied by 100 for

comparative purposes.

The figures presented in Table 7.3 suggest that in at least some cases there is a
strong relationship between the excavation strategies employed at a given settlement
and the densities of artifacts recovered. Those sites for which the area excavated
divided by the number houses excavated is low tend to be sites which have high
densities of the artifact classes selected. This trend is perhaps most evident at the
Footprint site where three houses were excavated and all excavations were limited to
house interiors or adjacent midden areas (see Green 1986:Figure 30). This settlement
ranked in the top five for artifact densities for each of the three artifact classes
examined (Table 7.2).

The reverse trend is represented by settlements, such as

Antelope Creek 22 and Alibates Ruin 28 Unit II, where large areas exterior to houses
and middens were excavated and exhibit low densities of artifacts. As such, it is
suggested that the frequency of artifacts recovered at the sites in the sample be
calculated using an alternative means of measurement: density per excavated house.
Tables 7.4 and 7.5 provide densities per house for cores and hammerstones
(production related classes) and bifaces and scrapers (finished items) for the same

304

sample of settlements. Once again, settlements with the five highest density scores for
each of these artifact classes are shown in bold. Also included are the approximate
straight-line distances to the Alibates quarries from each settlement.

The data presented in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 exhibit a strong correlation between
artifact densities per house and the proximity of settlements to the Alibates quarries.
Of the six sites that are within five km of the quarries, all but Alibates Ruin 30 have
high densities of the artifact classes examined. For each of the four classes of artifacts
examined, Alibates Ruin 28 Units I and II, Turkey Creek (41PT8), and 41MO7 rank in
top five 75% to 100% of the time. Alibates Ruin 28A, a portion of the Alibates Ruins
that is about one km from the quarries, ranks in the top five only twice, but narrowly
misses in the remaining two instances (i.e., it ranks sixth for both cores and bifaces).

If one calculates the average density of each artifact class for settlements
within 5 km of the quarries (N=6) and those at greater distances (N=12) the
differences are fairly striking (Figure 7.5). For instance, the actual quantities of
scrapers and cores are nearly eight to 10 times more numerous per house at
settlements near the quarries (i.e., scrapers: 128.0 versus 16.3; cores: 25.7 versus 2.7).
The densities of bifaces and hammerstones are less dramatic, but are still two to four
times more common at settlements near the quarries than those more distant (bifaces
30.4 versus 13.4; hammerstones 6.2 versus 1.6).
Overall, the selection of cores and hammerstones for the preceding analysis are
self explanatory since they are obviously classes of artifacts related to chipped stone
tool production. The frequency of antler billets was also examined, but was not
included in the analysis because it seemed possible that some of these items may

306

actually represent handles or hafting elements for chipped stone tools rather than lithic
percussors.

Generally, artifacts listed as antler billets were absent from most

settlements, however, one or more billets were recovered in each house at Alibates
Ruin 28 Unit I (4.25) and Unit II (3.77), Alibates Ruin 28A (3.0), Antelope Creek 22
(2.71), 41MO7 (1.0), and Footprint (1.67). All but two of these settlements are near
the quarries (i.e., Antelope Creek 22 and Footprint). Despite concerns regarding their
function, the frequency of antler billets at sites appears to compliment the preceding
data.

The reasoning underlying the selection of bifaces and scrapers for this analysis
is slightly less obvious. As noted earlier, however, of all of the formal tool types that
make their appearance during the Middle Ceramic period on the Southern High Plains,
bifacial knives and scrapers are the only two tools that appear to have been produced
for exchange. The only other items that appear to have been produced for exchange
were flake blanks, however, since many researchers did not systematically collect
unmodified debitage, the frequency of these items could not be tabulated. Other tools,
such as projectile points and drills, do not appear to have been produced by specialists
near the quarries, but rather seem to have been manufactured by consumers using
flake blanks. Thus, since bifaces and scrapers were the primary tool classes produced
by specialists, it was concluded that sites containing high frequencies of these objects
were most likely to reflect locales of specialized production.
In sum, using artifact classes related to lithic production, artifact densities per
excavated house were calculated for 18 different Antelope Creek sites. Six of the
settlements are within 5 km of the Alibates quarries (33% or six of 18 in the total site
sample), yet these sites ranked in the top five 76% of the time for the highest densities
of the artifacts examined (i.e., 16 of 21). These data indicate substantial differences in
the frequency of production related tools and finished items among Antelope Creek
settlements. I suggest that these data, as relatively coarse grained as they are, provide
fairly strong evidence for intensified production of chipped stone tools at several of
the Antelope Creek settlements near the Alibates quarries. Overall, the quantities of
items present at these sites are indicative of surplus production for exchange.

308

In the ensuing discussion additional evidence for economic intensification in
the region at this time is examined.

Here, intensification is manifested by the

development of another specialized economy: bison hunting. Once again evidence for
economic variability is identified through cross-cultural analysis.

Despite their

fundamental differences, these data also suggest that intensification represented an
organized strategy to produce valued items slated for intersocietal exchange.
Specialized Bison Hunting and the Secondary Products Revolution
By A.D. 1250 large portions of the Great Plains were dominated by sedentary
to semi-sedentary Plains Villagers who practiced a mixed economy of horticulture,
hunting, and foraging. In many areas this settled way of life continued well into the
historic period and is represented by societies such as the Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara,
Pawnee, and Wichita. Although these villagers are well documented, the media has
long emphasized the nomadic societies that occupied this vast region.

Unlike

sedentary villagers, these nomadic groups followed transhumant cycles linked to the
seasonal movements of bison herds, lived in portable bison skin tipis, and practiced
economies which focused heavily on bison. Although this way of life is generally
thought to apply only to equestrian hunters of the Historic period, accounts provided
by early explorers firmly document the existence of similarly organized societies
during the pre-horse era. The Coronado accounts describe two of these groups on the
Southern High Plains during the sixteenth century:
Two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows;
one is called Querechos and the other Teyas; they are very well built,
and painted, and are enemies of each other. They have no other
settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows.
They kill all of these they wish, and tan the hides, with which they
clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh,

309

sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty.
The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over some
poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are
tied at the top, and when they go from one place to another they carry
them on some dogs they have and other things, for the country is so
level, and I have said, that they can make use of these, because they
carry the poles dragging along on the ground. The sun is what they
worship most. The skins for the tents is cured on both sides, without
the hair, and they have the skins of deer and cows left over. They
exchange some cloaks with the natives of the river for corn. [Hammond
and Rey 1940:292-293]

The descriptions provided by this and other similar accounts document
nomadic Protohistoric and Historic Plains societies that were specialized bison hunters
par excellence (see Bolton 1949; Catlin 1996; Ewers 1955; Hammond and Rey 1940;
Holder 1970; Jablow 1951; Lowie 1954; Swanton 1942). From an archaeological
perspective, however, it is clear that these groups represent the final stages in a long
evolutionary sequence of bison hunting on the Plains. For example, on the Northern
Plains, kill sites containing Folsom, Goshen, Agate Basin, Hell Gap, Alberta, Cody,
Hawken, McKean, Pelican Lake, Besant, Avonlea, and a variety of triangular shaped
projectile points document 11,000 years of bison hunting (see Frison 1991; Reeves
1990). Since these societies are known almost exclusively from highly visible bison
kill sites, they are also invariably described as “specialized bison hunters”. Although
kill sites are nowhere near as numerous on the Central and Southern Plains, similar
trends are also presented for these regions (see Hofman 1996; Hofman and Graham
1998; Kay 1998). While the archaeological record is replete with societies that relied
extensively on bison, technically speaking, can all of these societies be considered
“specialized bison hunters”? This begs the question: What constitutes a specialized
hunting economy?

310

Drawing on earlier studies which have investigated and characterized
specialized economies (e.g., Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Costin 1991; Muller 1984; Rice
1981; Tosi 1984), a specialized bison hunting economy should involve a system in
which hunters “depend on extra-household exchange relationships at least in part for
their livelihood, and consumers depend on them for acquisition of goods they do not
produce themselves” (Costin 1991:4).

As such, key elements of specialized

economies are surplus production and exchange. From this perspective, while it is
apparent that numerous prehistoric Plains groups certainly focused on bison hunting,
most of these societies probably cannot be considered “specialists” in a strict
economic sense since they did not derive a large part of their livelihood from goods
obtained through the exchange of bison products. Rather, bison hunting in most of
these instances was conducted to meet basic subsistence needs (see Frison 1991;
compare to the Domestic Mode of Production, Sahlins 1972).
Thus, an important distinction that can be drawn between specialized and nonspecialized hunting economies is whether products from the hunt were procured for
personal consumption or for exchange with a consumer population. On the Southern
High Plains the earliest well documented bison hunting specialists are the Querechos
and Teyas of the Protohistoric period (A.D. 1450-1750) mentioned above.
Ethnohistorically these societies are known to have produced a surplus of bison hides,
dried meat, and bone for tools and other items for trade with sedentary horticulturalists
living to the west and east of the Plains (i.e., Puebloans and the Caddo). These groups
correspond to the Tierra Blanca, Garza, Edwards, and Wheeler complexes documented

311

in the archaeological record (see T. Baugh 1982, 1986; Habicht-Mauche 1992;
Hofman 1984, 1989b).
Using the definition of specialized economies presented above, the following
discussion examines the extent to which hunting economies during the Middle
Ceramic period can be characterized as “specialized bison hunting economies”. Here,
the degree to which Southern High Plains hunting economies were specialized or
generalized is measured through a comparative analysis of faunal remains.

It is

recognized that demonstrating the exchange of bison products in the distant past and
differentiating between exchange and simple sharing among prehistoric societies
presents a challenge.

Fortunately, the ethnohistoric and archaeological records

document Protohistoric societies that are known to have bartered in bison products for
a significant portion of their livelihood. As such, the economies of these groups are
used as a starting point from which to measure the extent of hunting specialization
among Middle Ceramic communities.
As with other types of specialized economies (i.e., chipped stone, metallurgy,
ceramics, textiles), the degree of specialization in hunting should be considered on a
relative scale (Costin 1991). Thus, the extent of specialization is examined once again
through comparative analysis.

Relying on faunal inventories from permanent

settlements of various Middle Ceramic complexes of the Southern Plains, hunting
strategies are placed along a continuum from specialized bison hunting to broad
spectrum hunting. Placement along this scale is based on faunal diversity and the total
number or percentage of bison remains in each assemblage. Due to a number of
problems with existing assemblages mentioned above, other types of data, such as

312

specialized bison processing tools, are not considered. Within this framework, it is
expected that bison hunting specialists should display faunal assemblages which
contain a low diversity of faunal species and unusually high frequencies of bison
remains. The Middle Ceramic settlements used in this analysis include two Antelope
Creek phase sites (Two Sisters and Landergin Mesa), two Odessa phase sites
(Lundeen and Odessa Yates), and one Turkey Creek phase site (Heerwald).
The faunal inventories from these settlements are compared to those from the
Duncan (34WA2) and Edwards I (34BK2) sites. Both of these sites are well-known
Edwards complex (A.D. 1450-1650) settlements in western Oklahoma. As Hofman
(1989b:98) notes, “the economy of Edwards complex people was apparently heavily
focused on bison hunting and trading. Trade probably involved bison products such as
hides, dried meat, selected bones, fat or grease, and other items such as salt”. As
noted earlier, Edwards and other related complexes (i.e., Tierra Blanca, Garza, and
Wheeler), are the archaeological manifestations of the nomadic bison hunting societies
described by early visitors to the region (see Baugh 1982; Bell and Bastian 1967;
Habicht-Mauche 1992; Hofman 1984, 1989b; Monk 1982; Savage 1995). As such,
the faunal assemblages from Duncan and Edwards I are used as a baseline for
weighing the degree of specialization in bison hunting for each of the study sites.
Figure 7.6 shows the location of each of the settlements used in this analysis. Overall,
each of the sites selected here represent some of the few faunal assemblages that have
been systematically collected, subjected to rigorous analysis, and are well reported in
the literature (see Appendix II; Bevitt 1999; Demarcay 1986; Duncan 2002; Monk
1982; Savage 1995).

313

Figure 7.6 Location of Settlements Used in Faunal Diet Breadth Study.

Before this analysis is presented there are a number of potential difficulties that
must be considered when comparing faunal assemblages from different sites. Often,
these problems stem from differences in excavation and sampling techniques,
preservation, variability among faunal analysts, and others.

Although excavation

techniques did vary among the study sites, the biases resulting from these differences
appear to be negligible for the following reasons.
First, except for Odessa Yates where fine-screening with 3 mm mesh was
employed, matrix from all of the study sites was dry screened through 6 mm mesh.
Thus, while it is possible that smaller fauna may be underrepresented in the
assemblages, since screening techniques were comparable among sites it is assumed
that this bias should be roughly equivalent among sites. Second, since field techniques
as a whole have improved over time, if there is a sampling bias against smaller fauna,

314

one should expect higher frequencies of rodent, snake, fish, and amphibian remains
recovered at settlements excavated more recently. This, however, does not seem to be
a major problem since high frequencies of small fauna were recovered at most of the
sites no matter their date of excavation (e.g., Two Sisters 1972 and 1973, Landergin
Mesa 1984, and Lundeen 1998).
Overall, biases resulting from other factors appear to be minimal and sample
sizes from each settlement are more than sufficient (i.e., NISP for each site are
>1800). Lastly, the Antelope Creek phase faunal data presented by Duffield (1970)
are not included here. These data are from excavations carried out at sites from about
1930 to 1961, and from an analytical perspective, are fraught with numerous problems
(see Lintz 1986a:243-244; Spielmann 1982:288). As Lintz (1986a:244) has pointed
out, the samples used by Duffield were derived from sites where screening was not
systematically employed and only “identifiable” faunal specimens were collected.
Table 7.6 presents the faunal inventories for the Middle Ceramic settlements
examined here. These data include the number of identified specimens (NISP) and
minimum number of individuals (MNI) for all but Landergin Mesa (see Demarcay
1986). Freshwater molluscan fauna are excluded from these data. It should be noted
that several closely related taxa are lumped for ease of data presentation. Thus,
aquatic turtles, snakes and lizards, amphibians, fish, mice, ground squirrels, woodrats,
and cottontails are not differentiated as to species, but are combined into individual
classes. Likewise, deer and pronghorn are joined into a single class. Later, faunal
diversity is examined in greater detail and specific information regarding the number
of species identified at each site is presented at that time.

Faunal inventories for the Protohistoric period Edwards complex sites selected
for analysis (i.e., Duncan and Edwards I) are presented in Table 7.7. Once again,
similar lumping techniques were employed to produce a manageably sized table.
Whereas, the Middle Ceramic site assemblages did not appear to display any major
sampling biases, Duncan has low quantities of small mammals, birds, and fish. For
instance, small mammals represent only 0.5% of all mammals at this site. It is likely
that these patterns reflect a sampling bias against small animals. Sampling appears to
be less of a problem at Edwards I where small mammals are represented by a number
of different species, and as a whole, comprise nearly 2% of all mammals.

The two primary faunal indices used here to measure the degree of hunting
specialization among the study sites are faunal diversity and the overall abundance of
bison in each assemblage (Figure 7.7). Faunal diversity equates to the total number of
terrestrial, avian, and aquatic species (excluding freshwater mussels). To account for
differences among faunal analysts some taxa are joined into single classes.

In

particular, aquatic turtles and fish were not consistently differentiated to species, so
they are combined here. Likewise, because it is often not possible to differentiate
between deer and pronghorn elements in highly fragmented assemblages, these
ungulates are joined into one class. Other than these minor changes, all identified
species are included in these figures. Determining the abundance of bison at each
settlement is straightforward and was calculated based on the percentage of identified
bison elements relative to the total number of identified mammal elements. For
comparative purposes, two hypothetical sites are also included in Figure 7.7. These
sites are labeled “specialist” and “generalist” and represent two conceptual extremes
of the hunting spectrum.
The results of this comparison show some very interesting trends. It is readily
apparent that two of the Middle Ceramic sites, Odessa Yates and Heerwald, compare
very closely, both in terms of faunal diversity and the abundance of bison, to the two
specialized bison hunting economies of Duncan and Edwards I.

Overall, faunal

diversity among the study sites varies from a low of 12 different species at Duncan to
a high of 52 at Lundeen. As noted earlier, the unusually low faunal diversity index at
Duncan is probably related to a sampling bias against small mammals, birds, and fish.

318

As such, it is likely that the number of species represented at this site is actually higher
than is indicated here (i.e., >15 species). Odessa Yates has the next lowest number of
species identified (N=18). Because all soil matrix from this site was subjected to fine
screening it seems less likely that this low figure reflects a sampling bias against small
fauna.

Number of Identified Faunal Species

Figure 7.7 Faunal Diversity and the Abundance of Bison at the Study Sites.

Besides indicating the range of animals hunted or collected, it is possible that
the diversity of species identified can also be a reflection of the environmental setting
immediately surrounding each settlement. The sites used here (see Figure 7.6) are
dispersed over a large area of western Oklahoma (Heerwald, Duncan, and Edwards I),

319

north across the Oklahoma panhandle (Two Sisters and Odessa Yates) to southern
Kansas (Lundeen). Landergin Mesa is to the west near the Texas-New Mexico line.
Annual precipitation varies considerably from about 736 mm (29 in) at Duncan, to
about 508 mm (20 in) at Odessa Yates, and 457 mm (18 in) at Two Sisters and
Landergin Mesa. All of the settlements are along spring fed tributary streams, except
the Two Sisters site, which is adjacent to the Beaver River.
Of all the sites, the potential impact that a productive environment may have
on faunal assemblage diversity is best reflected by the Lundeen site. Bevitt (1999:20)
notes that the Crooked Creek valley surrounding Lundeen contains numerous large
sloughs or lakes that historically often held water for several years. Thus, the large
numbers of waterfowl, aquatic turtles, and fish recovered at this settlement probably
reflect seasonal hunting, gathering, and fishing at these locales (Bevitt 2004, personal
communication). As a result, the diversity of species recovered likely reflects the
abundance of wetlands near the site. Nonetheless, even when the diversity index at
Lundeen is adjusted to account for the large numbers of birds (note: this index is
already adjusted for fish and aquatic turtles), a fairly generalized hunting strategy is
still indicated.

Besides Lundeen, no other sites present assemblages that would

indicate occupation of unusually productive settings.
Conversely, there were no settlements in which a low diversity of faunal
species could be attributed to occupation of a particularly unproductive environment.
For instance both Two Sisters and Landergin Mesa are in the most arid portions of the
study area, but both still have some of the highest faunal diversity indices. Overall,
except for Lundeen, the range and abundance of various fauna within a 5 km

320

catchment zone around each settlement appears to have been roughly equivalent. In
addition, the species represented at each site also indicate that all environmental zones
around settlements were used (i.e., riparian, breaks, and uplands). As a result, it is
concluded that the diversity of species presented for each site is a fair measure of diet
breadth and not settlement in settings that are unusually rich or poor in resources.
The abundance of bison at each of the settlements varies from 84% to 89% at
Odessa Yates, Duncan, Edwards I, and Heerwald to 31% at Lundeen.

As noted

earlier, the frequency of bison represents the total number of bison elements relative to
the total number of mammal elements. As such, this variable is useful because it
represents a measurement that is largely independent of the faunal diversity index.
Whereas the total number of faunal species seems to be a reasonable reflection of the
range of animals hunted or gathered in most cases, the overall quantity of bison
elements recovered at a permanent settlement can be subject to a large number of
social processes. For example, the proximity of bison kills to residential settlements,
transport and processing strategies, and the length and season of occupation are all
variables that can greatly affect the amount of bison bone in an assemblage. Since
there are considerable disparities in the abundance of bison among the study sites, it is
worthwhile to explore how some of these dynamics could have affected the frequency
of bison elements compared to other mammals.
The location of bison kills and their proximity to settlements has obvious
potential for influencing the amount and types of bison elements represented in the
faunal assemblages of residential sites (see Binford 1978, 1984). The average dressed
weights for bull and cow bison are about 246 and 212 kg (541 and 467 lbs),

321

respectively (derived from Halloran 1961:Tables I and II). Given the large body size
of bison and the limitations associated with Middle Ceramic and Protohistoric
transport technology (i.e., human and dog transport), bison hunters were faced with a
number of logistical problems related to transporting animals from kills to residential
sites. As the distance between bison kill locations and settlements increases the costs
of transporting animals also increases.
Previous research has examined the relationship between transport and
butchering/processing strategies among various types of societies (Binford 1978,
1984; Bunn 1983; Bunn et al. 1988; Metcalfe and Jones 1988; Speth 1983, 2004).
Beyond the logistical problems associated with transporting animals back to
settlements, processing strategies are also influenced by a number of factors, including
the number of animals killed, demands for meat, marrow, bone grease, and bone tools;
the food utility of various body parts (i.e., meat, marrow, bone grease, fat utility), and
the size, age, and nutritional status of animals (see Binford 1978, 1984; Emerson
1993; Speth 1983).
In general, these issues are less of a problem with other fauna of the region
since these animals are characterized by smaller body sizes. For instance, the average
dressed weights of adult male and female pronghorn are about 30 and 26 kg (66 and
57 lbs), respectively (Mitchell 1971; Miracle 2004). Other constraints aside, one of
these animals could easily be transported over fairly long distances by a single hunter.
Thus, except for perhaps deer, other non-bison faunal resources hunted by the
occupants of the region were more likely to be transported to settlements with little

322

field processing. As a result, it might be expected that all skeletal portions of these
animals stand a greater chance of being recovered at settlements.
With these points in mind, it is worth considering the possibility that each of
the settlements examined here may have emphasized bison hunting equally, but that
the amount of bison remains in each assemblage varied because the distance between
kills and settlements also varied (i.e., the transport and processing strategies differed).
Of particular concern, is the likelihood that the comparatively low frequencies of
identified bison elements at settlements, such as Lundeen and Two Sisters, resulted
because the occupants of these sites conducted bison hunts far from home, while those
settlements containing high frequencies of bison remains represent cases where bison
kills occurred close to settlements.
Weighing the utility of various anatomical parts and the costs associated with
transporting these items, the types and frequencies of bison elements represented in
assemblages can provide an approximate measure of the distance between kill sites
and settlements. Generally, as transport costs increase bulky portions of animals of
low utility (e.g., cranium, innominate/sacrum) are more likely to be abandoned at kills,
while anatomical segments of high utility (e.g., femur, tibia, humerus, radius) are more
frequently transported back to settlements (see Emerson 1993 for bison utility
indices).

Thus, assemblages that contain bulky, low utility elements are usually

interpreted to mean that kills occurred close to the settlement and transport costs were
low. In contrast, in systems where kills were typically conducted far from home,
assemblages should contain fewer low utility elements and larger numbers of high
utility elements.

323

From this perspective, it is possible to determine whether the reliance on bison
at Lundeen and Two Sisters was equal to that of Edwards I, Duncan, Odessa Yates,
and Heerwald, but because bison were killed far from settlements, low utility elements
may have been processed and discarded at kill locales, and thus, are underrepresented
in these assemblages. Even though these issues are less of a concern for Edwards I,
Duncan, Odessa Yates, and Heerwald, since all of these sites have high frequencies of
bison bone in their assemblages, the distance between kills and settlements is also
considered for these sites.
Using the types of bison skeletal elements transported to the study sites, it is
possible to determine the general proximity of settlements to bison kills (e.g., close,
moderate, and distant). If sites containing relatively low frequencies of bison remains
also primarily contain bison elements of high utility, then it may be concluded that
transport and processing decisions may have influenced the composition of faunal
assemblages causing bison elements to be underrepresented at these settlements (i.e.,
underestimating the importance of this resource to the economy).

If kills were

conducted close to settlements, then it is expected that transport and processing
decisions did not greatly impact the composition of faunal assemblages and all types
of elements, regardless of their utility, should be represented. In many instances this
issue has been already been explicitly addressed by previous researchers and is not
reviewed here (see Appendix II; Bevitt 1999; Duncan 2002; Savage 1995). In two
cases, Landergin Mesa and Edwards I, this issue has not been formally examined, but
elemental frequencies are available (Demarcay 1986:Appendix; Monk 1982:Table 12).
Using these previously published data the projected distance to kills, along with the

324

seasonality of occupation and the timing of bison kills, if available, are presented in
Table 7.8.

The projected distance to kills based on the recovery of portions of skeletons
with contrasting utility indices suggest that bison kills were regularly conducted at
relatively close or at moderate distances to each of the settlements. Although not
equally represented, both high and low utility portions of animals are present at all of
the sites (Appendix II; Bevitt 1999:Table 30; Demarcay 1986:Appendix; Duncan
2002, personal communication 2004; Monk 1982:Table 12; Savage 1995:Tables 5.8,
5.9). This pattern is perhaps most evident at Odessa Yates (see Figure 4.11). Similar
patterns are observed at Landergin Mesa and Two Sisters (Demarcay 1986:Appendix;
Duncan personal communication 2004). Based on these patterns it is concluded that
kills occurred close to all three of these settlements. Settlements listed as having kills
at close to moderate distances contained both high and low utility elements, but
researchers observed lower frequencies of certain anatomical segments, namely axial
elements (see Bevitt 1999:147-148; Savage 1995:149). Lower frequencies of these
elements suggest that some kills were far enough away from settlements that particular

325

portions of animals were processed and left at kill locales (see Speth 2004 for a
discussion of intervillage trade in axial elements). Nonetheless, the fact that three of
these four settlements (i.e., Heerwald, Duncan, and Edwards I) contain abundant
quantities of bison bone suggests that in these instances the proximity of kill locales
did not adversely affect our perceptions of the importance of bison to these economies.
Since faunal analyses typically emphasize identifiable specimens, the
processing of bison bone for marrow and bone grease also has the potential to affect
the apparent quantity of bison elements in assemblages. Although these activities
typically rendered most elements into small fragments, they do not appear to have
caused bison bone to be underrepresented in any of the assemblages because intensive
processing appears to be equally well represented among each of the study sites
(Bevitt 1999; Brosowske unpublished data; Demarcay 1986; Duncan 2002, personal
communication 2004; Monk 1982; Savage 1995). As a result, it is anticipated that a
failure to identify bison remains should be roughly equivalent among each of the study
settlements.
The final factor that must be investigated is to determine whether the quantity
of bison remains at any of the sites was influenced by the duration or season of
occupation. This issue is important because it is possible that bison hunting was a
seasonal activity for the occupants of some sites. If so, it is feasible that some
settlements were occupied during times of the year when bison were not hunted, thus,
potentially underestimating the importance of this resource. In most cases, this factor
does not appear to have influenced the composition of assemblages since nearly all of
the Middle Ceramic settlements appear to have been occupied throughout the year

326

(i.e., four of five sites). As such, it is assumed that the faunal remains recovered at
these sites are representative of hunting strategies throughout the year.
The only Middle Ceramic settlement for which the reconstructed length of
occupation is less than year round is Landergin Mesa. The seasonality data available
from this site are extremely meager and consist of the remains of a fetal or new born
pronghorn and turtle elements. These data suggest occupation during the warm season
(i.e., spring to fall). Generally, evidence for winter occupation at settlements of the
region is often derived from either mammal dentitions or migratory waterfowl
remains. However, since both of these forms of evidence are relatively rare at most
sites of the region, it is not surprising that they were not recovered at Landergin Mesa.
Therefore, even though data indicative of a winter occupation were not recovered at
this settlement does not necessarily imply that people were not here during this time of
the year. Overall, the fact that seasonality data is lacking at this site is somewhat of a
mute point because bison remains are abundant at this site.
Seasonal reconstructions for the two Edwards complex sites appear to suggest
relatively short-term occupations, possibly seasonal in nature. A fall occupation is
indicated by bison dentitions at the Duncan site (Savage 1995:146). Dentitions were
apparently absent from Edwards I and the presence of turtle remains in the assemblage
provides minimal evidence for occupation during the warm season (Monk 1982). The
seasonal nature of these Protohistoric settlements is not surprising as previous
reconstructions suggest that these societies were seasonally mobile (see T. Baugh
1982, 1986; Drass and Savage 1992; Hofman 1978, 1984, 1989b). These conclusions
are based largely on the absence or rarity of subterranean storage facilities, permanent

327

residential structures, and evidence for horticulture.

Because both Duncan and

Edwards I represent seasonal encampments, and since we have little evidence for
organization of their economies for the rest of the year, it is only possible to
characterize their hunting strategies based on the data available from these two sites.
Therefore, it is possible that the emphasis on bison hunting by Edwards complex
societies, as represented by Duncan and Edwards I, may have been seasonal, possibly
a fall activity. Nonetheless, even though these sites represent seasonal occupations,
the low diversity of faunal remains and the high frequency of bison elements at each
of these settlements provide excellent examples of what the faunal assemblages of
specialized bison hunters should look like. It should be noted that both of these sites
only somewhat approach the patterns expected at the hypothetical “specialized” site
shown in Figure 7.7.

However, since the composition of the faunal assemblage

presented for this hypothetical site is based on the patterns observed at bison kill sites
(i.e., species diversity equals one, bison comprise 100% of the assemblage), it is not
surprising that even the faunal assemblages recovered from fairly permanent
settlements of specialized bison hunters fall short of these expectations.
Overall, the comparative analysis of faunal assemblages from five Middle
Ceramic period settlements of the Southern Plains demonstrates considerable variation
in the organization of regional hunting strategies. Since all of these settlements were
occupied from A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1500, this variation does not appear to be related to
differences in regional climate across space or through time.

Rather, these data

document fundamental differences in the organization of subsistence economies.
These trends are perhaps most evident for the settlements of Two Sisters, Lundeen,

328

and Odessa Yates, which are all geographically close to one another. Similar patterns
are also observed for western Oklahoma, but space and time constraints limited the
number of Middle Ceramic sites, beyond Heerwald, that could be formally examined
(see Drass and Flynn 1990). Likewise, variation in the setting of sites, distance to
kills, and transport and processing strategies were also examined, but they do not
appear to have greatly influenced the patterns observed in assemblages. As such, the
results presented in Figure 7.7 are interpreted to represent examples of hunting
strategies along various points of a continuum from specialized bison hunting to broad
spectrum hunting. The two Edwards complex sites have provided a means by which
to gauge the importance of bison in Middle Ceramic economies.
The results indicate that two settlements, Odessa Yates and Heerwald, have
faunal assemblages that closely match the assemblages from the Protohistoric period
specialized bison hunting sites of Duncan and Edwards I (i.e., low diversity of fauna
and high frequencies of bison). Given these notable similarities, it is proposed that the
emphasis on bison hunting observed at Odessa Yates and Heerwald approximated that
of Duncan and Edwards I. Since Protohistoric societies associated with Duncan and
Edwards I were known to have produced a surplus of bison products for exchange, it
seems likely that the occupants of these two Middle Ceramic settlements did so as
well. Compared to the above sites, the faunal assemblages from Landergin Mesa,
Two Sisters, and Lundeen indicate more of an emphasis on broad spectrum hunting. I
would suggest that the patterns presented by these assemblages likely reflect bison
procurement for local consumption.

329

Lastly, the differences between specialized bison hunting and broad spectrum
strategies proposed here are only further clarified when additional data are examined.
For example, the contribution of different classes of mammals at each site is shown in
Figure 7.8. Among Two Sisters, Landergin Mesa, and Lundeen, the latter site is
certainly most similar to the hypothetical “generalized” site shown in Figure 7.7.
Even without considering the importance of birds, fish, and reptiles to the diet, this site
still displays a fairly equal representation of each of the four mammal classes. Once
again the importance of bison to the Odessa Yates, Heerwald, Duncan, and Edwards I
economies is aptly demonstrated by these data. As noted earlier, bison represent
>84% of all mammals at each of these settlements. These quantities are nearly 20%
higher than at any other site.
Intermediate to Lundeen and the proposed specialized bison economies are
Two Sisters and Landergin Mesa. It is worth noting that bison are the most numerous
of all mammal classes at both of these sites (i.e., Two Sisters 47.2%; Landergin Mesa
64.8%).

As such, the assemblages from these two settlements present a pattern

commonly observed for many portions of the Plains. Generally, these results are
interpreted to mean that bison hunting dominated the hunting economy. Oftentimes,
these interpretations are further bolstered using MNI’s and information regarding the
amount of usable meat provided by each faunal resource (e.g., bison, deer, jackrabbits,
prairie dogs, etc.). While certainly accurate to some extent, to conclude that the
occupants of these sites were specialized bison hunters is misleading. It is suggested
that these propositions are not particularly meaningful when presented outside a
comparative framework.

Previous studies have also emphasized the relative importance of bison to deer
and/or pronghorn in regional subsistence economies (e.g., Boyd 1997; Dillehay 1974;
Drass and Flynn 1990; Duffield 1970). Generally, these studies interpret differences
in the ratios of these large mammals among settlements as reflecting environmental
changes through time or across space (e.g., bison increased in abundance following
A.D. 1300 or bison were more common in western Oklahoma than in central
Oklahoma).
The ratio of bison to deer and antelope (derived from NISP data) among the
study sites presents some fairly dramatic trends (Figure 7.9). It is very apparent that
bison considerably outnumber the combined class of deer and antelope at Odessa
Yates and Heerwald (i.e., the average ratio is nearly 16 to 1). These results compare
quite nicely with specialized bison hunting sites of Duncan and Edwards I where the
average ratio is 14 to 1. These ratios are much higher than those observed for Two

331

Sisters, Landergin Mesa, and Lundeen (i.e., the average ratio is about 2 to 1). The
latter ratios are more indicative of generalized hunting economies. As noted above,
the variability in hunting strategies among societies of the region are typically
attributed to environmental variability. However, since each of the Middle Ceramic
period sites examined are roughly contemporaneous and are distributed throughout
much of the region, it is proposed that an ecological explanation for the data presented
here is not particularly helpful.

Rather, it is proposed that these results reflect

fundamental differences in the orientation and organization of hunting economies by
the occupants of these sites.

Summary
Case studies that examine the intensification of subsistence economies have
oftentimes focused on horticulture and the role of irrigation in agricultural production.
Given the lack of precise temporal control and the paucity of botanical data, our ability
to document variability in horticultural productivity of the region is currently out of
reach. Nevertheless, evidence for intensification is indicated for other segments of the
economy, namely chipped stone tool production and bison hunting. Even though
chipped stone production and hunting are fundamentally different segments of the
economy, intensification of these two activities was most effectively discussed and
described using the concept of specialization. The results of these analyses indicate
that economic behavior varied considerably from one settlement to another.
Importantly, this variability was discernable through cross-cultural analysis and the
adoption of a comparative approach and enabled human behavior to be measured
along a relative scale.

In this instance, the value of this approach was further

enhanced by holding spatial and temporal parameters among settlements roughly
uniform.
Considering the high frequencies of nonlocal items recovered at the Alibates
Ruins and Odessa Yates, it is suggested that the driving force behind the economic
intensification documented here was to produce a surplus of items for regional and
interregional exchange.

Previous studies of regional exchange have emphasized

relationships that developed between societies of the Southern High Plains and the
eastern Pueblos. Although this research has much to offer to that discussion, the last
section of this chapter examines the organization of exchange among resident

333

communities of the Southern High Plains. In particular, whether trade items present at
settlements of the region were acquired through direct or indirect exchange and how
these items were distributed among communities.

Redistribution on the Southern High Plains: The Emergence of Regional Centers
As noted in Chapter Five, previous research at Middle Ceramic age (A.D.
1250-1500) sites of the Southern High Plains has documented a wide variety of
durable trade items whose sources of origin are the eastern Pueblos of New Mexico.
These items include decorated ceramics, pipes, turquoise, marine shell, obsidian, and
others (e.g., Baker and Baker 2000; Brosowske and Bement 1998; Crabb 1968;
Harrison n.d.; Kreiger 1946; Lintz 1986a, 1991). The presence of these items attests
to the development of exchange between societies of the Plains and Southwest at this
time. However, the ability to demonstrate contact through the documentation of
nonlocal trade items does not by itself result in models of social interaction. The
process of describing exchange involves three interrelated steps: a) identification of
source areas for these items, b) description of the spatial patterning of nonlocal items,
and c) the reconstruction of the organization of exchange (Earle 1982:3-4). The last of
these steps involves the interpretation of data under the guidance of an explanatory
framework.
Previously, steps one and two were examined in Chapters Five and Six.
Combined, these discussions and those presented in the ensuing chapter represent the
final step toward reconstructing the organization of Middle Ceramic period exchange
on the Southern High Plains. Although some aspects of Plains-Southwest trade are

334

briefly considered, the primary emphasis of this study is on interaction and exchange
between resident communities of the Southern High Plains. In particular, this study
relies on the spatial distribution of obsidian artifacts from Middle Ceramic sites, in
relation to their source areas, as a means for understanding the organization of
regional exchange. The data for this investigation is provided by X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analysis of 139 obsidian artifacts from 21 Middle Ceramic period settlements
of the Southern High Plains (see Appendix V; Baugh and Nelson 1987; Bement and
Brosowske 2001; Brosowske 2004; Brosowske and Bement 1997; Lintz 1990;
Mitchell et al. 1980). The results provide information regarding the procurement and
distribution of obsidian, and by extension, other exotic items. Figure 7.10 shows the
location of the settlements used in this analysis.
While nonlocal trade items of southwestern origin are documented at many
settlements of the region, it is readily apparent that there is considerable variation in
the frequency of these items from site to site (see Chapter Six). For instance, even
though Southwest trade goods are documented at many Antelope Creek phase
settlements, it is clear that many more of these items have been recovered at Alibates
Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock Ruin 51 than all of the other sites of the phase combined
(Chapter Six; see also Lintz 1986a, 1991; Studer n.d.). Similarly, Odessa Yates, an
Odessa phase settlement in Beaver County, Oklahoma, also contained much higher
quantities of southwestern exotics than did other related sites (Brosowske and Bement
1997; see Chapter Six and Appendix V).

335

Figure 7.10 Distribution of Settlements Used in Obsidian Study.

Overall, the quantities of Southwest trade items rarely surpass 50 items at most
Middle Ceramic settlements of the region, although 100 to 300 exotics are known
from a handful of sites (Tables 6.1 and 6.7). As such, the several thousand Southwest
exotics documented at Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates
stand in marked contrast to other settlements. The quantities of southwestern trade
items at Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates sites mark these
settlements as likely candidates for regional trade centers that participated in direct
exchange with Puebloan communities. However, given that Alibates Ruin 28 and

336

Chimney Rock Ruin 51 are much closer to the eastern Pueblos than Odessa Yates, it is
possible that exotics found at Odessa Yates were obtained through down-the-line
exchange with the occupants of one or both of these two communities. Assessment of
this hypothesis is examined here through a trace element analysis of obsidian from
these settlements. If Odessa Yates obtained this resource from Alibates Ruin 28 or
Chimney Rock Ruin 51, then it is expected that the obsidian source areas documented
at Odessa Yates should mirror those of these two communities. On the other hand, if
the obsidian source areas at Odessa Yates do not correspond with these communities,
then it is concluded that the inhabitants of this settlement established independent
trade relations with communities of the Southwest.
X-ray fluorescence analysis and the correlation of obsidian with source areas
are both topics that have been thoroughly described elsewhere. As a result, these
topics are not examined here (see Anderson et al. 1986; Nelson 1984, 1985). Rather,
the objective of this discussion is to briefly describe the obsidian samples that were
studied as a part of this investigation and to present the results of XRF analyses. All
trace element analyses were performed under the direction of Steven Shackley at the
Archaeological XRF Laboratory at Berkeley, California.

A total of 45 obsidian

artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28 (N=39) and Chimney Rock Ruin 51 (N=6) were
analyzed as a part of this study. Items from Alibates Ruin 28 were recovered from
rooms 23, 25, and 45, areas 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 16, and 22, and surface contexts. Artifacts
from Chimney Rock Ruin 51 are from areas 1 and 2, the two main areas excavated at
this site. Artifacts sampled included projectile points (N=5), flake debris or shatter
(N=35), bifaces (N=2), and amorphous cores (N=3). Visually, these artifacts represent

337

the full range of obsidian present in these assemblages and include translucent,
opaque, banded, and other varieties. Likewise, a total of 45 obsidian artifacts from
Odessa Yates were also subjected to XRF analysis. This sample contains a similar
range of artifact types and obsidian varieties described above and includes items from
residential structures and surface contexts. Appendix V provides the trace element
information for all of the artifacts used in this analysis.
Table 7.9 provides source provenance information for obsidian artifacts from
Alibates Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock Ruin 51. Except for one flake from Alibates
Ruin 28 that was derived from the El Rechuelos (Polvadera Peak) source in northcentral New Mexico, all of the artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock
Ruin 51 are manufactured from Cerro Toledo Rhyolite obsidian. Primary sources for
this material are the Jemez Mountains and include Obsidian Ridge, Rabbit Mountain,
and Cerro Toledo localities (see Figure 5.2). Since obsidian from each of these
sources are chemically indistinguishable from one another and are ultimately derived
from the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite eruptions, following Baugh and Nelson (1987) the
correct term for these materials is Cerro Toledo Rhyolite (see Shackley 2004). Small
cobbles of Cerro Toledo obsidian are also documented in the alluvium of the Rio
Grande River (Church 2000).
The source provenance for obsidian recovered from Odessa Yates indicates
that these items were derived from source areas in the Jemez Mountains and the
Northwestern Plains (Table 7.9).

Jemez Mountain sources include Cerro Toledo

Rhyolite and Valle Grande (Cerro del Medio) (Figure 5.2). Northwestern Plains
sources include Fish Creek, Wyoming and one unknown source (Figure 5.1). The

338

latter exhibit a chemical composition with high strontium values and indicate that they
were also derived from the Yellowstone region (Shackley personal communication
2003). Lastly, two artifacts were visually identical to obsidian, but XRF analysis
indicates that these items are not obsidian.

These artifacts appear to be some

knappable variety of smoky quartz. A specific source area for this material is not
known at this time.

The results of these XRF analyses allow us to assess the likelihood that
obsidian artifacts present at Odessa Yates were obtained through down-the-line
exchange with Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51 (see Brosowske 2004).
First of all, it is apparent that obsidian artifacts from the Antelope Creek settlements
along the Canadian River were almost entirely produced from Cerro Toledo Rhyolite,
while obsidian from Odessa Yates was derived from multiple sources in New Mexico
and the Northwestern Plains. The absence of Northwestern Plains obsidian at Alibates
Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock Ruin 51 strongly suggests that Northwestern Plains

339

obsidian was not obtained by the occupants of Odessa Yates through down-the-line
exchange with Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51.
Regarding the Jemez Mountain sources, each of the obsidian samples
examined here are dominated by Cerro Toledo obsidian (i.e., Alibates Ruin 28, 97.4%;
Chimney Rock Ruin 51, 100%; Odessa Yates 84.4%). As such, it is entirely possible
that Odessa Yates could have obtained this variety of obsidian through down-the-line
exchange with the occupants of Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51. If this
was the case, however, one would expect that at least some Valle Grande obsidian
would also be represented at one of the Antelope Creek phase settlements. Since XRF
analysis did not document any obsidian from this source, it seems unlikely that the
Cerro Toledo Rhyolite and Valle Grande obsidian from Odessa Yates was obtained
from Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock. In addition, even though the El Rechuelos
source is represented by only a single artifact from Alibates Ruin 28, it is not
documented in the sample from Odessa Yates.
Ideally, the results obtained by these analyses would have been one of the
following: a) all of the obsidian from each of the three study sites was derived from
the same source or b) that all of the obsidian from Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock
Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates was derived from different sources. The explanation of
such results might be relatively straightforward and unambiguous. Nonetheless, the
lack of congruence for obsidian source areas represented at the study sites suggest that
most, if not all, of the obsidian from Odessa Yates was probably not obtained through
down-the-line exchange with either Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51. This
interpretation is further supported by an analysis of a broader range of nonlocal trade

340

items presented in Chapter Six. These items appear to suggest that little direct social
interaction occurred between the occupants of Odessa Yates and large Antelope Creek
phase communities along the Canadian River.

These data include substantial

disparities in the quantity of southwestern ceramics, Alibates silicified dolomite,
Olivella shell beads, Smoky Hill jasper, and decorated cordmarked ceramics.
The above results support the idea that the inhabitants of Alibates Ruin 28,
Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates had each established independent trade
relationships with Puebloan settlements, particularly those in the Santa Fe, Pajarito,
Albuquerque, and Española districts (see Chapter Six). The possibility that each of
these three communities did not obtain Southwest exotics through direct exchange
with the eastern Pueblos, but through some other means, seems unlikely for two
primary reasons. First, there are no settlements that have been identified between the
eastern Pueblos and the study sites that contain significant quantities of the nonlocal
goods. Second, previous research indicates that nomadic groups that could have acted
as intermediaries between Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates
and the Southwest were absent during the Middle Ceramic period. For these reasons,
it is concluded that southwestern exotics items present at these settlements could only
have been obtained through direct trade with the Pueblos.
Overall, the archaeological signature of down-the-line exchange (i.e., goods
fall-off with distance) is not observed among sites of the region. Rather distinct
concentrations of nonlocal trade items occur at Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin
51, and Odessa Yates. In addition, it should be emphasized that while nonlocal goods
do appear to be more common at larger settlements, the fact that other communities of

341

comparable size, occupational history, and sample sizes do not have equivalent
numbers of exotics suggest that the frequency of these items at settlements is not
solely a result of site size or temporal factors. Given the observed trends it is proposed
that each of these communities could have served as regional distribution centers for
obsidian and other southwestern exotics.
Using the same rationale applied above, a preliminary attempt to delineate the
geographic area served by each of these trade centers is explored here. Although it is
not possible to differentiate whether obsidian recovered at sites of the region was
obtained from either Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51 since they are both
dominated by Cerro Toledo Rhyolite, it should be feasible to determine if obsidian
from a given site was obtained through down-the-line exchange (i.e., redistribution)
with either of these two settlements or Odessa Yates. If so, then it is expected that the
obsidian sources represented at other Middle Ceramic sites of the region should
emulate those represented at the trade center where they obtained this resource.
Currently, our ability to assess whether Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin
51, or Odessa Yates served as redistribution centers is limited because so little
obsidian from Middle Ceramic sites of the region have been subjected to XRF
analysis. In fact, prior to 1998, of the thousands of obsidian artifacts known for the
region (see Baugh 1982; Lintz 1986a, 1991; Spielmann 1982), only 11 items from four
Middle Ceramic sites of the Southern High Plains had been subjected to source
analysis (i.e., Tarbox Ruin, McGarraugh Ranch, Skull Springs, and Landergin Mesa;
see Baugh and Nelson 1987; Lintz 1990; Mitchell et al. 1980). Despite additional
studies conducted by the author, sample sizes still remain small for most sites.

342

Nonetheless, they still enable some tentative statements regarding the potential role of
these settlements as trade centers. Tables 7.10 and 7.11 present the results of trace
element analyses for 49 obsidian artifacts from 18 Middle Ceramic age sites in the
Texas and Oklahoma panhandles (Figure 7.10).

Even though source provenance data for obsidian from Antelope Creek sites
still remain meager, it is apparent that significant variation in the obsidian source areas
are represented at sites in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles (Table 7.10). All of
the obsidian from sites in the Canadian River valley of the Texas panhandle are
derived from Cerro Toledo source areas. The dominance of this obsidian source at
these settlements is essentially identical to what is observed at Alibates Ruin 28 and
Chimney Rock Ruin 51. As such, considering that thousands of obsidian artifacts
have been recovered at Alibates Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock Ruin 51, it is proposed
that the obsidian present at these smaller settlements were derived through contact
with one of these two settlements.
In contrast, Antelope Creek phase sites along Beaver River in the Oklahoma
panhandle display a variety of sources from both New Mexico and the Northwestern

343

Plains (Table 7.10).

The New Mexico sources include Cerro Toledo and Valle

Grande. Northwestern Plains obsidian is documented at both Roy Smith and Stamper
and includes Obsidian Cliff, Wyoming and Owyhee, Idaho. Excluding Cerro Toledo
Rhyolite, the remaining sources are not represented at either Alibates Ruin 28 or
Chimney Rock Ruin 51. This suggests that these two settlements were not the source
for obsidian recovered at Roy Smith or Stamper. Although Obsidian Cliff, Wyoming
and Owyhee, Idaho sources are not specifically documented at Odessa Yates, the
combination of Cerro Toledo, Valle Grande, and Northwestern Plains sources mirrors
the patterns presented earlier for this large Odessa phase settlement. As a result, it
seems more likely that these materials were obtained from Odessa Yates or elsewhere
rather than the more distant Antelope Creek phase communities along the Canadian
River.
Combined, the source provenance information for 30 artifacts from eight
Odessa phase and six unaffiliated settlements present very similar trends (Table 7.11).
Obsidian from Cerro Toledo and Valle Grande sources in the Jemez Mountains and
the Malad, Idaho source are documented at these sites. As a whole, the source areas
documented at these sites appear most similar to what is observed at Odessa Yates
than either Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51. Therefore, although it is
certainly possible that some of the sites containing only Cerro Toledo Rhyolite could
have received these items from Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock Ruin 51, given the
spatial proximity of Odessa Yates to these sites, it seems more plausible that the
obsidian recovered at these settlements was obtained from this settlement or
elsewhere.

Summary
This analysis has concentrated on the spatial distribution of obsidian as a
means for reconstructing the structure of Middle Ceramic period exchange networks
on the Southern High Plains. Although it is recognized that this investigation is
limited at times by inadequacies in the available data sets (i.e., primarily sample sizes),
dealing with a class of artifacts for which precise elemental signatures can be
determined enables these items to be traced across the social landscape. The first step
in this research was to identify the spatial distribution of obsidian at settlements of the
region (Chapter Six). From a regional perspective, it was obvious that the settlements
of Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates contained much
higher frequencies of this resource than any other settlements of the region. Based on
this distribution it was hypothesized that these communities served as regional trade
centers.

345

Given the geographic proximity of each of these communities to obsidian
sources in New Mexico, however, it was possible that Odessa Yates may have
obtained obsidian through exchange with either Alibates Ruin 28 or Chimney Rock
Ruin 51. This idea was examined through a trace element analysis of 90 obsidian
artifacts from these three settlements. The lack of congruence of obsidian sources
documented suggests that it was unlikely that Odessa Yates obtained obsidian through
down-the-line exchange networks with either of these two large Antelope Creek
settlements along the Canadian River.
In turn, the proposition that each of these three sites may have acted as regional
distribution centers was tentatively supported by XRF source analysis results for 49
artifacts from 18 Middle Ceramic settlements.

The results seem to indicate that

Alibates Ruin 28 and Chimney Rock Ruin 51 supplied obsidian to other settlements of
the Canadian River valley. While it is certainly possible that these centers also traded
some obsidian to sites within the Beaver River drainage system, given their location
and the obsidian sources represented, it seems more plausible that they received this
resource through contact with the occupants of Odessa Yates or elsewhere. The
presence of cordmarked ceramics with decorated rims and higher frequencies of
Smoky Hill jasper at Antelope Creek sites in this area supports the idea of contact with
the community of Odessa Yates (see Schneider 1969; Watson 1950).
Given the distances involved in traveling to the eastern Pueblos (i.e., between
300 and 500 km to the nearest Pueblos from each of these settlements), the number of
people that likely comprised trading parties, the food required to feed the trading party
to and from distant communities, and the ability for home settlements to remain

346

economically viable while the expedition was gone, it is likely that only those
communities in the region that were socially, economically, and politically the most
complex could have organized and conducted such activities. Thus, it is not surprising
that only some of the largest communities in the region contain evidence for
participation in these expeditions.
Lastly, it may be noted that the terms distribution center and redistribution
center were used interchangeably here when referring to the communities of Alibates
Ruins, Chimney Rock 51, and Odessa Yates. This is not to suggest that these terms
are synonymous, for indeed entirely different social, economic, and political
arrangements characterize these two types of settlements. Rather, the problem lies in
determining which of these two terms is most appropriate for describing these
settlements.

Of particular importance to this issue is the character of social

relationships between these and other outlying settlements of the region. An analysis
of obsidian source areas represented at these and other outlying settlements certainly
seems to indicate that items obtained from the eastern Pueblos passed through these
regional centers to other settlements. As such, the description of these settlements as
either distribution or redistribution centers each has some merit. However, our ability
to discern whether true hierarchical relationships characterized social systems at this
time is limited by the data currently available.

Conclusions
An overriding point of interest in this study has been why exotic trade items
are disproportionately represented at the Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and

347

Odessa Yates compared to other settlements of the region. In preceding chapters
many of the traditional explanations used by existing models to explain exchange
relationships between societies of the Southern Plains and Southwest were explored
(e.g., Lintz 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983).

These frameworks, however, were

inadequate for explaining the patterns observed. For example, spatial and temporal
factors, such as climate change or environmental variability, do not appear responsible
for the discrepancies observed among settlements. Other potential explanations, such
as disparities in settlement size, length of occupation, and proximity to exotic source
areas were also examined, but they also held little power for explaining these
differences.
Since the above explanations provided little assistance for understanding the
dramatic differences in the distribution and frequency of exotics at Middle Ceramic
settlements alternative explanations were explored.

Theoretically speaking, an

economic perspective was immediately attractive because of its long association with
studies of exchange. In these studies exchange is envisioned as embedded in the
larger social realm and exchange data is often used for understanding the evolution of
human societies. Emphasis on the economy has directed this research to explore
topics which previously have attracted little attention from researchers of the region.
It is clear that this path has uncovered many significant correlations between
communities, economies, and involvement in exchange. Although this chapter has
covered a great deal of ground and a seemingly wide array of subjects, it should be
apparent that all of these topics are closely related and represent steps toward
economic intensification and emerging social complexity.

Examined from a historical perspective, the Early to Middle Ceramic transition
on the Southern High Plains represented a period of intense social change. Although
the timing and specific nature of these developments are poorly understood at present,
key changes included increasing regional population size and density, decreases in
settlement mobility, a reliance on food storage, changes in architecture and bone,
chipped stone, and ceramic technologies, and at times, shifts in settlement size and
location. In combination, it is obvious that these general trends have been played out
many times the world over and are often linked to the emergence or expansion of food
production. Among Odessa phase populations this certainly seems to be the case.
Although current subsistence data are fairly poor for Antelope Creek phase, these
societies appear to have practiced a subsistence economy based largely on foraging
supplemented by cultivation. Nonetheless, these societies also embody many of the
developments noted above. Thus, while changes in regional subsistence economies
were undoubtedly important to some extent, it does not seem to be the primary
stimulus leading to these changes. A more significant factor, however, seems to have
been increasing competition over crucial resources which were highly variable in
distribution and abundance.
Currently, available data indicates that the Southern High Plains was sparsely
inhabited by small groups of mobile foragers during the Early Ceramic period.
Although subsistence related data reflect a reliance on seasonally available plants and
animals, recent studies indicates that horticulture was not unknown to these societies
(Carmichael 2004).

Even though regional populations were low and seem to have

349

been dispersed at this time, evidence for violent conflict suggests that competition
over key resources was a recurrent problem (Boyd 1997; Wilkens and Boyd 2000).
With the striking increases in population that mark the region with the onset of
the Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 1250) it is not surprising that evidence for hostilities
also rose dramatically. In fact, Brooks (1994b:320) interprets the available data as
indicative of “moderate to large-scale conflict”.

It is proposed that increasing

intersocietal competition over important resources was at least initially a major factor
that led to heightened conflict at this time. Evidence for increased competition over
resources also resulted in the claiming of resources by resident societies and insured
access to crucial resources as populations rose. Although the emergence of property
rights in the context of increasing population is somewhat intuitive, the fact that the
first permanent settlements also make their appearance at this time is perfectly logical.
These settlements were placed adjacent to these resources and represented visible
claims to important resources by both horticulturalists and foragers. In some cases,
the placement of some communities in elevated locations appears to suggest selection
of these settings for defensive reasons, however, settlement in these locations could
also have served as visible markers of ownership.
Although difficult to demonstrate, it is likely that once some communities
began to lay claim to important resources through the establishment of permanent
settlements that others by necessity followed suit. From this perspective, it is easy to
envision the development of land tenure systems as coinciding with the appearance of
the first horticulturally based settlements in the region. Since sedentary communities
are represented throughout the Southern High Plains, it is assumed that this

350

development occurred on a region wide scale.

Therefore, even though the

establishment of permanent settlements and exclusive rights to resources was probably
widespread, these developments are perhaps most apparent by the examples
highlighted here: Antelope Creek communities near the Alibates quarries and the
proximity of large Odessa phase villages to arable land. Both of these examples
represent landed resources that were predictable, concentrated, limited in distribution,
and were highly valued.

As such, it is not surprising that they were subject to

exclusive rights of use and access. These two cases are of interest because even
though they represent fundamentally different types of resources, they are also types
of resources whose production can be intensified.
If some communities were heavily involved in intersocietal exchange, then it is
logical that they must be producing a surplus of some resource for export. In the two
cases examined here, the Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates, chipped stone tools and
horticultural products would seem to be the most obvious choices for surplus
production. Although much work remains to be done, it is clear that many of the
households near the Alibates quarries were producing chipped stone implements far
above and beyond normal consumption needs.

Intensive quarrying, concentrated

production at Alibates Ruin, standardized reduction techniques combined with the
widespread distribution of finished Alibates items at contemporaneous settlements
throughout the region further supports the hypothesis of intensified production by parttime craft specialists.
Arguably, besides Alibates silicified dolomite there are really no other obvious
natural resources available in the region, such as clay, shell, salt, crystals or other

351

types of tool stone, that readily apply themselves to claims of exclusive rights of
access, intensified production, and exchange (i.e., are naturally abundant, predictable
and limited in distribution, of high cultural value, etc.). As noted above, arable land is
one possible exception to this claim, however, given the problems associated with
current data sets, our ability to distinguish between differing levels of horticultural
production is limited. Therefore, while a surplus of cultivated foods certainly could
have been produced at Odessa Yates and other large Odessa phase settlements, an
examination of the material assemblage from the community of Odessa Yates
indicated another resource amenable to intensified production: bison products.
A comparative analysis of the faunal remains from several sites of the region
indicates that the occupants of Odessa Yates developed a hunting economy that was
organized similar to those of Protohistoric period societies. The latter are known
ethnohistorically to have produced a surplus of bison products for exchange. The
assemblage of Odessa Yates was quite aberrant compared to those from other Middle
Ceramic age settlements and indicates that a limited variety of faunal species were
exploited, of which, bison were far and away the dominant resource. It is suggested
that the hunting economy of Odessa Yates is best described as a specialist system.
The faunal assemblage from Courson D (41OC29), a settlement at the Buried
City locality, was not included in this analysis, but provides additional support for
intensified bison procurement at Odessa Yates.

Although the analysis of faunal

materials from this site is not entirely complete, it represents an ideal case study for
comparison with Odessa Yates because: a) both of these sites represent portions of
similarly sized Odessa phase extended villages, b) both settlements are

352

contemporaneous (A.D. 1250-1500), c) both of the economies are horticulturally
based, d) in both instances bison kills occurred close to settlements, and e) these
villages are only separated by approximately 42 km. While the assemblage from
Odessa Yates indicates intensified bison procurement, the faunal assemblage from
Courson D is quite different and indicates a generalized hunting economy more
similar to that documented at Two Sisters or Landergin Mesa. Here, the ratio of bison
to deer/antelope is approximately 3:1. The abundance of small mammals and aquatic
resources, particularly fish, is similar to that observed at Lundeen. Considering the
marked cultural similarities between Odessa Yates and Courson D, why are there such
dramatic differences in the hunting economies of these two settlements? I would
suggest that these differences relate to the extent of their involvement in long-distance
exchange with the eastern Pueblos. This proposition seems to be supported by the
quantities of southwestern exotics recovered from each of these villages.
While the exchange of food items is typically quite difficult to demonstrate
archaeologically, the idea that the community of Odessa Yates was involved in
intensified production of bison products for exchange is logical for the following
reason. The primary source of exotic prestige items on the Southern High Plains are
the eastern Pueblos (i.e., obsidian, marine shell, turquoise, decorated ceramics, etc.).
Since these societies are known to have been intensive horticulturalists it seems
improbable that Odessa Yates could have been exporting cultivated foods, such as
corn, to these groups. In addition, as mentioned elsewhere, in the absence of transport
systems capable of moving bulk staple foods, it also is unlikely that horticultural

353

products could have been efficiently transported over the 450 km that separates
Odessa Yates from the eastern Pueblos.

The idea that societies of the Southern High Plains were exporting bison hides
to southwestern communities is not a new development and has been previously
proposed by numerous researchers (see T. Baugh 1982, 1986; Creel 1991; HabichtMauche 1992, 2002; Hofman 1984, 1989b; Spielmann 1982, 1983).

The exact

reasons underlying the demand for bison hides and meat by southwestern
communities, however, has attracted little systematic research (see Spielmann 1982).
As noted earlier, ethnohistoric accounts document the existence of specialized bison

354

hunters on the Southern High Plains by A.D. 1540 (see Bolton 1949; Hammond and
Rey 1940). Minimally, this suggests that the need for bison products at the Pueblos
could have been present as early as the Middle Ceramic.
Recently, LeBlanc (1999) has proposed that a dramatic increase in the need for
bison hides in the Southwest occurred following A.D. 1300 (see also Creel 1991).
This increase in demand is attributed to the need for durable shields used in warfare
following the appearance of sinew backed recurved bows.

These shields were

produced from the hump portion of bison hides (i.e., the toughest portion of the hide).
Generally, the hump portion of one or two hides provided only enough material to
produce a single shield (LeBlanc 1999). If indeed every male of fighting age in the
Southwest required at least one shield, one can imagine that consumption rates of
bison hides may have doubled or even tripled at this time. It is likely that this increase
in demand provided more than enough incentive for some Plains societies to intensify
bison procurement and hide production for exchange.
Although the exact character of products obtained from Plains societies still
remains largely unexplored, the available data suggests that bison hides, sinew, robes,
and possibly, dried meat, were the most likely items produced for export. Whatever
the case may be it is apparent that there was a substantial increase in interaction and
exchange between the two regions beginning during the Middle Ceramic period.
Given the distances involved and the logistics associated with long-distance exchange,
it is likely that very few communities of the Southern High Plains were capable of
organizing and conducting trading expeditions to the Southwest. Of all of the Middle
Ceramic settlements known, the high frequencies of southwestern exotics recovered at

355

the Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates suggest that these three
communities were involved in direct exchange with the eastern Pueblos. Although
little information is currently available concerning Chimney Rock Ruin 51, all of the
data examined here from the Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates support this
proposition.
Considering that the communities mentioned here are not particularly unique
in terms of their size or other aspects, it is intriguing that Alibates Ruins, Chimney
Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates intensified economic production to produce a surplus
of items for interregional exchange while other communities did not. The examples
provided here suggest that multiple strategies for producing a surplus of products for
exchange existed. For instance, the Alibates Ruins manufactured an abundance of
chipped stone implements and Odessa Yates produced bison products. Unfortunately,
the economic system of the Chimney Rock Ruin 51 is not known, but could provide a
third strategy. While there are no indications which suggest that other similarly sized
settlements of the region were not equally capable of incorporating these strategies to
intensify production, the question remains why communities, such as Buried City,
Coetas Creek, and settlements along Antelope Creek, did not.
If indeed the Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates were
the primary communities in the region involved in direct contact and exchange with
Southwest, it is very likely that these societies occupied positions of considerable
sociopolitical power.

From a regional standpoint, it is probable that these

communities were already considered quite powerful due to their large size and their
ability to produce a surplus of food and utilitarian items. However, their ability to

356

establish and maintain ties with distant and largely unknown settlements almost
certainly increased the regional standing of leaders in these communities to a different
realm.
The final chapter of this study examines the potential role that local leaders
could have played in the patterns highlighted here. It is proposed that enterprising
leaders emerged at Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates and
encouraged intensified economic production to produce a surplus for intersocietal
exchange. Although similar leaders were undoubtedly present at other settlements, it
is proposed that important differences in the aspirations of leaders existed.
Considering that the Southern High Plains is marked by significant environmental
uncertainly from year to year and season to season, it is likely that the surplus
production revolved around basic food items which were used to establish debts
among neighboring communities that could be called upon during subsequent times of
need. While such strategies likely characterized most settlements of the region and
certainly required leadership, I think the crucial turning point in social systems
occurred when particularly ambitious leaders expanded their attention from the
subsistence to the political realm of the economy. This transition coincided with the
development of interaction and exchange with distant communities.

357

CHAPTER EIGHT
Alternative Roles of Exchange in Small-Scale Societies

Using the Middle Ceramic period of the Southern High Plains as a case study,
the preceding chapters have presented a wide array of information surrounding the
development and florescence of exchange. Although quite extensive in scope, this
information provides the contextual foundation needed for understanding the various
roles that exchange played in these societies. For numerous reasons, however, given
that exchange is an activity that can have social, economic, and political components,
an attempt to model its development through time is certainly a daunting, if not
presumptuous, task. Thus, while it may be tempting to divorce exchange from the
larger social context to isolate a specific function, such a strategy can diminish
exchange to something much less than it actually was. With these cautions in mind, a
general framework which seeks to explain the changing role of exchange in small, kinbased societies is presented. While never entirely separate or unrelated, the evolution
of exchange in this study is interpreted as reflecting a shift in emphasis from concerns
that are primarily subsistence related to those associated with the political side of life
(see Bohannan 1955; Earle 1994, 2002).

Correlations between Types of Exchange and the Social Scale
Generally, the types of nonlocal objects recovered at settlements, the distances
at which they were procured, and their context within sites provide the primary
evidence for interpreting the meaning of exchange (see Earle 1982). As described in

358

Chapter Two, nonlocal items obtained through exchange are traditionally seen as
related to one of two broad realms, the subsistence or political (e.g., Bohannan 1955;
Earle 1994, 2002; Friedman and Rowlands 1978).

The exchange of food, raw

materials, and tools are typically attributed to the subsistence economy and are seen as
strategies to buffer against economic shortfalls, even out resource distributions, and
maintain access to neighboring territories (Braun and Plog 1982; Cobb 1993; Earle
1994). On the other hand, the transfer of nonutilitarian objects manufactured from
shell, copper, galena, special stone, mica, and other exotics are frequently interpreted
as status, wealth, or prestige objects and are linked to political activities (Earle
1994:427; Friedman and Rowlands 1978). These items may be obtained from distant
settlements, time intensive to produce, and at times, convey socio-religious or
ideological meanings.
Unfortunately, the meaning of exchange can be more problematic to interpret
in some instances than others. The primary reason for this is that the nature of
exchange can vary considerably depending on the social scale of the societies
involved. For example, attributing the exchange of utilitarian items between familylevel groups to the subsistence realm or associating the transfer of exotics between
regional polities with the political realm is fairly straightforward (see Chapter Two).
These two examples illustrate well the strong correlation that generally exists between
social scale and various types of exchange. For obvious reasons, however, exchange
among societies that span the evolutionary continuum between family-level groups
and regional polities can be much more difficult to infer. This point is particularly
germane for cases in the prehistoric record, including the present study.

359

Settlements documented for the region vary considerably from relatively
isolated, single family residences to larger extended villages containing 100 to perhaps
250 people. To encompass the full range of social variability present in the area the
term small-scale society has been used to describe these kin-based groups. It is
apparent, however, that much of this study has been concerned with the largest
settlements of the region, such as Alibates Ruin, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, Odessa
Yates, and Buried City. Judging from their size, degree of permanence, and nature of
subsistence economies, these sedentary settlements are analogous to the local groups
described earlier in Chapter Two (see Johnson and Earle 2000). The terms tribal,
nonstratified, middle-range, nonhierarchical, or transegalitarian have been used by
others to describe similar types of societies found elsewhere (see Bender 1985; Cobb
1993, 2000; Dalton 1977; Feinman and Neitzel 1994; Hayden 1995, 1998; Mills 2000;
Plog and Upham 1983; Upham 1990).
As Chapter Six has related, some of these communities contain high
frequencies of nonlocal items, while others do not. Importantly, those settlements
with large quantities of nonlocal objects also exhibit unmistakable signs of emergent
social complexity (see Chapter Seven), yet they also lack many of the traits
traditionally linked to institutionalized social inequality, namely monumental
architecture and concentrations of wealth associated with certain burials or
households.

The absence of clear markers of status differentiation among these

societies is not entirely surprising, however, since the ethnographic and archaeological
records are replete with examples which demonstrate that social inequality is
frequently manifested along a number of other dimensions in nonhierarchical societies

360

(Arnold 1996, 2000; Bender 1985; Cobb 1993, 2000; Dalton 1977; Feinman and
Neitzel 1994; Godelier 1982; Hayden 1995, 1998; Malinowski 1984; Mauss 1967;
McGuire and Saitta 1995; Mills 2000; Moore 1993; Muller 1997; Peregrine 1992;
Plop and Upham 1983; Rappaport 1967; Sahlins 1963, 1968, 1972; Saitta 1994;
Service 1966, 1971; Strathern 1973; Upham 1990).
Numerous studies demonstrate that wealth items or primitive valuables used to
create and validate status first make their appearance among societies at this scale
(Dalton 1977; Earle 1994:428-429; Johnson and Earle 2000:136).

In contrast to

traditional views of social inequality, the ethnographic record indicates that an inverse
relationship often exists between wealth and power in these societies (Barnes 1988;
Dalton 1977; Godelier 1977, 1982; Mann 1986; Meillassoux 1981; Sahlins 1958,
1963, 1972; Trigger 1990:135-136).

Indeed, that “individuals may be forced to

distribute worldly goods rather than to accumulate them” to build prestige and status
in these societies has long been recognized (Cobb 1993:51-52).

Therefore,

considering that many of the most obvious signs of inequality may be absent in
middle-range societies, a key question is how are social distinctions between
individuals, interest groups, or communities identified? Although multiple approaches
are available, this study has adopted a regional perspective involving intercommunity
analyses along a number of interrelated topics and scales.
This study has documented nonlocal items, which given that they occur at
sedentary settlements and originate from sources greater than 100 km away, are
concluded to have been obtained through intersocietal exchange. Most frequently
these objects include raw materials, utilitarian tools, decorated ceramics, pipes,

361

jewelry, and other various exotics. While frameworks for describing exchange among
egalitarian or hierarchical societies are well established, coherent theoretical
explanations are not well developed for the types of societies examined in this study.
In particular, items that have characteristics of both the subsistence and political
realms are particularly difficult to interpret since clear markers of social inequality are
absent. On the other hand, the social and economic patterns observed among groups
in this study also indicate that these societies were not strongly egalitarian either.
Here, an interpretation of Middle Ceramic period exchange for the Southern High
Plains is presented. The assignment of exchange items to either the subsistence or
political segments of society are based primarily on the function and use contexts of
objects and the distance that items were procured.

Other objects which display

characteristics of both realms are also identified. The latter include utilitarian tools
produced from high-quality materials that were derived from sources approximately
300 km away.

These items are assessed using other contextual information and

examples provided by the ethnographic record.

Exchange and the Subsistence Economy
The initial development of widespread exchange on the Southern High Plains
coincided with the onset of the Middle Ceramic period.

Earlier chapters have

demonstrated that the extent of cultural change coinciding with this development was
extensive and far-reaching. These changes impacted virtually all areas of life and
included a shift to a reliance on horticulture or intensive foraging and long-term
storage, substantial reductions in residential mobility, the appearance of permanent

362

settlements, increases in regional population density, modifications in chipped stone,
ceramic, and bone technologies, the claiming of crucial resources, and in some cases,
the aggregation of population and specialized production.

Together, these traits

represent the earliest manifestation of the Plains Village tradition in the region
(Lehmer 1971). Given the extensive nature of these changes and the apparent rapidity
at which they spread, it is difficult to envision these developments as occurring
without the intrusion of at least one social group from outside the region.
Considering the intensive cultural change documented at this time, there are a
large number factors which potentially could have led to the intensification of
intersocietal exchange. From an ecological perspective, increasing population and a
transition to a sedentary horticultural lifestyle are frequently seen as primary factors
leading to numerous developments, including exchange. From this view, exchange is
often visualized as a strategy to offset periodic economic shortfalls and to maintain
access to crucial resources (Braun 1986; Earle 1994; Johnson and Earle 2000;
Spielmann 1982). Depending on the scale of societies involved such exchange can
vary from reciprocal exchange of food and raw materials among family groups of
foragers to redistributive networks among complex regional polities (Earle 1994;
Johnson and Earle 2000).

The latter, often seen as a strategy to even out

environmental disparities, required the existence of a central authority and often
resulted in considerable economic interdependence among participants (see Earle
1977; Sahlins 1958; Service 1962).
Traditionally, the Southern High Plains has been viewed as marginal for
horticulture, and during some periods, even foraging (e.g., the middle Holocene). As

363

such, it is not surprising that many previous studies have envisioned the environment
as a major force that essentially dictated the structure of resident subsistence
economies. Until recently, however, there has been little to no data collected from
which to evaluate the economic productivity of regional farming and foraging
systems. As described in Chapter Three, the distribution and abundance of important
resources on the Southern High Plains can vary considerably across both space and
time.

Rainfall is seen as deficient throughout much of the region and resource

conditions are in many ways linked to the amount of precipitation areas within the
region receive. Annual precipitation varies from about 585 mm (23 in.) along the
Eastern margins of the study area to about 430 mm (17 in.) in the west.
To some extent, precipitation rates across the region do seem to have
constrained what types of subsistence strategies were economically feasible. Better
watered areas with annual rainfall rates that surpass 490 mm (19 in) were occupied by
societies in which horticultural products represented a major component of the diet
(i.e., Odessa phase).

Although important, rainfall was not the sole factor that

constrained horticultural systems. Soils with high fertility rates and high moisture
holding capabilities also appear to have been necessary for successful cultivation.
Elsewhere, areas receiving less than 490 mm of precipitation and containing
extensively drained sandy soils appear to have been prohibitive to farming. These
areas appear to have been occupied by groups that were primarily broad-spectrum
foragers (i.e., Antelope Creek phase).

The recovery of cultivated plants and

horticultural implements at some sites, however, do suggest that some farming was
also practiced by these groups.

364

In cases where the productivity of food resources may have fluctuated
considerably from year to year or season to season, ecological models have often been
proposed for explaining for the development of exchange among prehistoric Plains
societies (e.g., Blakeslee 1975; Lintz 1986a, 1991; Spielmann 1982, 1983). Under
these conditions the establishment and maintenance of reciprocal trade relationships
over broad areas are frequently hypothesized to have been important strategies to
combat economic shortfalls. Although such relationships may have developed in the
study area, considering the constraints imposed by local transport systems and the
prohibitive costs of moving staple products over long distances (Earle 1994:422), a
threshold must have existed where it was not feasible to trade for food with
communities located more than a certain distance away. Although this actual distance
is not known, it might be expected that it was not very great, possibly less than 20 or
30 km. It should also be stressed that while lower than average harvests must have
occurred from time to time, there is nothing to indicate that subsistence economies
were not well adapted to local climatic and environmental regimes. In addition, while
periodic shortages could probably be expected at times, it seems unlikely that
permanent settlements, especially large villages, would have been established and
occupied for any length of time if basic subsistence yields were not consistently met in
most years (see Chapter Four).
While each of the above points suggests that it is unlikely any real economic
interdependence based on food existed among widely dispersed settlements, it is
possible that some degree of interdependence may have developed within or among
closely spaced communities of the region (see Duffield 1970:254). For this to occur

365

one might expect family groups to have worked cooperatively with each emphasizing
or specializing in particular components of the economy.

Nevertheless, the data

needed to explore the idea that mutualistic networks may have existed among some
local communities, such as those near the Alibates quarries, is currently not available.
The costs of transporting raw materials and technology are generally much less
than those associated with staple foods (see examples in Baugh and Ericson 1994).
This is aptly demonstrated by the vast distances that utilitarian items were transported
in the study area during the Middle Ceramic period. This trend stands in marked
contrast to the preceding Early Ceramic period (A.D. 500-1200) where assemblages
reflect an emphasis on locally available raw materials for the production of tools. This
pattern is most apparent in chipped stone tools. Although variable, local quartzites
and cherts from the Ogallala Formation were the primary tool stone used for the
production of chipped stone implements for most of the region during the Early
Ceramic period.

This pattern was modified in the Canadian River valley where

Alibates silicified dolomite from both primary and secondary sources was used
alongside local quartzites and cherts. Overall, these trends of tool stone use persisted
throughout the Archaic and Early Ceramic periods (i.e., 6000 B.C. to A.D. 1200).
Around A.D. 1250 Middle Ceramic societies greatly reduced their reliance on locally
available tool stone in favor of high quality nonlocal materials. Although the reasons
underlying this development are not self evident, the most obvious explanation would
be that specialized tool forms that made their appearance at this time required
production using high quality stone. As we shall see, however, even this explanation
is problematic.

366

As many have noted, the abundance and quality of lithic raw materials factor
prevalently into the organization of stone tool technology (e.g., Andrefsky 1994; see
Bamforth 1986, 1990; Kelly 1988; Parry and Kelly 1987). When high-quality tool
stone occurs in low abundance it is often the preferred material to produce formal tool
designs. In contexts where only poor-quality material is available informal tools tend
to predominate. Typically, formal curated tools manufactured from high-quality stone
are usually associated with mobile foragers, while informal or expedient tools
produced from poorer quality materials are thought to characterize sedentary systems
(Henry 1989; Kelly and Todd 1988; Parry and Kelly 1987). In contrast to earlier
studies, Andrefsky (1994) has argued that levels of residential mobility or sedentism
had little effect on the organization and design of chipped stone tools.
To briefly summarize general trends for chipped stone economies of the study
area, Early Ceramic assemblages of the Southern High Plains are marked by few
formal tools and the use of poor-quality materials of local origin. In contrast, the onset
of the Middle Ceramic coincides with the appearance of several specialized tool forms
which were almost always produced from high-quality tool stone. Logically, one
might conclude that since the geological distribution and quality of tool stone in the
region did not change through time that the dramatic changes observed in raw material
use (i.e., a shift from poor to high quality) and an increased emphasis on formal tool
designs were related to a shift toward decreasing residential mobility. If so, given the
prevailing thoughts regarding the organization of technology among mobile and
sedentary societies, then the trends observed here are essentially the opposite of what
many researchers have noted for other areas (compare Andrefsky 1994:27-28, 30-31).

367

So why did many Middle Ceramic societies of the Southern High Plains elect to use
nonlocal high-quality tool stone when suitable, but poorer quality material, was locally
available? What had changed? Overall, the solutions to these questions are complex
and likely varied among societies of the region (i.e., Antelope Creek and Odessa
phases). Nevertheless, they are key for understanding several aspects of exchange.
Given the large quantities of subsistence items obtained through exchange
during the Middle Ceramic period and the vast distances at which these objects were
procured, the research area certainly presents a unique case study. Faced with these
trends, it should not be surprising that it is difficult to determine at what procurement
distance objects should be considered nonlocal or exotic. While it is apparent that
classes of utilitarian goods, especially Alibates tools, were regularly traded at
distances up to 150 km, whether these items were obtained through direct or indirect
exchange has obvious implications for understanding the organization of exchange.
In the ensuing discussion the acquisition of raw materials and utilitarian
objects associated with the subsistence side of the economy is examined. Of these
items, information regarding the distribution and frequency of nonlocal tool stone
among settlements of the region are by far most abundant and are summarized here.
These data are examined separately for Antelope Creek and Odessa phase
communities and highlight contrasting archaeological signatures associated with
down-the-line exchange systems and items procured through direct, long-distance
trading expeditions.
Despite current limitations of existing data sets, the ubiquitous presence of
Alibates tools at settlements throughout the region suggests that these items moved

368

steadily through a series of direct and down-the-line reciprocal exchange transactions
(see Chapter Six for quantities of Alibates at various sites of the region). In fact, it
may be possible to discern a pattern of fall-off with distance from the Alibates quarries
for these items. For example, the quantity of Alibates in assemblages near source
areas in the Canadian River valley average between 95% and 100%. Frequencies at
Antelope Creek settlements 125 km north in the Oklahoma panhandle and the Buried
City locality 110 km to the northeast drop to between 80% and 90%. These high
frequencies seem to indicate direct exchange with inhabitants at the quarries.
Alibates comprises only 50% to 70% of assemblages at other Odessa phase
settlements 150 km to the northeast in the Oklahoma panhandle and beyond (e.g.,
Odessa Yates, Lonker, and Lundeen). These lower frequencies suggest that Alibates
at these settlements was obtained through down-the-line exchange rather than direct
trade with settlements near the quarries. Other trade items also suggest there was little
direct interaction between Antelope Creek settlements near the Alibates quarries and
these Odessa phase communities (Chapters Six and Seven). Alibates is abundant at
Antelope Creek settlements, such as Stamper, Two Sisters, Casto-Nash, to the west
and represent likely sources for this material. Considering the apparent shortages of
chipped stone observed at the Buried City locality (Brosowske et al. 2003; Hughes and
Hughes-Jones 1987:103), it is unlikely that Alibates was obtained from this
settlement.
Currently, temporal data from the region are insufficient for a precise
understanding of the development of Alibates production and exchange. Nonetheless,
the moderate to high frequencies of Alibates at settlements over 100 km from the

369

quarries certainly demonstrates that the mining, production, and exchange of this tool
stone by Antelope Creek groups was well established by the end of the thirteenth
century. Previously, Lintz (1986a) has suggested that the relatively low frequencies of
this tool stone at the Roy Smith site (61%), the easternmost Antelope Creek site
known in the Oklahoma panhandle, may indicate that the mining, production, and
exchange of Alibates by groups near the quarries had not yet begun. This site has
yielded multiple calibrated dates that range from about A.D. 1275 to 1300 (Chapter
Four). However, the quantity of Alibates at this multi-family settlement is comparable
to that of other nearby, and apparently contemporaneous, Odessa phase sites in Beaver
County, Oklahoma. As such, these relatively low frequencies may also reflect fall-off
associated with down-the-line exchange.
As noted recently in Chapter Seven, formal tools present in Middle Ceramic
assemblages included alternately beveled diamond shaped knives, small triangular
projectile points, distal endscrapers, and drills. Of these tools, it is almost certain that
high quality tool stone was necessary for the production of the large ovate bifaces,
which through use and resharpening became alternately beveled knives (i.e., Harahey
knives). The same limitations or constraints, however, do not apply for the other
formal tools present, yet they were still produced from nonlocal tool stone. Why was
local material not used to manufacture these items?
These observations are particularly noteworthy when one considers the
shortages of lithic materials that seem to have characterized some Odessa phase
settlements (Brosowske et al. 2003; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:103). These
communities are about 110-150 km from the nearest source of high quality tool stone.

370

If these societies were indeed plagued by shortages of chipped stone materials,
logically one would expect that they would make greater use of local materials. This
strategy, however, is not represented at these sites. Instead, while these societies did
rely heavily on Alibates (i.e., about 50% to 70% of all chipped stone is this material),
they also established and participated in long-distance exchange to obtain either
Smoky Hill jasper from northwestern Kansas or Gray Permian cherts from southcentral Kansas. The nearest sources for these high-quality materials are both about
250 km to 300 km away (Figure 5.1).
The frequency of Smoky Hill and Gray Permian cherts varies considerably
among Odessa phase settlements. For instance, although never absent from any sites,
Smoky Hill jasper is most abundant at communities in Beaver County, Oklahoma, and
Meade County, Kansas (i.e., comprising 20% to 35% of chipped stone assemblages).
Likewise, although not completely quantified at this time, Gray Permian cherts are
most common at settlements in Lipscomb County, Texas, and Ellis County, Oklahoma
(i.e., about 20% of chipped stone assemblages). It is also worth noting that Florence A
or Kay County chert from north-central Oklahoma is about the same distance from the
area as Gray Permian cherts, but was not used in the area at this time. This suggests
that exchange of Florence A described by Vehik (1986, 1990) did not extend this far
west prior to A.D. 1400.
The Middle Ceramic cultural complexes of Kansas and the nonlocal trade
items associated with these societies were not examined in preceding chapters.
Nevertheless, given the abundance of Smoky Hill jasper and Gray Permian cherts
recovered at Odessa phase sites it is useful to briefly consider the frequency of items

371

derived from the Southern High Plains in this area as a means of understanding
exchange relationships that developed between the two areas. To date no one has
systematically examined these data so this information is admittedly incomplete.
Nevertheless, enough information is documented to propose a few tentative trends.
Beyond the sporadic occurrence of Alibates at numerous sites, comparable data
regarding objects of Southern Plains origin at Central Plains Tradition settlements are
not well understood at this time.

Roper (1988) has documented malachite and

turquoise at Upper Republican phase settlements in south-central Nebraska. Similar
items are also documented among White Rock and Oneota phase settlements of the
region (Ritterbush 2002a, 2002b). Originally, it was suggested that these societies
obtained southwestern exotics through down-the-line exchange with the Antelope
Creek phase. Considering that nonlocal items derived from the Central Plains are
almost completely absent at Antelope Creek sites, but very abundant at Odessa phase
sites, suggests that these objects were almost surely obtained via exchange with the
latter societies.
The profusion of Smoky Hill jasper, Gray Permian cherts, and Kansas
pipestone throughout the period certainly demonstrates regular and sustained contact
between the Central Plains and Odessa phase groups. In fact, the abundance of these
items at Odessa phase settlements along with the similarities noted in ceramics,
architectural forms, and subsistence economies may indicate that additional
relationships beyond exchange existed between these societies and the Central Plains
tradition. Nevertheless, given the paucity of detailed information regarding nonlocal
items from the Southern High Plains in Kansas, specific Central Plains communities

372

that may have been in contact with Odessa phase communities are not known at this
time. As such, Upper Republican variant, and Solomon River, Smoky Hill, White
Rock, and Oneota phase settlements are all regarded as potential trading partners.
Despite the current limitations in the data sets, is it possible to determine
whether only Odessa phase trading expeditions visited the Central Plains or if
expeditions from the latter also visited the Southern High Plains? This is certainly a
difficult question to answer at present considering that the Middle Ceramic period for
most of western Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma is poorly known. Nevertheless,
it is an issue that is of obvious importance to understanding the nature and structure of
exchange.
The fact that distinct concentrations of Smoky Hill and Gray Permian cherts
can be readily identified for specific portions of the Odessa phase distribution suggests
that a community or communities in each of these areas had established independent
exchange relationships with societies presiding near the source areas of these
materials. If trading expeditions from the Central Plains visited the region and traded
equally among settlements, one might expect that the distribution of these two types of
tool stone would be fairly ubiquitous among local communities.

This pattern,

however, is not observed.
Overall, previous studies have not identified any Central Plains societies,
except perhaps Oneota or White Rock phase groups, which were as heavily involved
in long-distance exchange as Odessa phase. Thus, although the total numbers of trade
items derived from the Southern High Plains have not been formally quantified for
Central Plains Tradition settlements, I suspect that they are not nearly as abundant as

373

objects documented at Odessa phase sites that were derived from the Central Plains.
As such, while not entirely clear at this time, I suspect that Smoky Hill jasper, Gray
Permian cherts, and Kansas pipestone were acquired primarily by Odessa phase
trading expeditions to the Central Plains and not supplied by Central Plains groups
traveling to Southern Plains settlements.
As these data demonstrate, understanding the meaning and function of
exchange for items related to the subsistence realm can be quite complex and require
robust data sets. In spite of these problems the transfer of food, utilitarian implements,
raw materials, and technology over short distances within the study area seems fairly
straightforward.

The movement of these items suggest that faced with unequal

resource distributions and abundances, exchange at the outset of the Middle Ceramic
period (A.D. 1250) likely functioned as a strategy by which recently settled people
maintained access to crucial resources associated with the subsistence realm. Since
“exchange is widespread, if not universal among human societies” (Earle 1994:420),
this is probably a reasonable assumption.
Transfers at the local level probably revolved around the reciprocal exchange
of food, raw materials, and technology among neighboring settlements. Previously,
procurement of subsistence related items was embedded in annual mobility rounds.
Tethered to the landscape, however, by permanent settlements, stored resources,
claims to resources, and improvements to land, exchange was likely the only avenue in
which sedentary to semi-sedentary groups were able to procure many basic resources
that were unequally distributed across the landscape. The widespread distribution of
cordmarked ceramics, chipped stone and bone tool forms, and certain raw materials,

374

such as Alibates, indicate that most, if not all, settlements of the region were linked
through a broad web of reciprocal exchange relationships (see Fortes 1949).
Depending on the exact social distances involved, it can be expected that general or
balanced forms of reciprocity characterized exchange among individuals and families,
while negative forms probably occurred between strangers and distant kin.
Simultaneously, these material transactions not only served to initiate and solidify
interpersonal relationships within and between neighboring communities, but they also
imposed an obligatory bond that ensured repayment at a later date.
From a functionalist perspective, the regional exchange of subsistence related
objects as an organized strategy to maintain access to crucial resources unequally
distributed across the landscape is a reasonable interpretation for the items discussed
above. In contrast, the long-distance acquisition of utilitarian tools produced from
Smoky Hill jasper or Gray Permian cherts by Odessa phase societies is not as easily
explained. As noted above, the nearest source areas for these items are about twice as
distant as the Alibates quarries (i.e., 300 km versus 150 km). The question remains
why these objects were obtained when another equal quality tool stone, Alibates
appears to have been more readily available through down-the-line networks. Since
Odessa phase societies were sedentary horticultural villagers and that bison kills were
made close to settlements (Chapter Four and Seven), suggests that it is unlikely that
these materials were obtained through direct procurement while conducting other
activities.
In sum, it is concluded that models of technological organization and optimal
foraging hold little explanatory power for understanding the acquisition of utilitarian

375

tools manufactured from exotic tool stone. As such, considering each of the patterns
noted here, even though chipped stone tools produced from Smoky Hill and Gray
Permian cherts are obviously associated with the subsistence realm, it may be
profitable to consider them as something more than just simple utilitarian items.
Therefore, it is proposed that these objects span the continuum that exists between the
subsistence and political spheres of the economy. In fact, given the distance at which
these two types of exotic tool stone were procured, it is probable that the social value
attributed to these objects were in many ways analogous to obsidian obtained from
north-central New Mexico.
Obviously, the basis for this conclusion is poorly formulated at this point in the
discussion.

Nevertheless, the potential meaning and symbolic importance of these

items as trade goods associated with sociopolitical activities necessitates a brief review
of politics among small-scale societies. The ensuing discussion relates the types of
leaders present in these societies and the various strategies that they use to establish,
validate, and maintain positions of leadership.

These data are derived from the

ethnographic record and emphasize the key role that the economy and exchange play
in the politics of these societies.

The Rise of Politics in Small-Scale Societies
In this study it is proposed that many of social and economic developments
described for the Middle Ceramic period of the Southern High Plains mark the
emergence of communities characterized by greater social complexity than preceding
periods.

This is obvious considering that the appearance of larger settlements,

376

increasing sedentism, claims to important resources, economic intensification, and
long-distance exchange are all developments that would have required substantial
changes to previously existing forms of leadership and social organization.

Of

particular interest is the role that nonlocal items and the economy frequently play in
the social and political activities of these and other small-scale societies. As noted
earlier, these societies have been referred to as middle-range, transegalitarian, or
intermediate societies.

These entities usually lack the overt forms of inequality

observed in hierarchical societies, but display varying levels of inequality along a
number of other different dimensions (e.g., Cobb 1993; Hayden 1995; Mills 2000).
As many have noted, objects obtained through exchange frequently provide an
avenue that enables leaders to gain followers and build prestige (e.g., Cobb 1993;
Earle 1994, 2002; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Hayden 1995; Johnson and Earle
2000; Sahlins 1972). However, simply proposing the emergence of prominent leaders
as an explanation for the patterns observed versus understanding how these individuals
rose to prominence and maintained these positions are two entirely different things.
Given the trends noted here, insights into the politics and social life of contemporary
small-scale societies are helpful for explaining and interpreting long-distance
exchange in the present study.
As noted earlier, culture change associated with the transition from the Early to
Middle Ceramic period on the Southern High Plains was substantial. Although the
degree of change was generally quite intensive, some continuity was noted for some
communities of the region. For instance, throughout the preceding Early Ceramic
period populations were dispersed across the landscape into family sized groups.

377

Likewise, even though aggregated settlements of various sizes do make their
appearance during the Middle Ceramic period, some communities, especially among
the Antelope Creek phase, still represented dispersed single family settlements.
Current data suggest that these homesteads were largely autonomous and selfsufficient. In these instances, it is probable that these settlements were organized by a
domestic mode of production (DMP). As Sahlins (1972) has observed, the DMP is
characterized by economic underproduction and families generally produce only
enough to meet their immediate needs. Under these conditions, political leaders of
any consequence are not to be expected.
By necessity, the transition from dispersed homesteads to cohabitation in
villages often brings about many substantial changes in the organization of human
societies. Even though most of life’s daily activities may still continue to be organized
around the family, it is at this level that we witness the emergence of broader, more
formalized kinship networks. The formation of clans and lineages serve to define
group membership and interpersonal relationships, integrate the community, and
often, signal the appearance of corporate groups.

These developments in social

organization are frequently accompanied by heightened ceremonial activity, the
claiming of resources, economic intensification, and warfare (see Johnson and Earle
2000; Keeley 1996; Sahlins 1968, 1972). Under these conditions the basic elements
necessary for the appearance of more complex sociopolitical systems are present (i.e.,
emergent political economies).
In contrast to societies characterized by a DMP, emerging political economies
are marked by systems of production and distribution above and beyond the household

378

level (Cobb 1993; Earle 1994, 2002; Hayden 1995; Sahlins 1972).

Critical

components of these social systems are ambitious leaders who organized and
manipulated the economy of a larger group as a basis to support their political
activities. Following Leach (1954) and others (Earle 1997:2; Hayden 1995:20, 1998;
Sahlins 1958:1), I assume that all societies contain at least a few individuals that seek
political advantage at the expense of others. With this being said, it is important to
emphasize the social limitations that often hinder marked social inequalities among
small-scale societies. Since members of these societies are unlikely to tolerate blatant
self-serving behavior, leaders’ intent on attaining fame, status, and prestige must also
be generous, hard working, and seen as acting in the best interests of the community
they represent.
Leaders in small-scale societies are variously termed petty chieftains, great
men, headmen, center-men, village heads, lineage or clan heads, rich men, chiefs, big
men, men of renown, and aggrandizers (see Bulmer 1960; Dalton 1977; Godelier
1982; Hayden 1995; Johnson and Earle 2000; Malinowski 1984; Mauss 1967;
Rappaport 1967; Sahlins 1963, 1968, 1972; Service 1966, 1971; Strathern 1971).
Importantly, the degree of power and authority wielded by these individuals varies
considerably depending on the number of persons over which they hold influence and
can direct. For comparative purposes, a few of these leaders and the roles they play in
the politics of small-scale societies are briefly reviewed here. Although somewhat
arbitrary, the positions of leadership examined here are intended to relate how power
and authority vary in scale among these societies (see Hayden 1995 and Sahlins 1963).

379

Positions of leadership among family level foragers are typically short-lived
and informal (see Chapter Two). Because daily activities are organized and carried
out by autonomous families, suprafamily leadership is ephemeral and required
primarily when the coordination of several families is needed for the procurement of
seasonally abundant foods (Johnson and Earle 2000).

In these societies, where all

individuals are considered equally capable of leading, temporary positions of
leadership can be filled by a number of eligible persons.
As defined by Sahlins (1968:21) a petty chieftain refers to a “duly constituted
authority” of a village or local descent group. Petty chieftains are the first among
equals and are leaders in name only. This official position is often obtained not
through any exceptional skill or ability, but by group membership, customary rules,
and consensus. In other words, this position may be acquired simply by virtue of
being the oldest living man in the group or by being the eldest son of an existing
leader if determined by descent. Politically, beyond the title of “chief” this position
carries little social distinction and authority. For instance, although petty chieftains
are frequently called upon to give some direction regarding internal disputes, in the
end, village members are not obligated to follow their advice.
Like the petty chieftain, the village head represents a leadership position found
in small-scale societies organized into villages. Although most activities are still
organized at the family level, political integration among these groups is strongly
defined by ceremony and leadership (Johnson and Earle 2000:125). As with petty
chieftains, the power and authority of village heads is limited and they lack the ability
to issue direct orders. Nonetheless, because social sanctions underlie all reciprocal

380

relations, members of these integrated societies often feel obligated to respect
decisions made by leaders.
Village heads are usually well known for gaining prominence and followers
through persuasiveness, generosity, strength of personality, and their reputation as
renowned hunters, warriors, orators, mediators, and diplomats. However, since power
and authority are not institutionalized in these societies, if the village head wishes to
have something done he must lead by example or persuade others to do his bidding.
The primary means by which these individuals operate and expand their sphere of
influence is through the accumulation of loyal followers that willingly back his
political career with labor and resources (Earle 1994, 1997; Hayden 1995; Sahlins
1963, 1972).
Supporters are amassed by village heads who demonstrate their effectiveness
in sponsoring public feasts, resolving internal and intergroup disputes, implementing
public policy, paying death and bride compensations, attracting mates, allies, and
exchange partners, organizing ceremonial exchanges, and being a generous provider
of food and resources (Godelier 1982; Hayden 1995; Sahlins 1963, 1972). All of
these activities are seen as beneficial to the general well-being and reputation of the
group. Although there is considerable overlap, it is the expansion of political activities
that generally serves to separate a village head from petty chieftains.
Similar to the village head, the “big man” makes himself leader by virtue of
possessing extraordinary abilities to marshal followers (Godelier 1982; Sahlins 1963,
1972). While these leaders still hold no official position or ascribed power, “big men”
do hold considerable influence over others. Once again, reciprocal debt relationships

381

established through the strategic use of surplus resources and labor provide an
economic basis for political activities. Generally speaking, “big men” are simply an
elaborate version of village heads whose authority and influence has extended beyond
the local village (Sahlins 1963:163).
Although highly simplified, it should be apparent that the leadership positions
reviewed here may be envisioned as existing along a continuum. Importantly, the
elaboration of power and authority in small-scale societies is directly tied to the
number of followers that an individual leader can amass and rely upon for support in
his political endeavors. For instance, a petty chieftain may have influence over a few
families, while the village head may hold sway over entire lineages and clans. In its
most advanced form, the “big man” also has followers outside his village.
In contrast to the paramount leaders of chiefdoms who come into power (see
Earle 1997; Sahlins 1963), none of the positions described here represent
institutionalized offices.

Rather, individuals in these societies attain power by

elevating themselves over others through personal acts of generosity and deeds which
promote the status, well-being, and welfare of the community. Because social status is
not ascribed or determined by birth, and theoretically, all individuals were equally
capable of leading, it is not surprising that the politics of small-scale societies are
characterized by considerable competition over positions of leadership (Dalton 1977;
Godelier 1982; Hayden 1995; Johnson and Earle 2000; Rappaport 1967; Sahlins 1972;
Strathern 1971). Under these circumstances, leaders are often compelled to perform
increasingly elaborate deeds that serve the dual role of validating their authority and

382

providing benefits to supporters. Failure in these activities meant a loss of prestige to
both the leader and his followers, and at times, a loss of supporters to rival head men.
In nonstratified societies there are numerous strategies by which enterprising
individuals seek and attain political influence and power (Barnes 1988; Carneiro 1981;
Earle 1987, 1994, 1997; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Gilman 1981; Godelier 1977,
1982; Hayden 1995; Mann 1986; McGuire 1992; Meillassoux 1981; Sahlins 1972).
These include the manipulation of social relationships, ideological systems, coercion,
and control of the economy (see Earle 1997). Given the numerous constraints that
often characterize small, kin-based societies, coercion and the manipulation of
ideological systems tend to be uncommon among these groups. Accordingly, Sahlins
(1963, 1972) and many others (e.g., Earle 1997, 2002; Hayden 1995; Johnson and
Earle 2000) have emphasized the key position that the economy occupies in
establishing, maintaining, and expanding a base of power and authority in these
societies.

Indeed, labor and resources always play a crucial role in important

activities, such as attracting and pacifying supporters, death and bride wealth
payments, feasting, and ceremonial exchange.
Therefore, if ambitious leaders intend to become major players in the politics
of small-scale societies they must intensify economic production to sponsor important
political activities. Initially, ambitious leaders may cultivate larger gardens or enlarge
their domestic work force through polygyny as a basis for launching their political
careers. However, if their scale of involvement is to expand leaders must eventually
attract supporters beyond their household that can be convinced to work harder to
produce surplus resources.

So how is this accomplished?

383

As noted above, the

ethnographic record repeatedly demonstrates that positions of leadership were won by
those capable of enhancing the well-being, security, and status of the community. In
New Guinea, for example, successful “big men” gained loyal followers by
demonstrating “their effectiveness in entrepreneurial roles: the planner of public
policy, the settler of private disputes, the peace-maker in war, the arranger of death
compensations, the generous provider of food, the leader who secures strong allies in
war and pays for their services with valuables, the organizer of moka ceremonial
exchanges” (Dalton 1977:196).
Altogether, this discussion of politics in small-scale societies provides a basis
for understanding the evolution of exchange in the present study. In the subsequent
discussion the elaboration of exchange is seen as an archaeological signature that
marks the emergence of ambitious leaders. Contact with distant communities brought
prestige and renown to local leaders that organized trading expeditions. Supporters
also benefited through their association with these activities and by obtaining rare
items used to display their value as potential trading partners, allies, and mates. An
important element of long-distance exchange is its elaboration within a competitive
arena. Here, the continued expansion of long-distance exchange is seen as arising
from rivalry among local leaders for enhanced personal status, prestige, and the
accumulation of loyal supporters.

Long-Distance Exchange and the Emergence of Political Economies
In addition to the subsistence related items discussed earlier in this chapter, a
number of truly exotic objects obtained through long-distance exchange are also

384

frequently recovered from settlements of the region. It is readily apparent that many
of these objects were not associated with the subsistence realm of the economy.
Exotics include marine shell, decorated ceramics, obsidian, quartz crystal, turquoise,
Puebloan pipes, Kansas and South Dakota pipestone pipes, greenstone celts, mica, and
other unique objects (see Chapter Five and Six). Most exotics were acquired from the
Eastern Pueblos of the Rio Grande and Pecos River valleys, although a few items were
also derived from the Central, Northern, and Northwestern Plains. Goods derived
from contemporaneous Mississippian communities to the east have not been recovered
at settlements of the Southern High Plains.

Given that the listed objects were

materially and/or stylistically quite distinctive from locally available items, it is
probable that all inhabitants of the region were well aware that these items were
obtained through long-distance exchange with remote communities.
As described in Chapters Six and Seven, even though one or two exotic items
have been recovered at most settlements of the region, prestige items are notably
concentrated at Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruins 51, and Odessa Yates. Nonlocal
items number in the thousands at these three settlements. Distributions and source
analysis indicate that the occupants of these settlements conducted trading expeditions
to the Eastern Pueblos. The low frequencies of exotics at other settlements of the
region and source provenance analyses also suggest that the communities of Chimney
Rock Ruins 51, Alibates Ruins, and Odessa Yates functioned as regional trade centers
that redistributed exotics obtained during long-distance trading expeditions.
As noted above, demonstrating that trading expeditions from the Southwest or
elsewhere visited the region is difficult to confirm (see Howard and Brown 1973).

385

Nonetheless, if trading emissaries from other regions visited the Southern High Plains
one might anticipate that exotics would have a much broader distribution among
settlements of the Plains than is observed. On the other hand, it is possible that traders
did travel to the region, but the distribution of nonlocal items suggests that they only
visited a select number of important communities.
Treated in isolation, any body of data is subject to a number of equally
plausible alternative explanations.

Nonetheless, even in isolation, it is readily

apparent that risk reduction models or down-the-line exchange networks are
insufficient for elucidating the distributional patterns of trade items observed here.
Given that exchange is an activity that is embedded in broader social institutions, an
understanding of the social and environmental context in which exchange occurs is
crucial for understanding the meaning of this material act. Thus, that the communities
of Alibates Ruin, Odessa Yates, and likely, Chimney Rock Ruins 51 also made
exclusive claims to important resources and exhibit trends toward economic
intensification are additional cultural patterns that support the emerging social
complexity. Overall, while the Southern High Plains were never home to hierarchical
societies during the prehistoric era, at the same time, it is also evident that the trends
observed here are not typical of societies normally characterized as “egalitarian.”
As demonstrated above, economic intensification and long-distance exchange
are often two complimentary strategies used by emergent political leaders to attain
status and renown. In contrast to other communities of the region, the settlements of
Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates display intensified economic production to levels
beyond normal consumption. At the Alibates Ruins inhabitants were involved in

386

mining, production, and exchange of Alibates tools for exchange. Alternatively, the
faunal inventory at Odessa Yates indicates that the occupants of this settlement
developed a bison hunting economy that is best described as “specialized”. In each of
these contexts one must ask: under what conditions would families elect to work
harder to produce a surplus?
Judging from the data represented, however, I would suggest that risk
reduction strategies were not the ultimate factor influencing the economic patterns
observed here. In fact, rather than periodic shortages, I visualize these developments
as only occurring within a context where resources were reliable and abundant (see
Hayden 1995, 1998). As the ethnographic record demonstrates, an expansion of
political activities, such as long-distance exchange and the accumulation of loyal
supporters, relies extensively on the ability to generate surpluses. As such, I would
suggest that intensified production observed at Alibates Ruins and Odessa Yates
represents a strategy initiated by local leaders to finance political activities, including
long-distance exchange.

Likewise, even though many of the details surrounding

Chimney Rock Ruins 51 remain unknown, the same can probably also be said for this
settlement. Drawing on examples provided by the ethnographic record, the various
trends observed for the region are cautiously interpreted here.
Earlier it was proposed that the emergence of regular exchange among Middle
Ceramic settlements of the Southern High Plains developed as an organized strategy to
obtain crucial resources related to the subsistence realm. While many of these items
were likely obtained through reciprocal exchange with relatives or extended kin in
neighboring settlements, as social and geographic distances increased more formal

387

social arrangements undoubtedly must have been required to initiate and maintain
exchange relationships.

The ethnographic record demonstrates that intervillage

exchange was an activity often orchestrated by group leaders and that success in
exchange often brought considerable status and renown to head men and the
communities they represented.
Considering that the items obtained through local and regional exchange (i.e.,
food, raw materials, and technology) represent crucial objects associated with the
subsistence realm, it is easy to envision that initially community members were easily
persuaded to produce a surplus to obtain these objects. The broad distribution of
Alibates tools, which are by far the most widespread trade item found in the region,
indicates that all members of society benefited from intervillage exchange. Trade in
other subsistence items are admittedly difficult to document in the archaeological
record at this time (see Lintz and Reese-Taylor 1997), however, given regional
environmental and climatic conditions that result in marked disparities in many
important resources, it seems reasonable to assume that other objects must have also
been exchanged (see Ford 1972).
For Odessa phase societies the expansion of exchange to obtain utilitarian
chipped stone tools produced from high quality, nonlocal tool stone, such as Smoky
Hill Jasper and Gray Permian cherts, seems to mark an important step in the evolution
of exchange and resident sociopolitical systems. It is likely that the success garnered
from local and regional exchange of subsistence objects was recognized by leaders as
an activity that could be manipulated for personal gain. In fact, in many ways the
expansion of exchange to procure these nonlocal items simply represented an

388

elaboration of existing strategies already proven successful and deemed acceptable by
local community members. Once again, success in long-distance exchange to obtain
these items brought prestige to local leaders and community members also benefited
by acquiring high quality utilitarian items that were obtained by these leaders from
distant communities. However, given the distances involved, added prestige must
have been gained from these activities. In fact, enhanced status and prestige garnered
by long-distance traders appears to be universal among small-scale societies around
the world (see Helm 1979, 1988, 1992).
Smoky Hill Jasper and Gray Permian chert tools were not as widely distributed
throughout the Southern High Plains as Alibates. Although low frequencies of these
items, usually exhausted Harahey knives and distal endscrapers, are often observed at
most Odessa phase settlements, each of these materials is notably concentrated at
specific communities.

These patterns suggest that only certain Odessa phase

communities conducted trading expeditions to certain portions of the Central Plains.
The regional distribution of exotics from the Southwest indicates that an even smaller
number of settlements participated in exchange with the Eastern Pueblos.
The recovery of Smoky Hill and Gray Permian chipped stone tools in
residential and midden contexts supports their use in subsistence related tasks,
especially those related bison hunting, processing, and hide preparation. However, it
seems highly unlikely that the sole purpose of trading expeditions to communities 300
km away was to procure items whose value was limited to the subsistence realm.
These trends are especially enigmatic when one realizes that Alibates, another high
quality tool stone was available at half this distance. Considering that procurement

389

costs for these objects were extremely high, but yet they were used on a regular basis
for subsistence activities suggests that this trend was not coincidental.

The

ethnographic studies discussed earlier indicate that nonlocal items obtained through
long-distance exchange were often extensively used by community members to
display their value as potential trading partners, allies in times of war, as mates, or as
enemies to be feared. As such, even though these nonlocal items are associated with
the subsistence realm, the patterns observed suggest that these utilitarian items may
have also served as indicators of wealth, status, and power for community members
(see Hayden 1998). Materially, these items demonstrated the ability of a leader and
his followers to produce reliable surpluses, which out of a number of potential options,
were used to obtain luxury items from distant communities.
It is also worth noting that at settlements, such as Alibates Ruins and Odessa
Yates, where exotics are abundant, these items were not concentrated in particular
portions of these settlements, but appear to have been distributed throughout the
community. This distribution pattern is not unexpected, however, as the ethnographic
record indicates that the stockpiling of prestige items by leaders is not likely to be
tolerated.

Indeed, leaders in many of these societies are well-known for their

generosity and often give away all they have (see Dalton 1977; Sahlins 1963; Trigger
1990:135-136 among many others). As such, it is likely that it was in the best interest
of leaders’ who organized trading expeditions to strategically redistribute nonlocal
items. These transactions served as repayment for supporters or could be used to
indebt additional people to them.

390

The fact that exotics are not observed in large quantities in burial contexts is
also not to be expected in the study area. Considering that the primary value of items
obtained through long-distance exchange was their use in displaying status, inclusion
in mortuary contexts would have effectively removed them from circulation.
Nonetheless, the small quantities of marine shell jewelry associated with burials
supports the interpretation that these items represented personal belongings worn for
display.
In Chapter Seven it was argued that the settlement of Odessa Yates intensified
production of bison hides for long-distance exchange with the eastern Pueblos. Earle
(1994:427) has raised the question of whether exchange in nonlocal tools could have
provided a strategy by which local leaders could manipulate or control the subsistence
economy. While the patterns are not entirely clear, the co-occurrence of specialized
bison hunting economies and long-distance exchange to procure high quality chipped
stone tools used in bison hunting, processing, and hide production is interesting.
If indeed developments of specialized bison hunting and the acquisition of
chipped stone tools manufactured from high quality stone were contemporaneous and
interrelated developments, then it seems possible that the development of exchange
with the Southwest may have also been a related event. Earlier it was suggested that
the primary trade item exported to Puebloan communities was bison hides (Chapter
Seven). The distribution of exotics obtained from the Southwest suggests that only a
small number of communities in the region conducted trading expeditions to the
Eastern Pueblos. These items are clearly most abundant at Alibates Ruins, Chimney
Rock Ruins 51, and Odessa Yates. However, specialized bison hunting has only been

391

demonstrated at the latter settlement. While a lack of data from Chimney Rock Ruins
51 precludes further discussion of this site, the available information from Alibates
Ruins provides a basis for some tentative thoughts regarding long-distance exchange
by the occupants of this settlement.
Current evidence indicates that the occupants of Alibates Ruins were heavily
involved in the mining, production, and exchange of Alibates tools (see Chapter
Seven).

The distribution of Alibates tools throughout the region and beyond

demonstrates the key economic position that this community occupied. The abundant
exotics from the Southwest at this settlement also indicate that regular trading
expeditions to the west were conducted. While the occupants of Odessa Yates appear
to have produced bison hides for exchange, what items the occupants of Alibates
Ruins traded with Puebloans is not entirely clear at this time. At first glance, Alibates
tools seem to be the most logical commodity to be traded to the Pueblos, and indeed,
these objects have been recovered at many of these settlements (Lintz 1991;
Spielmann 1982). Unfortunately, the abundance of these items in contexts dating
between A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1500 at the Eastern Pueblos are not well documented.
Despite these limitations, I suspect that Alibates silicified dolomite was not the
primary item traded to the Southwest by the inhabitants of Alibates Ruins. This
conclusion is based largely on the observation that Puebloan populations generally
seem to have shown little interest in chipped stone technology. Indeed, these groups
did not emphasize high quality tool stone or formal tool designs to the degree
observed among neighboring Plains tradition societies. Equally telling is the fact that
obsidian frequencies at Alibates Ruins, Chimney Rock Ruins 51, and Odessa Yates

392

likely outnumber obsidian recovered at most Puebloan communities of comparable
size. Thus, if Puebloan societies exhibited little interest in obtaining obsidian, a local
higher quality tool stone, then it seems unlikely that Alibates would have generated
interest as a trade item among these groups. Currently, it is not known whether
Alibates tools occur in contexts at the Eastern Pueblos that would suggest their use as
status markers. Thus, even though much supporting data needed are largely lacking, I
would speculate that bison products were probably the main items traded to the
Southwest by Alibates Ruins. Indeed, much basic information regarding the economy
of this settlement remains unknown.
The distances to the Eastern Pueblos are highly variable for Southern High
Plains societies. Eastern Pueblos are only about 350 km from the settlements of
Chimney Rock Ruin 51 and Alibates Ruins, while the nearest pueblos are about 550
km from Odessa Yates. In contrast to Odessa phase communities, it is apparent that
none of the Antelope Creek settlements were involved in direct exchange with any
Central Plains societies. Overall, I suspect that the development of exchange with
Central Plains tradition groups and the Eastern Pueblos simply represent trends toward
increasing elaboration.

Given the lack of other plausible explanations, the

ethnographic record would appear to suggest that the primary motivation underlying
this elaboration was competition among local leaders for prestige, nonlocal items, and
followers. Although precise temporal data is lacking, the interpretation that longdistance exchange was an activity that grew incrementally seems most plausible and
was an outcome of competition among local leaders.

393

As presented above, the importance of ambitious leaders in the emergence of
social complexity obviously has a long history in anthropological studies (see Blanton
et al. 1996; Earle 1997; Hayden 1995; Sahlins 1972). Recently, however, researchers
have questioned the traditional view of social hierarchy as a monolithic process
involving ambitious leaders with centralized authority (e.g., Blanton et al. 1996;
Feinman 2000a, 2000b; Hayden 1995; Mills 2000). Grounded in political economy,
these studies contrast social systems where political organization is exclusionary and
individual-centered (network) with others that are more group-oriented (corporate).
Together, network and corporate modes are linked under the heading of dualprocessual theory and represent alternative strategies to establish and maintain
political-economic power in societies of varying complexity and scale (Blanton et al.
1996; Hayden 1995).
Arguably, the societies examined in this study employed strategies that contain
characteristics of both network and corporate modes (see Blanton et al. 1996; Feinman
2000a, 2000b; Hayden 1995). Here, emerging leaders are envisioned as encouraging
and organizing the intensification of local economies and the elaboration long-distance
exchange (i.e., network mode). However, it is also apparent that social constraints
greatly limited the ability of leaders to manipulate these activities for personal gain
(i.e., corporate mode). In addition, while the absence of concentrations of wealth and
elite residences are certainly characteristic of corporate systems, evidence for other
key traits of this mode are noticeably lacking. For example, even though items
obtained through exchange do appear to have been distributed throughout each
community, other major integrating mechanisms used to create and maintain group

394

equality and solidarity, including ritual and ceremony, non-competitive feasting, and
large communal construction projects are not observed (see Blanton et al. 1996;
Feinman 2000a, 2000b; Hayden 1995; Mills 2000).

Conclusions
This research has examined the origin and evolution of exchange among smallscale societies of the Southern High Plains. The results of this study indicate that the
development and expansion of exchange on the Southern High Plains was rapid and in
step with other important events associated with the appearance of Plains Village
tradition societies in the region. On a general level, the nonlocal items observed can
be envisioned as being broadly related to either the subsistence or political realms
(Earle 1994, 2002; Johnson and Earle 2000).

As this study has demonstrated,

however, the assignment of items to one of these two realms can be problematic for a
number of different reasons. As a result, it is apparent that this investigation has
benefited greatly by the adoption of a contextual perspective that considers both
temporal and spatial parameters.

This study concludes that exchange and the

acquisition of nonlocal items served a number of different purposes in Middle
Ceramic society.
Previously, researchers have hypothesized that climate conditions during the
Middle Ceramic period fluctuated greatly from year-to-year and caused considerable
economic uncertainty and stress among resident populations (see Lintz 1991;
Spielmann 1982, 1983).

Considering the prohibitive costs of transporting staple

products over long distances coupled with evidence for long-term occupation of

395

settlements and local subsistence economies that were productive and reliable, this
study concludes that it is unlikely that the primary function of Middle Ceramic
exchange was to buffer against economic shortfalls. Instead, the types, quantities, and
source areas of nonlocal items present suggest that exchange systems developed for
other socioeconomic reasons.
An examination of Archaic and Early Ceramic period assemblages of the
region indicates that evidence for the organized transfer of nonlocal items among
resident mobile foraging societies was extremely limited.

This suggests that

intersocietal exchange was of little socioeconomic importance to groups at that time.
In contrast, widespread exchange involving large quantities of nonlocal objects
appears to have developed rapidly at the onset of the Middle Ceramic period around
A.D. 1250. In particular, evidence for the exchange of utilitarian items, especially
chipped stone tools manufactured from high quality nonlocal tool stone, are extremely
abundant at settlements throughout the region. These objects were often obtained
from sources over 100 km away and comprise 70% to 90% of assemblages. That this
development coincided with the appearance with sedentism and the first permanent
settlements suggest that the initial function of exchange was to provide access to
resources that earlier were obtained through residential mobility.
The distances at which nonlocal objects were obtained and their distribution
among settlements provide additional information regarding the structure of regional
exchange networks. For example, even though chipped stone tools produced from
Alibates silicified dolomite are abundant at all communities of the region, it is clear
that the quantity of these items decrease with increasing social and geographic

396

distance from communities controlling the distribution of this important resource.
These patterns suggest that these utilitarian objects passed through down-the-line,
reciprocal exchange networks established and maintained between individuals and
families in neighboring settlements. If correct, it is probable that these exchange
relationships closely corresponded to extended kin networks that existed between
communities.
Given the disparities noted in the distribution of local resources, the initial
development of exchange to obtain subsistence related objects at the regional level
seems perfectly logical. However, the appearance of utilitarian and status items whose
primary cultural value seems to lay in the fact that they were obtained from distant
sources or communities makes little sense from technological, ecological or economic
perspectives. This is especially apparent if one considers the Smoky Hill jasper and
Gray Permian chert stone tools obtained by Odessa phase societies. These objects
were procured through long-distance exchange with communities 250 km to 300 km
away, yet were equivalent in quality to Alibates tools available through local downthe-line networks.

Considering the costs involved in procuring these items it is

suggested that it is useful to consider these objects as something more than mere
utilitarian goods, perhaps as luxury items or primitive valuables.
Whereas the exchange discussed above centered around the acquisition of
items linked to the subsistence economy, trading expeditions to Puebloan communities
300 to 600 km away focused on the procurement of nonutilitarian items, including
painted ceramics, pipes, and jewelry produced from marine shell and precious stone.
Since most these items essentially had no local equivalents and were clearly not

397

associated with the subsistence realm, it is assumed that these objects were worn to
display and validate social status. The frequent recovery of pipes and jewelry in burial
contexts supports this contention.
These nonlocal status items are noticeably concentrated at a small number of
settlements, such as Alibates Ruin 28, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, and Odessa Yates.
Analyses also indicate that these settlements laid claim to important resources,
intensified economic strategies to produce surpluses, and served as important regional
trade centers.

These patterns suggest that only the largest and most complex

communities in the region were capable of participating in long-distance trading
expeditions to settlements more than 300 km away.
Overall, although the exact timing is not well understood, it is proposed that
the material and economic evidence documented in this case study reflect trends
toward increasing social complexity among Middle Ceramic societies of the Southern
High Plains. In particular, it is suggested that these data along with the exchange
patterns observed above indicate that intersocietal exchange provided a major avenue
by which enterprising leaders sought to create and sustain status, power, and respect.
The interpretation that these events were incremental in nature seems reasonable
considering the scale of societies and distances involved, the types of objects
exchanged, and the nature and extent of regional involvement.
The ethnographic record repeatedly demonstrates that as social distances
increase individuals with exceptional social skills are likely required for initiating,
negotiating, and maintaining the exchange relationships with communities consisting
of nonkin. As in any context, the process of distinguishing oneself among other

398

potentially capable individuals undoubtedly was a process played out on a competitive
stage. Therefore, as an official representative of a larger social group (i.e., clans or
lineages), these individuals must have demonstrated their skill and ability as emerging
local leaders through their generosity, organizational skills, implementing public
policy, as peace-makers, etc.

Like these other stepping stones, success in long-

distance exchange must also have had the two-fold effect of providing status and
prestige for leaders and well-being and security of community members. In this light,
the increasing distances at which nonlocal items were procured may reflect some
degree of competition among local leaders for status and supporters.
It is proposed that the social and economic trends documented here required
forms of leadership that for numerous reasons were not necessary for small groups of
economically autonomous families. Although it is concluded that these trends mark
the emergence of important community leaders, it is apparent these were individuals
whose power and authority was socially restricted. Given the proposed relationship
between exchange and increasing social complexity, a basic understanding of the
politics of small-scale societies has provided an important basis for understanding how
and why these developments occurred. Here, the steady movement of subsistence
related objects among settlements throughout the region is seen as a strategy by which
recently sedentary populations maintained access to crucial resources. Developing
from these beginnings were the skills required to organize long-distance trading
expeditions to distant communities. Importantly, these developments provided the
leverage needed to manipulate local economic, social, and ideological systems.
Altogether, these are key developments that mark emergent political economies.

APPENDIX I
Odessa Yates: The 1998 to 2000 Field Seasons

Odessa Yates (34BV100) is a large Middle Ceramic settlement in Beaver County,
Oklahoma. Three field seasons of archaeological investigations were conducted at
this site as a part of this research. Fieldwork included large-scale shallow subsurface
geophysical survey, testing, and open block excavation. Figure I.1 provides a plan
map of the site and the location of investigated areas.

In addition to these

investigations several private collections from Odessa Yates were also documented
(see Brosowske and Bement 1998).

This appendix briefly relates the results of

fieldwork conducted at Odessa Yates from 1998 to 2000. Subsequent appendices
present the results of various analyses completed on cultural materials recovered.
Odessa Yates is one of the largest prehistoric settlement sites known for the
region. Although the site has been known and collected by the local community for
perhaps more than a century, professional archaeologists did not become aware of its
existence until it was recorded in the spring of 1998. Odessa Yates is approximately
40.5 ha (100 acres) in size and is situated along the south side of Clear Creek. The site
is part of a much larger extended village that stretches for several kilometers (see
Figure 4.13). Extensive private collections indicate that Odessa Yates contained a
single Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 1200-1500) component. Subsequent fieldwork
and absolute dating completed since 1998 supports this interpretation.

Currently, about 50% of Odessa Yates is actively cultivated, although it appears
that most of the site was farmed until the 1940’s. In June of 1998 geophysical survey
using a Geoscan RM 15 resistance meter and a Geoscan FM 35 gradiometer was
conducted in a fenced portion of the site that has been in pasture for nearly 60 years
(Maki and Jones 1998). The resistance survey covered 6300 m2 and the magnetic
survey included 4500 m2 (Figure I.1). This geophysical survey, representing the first
completed in the region using modern equipment (see Hughes and Hughes-Jones
1987:121-130), successfully identified numerous anomalies thought to be cultural in
origin.
The survey area was separated from a wheat field on the west by a barbed wire
fence. At the time of the survey wheat in this field was mature and about ready to be
harvested.

During the evening, under the low light conditions, several hundred

positive cropmarks were visible in this field. These cropmarks were circular in shape
and varied in size from one to six meters in diameter. These anomalies were clearly
visible as discrete areas containing taller and thicker vegetation. Closer inspection of
these areas showed charcoal stained soils and concentrations of cultural debris.
Although it was apparent that these cropmarks were associated with buried cultural
features, further investigation of these features was not possible until January of 2000.
Shortly after the geophysical survey was completed, a sample of resistance and
magnetic anomalies were selected for systematic ground truthing or testing in July of
1998. Testing determined that all of the most salient anomalies could be attributed to
differences in topography or local variation in soils and bedrock geology. In other
words, these anomalies were not cultural in origin.

453

However, there were also

numerous, much more subtle anomalies that did represent cultural features. These
features showed up in both the resistance and magnetic data and could be split into
two main categories: 1) large basin shaped features approximately four to six meters in
diameter and 2) smaller features about 1 m in diameter. Once located, both types of
features were easily differentiated from surrounding matrix by coring because they
contained dark, greasy soil filled charcoal, bone, and other cultural debris. Based on
testing it was concluded that the largest features likely represented domestic structures
and the smaller ones were cache pits. Both types of features extended to depths of
about 100 to 150 cm below the modern ground surface.
In June and July of 1999 a six week long archaeological field school was
conducted at Odessa Yates by the University of Oklahoma (Brosowske 1999).
Fieldwork completed during this field season focused on block excavation at one of
the large basin shaped features identified and tested in 1998. Additional geophysical
survey extended the block examined in 1998 and also completed areas immediately to
the west in the wheat field which was not cultivated at that time. A total of 18,900 m2
was surveyed with a resistance meter and 18,000 m2 was examined with a gradiometer
during this field season (Figure I.1).
Excavation of the large basin shaped feature uncovered an oval shaped pithouse
approximately 5.5 x 3.5 m in size (Figure I.2). This structure, called the Pasture
House, was excavated to a depth of about 100 cm below aboriginal surface. It had two
central support posts, and smaller posts about 8 cm in diameter around the perimeter.
The house was oriented from northwest to southeast.

No discernable entry was

identified, although a 1 m diameter vestibule adjoined the structure on the southeast

454

corner and was separated from the rest of the house by a raised sill. Although unclear,
entry to the structure may have been gained through this vestibule.

Figure I.2 Floor Plan of the Pasture House at 34BV100

Fill within this structure lacked evidence for the remnants of a superstructure
indicating that the house was dismantled and usable materials were salvaged.
Following abandonment the house basin was filled with a mixture of midden debris
and aeolian and colluvial sediments. A north to south profile across this structure
shows a series of strata sloping downward from the margins of the feature to the center
of the basin (Figure I.3). In general the pasture house contained a level floor, although
a shallow basin shaped depression was observed along the west wall. This basin was

455

roughly oval in shape and approximately 1 x 2 m in size and 0.2 m deep. Outside and
immediately upslope from the house (i.e., along the northwest side) a series 14 small
posts were identified. Each of these posts was about 8 cm in diameter and did not
present any obvious patterning. One wood charcoal sample from the floor of the
Pasture House was submitted for a standard radiocarbon date. This sample yielded a
calibrated age of A.D. 1296 (Beta 133579).

Figure I.3 Soil Profile from the Pasture House, 34BV100

Geophysical survey conducted in the fallow wheat field identified numerous
anomalies which were thought to be cultural features. Following the survey a sample
of these anomalies was subjected to ground truthing or testing to determine if indeed
they represented cultural features. Small anomalies less than 2 m in diameter were
systematically cored using a truck mounted “bull-probe” and Oakfield coring
instruments. Larger anomalies were examined using a small backhoe with a 30 cm
(12 in.) wide bucket. Trench #5 examined one such anomaly. Trenching of this area
began to the west of a large high amplitude bipolar magnetic anomaly and proceeded

456

slowly to the east with several individuals monitoring excavation. This trench was
excavated to a length of 4 m when the edge of a semi-subterranean habitation structure
was encountered. At this point, trenching of this anomaly was terminated and the
trench was profiled and photographed.
To gain a better understanding of the architectural details of pithouses at Odessa
Yates, Trench 5 was extended to the east through excavation of a series of 1 x 1 m test
units until the eastern wall of this feature was encountered (Figure I.4).

Upon

completion the total length of this west to east trending trench, including both
mechanical and hand excavated portions, was 11 m. The profile afforded by this
trench indicated the presence of not one, but three overlapping pithouses (Figure I.5).
From west to east these structures are labeled #2, #1, and #4. Two additional 1 x 1 m
units (N 608/E949 and N608/E951) were also excavated to the north along the eastern
end of the trench to gather additional architectural information regarding the shallow,
easternmost structure (#4). This also aided in determining the diameter of the feature.
Work at Trench 5 continued with the excavation of a second trench (Figure I.4).
Seven additional 1 x 1 m units were consecutively excavated northward from the
original trench until the northern margin of structure #1 was encountered. The profile
provided by this trench suggested that the structure was about 8 m long. Given the
size of other pithouses present at the site, which are generally much smaller, it was
thought that more than one feature might be present, but that could not be
demonstrated at the time.

457

Figure I.4 Trench 5 Grid Layout at 34BV100

Determining the occupation sequence for the three structures identified at Trench 5
was, in some instances, quite apparent in soil profiles (Figure I.5). For example, in the
west to east profile it was clear that the westernmost structure (#2) truncated an earlier
house immediately to the east (#1). As noted above, the profile provided by the north
to south trench suggested that structure #1 was about 8 m in diameter, but this seemed
too large. In hopes of clarifying this issue two samples were submitted for absolute
dating. The first sample submitted for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating
was from level 6 (55-65 cm below ground surface or BGS) of unit N 608/E949. The
material dated was maize and was derived from midden fill deposited into structure #1
after it was abandoned. The provenience of this sample was northwest and below the
floor of structure #4 and was associated with fill containing an obsidian Washita
projectile point. This sample yielded a calibrated date of A.D. 1284 (Beta 145474)
and indicated that both structures #2 and #4 post-date A.D. 1284.

458

459

Figure I.5 Trench 5 Profiles

A second sample from Trench 5 was also submitted for AMS dating. This sample
was from level 10 (95-105 cm BGS) of N612/E947. The material dated once again
was maize. If this unit was part of structure #1 and this structure was indeed nearly 8
m in diameter, then the date obtained from this sample should have yielded a date
relatively close to A.D. 1284. This sample yielded a calibrated AMS date of A.D.
1434 (Beta 153241). Since no other intrusive features, such as cache pits, were
observed during the excavation of this section of Trench 5, based on radiometric data
it is concluded that two structures, rather than one, are present in the N-S trench.
Overall, profiles, superposition, and absolute dates provide a chronometric sequence
for the features exposed in Trench 5. The approximate dates for structures 1 through 4
are shown in Figure I.6. Until samples for dating are submitted for structures 2 and 4,
it is only possible to state that these features date sometime after A.D. 1284. In
addition, it should be stressed that it is not possible to precisely identify the northern
limits of structure #1 (or the southern limits of structure #3) in the N-S trench. As
such, these boundaries as shown assume some degree of symmetry.
Given that numerous features, which overlap and are not contemporaneous, were
identified at Trench 5 presents several analytical problems. As noted above, it was
generally not possible to visually distinguish between the fill of overlapping features
until excavation was complete and a profile was available. As a result, it is not
possible to reliably separate cultural materials from each respective structure in
instances where features overlapped, or likely overlapped, within a single 1 x 1 m
excavation unit.

Figure I.6 Habitation Structures Identified at Trench 5, 34BV100

As mentioned earlier, a large number of positive cropmarks, which were thought
to mark buried cultural features, were observed in the cultivated wheat field at Odessa
Yates during the summer of 1998. This field was not planted again until August of
1999. The site was monitored throughout the fall and early winter of 1999 for the
presence of cropmarks.

In December the wheat sprouted and shortly thereafter

cropmarks were observed along several low ridges and knolls throughout the field.
Later, additional cropmarks were noted in some of the lower elevation areas.
In January of 2000 several days were spent mapping and coring some these
features. Aerial photography was also undertaken as a means to further document
these anomalies. A total 108 cropmarks approximately 1 m in diameter (probable
cache pits) were mapped. Twelve cropmarks were noticeably larger and ranged in
size from three to seven meters in diameter. These probably mark the location of

461

semi-subterranean domestic structures. A 20% sample of these features was subjected
to coring. Results indicate that these cropmarks do indeed represent buried cultural
features. In addition, the provenience data for cropmarks were overlaid onto maps
depicting the results of resistance and magnetic survey.

This helped clarify the

interpretation of small, subtle anomalies present in the geophysical data.
A second summer field school was held at Odessa Yates during August of 2000.
This field school was only three weeks long, but completed testing at five different
areas of the site. Three of the features examined had been previously located through
geophysical survey (i.e., 2000-1) or were marked by positive cropmarks (2000-2, and
2000-3). Two additional features (2000-4 and 2000-5), were identified by geophysical
survey conducted as a part of the field school. Altogether, 2000-1, 2000-2, and 20003 are located near the center of the site, while the other two are along the northern
(2000-4) and eastern margins (2000-5) of 34BV100 (Figure I.1).
The primary goal of these investigations was to collect a sample of cultural
materials from several different portions of the settlement. Testing consisted of the
excavation of a 1 x 2 m unit from the ground surface to the bottom of each feature.
Features 2000-2, 2000-4, and 2000-5 all represent semi-subterranean pithouses that
were between four and five meters in diameter. Excavation units in each of these
three areas were all placed in the approximate center of these structures as indicated
by coring conducted with a truck mounted “bull probe”. As such, beyond determining
the diameter of these features through coring, these units provided no information
regarding the architecture of domestic structures at the site. Features 2000-2 and
2000-5 both contained abundant midden debris deposited into houses after

462

abandonment. Feature 2000-4 contained very little cultural material throughout all
levels, except on the floor where the butchered remains from a summer bison kill
event were documented. Accelerator mass spectrometry dates from 2000-4 and 20005 suggest these structures were abandoned during the fourteenth century (Beta
153242) and around A.D. 1300 (Beta 153243), respectively.
Feature 2000-1 is a small, shallow structure 2.5 m in diameter (Figure I.7). This
floor of this feature was only about 50 cm below the ground surface, but contained
extensive midden debris. The conclusion that this feature was a habitation structure is
supported by the presence of a central support post, a basin shaped hearth, and a small
stepped entryway to the east. Its small size and the absence of substantial walls,
however, may indicate that the occupation of this structure was limited to the warmer
months. An AMS date on maize from this structure indicates that it was abandoned
around A.D. 1476 (Beta 169790).

463

The remaining feature examined in 2000, 2000-3, is a large bell-shaped cache pit
(Figure I.8). Investigations examined only the southern half of this feature.

This

cache pit extended to a depth of 150 cm, was about 140 cm at its widest point, and had
an orifice diameter of approximately 95 cm. Interestingly, a caliche plaster 5 cm thick
was applied to the interior walls of this pit. After abandonment this feature was
completely backfilled with trash debris. Notable artifacts recovered from 2000-1
included numerous bison scapula and tibia bone tools and abundant charred corn
remains. An AMS date on maize from the bottom of the feature yielded a calibrated
age of A.D. 1476 (Beta 169791). Table I.1 presents dates from 34BV100.

These discussions have provided a brief summary of the investigations conducted
at 34BV100 from 1998 to 2000. This work resulted in the investigation of 10 separate
cultural features. All of these features represent domestic structures except 2000-3
which was a storage facility. In addition to excavation, 34,200 m2 or 3.42 ha were
surveyed using geophysical instruments.

Radiocarbon dates were obtained for seven

of the features examined and demonstrate occupation of Odessa Yates from about
A.D. 1275 to A.D. 1475. In subsequent appendices the results of analyses conducted
on faunal, chipped stone, and botanical remains, from these features are presented. As
such, these discussions provide basic information regarding the provenience of
cultural materials analyzed.

466

APPENDIX II
Odessa Yates (34BV100): The Faunal Remains

This appendix presents the results of analyses conducted on faunal remains from
the Odessa Yates site. These materials were recovered during two summer field
schools conducted at the site by the University of Oklahoma in 1999 and 2000. Here,
faunal remains recovered from six areas investigated during these field seasons are
reported. These areas include 2000-1, 2000-2, 2000-3, and 2000-5, Trench 5, and the
Pasture House. Feature 2000-4, a domestic structure along the northern margins of
Odessa Yates, was nearly devoid of trash debris. As such, the total number of faunal
remains from this feature did not constitute a large sample and was not analyzed.
Figure I.1 shows the location of each of the areas investigated at the site.
Except for faunal remains from the Pasture House, all of the analysis results
presented here were completed by the author from 1999 to 2002. These studies were
conducted at the Oklahoma Archeological Survey in Norman and made use of the
extensive comparative faunal collection housed there. As noted in Appendix I, all but
Feature 2000-3 (a trash filled cache pit) represent abandoned domestic structures filled
with trash debris.

The total amount of trash debris deposited in these features,

especially faunal remains, was generally extensive. As a result, a sample of faunal
materials from each feature was selected for analysis.

In most cases, samples

consisted of all faunal remains recovered from a single 1 x 1 m excavation unit. The
sample from Trench 5, which tested four overlapping domestic structures, is derived
from 10, 1 x 1 m units. Sample sizes for each discrete feature ranged from about 1900

467

to 6400 individual specimens. Combined, all of the samples total nearly 26,500
specimens. Except for some of the upper levels, which were excavated with shovels,
all excavation at Odessa Yates was conducted using trowels and bamboo tools. Soil
was dry screened through 3 mm mesh.
The analytical procedures and data classes used in these analyses focused on
collecting information needed for reconstructing diet breadth and butchering and
transport decisions by the occupants of Odessa Yates. Attributes used to determine
skeletal element frequencies for each taxon included the portion, segment, and side of
an element. Anatomical landmarks were also recorded for several elements. Efforts
were generally made to identify the taxon represented for all specimens, although
given the fragmentary condition of the assemblage some general classes were utilized
(e.g., deer/antelope, fish, and aquatic turtles). Fish remains were not identified to taxa
or element; they were simply recorded as “unidentified fish”.
Specimens too fragmentary for species identification were assigned to classes,
such as unidentified mammal, bird, and so on. Unidentified mammal bones were
further divided into three categories based upon the animal’s size. These categories
included 1) large mammals (e.g., bison, elk, and bear), 2) medium mammals (e.g.,
mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, wolf, domestic dog, and coyote), and 3) small
mammals (e.g., foxes, rabbits, hares, rats, and mice). When possible generalized
element designations, such as long bone, rib, and vertebra along with size class
information were also recorded for all unidentified specimens. Since no identifiable
elements of any large mammals other than bison were observed, it is concluded that all
unidentifiable large mammals remains probably represent bison.

468

Overall, the

frequencies of each category of unidentifiable mammals are similar to the results
provided by identifiable specimens. The only inconsistency observed is from Feature
2000-5 where higher numbers of deer to jackrabbit sized mammals were observed.
These remains were intensively processed into small unidentifiable fragments and
were often burned.
Element size and whether a specimen was burned were recorded for insight into
butchering strategies. The maximum length of all specimens was recorded using an
arbitrary size class system. These classes are as follows: Class 1 (0-25 mm), Class 2
(25-50 mm), Class 3 (50-100 mm), Class 4 (100-200 mm), and Class 5 (>200 mm).
Size information was recorded for all specimens. These data are only presented for
bison and deer/pronghorn since the elements of other species generally fell into
Classes 1 or 2. Bone breakage caused by excavation appears to be minimal and
element sizes observed are assumed to have resulted largely from aboriginal
processing. This conclusion is reasonable considering that faunal remains from the
site are characterized by green bone breaks and exhibit little surface weathering.
Evidence for burning was simply recorded as present or absent.

Weights were

recorded by all specimens, but are reported only for species other than bison and
deer/pronghorn.
The results of faunal analyses are presented here in tabular form by feature.
Minimum number of individuals (MNI) information is also provided.

Earlier a

combined summary of faunal data from Odessa Yates was presented in Chapter Seven
(Table 7.6). The interpretation that the occupants of this settlement practiced an
economy largely dependent on bison is supported by the data presented here.

TRENCH 5 FAUNAL REMAINS (N=6909)
A total of 10 units were sampled for faunal analysis from Trench 5 (see Figure I4). As noted in Appendix I, Trench 5 exposed portions of four overlapping semisubterranean domestic structures. Radiocarbon dates were obtained from two of these
features and suggest that Structure #1 and #3 were abandoned sometime around A.D.
1284 and A.D. 1434, respectively. Structure #1 is represented by remains from a
single unit (N 609/E 947). Faunal material was not numerous from N 607/E 946, the
only unit that clearly contained fill from structure #2. Thus, due to a small sample size
from this unit no faunal debris from this structure was analyzed. Structure #3 is
represented by specimens from four units (N 611/E 947, N 612/E 947, N 613/E 947,
and N 613/E 947). Structure #4 is represented by faunal material from three units (N
607/E 950, N 607/E 951, and N 608/E 951). Faunal elements from N 607/E 949 and
N 610/E 947 likely represent mixed contexts. These data are presented in tabular form
for all units combined and by each individual habitation structure.

Information

presented here include number of individual specimens (NISP), weight, and minimum
number of individuals (MNI).

PASTURE HOUSE (N=3633)
Faunal analyses were also completed for two, adjacent 1 x 1 m units (N566 E1026
and N566 E1027) from a domestic structure referred to as the Pasture House. These
analyses were not conducted by the author and the methods used and attributes
measured by the analysts vary considerably from those presented above. Nonetheless,
the results are important and are reported here. The primary information available
from these analyses includes the number of individual specimens for each taxon.
Weights of specimens were measured for only one unit (N566 E1027), and thus,
cannot be presented for both units. MNI figures and the data they are based upon were
only calculated for N566 E1026. These MNI results are presented, but it must be
recognized that these figures are in some cases probably too low. For example, a total
of 278 deer/pronghorn elements were identified from these two units. Thus, an MNI
of one for this combined class seems too low. It should also be noted that unidentified
mammal categories, such as large, medium, and small, were not utilized by either

492

analyst. Instead, all unidentified large mammal remains were assumed to represent
bison and all unidentified medium-sized mammals were attributed to deer/pronghorn.
Given the trends observed for faunal remains from other features at the site these
appear to be reasonable assumptions. Figure II.1 shows bison elements or element
classes (e.g., ribs, thoracic or lumbar vertebra) present in this sample. These data
suggest that all portions of bison were transported back to the settlement (compare to
Figure 4.11).

APPENDIX III
Archaeobotanical Remains from Odessa Yates (34BV100)

Sediment samples containing archaeobotanical remains were collected from nearly
every level of every excavation unit during the 1999 and 2000 field seasons at Odessa
Yates. Except for a few samples curated for future studies, all of these sediment
samples have been processed to remove preserved plant remains. Limited funding has
enabled only a small portion of these remains to be analyzed. To date, analysis of
plant remains has been completed for several of the features excavated at the site
(Table III.1).

All archaeobotanical analyses of plant remains from Odessa Yates were conducted
by Dr. Richard R. Drass of the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, Norman from 1999
to 2002. Sediment samples were dried and processed to collect heavy and light
fraction remains. A flotation system consisting of 5 gal buckets with an overflow
spout to collect light fraction debris was used. Heavy fraction debris was collected
from the bottom of these buckets after their separation from sediments. After drying,

494

all samples were sorted in the laboratory through nested screens of 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5
mm, and 0.25 mm for light fractions and 2 mm and 1 mm for heavy fractions.
Generally, both heavy and light fractions were scanned for seeds and other plant
remains. The results are presented here in tabular form and include both charred and
uncharred remains (Tables III.2 and III.3). Even though most samples were collected
from relatively deep contexts at the site (i.e., 0.8 to 1.5 m below ground surface), it is
likely that uncharred remains represent recent intrusions, probably the result of rodent
activity.

APPENDIX IV
Chipped Stone Artifacts from Odessa Yates

The chipped stone assemblage from Odessa Yates is typical of sites attributed to
the Plains Village tradition. Diagnostic items include triangular projectile points,
distal endscrapers, and Harahey knives. Other aspects of the assemblage, however,
are quite unique compared to other Middle Ceramic sites of the region. For example,
the types of tool stone used by these groups, which include a combination of Central
and Southern Plains types, are particularly notable. Another key characteristic, but
more difficult to quantify, is the heavily curated appearance of the chipped stone
assemblages. The latter suggest that the occupants of this village may have suffered
from shortages of chipped stone. A similar trend is also observed at the Buried City
locality (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:103). Here, chipped stone from five features
at Odessa Yates are used to document these trends (Table IV.1). These assemblages
were recovered along with other trash debris in abandoned habitation or storage
features. Two other features, 2000-4 and 2000-5, were also excavated, but chipped
stone from these areas were not analyzed due to time and budgetary constraints.

Table IV.1 presents basic information regarding the chipped stone assemblages
used here. Included are the total volumes of matrix excavated at each feature and the
total number of all chipped stone items recovered from these areas. The density of
chipped stone per m3 ranges from about 54 to nearly 100 items per m3. By themselves
these data might suggest that cultural materials were sparse in these features. To
demonstrate that this is certainly not the case, the quantities of faunal remains and
their respective densities for each of these of features are also presented in Table IV.1.
Faunal densities are very high and range from 700 to nearly 5000 individual faunal
specimens per m3. A comparison of average chipped stone and faunal densities for
each of the features indicates a chipped stone to faunal debris ratio of 1.0 to 28.4.
Not only is the total quantity of chipped stone unusually low at this settlement, but
the overall size of chipped stone items is also surprisingly small. Figure IV.1 presents
the maximum length for the sample analyzed. Although there is some variation in the
frequency of chipped stone artifact size classes among features, 81.5% or 2652 of all
specimens, including tools, are 20.0 mm or less in length. Debitage in this size range
are likely associated with the refurbishing and/or late stage production of chipped
stone tools. This, coupled with low frequencies of primary and secondary flakes,
supports the interpretation that tools entered the site as finished items or in the late
stages of production (see Chapter Six; Table 6.9). It should be noted, however, that 23
cores were recovered. The average maximum length of all cores is only 40.3 mm,
indicating these items were essentially exhausted of usable stone. Of these items,
Alibates and Smoky Hill jasper, the two primary types of stone used for tool
production, are represented by only six examples.

498

Figure IV.1 Maximum Length of Chipped Stone at 34BV100.

Chipped stone tools recovered at Odessa Yates are represented almost entirely by
formal designs produced from either Alibates or Smoky Hill jasper. These include
projectile points, distal endscrapers, alternately beveled diamond shaped knives, and
drills (Table IV.2). Modified flake tools, referring to flakes exhibiting one or more
resharpening episodes, were rarely observed. Except for projectile points, most of the
formal tools present are broken or exhausted. This is particularly evident among distal
endscrapers and alternately beveled diamond shaped knives (i.e., Harahey knives).
These tool forms are designed for long-term use and employ resharpening techniques
that facilitate economical use of tool stone. A total of 15 bifaces were also recovered.
These items are generally small and crude and may represent attempts to recycle tools.

A total of 65 arrowpoints were recovered from excavated contexts at Odessa
Yates. Varieties represented include Washita (33 or 60.0%), Fresno (20 or 36.4%),
and unidentified corner-notched types (2 or 3.6%). Ten arrowpoints fragments were
also recovered and could not be identified to type. Except for lower quantities of
corner-notched points from excavated features, these frequencies closely resemble a
much larger sample recovered from surface contexts at the site (N=346) (Figure IV.2).

The chipped stone recovered at Odessa Yates (see Figures IV.3 and Table IV.3)
are dominated by two main types: Alibates silicified dolomite (48.1% or 1566) and
Smoky Hill jasper (26% or 848). The remainder includes a variety of local and
nonlocal materials. Of these Dakota quartzite (9.5% or 310), quartz crystal (7.6% or
247), and silicified caliche (2.9% or 94) are most common. Only 25 (0.8%) obsidian
artifacts were recovered during excavations. Overall, similar trends of tool stone use
are observed at the Lundeen site (Bevitt 1999).

In summary, chipped stone tool forms recovered at Odessa Yates represent items
diagnostic of the Plains Village tradition.

Two unique characteristics of the

assemblage include the types of tool stone used and the overall rarity of chipped stone.
Combined, Alibates silicified dolomite and Smoky Hill jasper comprise nearly 75% of
all chipped stone. The abundance of these materials in features dating from A.D. 1284
to A.D. 1476 demonstrates sustained exchange contacts with both Southern and
Central Plains societies.

502

The rarity of chipped stone is apparent both in terms of the low quantities
recovered and the small size of items. While the high frequencies of small debitage
are clearly related to the fact that sediment from the site was screened through 3 mm
mesh, it should be noted that even smaller quantities of chipped stone would have
been recovered if 6 mm mesh had been used.

Thus, the paucity of tool stone

recovered seems to be quite real. These trends are interpreted as evidence for limited
tool production at the site and probable shortages of chipped stone for the occupants of
Odessa Yates.

503

APPENDIX V
Results of Obsidian X-Ray Florescence Analyses

Introduction
Given the emphasis of this research on intersocietal exchange determining the
source of origin for nonlocal items obtained through trade has been of obvious
importance.

Here, the results of X-Ray Florescence (XRF) source analyses of

obsidian artifacts undertaken as a part of this research are presented. Source areas for
130 artifacts from 19 different Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 1200-1500) sites are
reported. All of the XRF analyses results presented here were conducted by the
Berkeley Archaeological XRF Laboratory, Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology,
University of California at Berkeley under the direction of Steven Shackley. These
analyses were conducted between May 1998 and November of 2003.
By taxonomic unit, 63 artifacts were recovered from Odessa phase settlements, 59
were from Antelope Creek settlements, and eight are from Middle Ceramic period
sites for which the cultural affiliation is not yet clear. Odessa phase settlements
included in these analyses are Campbell, Sprague, Odessa Yates, Spangler,
Huddleston, 34BV122, and Courson D. Additional obsidian artifacts attributed to this
phase include those from 34BV93 and one Washita projectile point. The latter item is
from the collection of Ross and Clifford Goodner. Although the specific site where
this artifact was recovered is not known, Ross and Clifford are known to have
collected extensively at Odessa Yates, Sprague, and other Odessa phase sites in
Beaver County, Oklahoma (Brosowske and Bement 1999:49; Karber 2000, personal

504

communication). It does not appear as though they ever collected from any of the
Antelope Creek phase sites located 75 km to the west. As such, it is concluded that
this artifact was recovered from an Odessa phase site, likely Odessa Yates or Sprague.
Three flakes, all which were thought to be obsidian were analyzed from 34BV93.
Two are obsidian and the other is a black chert. This site, which contains a Middle
Ceramic period component, is situated on a playa lake in northwestern Beaver County,
Oklahoma. The source area for one flake is Malad, Idaho and is remarkably similar in
elemental composition to another from Spangler, an Odessa phase site about 22 km to
the southeast. Given these similarities and the site’s location it is concluded that the
obsidian flakes from 34BV93 are associated with an Odessa phase occupation of the
site.
Antelope Creek phase settlements examined in this analyses include Alibates Ruin
28, Chimney Rock Ruin 51, Archie King Ruins, Stamper, Roy Smith, and Clawson.
An additional site included with this group, 34TX113, is an ephemeral site on a playa
lake in north-central Texas County, Oklahoma. This site has a Middle Ceramic period
component and is near permanent settlements of the Antelope Creek phase. As such,
it is concluded that 34TX113 was likely used by these groups. Another playa site in
this area, 34TX112, also appears to have used by groups of the phase. One flake,
thought to be obsidian, was analyzed from this site. This item is not obsidian, but is
also included in the results presented here.
Eight additional obsidian artifacts were also sourced from three Middle Ceramic
period sites for which the cultural affiliation is not known.

These sites include

34BV172, 34BV157, and 14KW311. The latter site, known as Nichols Ranch, is a

505

permanent habitation site along the upper reaches of Medicine Lodge Creek in Kiowa
County, Kansas.

Very little is known about Nichols Ranch, although the three

obsidian artifacts analyzed were recovered from uncontrolled excavation of Middle
Ceramic age midden deposits at the site. The other two sites, 34BV157 and 34BV172,
are in southwestern Beaver County, Oklahoma and are along Fulton and Bull creeks,
respectively. These sites have yet to receive any formal investigations and the cultural
affiliation remains unknown. Each of these sites is situated between known Odessa
and Antelope Creek phase settlements.

Provenience of Obsidian Samples Analyzed
The provenience of artifacts presented here includes items from excavated and
surface contexts.

Of the Odessa phase obsidian artifacts, only 13 (20.6%) were

recovered during excavations. All of these artifacts were recovered from Trench 5 and
document items from Cerro Toledo and Valle Grande from New Mexico, an unknown
source in the northwestern Plains, and a knappable quality variety of smoky quartz
whose source is not known (Table V.1). The latter is visually identical to obsidian.
Many of these items found on site surfaces represent projectile points diagnostic of the
period (i.e., Washita and Fresno varieties) and document similar source areas as those
from excavations. Given these trends, and the fact that later components have not
been documented at these sites, it is reasonable to conclude that the obsidian from
these sites can be attributed to Middle Ceramic period occupation by Odessa phase
societies.

506

The context of obsidian from the Antelope Creek sites is not entirely clear in all
cases. The artifacts from 34TX113, Archie King Ruins, and Clawson are all from
surface deposits. A total of nine obsidian artifacts are reported for the Roy Smith site
(Schneider 1969:Table V). A site catalog for the collection, however, documents 10
obsidian flakes from the site (Table V.2). These include seven flakes from the main
structure, and three flakes from other test units (one from Test C and D, one from Test
E, and one from the Corral). Of the ten cataloged obsidian artifacts, only six are
curated with the collection at the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History in Norman,
Oklahoma. All six of these items were subjected to source analysis. Unfortunately,
none of these artifacts were marked with catalog numbers. As such, it is not possible
to determine where each of the artifacts subjected to source analysis were recovered.

Three flakes from the Stamper site were submitted for source analysis. The results
indicate that two items are obsidian and one is an opaque variety of black chert. These
represent all of the obsidian artifacts present in collections from the site. Provenience

A short site report was written on the investigations at Chimney Rock Ruin 51
indicates that “thousands” of obsidian artifacts were recovered here (Studer n.d.:4).
Studer (n.d.:4) also notes that southwestern trade items were more numerous here than
any of the other Antelope Creek site investigated along the Canadian River, including
Alibates Ruins. Unfortunately, the debitage from the site, including obsidian, was
apparently not collected (i.e., they are not curated with the collection). All of the
obsidian artifacts present in the collection are bifaces. Of the items analyzed, four are
Washita projectile points and two are biface fragments. Five of these items have
catalog numbers and indicate that three are from Area 1 and two are from Area 2
(Table V.3). The catalog number on the remaining item was not entirely legible and
the area where it was recovered is not known. The catalog numbers used for Chimney
Rock Ruin 51 records site (i.e., 51 A1-16/11), area number (i.e., 51 A1-16/11), section

Alibates Ruin 28 was excavated by the Workers Progress Administration (WPA)
from 1938 to 1941 (Lintz 1986:328). This site was split into two main areas of
excavation: Units I and II. Excavation Unit I is along the northern perimeter of the
site and overlooks the Canadian River valley and the Alibates quarries to the north.
Unit I contained a large pueblo-like structure that included numerous contiguous
habitation and non-habitation rooms. Unit I was subdivided into four areas (Areas 14) and a total of 1515 m2 were excavated here (Lintz 1986:335). Excavation Unit II
adjoins Unit I on the south and is also subdivided into four areas (Areas 5-8). A total
of 4110 m2 were excavated at Unit II and exposed numerous freestanding habitation
and non-habitation features (Lintz 1986:335). Several thousand obsidian artifacts
were recovered during excavations (Lintz 1986, 1991; Spielmann 1982; see Figure
V.1). Nearly all of these items are unworked and represent debitage from all stages of
tool manufacture. In contrast to Chimney Rock Ruin 51, all of the obsidian artifacts
recovered at Alibates Ruin 28 appear to have been collected and are now housed at the
Panhandle-Plains Museum in Canyon, Texas.
Determining the provenience of obsidian recovered at Alibates Ruin 28 is of key
importance because the frequency of obsidian and other Southwest exotics has been
used, sometimes in the absence of radiocarbon dates, as a means for relative dating of

509

Antelope Creek phase sites. Lintz (1986a, 1986b, 1991) has argued that exchange
between Southern High Plains and Puebloan societies increased dramatically
following A.D. 1350 (i.e., during the late subphase [A.D. 1350-1500] of the Antelope
Creek phase). Thus, sites with few southwestern exotics are thought to date to A.D.
1250-1350, while settlements containing an abundance of trade items are thought to
date after A.D. 1350 (see Lintz 1986:184-191, 1991:93).
entirely on the data derived from Alibates Ruin 28.

Figure V.1 Obsidian Artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28

510

These ideas are based

Citing several short, unpublished reports written by Ele and Jewel Baker (Baker
1940a:51, 1940b:44; Baker and Baker 1940:20), Lintz (1986a:335, 1986b:117;
1991:101) has suggested that only 13 obsidian artifacts were recovered from Unit I,
while at least 4132 were recovered from Unit II. To account for these vast differences,
Lintz (1986b:117, 1991:101) proposed that Unit I represents an earlier component of
the site (i.e., pre-A.D. 1350) a period when exchange with southwestern societies was
minimal. The higher frequencies of obsidian at Unit II were thought to represent a
later period of occupation (i.e., post-A.D. 1350) when intersocietal relations with the
Southwest had increased significantly (Lintz 1991:101).
Only five radiocarbon dates are available from Alibates Ruin 28 (Table 4.1).
Three of these dates are from Rooms 1 (N=1) and 19 (N=2) at Unit I and two are from
Room 24 at Unit II. The dates from Unit I range from about A.D. 1270 until A.D.
1400 and the dates from Unit II suggest occupation from about A.D. 1325 until A.D.
1430. Give the large number of habitation structures at this settlement (see Table 4.4)
and the limited number of dates from the site I would suggest that the occupational
history of this site is not well understood at this time (see Lintz 1986b).
Previous analyses of artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28 have not documented the
quantities of obsidian recovered from various excavation areas of the site (see Baker
and Baker 2000). As of May 2003, nearly all of the several thousand obsidian artifacts
from Alibates Ruins 28 were permanently curated in six cigar boxes and two paper
bags (three additional boxes held another 46 items). In most cases, these boxes and
bags were labeled with provenience data or contained slips of paper with this
information. A small number of obsidian artifacts within each box or bag were also

511

usually labeled with provenience information.

The two paper bags containing

obsidian represent original bags used by WPA archaeologists. These bags were sealed
shut in such a manner that suggests that they have not opened since the 1940’s. At the
request of the museum curator, these items were rebagged into plastic bags (the
original paper bags were retained with the artifacts). Due to time constraints, the total
number of obsidian was tabulated for only one box of artifacts (i.e., Cigar Box 2).
This box contained a total of 879 obsidian artifacts weighing 1751.2 g (1.99 g per
flake).

Counts for the remaining boxes and bags were estimated based on the

quantities contained in this box. It is estimated that approximately 6000 obsidian
artifacts weighing approximately 11,954 g are present in the collection. Table V.4
provides provenience information and estimates or counts for each box and bag of
obsidian artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28.
Table V.4 shows there are instances where provenience information written on
bags, boxes, slips of paper, and artifacts do not match. For example, items in Cigar
Box 3 could be from either Area 4 of Unit I or Area 8 of Unit II. Similar problems are
noted for Cigar Boxes 4 and 5. Artifacts in Cigar Box 4 appear to be from Areas 1
and 4 of Unit I. This box is also labeled “Site 24 Area 2 Section 46”. The “Site 24”
label may refer to Antelope Creek 24 and may indicate that this box was recycled by
WPA analysts. In addition, since only 43 obsidian artifacts were recovered from
Antelope Creek 24 (Lintz 1986:Table 31), the approximately 900 artifacts in this box
are almost surely from Alibates Ruin 28. Cigar Box 5 is labeled “Area 5

7” and an

inside tag reads “Ruin 28 Area 7”. None of the artifacts within this box are labeled.
These items appear to be from Unit II, although it is not known whether they are from

512

Area 5 and/or Area 7. A small box containing four items (Small Box 3) contains a tag
that reads “Ruin 28 Area 7”. Two of the artifacts inside this box, however, are labeled
as coming from Unit I (Area 4 Sections 1 and 7). The provenience data on the
remaining boxes and bags correspond with information written on artifacts and it is
concluded that these data are correct. In addition, many boxes contain artifacts labeled
with an area designation of “0”. It is likely that these represent items recovered from
surface contexts at each area (Shaller 2003, personal communication).

Although provenience information is suspect in a couple of instances, it is apparent
that large quantities of obsidian were recovered from nearly all of the areas

513

investigated at Alibates Ruin 28. The provenience data presented here suggest that
approximately 2721 obsidian artifacts were recovered from Unit I (Areas 1 to 4). This
figure includes the items from Cigar Box 4. It is estimated that approximately 2704
obsidian artifacts were recovered from Unit II (Areas 6, 7, and 8). The items in Cigar
Box 3, which is estimated to contain a total of 600 artifacts, could be from either Area
3 of Unit I and/or from Area 8 of Unit II.
It is apparent that the obsidian frequencies presented here for Alibates Ruin 28 is
dramatically different than those reported by the Bakers (Baker 1940a:51, 1940b:44;
Baker and Baker 1940:20) and Lintz (1986a, 1986b, 1991).

These findings are

important for a number of reasons. First, they do not lend support to the idea that
dramatically different quantities of obsidian were recovered from Units I and II. As
such, these data cannot support the proposition that temporally distinct components
were present at Alibates Ruin 28. Thus, the proposition that exchange relations with
southwestern societies were essentially nonexistent from A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1350 and
then rapidly developed thereafter is also difficult, if not impossible, to support with the
quantities and spatial distribution of obsidian from Alibates Ruin 28.
Turning to the obsidian artifacts from Alibates Ruin 28 selected for XRF analysis,
Table V.5 presents provenience, descriptive, and metric information for these items.
The sample selected includes the full range of artifact and flake types and obsidian
varieties present in the collection. Items included in the analysis are 22 artifacts from
Unit I and 15 items from Unit II. Two items are labeled as being from areas not
known to have been excavated at the site (i.e., Area 16 and Area 22). The 22 artifacts
from Unit I are from Area 1 (N=2), Area 2 (N=18), and Area 3 (N=2). Two of the

514

items from Area 2 (i.e., from Cigar Box 2) had no labels and eight were labeled as
coming from surface contexts (e.g., 28 0/15). The artifacts from Unit II include five
from Area 6 (including 4 with no catalog numbers), two from Area 7, and two from
Area 8. Five obsidian artifacts came from room contexts (Rooms 23, 25, and 45) in
Unit II. Of note are the four specimens from Room 25. This domestic structure is
overlain by several other habitation and storage features (see Baker and Baker
2000:215, 218, 223) and suggests that it is an early house at the site.
The cataloging system used by WPA archaeologists is essentially the same as that
discussed earlier for Chimney Rock Ruin 51.

Items from non-room or “refuse”

contexts incorporate site, area, section, and specimen designations as noted above (see
Baker and Baker 2000:131). In contrast, items from habitation and non-habitation
rooms are designated with room numbers (e.g., 28 R23/4). Some artifacts from rooms
have individual specimen numbers as noted above, but others have an “M” or “A”
preceding the last number. The meaning of this code is not known.
The elemental concentrations for all of the obsidian specimens included in this
analysis are presented at the end of this appendix (Table V.6). Here, all measurements
are presented in parts per million (ppm). Elemental concentrations for artifacts from
four other Middle Ceramic sites of the region (i.e., Tarbox Ruin, McGarraugh Ranch,
Landergin Mesa, and Skull Springs) have been previously presented by others (see
Baugh and Nelson 1987; Lintz 1990; Mitchell et al. 1980). These items are not
included here.

Discussion
As noted in Chapter Six, Cerro Toledo Rhyolite obsidian from the Jemez
Mountains of north-central New Mexico dominates the current sample of sourced
obsidian artifacts from Middle Ceramic contexts of the Southern High Plains.

516

Combining all items in the sample (N=129), 108 (83.7%) are from Cerro Toledo, nine
(7.0%) are from Valle Grande, and 12 (9.3%) are from various other sources. These
trends are quite different than those observed for the Protohistoric period (A.D. 14501700) (see Figure V.2).

Figure V.2 Obsidian Source Areas by Time Period for Southern Plains Sites

Baugh and Nelson (1987) present XRF sourcing results for 80 obsidian artifacts of
Protohistoric age from the Southern Plains. These items were recovered from Duncan
(N=7), Goodwin-Baker (N=17), Taylor (N=6), Edwards I (N=31), Bridwell (N=7),
Montgomery (N=8), and Country Club (N=4).

Previously, Baugh and Nelson

(1987:Table 3) also included one obsidian flake from Skull Springs (34BV55) to this
list. Recent analysis of materials from this site by the author, however, indicates that

517

this site is Middle Ceramic in age. Of this sample (N=80), 60 (75%) are from Valle
Grande, New Mexico, 18 (22.5%) are from Cerro Toledo, and 2 (2.5%) are from other
sources (El Rechuelos, New Mexico and Malad, Idaho).
Figure V.2 documents a major shift from the use of Cerro Toledo obsidian during
the Middle Ceramic period to Valle Grande obsidian during the Protohistoric period.
Although the reasons for this shift are not yet understood, this cultural transition is
traditionally thought to be marked by the abandonment of the region by at least some
Middle Ceramic period societies and their replacement by Athapaskan or other
Caddoan speaking groups (for a review see Hofman 1989).

Even though Cerro

Toledo and Valle Grande sources are geologically close to one another, this dramatic
shift in resource use may signify the emergence of new exchange alliances and
possibly the control of obsidian sources (i.e., Valle Grande) by resident Puebloan
groups.

Hopefully, future research will shed additional light on the structure of

obsidian exchange on the Southern Plains and adjacent areas of New Mexico.

APPENDIX VI
Database of Recorded Antelope Creek Phase Settlements

In Chapter Four a study of Antelope Creek phase settlement patterns was
presented. This study focused on the distribution of permanent habitation sites of the
phase in Texas and Oklahoma. Permanent settlements, as opposed to special activity,
resource procurement, and other non-habitation sites, were identified in existing site
files by the presence of domestic architecture. Data used for this study were derived
almost exclusively from the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (2003) and site files
housed at the Oklahoma Archeological Survey in Norman (2002).
This site database represents a listing of all permanent habitation sites of the phase
that were recorded as of January 2003. It should be noted that additional habitation
sites, particularly in the Texas panhandle, are known, but remain unrecorded. For
instance, there are two sites in Hutchinson County and four sites in Roberts County,
which the author has visited. Although these sites have never been recorded, they are
included here. There are undoubtedly other similar cases along the Canadian River
and its tributaries of which I am not aware. In addition, since significant portions of
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles remain uninvestigated, it goes without saying
that additional sites surely remain to be documented.
These data are presented by county for each state. As noted in Chapter Four, site
records for surrounding counties were also examined, but failed to document
additional sites that could be firmly attributed to the phase as it is defined by Lintz
(1986a).
