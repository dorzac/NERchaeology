ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of a proposed 6100 foot (2 acres) water discharge
line in central Liberty County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates in March 2003 under Texas Antiquities Permit 3076 with William E. Moore
the Principal Investigator. This project falls under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The Federal Agency
involved in this project is the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality. Although
archaeological sites 41LB21 and 41LB22 are recorded as being close to the project
area, no evidence of these sites was found through shovel testing within the right-ofway. It is, therefore, recommended that the City of Hardin be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned with no further archaeological investigations. Copies of this
report are on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division; City of Hardin; and Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA).

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the City of Hardin through
J.F. Fontaine Associates, Inc. of Palestine, Texas to conduct a Phase I cultural
resources survey of a proposed water discharge line in central Liberty County (Figure
1). The line will begin at a proposed sewer plant and cross private property before
moving to the south side of County Road 2084. At the intersection of County Road
2084 and F.M. 1011 the line turns to the north and parallels the east side of this road. It
will follow this road in a borrow ditch for approximately 1500 feet before ending at a
discharge point on the south bank of Barrett Bayou. The total length of the water line is
approximately 6100 feet (two acres). The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5'
topographic map Capers Ridge dated 1984 (provisional edition) (Figure 2). The
proposed water line will involve an eight inch pvc pipe in a twelve inch wide ditch. The
pipe will be covered with 36 inches of dirt. The permanent easement will be 15 feet
wide with no temporary construction easement.
Liberty County is located in Northeast Texas, an area known to contain
significant archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a cultural
resource study by a professional archaeologist was warranted according to Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
Federal agency involved in this project is the Texas Commission for Environmental
Quality. Since this project will be placed in state and county rights-of-way, and the
portion on private property represents a public easement, an antiquities permit was
required. Permit 3076 was issued to BVRA by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division. The project number assigned by BVRA is 03-06. The field survey
was conducted on March 7, 2003 by Edward P. Baxter with William E. Moore assuming
the duties and responsibilities of Principal Investigator. The permit application was
signed for the Texas Department of Transportation by Owen Linbauer, Supervisor for
Archaeological Studies and for the City of Hardin by William E. Haynie, Mayor.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following statements were taken from the published Soil Survey of Liberty
County by Kirby L. Griffith (1996:1-2). Approximately 58% of the county lies within the
Gulf Coast Prairie major land resource area, known locally as the coast prairie. The
main crops produced in this area are rice and soybeans. About 42% of the county lies
within the Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods major land resource area, known locally as the
flatwoods. The area is slightly dissected by drainage ways. The surface has low relief
and consists primarily of large, nearly level areas that have slow drainage. The
flatwoods merge with the coast prairie without a noticeable change in elevation.
Woodland is the major land use with both pine and hardwood timber being produced. In
the southern part of the county the elevation ranges from 20 feet above sea level in
contrast to 210 feet above sea level in the northern part. There are two major drainages
within the boundaries of Liberty County, the San Jacinto River and the Trinity River.
In Liberty County summers are hot and humid. Winters are typically mild and are
only occasionally interrupted by cold air from the north. Rainfall occurs throughout the
year. In winter, the average temperature is 52 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average
daily minimum temperature is 41 degrees. The average summer temperature is 82
degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily maximum temperature is 92 degrees. Total
annual precipitation is 53.6 inches. Of this, nearly 53.6 inches (54%) fall in April through
September.
The route of the water discharge line passes through five soil types (Figure 3):
Kaman clay, occasionally flooded (Ka); Katy fine sandy loam (Kg), Spurger-Waller
complex, 0-2 percent slopes (SwB); Verland clay loam (Ve); and Woodville fine sandy
loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes (WvD). These soils are described by Griffith (1996).
Ka soils are described by Griffith (1996:27) as nearly level soils that are found
along the flood plains of the Trinity River and other large streams. Typically, the surface
layer of Ka soils is an extremely firm, moderately acid, very dark gray clay about 20
inches thick. This soil is poorly drained, surface runoff and permeability are very slow,
and the available water capacity is high.
Kg soils are described by Griffith (1996:28) as nearly level soils found on uplands
of the coast prairie. Typically, the surface layer is a very friable, moderately acid, dark
grayish-brown fine sandy loam about three inches thick. The upper part of the subsoil,
from a depth of 23 to 29 inches, is a firm, moderately acid, yellowish-brown clay loam
that has red and grayish-brown mottles. It is moderately well drained, and surface
runoff is slow.

Figure 3. Project Area on Soils Map

SwB soils are described by Griffith (1996:38) as nearly level soils found on
stream terraces. Typically, the surface layer of the Spurger soils is a very friable,
moderately acid, dark yellowish-brown fine sandy loam about three inches thick. The
subsoil, at 12 to 33 inches, is a firm, very strongly acid red clay. Spurger soils are
moderately well drained, permeability is slow, and water capacity is high. The surface
layer of the Waller soils is a firm, strongly acid, dark grayish-brown loam. The upper
part of the subsoil, from 5 to 35 inches, is a firm, strongly acid grayish-brown and dark
gray loam. Waller soils are poorly drained, surface runoff and permeability are slow,
and water capacity is high.

5

Ve soils are described by Griffith (1996:40) as nearly level soils in plane to
slightly concave areas of the coast prairie. Typically, the surface layer is a firm,
moderately acid, grayish-brown clay loam about three inches thick. The upper part of
the subsoil, from a depth of 3 to 27 inches, is very firm, moderately acid, light brownishgray clay. This soil is somewhat poorly drained, surface runoff is slow, permeability is
very slow, and the available water capacity is high.
WvD soils are described by Griffith (1996:45) as a moderately sloping soil on
uplands along drainage ways. Typically, the surface layer is a very friable, very strongly
acid, very dark grayish-brown, fine sandy loam about three inches thick. The
subsurface layer, from a depth of 3 to 6 inches, is a very friable, very strongly acid,
brown fine sandy loam that has strong brown mottles. From a depth of 6 to 30 inches,
this soil is very firm, very strongly acid red clay that has mottles in shades of gray. This
soil is somewhat poorly drained, surface runoff is rapid, and permeability is very slow.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Liberty County is located in the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region of
the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the Department of Antiquities Protection in
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993). The county is located in the Southeast Texas cultural-geographical
region (Region 6) as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:88-90) in a statistical overview. At
the time the overview was published, Liberty County was 8th in the region with 36
known archeological sites. The 36 sites comprised 2.21% of the region and .18% of the
state. As of March 4, 2003, there were 94 recorded prehistoric and historic sites in
Liberty County (TARL site files). The Archeological Bibliography for the Southeastern
Region of Texas (Moore 1989) cites 76 references for the county. Although many of
these investigations have been small area surveys, often resulting in no sites being
recorded, several projects involving larger areas have been conducted.
The earliest large project in the area was a survey of the Wallisville Reservoir in
Chambers and Liberty counties. This was a major, long-term salvage project begun in
the mid-1960s by Harry J Shafer (1966) for the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(TASP). Other research relevant to this reservoir includes works by Aten (1967),
Ambler (1970), Gilmore (1974), Fox et al. (1980), Good (1983), McIntire (1979a, 1979b,
1979c), Stokes (1985), and Weinstein et al. (1988). Aten's Ph.D. dissertation (Aten
1979) and a later publication (Aten 1983) synthesize his work at Wallisville Reservoir.
The next large-scale project in the area was a survey of the Big Thicket National
Preserve which covered six counties in Southeast Texas. This study was initiated by
the Anthropology Laboratory at Texas A&M University (Shafer et al. 1975) and
examined the 550 acre Loblolly Unit in Liberty County. Overviews of the historic
resources of the Big Thicket area, including the Liberty County portion, were prepared
by Dethloff and Treat (1975) and Treat and Dethloff (1978). Other studies involving the
remainder of the Big Thicket are referenced in the bibliography by William Edward
Moore cited above (Moore 1989). Other major projects involving Liberty County include
the Channel to Liberty project (Prewitt et al. 1986; Nash and Rogers 1992) and a survey
of the Trinity River Basin by Southern Methodist University (Richner and Bagot 1978).
In 1995, Brazos Valley Research Associates conducted a study of the Liberty
Levee project for the City of Liberty (Moore 1995) that examined a 4.5 mile levee route
with an average right-of-way of 50 feet (27.3 acres), two proposed borrow areas (one
acre each), and a 6.6 acre detention pond. This investigation recorded five prehistoric
sites (41LB88, 41LB89, 41LB90, 41LB91, and 41LB92) within the project area and a
previously recorded prehistoric site (41LB7) located within the right-of-way of the
existing levee. This site was assessed in 1993 by Bryan Guevin of the United States
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, and was destroyed. This site and the route of
the existing levee were not investigated during the current survey. No new sites have
been recorded in Liberty County since this study.

7

The most recent field project in the vicinity of the current project area involved an
archaeological survey of ten selected landforms in the Trinity River National Wildlife in
2003 by Edward P. Baxter (Baxter and Moore 2003). No previously unrecorded sites
were identified, and one previously recorded site (41LB5) was revisited and found to be
greatly disturbed.
A major contribution to the archaeological record of Liberty County was made by
Andy Kyle, a local collector from Liberty, Texas. Mr. Kyle collected over 5000 projectile
points in the area and maintained a record system that allows each artifact to be
correlated by site. In 1986, Sheldon Kindall and Leland W. Patterson, members of the
Houston Archeological Society visited Mr. Kyle and cataloged the collection (Kindall and
Patterson 1986). In addition to identifying the points by type and age, they obtained site
numbers for each site represented by the collection. As a result of this effort, 37 new
sites were recorded for Liberty County.
Two of the sites (41LB21 and 41LB22) are very close to the project area. The
actual boundaries of these sites are not known, and the location of 41LB22 is indicated
on the TARL map as uncertain. It is possible that the entire ridge on which these sites
are located is actually one large site. Since Mr. Kyle did no formal testing and visited
these sites many years ago, the site plottings are based on his memory. It is also
possible that the proposed water discharge line may pass through the area marked as
41LB21. According to the site forms at TARL, sites 41LB21 and 41LB22 were originally
recorded by Elton Prewitt (1973) during the Louisiana Loop Pipeline project, apparently
based on the word of Mr. Kyle. Unfortunately, the site plottings are the only record of
these sites as site forms were only partially completed by Prewitt. Sheldon Kindall
prepared an updated form for 41LB22 in 1986 who probably plotted both sites on the
TARL maps.
A review of the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series authored by
William E. Moore and published by the Texas Historical Commission from 1988 through
1992 revealed sporadic small area surveys, many resulting in negative findings.
Overviews of the area are included in the works by Dillehay (1975), Ambler (1988),
Aten (1979, 1983), Briggs (1971), Coastal Environments, Inc. (1977), Fox et al. (1980),
Sciscenti (1972), Shafer et al. (1975), Weinstein et al. (1988), and Story, et al. (1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Allegra Azulay at TARL. Two archaeological sites
found to be near the construction corridor were plotted on a project map for use in the
field. These sites appear on the topographic map as Appendix I to this report. The
Project Archaeologist visited the project area with Roberta Fregia before conducting the
field survey to make sure that all shovel tests would be excavated within the
construction corridor and not outside the project area right-of-way.
The entire right-of-way was walked by the Project Archaeologist who conducted
shovel testing and inspected all disturbed areas for evidence of displaced cultural
materials that might be exposed on the surface. Although a ditch covered with grass
and recently mowed was observed along most of the east-west section of the right-ofway, a section with good surface exposure was noted in the area of deepest sand
between shovel tests 7 and 13.
In the area where borrow ditches were present, shovel tests were excavated
between the ditch and existing utilities. All earth excavated through shovel testing was
screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was kept (Appendix II). In all,
23 shovel tests were dug, and the approximate location of each test is depicted on the
topographic map Capers Ridge that has been drafted to serve as a project area map
(Figure 4). The Project Archaeologist worked from east to west and was able to number
the tests consecutively from 1-23. A digital camera was used to document the field
conditions present during the survey.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of site records at TARL revealed two previously recorded prehistoric
sites (41LB21 and 41LB22) in close proximity to the project area. The site forms are
incomplete; therefore, very little information is available regarding these sites. These
sites are depicted on the topographic map Capers Ridge in Appendix I. No previously
unrecorded archaeological sites were found to exist within the construction corridor as
currently planned. No evidence of previously recorded sites 41LB21 and 41LB22 was
found during shovel testing in the general area.
The terrain varied from a low-lying area to the east (small creek crossing) with
standing water, palmetto plants, and clay at or near the surface to higher ground (50
foot contour) containing deep sandy soils. In this area shovel tests 7-14 contained sand
with depths from 40 to 80 cm. At the western end of the project area soils became
shallow again with clay at or near the surface. Disturbance along the county road was
observed in the form of a shallow borrow ditch and buried utilities. Along Farm-toMarket Road 1011, the project area is located in a very disturbed borrow ditch created
when the highway was constructed. In this area the edge of the landform was greatly
modified during the highway construction to create a more stable slope to prevent future
erosion and maintenance. Overall, the entire project area right-of-way has been
disturbed through road construction, plowing, and other land altering activities.

11

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found within the construction
corridor, and no evidence of previously recorded sites 41LB21 and 41LB22 was found.
It is, therefore, recommended that the City of Hardin be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned with no additional archaeological investigations. It is always
possible that areas containing cultural resources are missed during any archaeological
survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during
construction of the proposed water line, work in that area should cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with
BVRA and the City of Hardin.
