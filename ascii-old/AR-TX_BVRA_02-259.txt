ABSTRACT
A cultural resources survey was conducted at an organic vegetable farm in
Travis County (185 acres) by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in February
of 2012. The client proposes to construct a farm irrigation system that includes the
drilling of water supply test wells, permanent wells, an underground pipeline, a reregulation reservoir and associated drainway, a pump station, and an area in the center
of the farm that will contain a cold storage facility, offices, and other facilities.
Four high probability areas were identified, and sites were found at three of these
areas. Site 41TV2402 is historic and was probably first occupied in 1906 when an
unknown structure believed to be a house was constructed. Later, the land was used for
dairy farming, row crop production, and most recently for hay production. This site has
been totally destroyed, and a bridge that is believed to be associated with the 1906
structure is in poor condition. Site 41TV2402 and the bridge are in areas not associated
with the proposed irrigation project and are not considered worthy of additional work or
protection. Sites 41TV2403 and 41TV2404 are prehistoric, and they are located on the
north and south banks of Dry Creek. These sites are described in this report as camps
of unknown age and function. The presence of fragments of mussel shell at both sites,
however, suggests that the procurement and consumption of this species of mussel was
one of the activities conducted at these sites. The primary source of raw material for
lithic artifacts in this area is believed to be gravels in the Colorado River.
Copies of the report are on file at the THC, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA), and Johnson’s Backyard Garden.

INTRODUCTION
Johnson’s Backyard Garden is an organic vegetable farm located in southeast
Travis County (Figure 1). The owner has applied for funding from the United States
Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA) for financial assistance. The
THC reviewed this request and has recommended an archaeological survey to be
performed prior to beginning construction on this project. In order to satisfy this
requirement, the client retained BVRA to perform this service.
Construction plans include 20-30 water supply test wells, 4-5 permanent wells,
an underground irrigation pipeline system, a re-regulation reservoir and associated
drainway, a pump station, a perimeter road, and a facilities area. The client will also
construct a six-acre development site located in the center of the property that includes
greenhouse facilities, office and cold storage/packing facilities (FSA loan application
pending), equipment barn and shop facilities, event space, commercial kitchen facilities,
and parking facilities. With the exception of the wells (exact location not known), the
proposed improvements are depicted in Figure 2.


The test wells will be four inches in diameter and approximately fifty feet
deep. Any test wells not fully developed will be immediately backfilled by
the drilling company.



The permanent wells will be drilled by a licensed Texas driller using a
portable drilling rig. The completed well pad area for each well will be
about 15 feet by 15 feet in size and will include a metal building to enclose
the pump and equipment. Overhead electrical service will also be installed
as required to provide power to the permanent well locations.



The irrigation pipeline will consist of five primary pipeline laterals that vary
in size from 6 inches to 16 inches that will be placed in trenches at a depth
of 3 feet. The width of the trenches will be 16 inches. These laterals will
be placed 450 feet apart. Most of the risers will be attached to the pipe at
intervals of 300 feet. One segment of pipe will cross Dry Creek. The
proposed irrigation system will expand the area that can be farmed from
43 acres to approximately 130 acres.



The size of the re-regulation reservoir will be 3 acres. It will be 14 feet
deep and occupy an area of approximately 300 feet by 420 feet. The
earth removed during the excavation of the reservoir will be used to
reduce erosion in a gully in the northwest part of the farm.

1



The drainway will be constructed to serve as a primary drain for the farm.
Excess water from the re-regulation reservoir, as well as surface water
draining from the fields, will be routed through the drain to Dry Creek as
needed. It will be less than three feet deep.



The pump station will be located adjacent to the re-regulation reservoir. It
will occupy a footprint of 10 feet by 15 feet and will be above ground. It
will be placed on a foundation that will have a minimal impact on the
subsurface.



The facilities area will include a green house, office, cold storage/packing
facilities, equipment barn, shop, event space, commercial kitchen, and
parking area.

The project area map (Figure 2) was created from a map prepared by
Progressive Earth Engineering, the engineering firm who is designing the project. The
area is depicted on the 7.5' USGS Webberville topographic quadrangle dated 1963 and
photorevised 1989 (Figure 3).

ENVIRONMENT
Travis County is located in Central Texas within the Texan Biotic Province as
defined by Blair (1950). The size of the county is 1022.06 square miles. The climate is
considered to be humid subtropical. The January mean minimum temperature is 39°
Fahrenheit and July mean maximum temperature is 95° Fahrenheit. The total annual
precipitation is 31.9 inches. The climate is ideal for crops such as sorghum, corn,
cotton, grains, and pecans. Livestock include cattle and hogs. Significant natural
resources include lime, stone, sand, gravel, and oil and gas. The county is drained by
the Colorado River and its tributaries. The northern boundary of the project area is on a
high bluff overlooking the Colorado River, and Dry Creek (a tributary of the Colorado
River) passes through the southern portion of the project area (Figure 4). Elevations in
the county range from 400 feet to 1330 feet with the highest landforms in the central
and western part of the county. According to the soil survey for Travis County
(Werchan et al. 1974), the soils in the project area are described in the soil survey for
Travis County as Bergstrom silty clay loam, 0-1% slopes (BgA), Bergstrom silty clay
loam, 1-3% slopes (BgB), Miller Clay (MC), and Trinity clay, frequently flooded (TW).
The Bergstrom soils are found over most of the project area. Miller Clay is found along
a narrow strip in the west-central part of the project area, and the soil along the bank of
Dry Creek is Miller Clay. At the time of this survey, most of the area had been cleared
for cultivation but wooded areas were present along Dry Creek and the bluff overlooking
the Colorado River. No attempt was made to identify the species of trees and other
plants present.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Travis County is located in the Central Region of Texas as defined by the Texas
Historical Commission (Simons and Moore 1997) (Figure 5). According to a statistical
overview prepared by the Office of the State Archeologist (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
project area is in the Central Texas Cultural-Geographical Region. This region was first
in the state in terms of number of sites recorded in 1985 with 3507. Travis County was
third in the region in 1985 with 417 known sites. Today, there are 2401 documented
sites in the county. According to Biesaart et al., the prehistoric sites in Travis County
consisted of Paleoindian (n=9), Early Archaic (n=23), Middle Archaic (n=39), Late
Archaic (n=30), General Archaic (n=44), and Late Prehistoric (n=42). Seventeen sites
were listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and 121 sites had been
designated as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). The major form of disturbance
was the result of erosion (358 sites) and construction (137 sites). Surface collection
and vandalism was documented for 136 sites, and 11 sites were listed as destroyed.
Forty-seven sites had been excavated, 91 had been tested by hand, and 4 had been
tested by machine. Types of sites include burned rock middens (n=95), shell middens
(n=9), quarries (n=12), and areas where stone tools had been manufactured (n=91).
Hearths had been identified at 31 sites, and burials were present at 17 sites. MercadoAllinger et al. (1996) compiled data for the Central and Southern Planning Region of
Texas that includes Travis County and discusses threats to archaeological sites such as
population growth, production of oil and gas, highway construction, surface mining,
agriculture, reservoirs, and vandalism.
W. B. Hempkins recorded the first site in Travis County (41TV1) in 1957. It is
described as being in a fallow field consisting of black soil. According to the site form,
artifacts were numerous and consisted of Angostura, Bulverde, Darl, Ellis, Martindale,
Meserve, Montell, Pedernales, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Tortugas projectile points as
well as manos, grinding stones, and scrapers. Subsequent sites have been recorded by
contract archaeologists, the Travis County Archeological Society, and individuals on
their own time.
The nearest site to the project area is 41TV2105. This is a prehistoric campsite
that was recorded by Luanda Skeete in 2004 for a LCRA transmission line maintenance
project (Hixson et al. 2006:344). According to the site form, the site is on a terrace
(elevation 395-402 feet) overlooking the Colorado River 270 meters to the northeast.
Artifacts observed include a Darl preform, Scallorn arrow point, bone-tempered sherd,
possible shell bead, numerous pieces of flint debitage and fragments of burned rock. In
addition, a disturbed hearth was seen on an eroded slope on the south end of the site.
At Shovel Test 2, artifacts were recovered from 0-60 cm and 80-90 cm. This site is
located approximately 0.65 km to the northeast of the current project area.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas in order to identify any previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and immediate vicinity and examined several contract reports
documenting work in the area. Jean Hughes checked the site files at TARL for
previously recorded sites, and she copied historic maps that include the project area.
On February 8, 2012, the Principal Investigator visited the project area in order to get an
idea of what would be needed and to discuss the project with the client. Based on the
maps provided and the initial visit to the site, four high probability areas were identified.
These are the bluff overlooking the Colorado River (Area A), the site of a demolished
house and outbuildings (Area B), the north bank of Dry Creek (Area C), and the south
bank of Dry Creek (Area D). On February 9, 2012, the initial field survey was conducted
under the supervision of William E. Moore with assistance from Cody Handlin. The
survey was continued on February 27, 2012 with Cody Handlin, Gina Kunda, and
Sergio Martinez; and the final day of survey was on February 28, 2012 with Gina Kunda
and Mike Crockett. Shovel tests and approximate site boundaries are depicted on
Figure 6.
Area A
Area A consists of 1800 feet of bluff overlooking the Colorado River. The
extreme edge of the bluff is thickly wooded. Next to the woods is a road that has been
compacted due to the frequent use of vehicles. Adjacent to this road (due south) is the
beginning of cultivated fields. At the time of our visit, some of these fields were fallow,
and surface visibility was excellent. A thorough surface inspection of this cultivated area
for a distance of 120 feet from the road was conducted, and no cultural materials were
observed. The client provided a farm tractor equipped with a bucket for the purpose of
investigating the subsurface to a greater extent than could have been accomplished
with shovels. Three trenches were excavated to depths of approximately one meter,
and each was 2.4 meters by 2.4 meters in size (Figure 2). The soil is dark clay loam
and uniform in color throughout. Trench 1 is illustrated in Figure 7. No profile drawings
were made because there were no clearly discernible changes in the profiles. No
features were observed, and the only lithic materials present were a very few small
pebbles. Samples of the excavated earth were screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth.
No cultural materials were observed in the plowed field. No additional work in this area
was considered necessary. This effort was documented by trench forms (Appendix I),
project notes, and digital photographs. Control for the trenches was created using a
hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) with an accuracy of less than five feet and
a metric tape.

Area B
This area is the site of a structure constructed in 1906 and a dairy farm that was
in operation during the middle of the 20th century. This area was investigated by a
surface inspection. Notes were taken regarding the kinds of artifacts present, and the
area was photographed with a digital camera. In addition, historic maps on file at TARL
and the Austin History Center were reviewed and an oral interview was conducted with
Joe Cook who has lived in the area since 1961.
Area C
This area is the north bank of Dry Creek. The investigation consisted of shovel
testing and a 100% surface inspection. The area had been cultivated in the past but the
fields were fallow at the time of our visit. Surface visibility was excellent due to the fact
that very little ground cover was present. Small cobbles and pebbles were scattered
across the surface and among them we observed several flakes, cores, scrapers, a
quartzite hammer stone, a mano made of quartzite, and a fragment of freshwater
mussel shell. It was getting late, but we decided to dig a shovel test to see if we could
recover buried cultural materials and determine the depth of the site. The soil is dark
clay loam. Due to the clay content, much of the soil had to be examined by hand as it
was not easy to screen. Using a GPS, we excavated the shovel test as close as
possible to the southernmost riser depicted on the project area map provided by the
client (Figure 2). At 40 cm, we encountered a concentration of ten flakes. No artifacts
were found below this depth, and the test was terminated at 60 cm. This area has been
designated as prehistoric site 41TV2403. A shovel test log (Appendix II) was used to
record the depth of each test and other relevant data.
On February 28, 2012, I returned to this site with Cody Handlin, Gina Kunda, and
Sergio Martinez. We dug 12 shovel tests over a large area, but no tests were dug south
of the discovery test because the southern boundary is Dry Creek and much of the area
was thickly wooded. To the east, we continued to dig tests and find artifacts in that
direction even though we were on a gradual slope that terminates in a low area (swale)
that is viewed as the eastern boundary. Earlier, we had walked over the area on the
other side of the swale. The surface visibility was 100%, and no artifacts were
observed. This landform had been severely disturbed through unidentified earth moving
activities. Therefore, we think that the site ends very close to our last shovel test (13) in
this direction.

13

Area D
This is the south bank of Dry Creek. The Principal Investigator visited the area
on February 27, 2012 with Gina Kunda, and they conducted a 100% Pedestrian Survey.
A sparse scatter of artifacts was observed, and they collected flakes, a tested cobble,
scraper, chopper, cores, and a fragment of freshwater mussel shell. The soil is clay
loam, and the surface visibility was excellent due to past cultivation and tree and brush
removal. Two areas of woods had been cleared exposing the dark Trinity Clay. There
were many depressions where trees had been removed, and no cultural materials were
observed in either of these areas. Natural chert cobbles large enough to be suitable for
the manufacture of stone tools were few in number. This area has been designated as
prehistoric site 41TV2404.
On February 29, 2012, a return visit was made to determine the size and depth
of this site through shovel testing. The majority of shovel tests were excavated in the
area where artifacts had been observed on the surface. First, a row of four shovel tests
was excavated from east to west at intervals of thirty meters along the high point of the
land form. They were dug to a depth of 100 centimeters and were negative. A second
row of shovel tests was excavated from west to east at intervals of thirty meters, and
each test was thirty meters south of those in the first row. A fourth test was not dug on
this row because it would have been on a slope. There were two large burn areas that
contained the remains of stumps that had been burned, and no shovel tests could be
dug in these areas. One of these burn areas is depicted in Figure 8. A shovel test log
(Appendix III) was used to record the depth of each test and other relevant data.

At the beginning of this project I was not told about the re-regulation reservoir,
drainway, pump station, cold storage building, offices, and other facilities. My research
design and budget was based on the map given to me prior to the field survey, and not
one of these planned improvements was depicted on that map. Although the reservoir
will be dug to a depth of fourteen feet, it is far from any source of water and is a very low
probability area for a prehistoric site. Also, not one of the historic maps depicts any
structures in the area. The pump station is associated with the reservoir and is in the
same low probability area. Therefore, this area was not investigated. When I was
informed that there would be a drainway that would empty into the creek, I was
concerned that it might pass through site 41TV2403. I requested a map depicting the
path of the drainway, and it will miss the site. The cold storage building, offices, parking
lot, and other facilities will be within the boundaries of historic site 41TV2402. However,
this site had already been evaluated during the survey phase, and additional work was
not necessary.

16

RESULTS
Three sites were found as a result of this investigation. Site 41TV2402 is a 20 th
century dairy farm. A concrete pier on site with the date August 11, 1906 is an
indication that an earlier structure was present. Sites 41TV2403 and 41TV2404 are
prehistoric sites, and their age and function are unknown. These sites are discussed
below.
41TV2402
The earliest map known to depict the project area is the USGS topographic
quadrangle Austin dated 1896 (Appendix IV). It depicts a road and what appear to be
two structures in the project area. According to a map entitled “Map of Travis County
Roads: Surveyed by John L. Wallace, 1902,” the project area was owned by B. P.
Templeton at that time. This map is on file at the Austin History Center. A cement pier
with the inscription August 11, 1906 was observed in a pile of rubble, and this indicates
that a structure was constructed on that date (Figure 9). According to a map entitled
“Portion of the Antonio Navarro Grant Showing Garfield Oil Section in Travis County,
1923,” the land was still owned by Templeton in 1923. This map is on file at the Austin
History Center. It is not known when Templeton sold his property, but there was a
structure present on the 1936 highway map for Travis County (Appendix IV). According
to local resident Joe Cook who moved to the area in 1961, Richard Riley was the
landowner who operated a dairy at that location. The 15’ USGS Montopolis topographic
quadrangle dated 1955 (Appendix IV) shows six structures in the project area, and they
are believed to be associated with the dairy. Google Earth also depicts a house and
other structures at this location. According to Mr. Cook, the dairy consisted of a house,
dairy barn, milking parlor, hay barn, sheds and various outbuildings along with a few
houses for employees. Sheet 72 of the soil survey depicts two structures along the
eastern boundary of the project area. These are in the general where Mr. Cook said
houses for employees of the dairy were located.
At the time of this investigation, the only physical evidence of the former
structures was a pile of rubble; a cement slab that was used as the floor of a garage;
and various artifacts such as fragments of porcelain fixtures, various metal objects,
cement piers, asphalt shingles, window glass, and miscellaneous items that could not
be identified (Figure 10).
The 1936 highway map also depicts the road that borders a portion of the project
area to the east and the bridge that exists today (Figure 11). This bridge is made from
concrete and is in poor condition. Since it leads directly to a house and ends there, the
owner probably constructed it. The age of the bridge is not known but it is possible that
it was built in 1906 or earlier since it appears that a bridge would have been needed to
access the structure built in that year. It is rather primitive (no rebar reinforcement) and
is an example of local vernacular engineering.

It is not known how many structures were present in the project area at various
times, but not one is standing today and the only physical evidence is the rubble and
artifacts in the area of the house that was associated with the dairy. The size of this site
is not known since it would encompass not only the structures but also the land that Mr.
Riley used for his dairy.
According to a survey plat prepared by Weiser Becker Surveyors, P.C., this site
is located in the Jose Antonio Navarro Survey (Abstract 18) that was part of a 199.604
acre tract conveyed to Steven R. Baker (Volume 12724, Page 1366 of the Real
Property Records of Travis County, Texas). That portion of this tract where site
41TV2402 is located consists of 146.052 acres, and it was purchased by the client from
Steven Baker in 2011.
This site is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because it has been disturbed and does not retain integrity.
41TV2403
This site is located on the north bank of Dry Creek in a fallow field that had been
cultivated in the past. Site 41TV2403 was discovered when artifacts and mussel shell
were found on the surface during the initial visit to the area. Those collected include a
biface fragment, two scrapers, three hammerstones, three cores, one mano, one
possible mano, and five flakes. Thirteen shovel tests yielded twenty-four chert flakes
created from Colorado River gravels that could have been obtained from gravel bars in
the river. The artifacts are discussed in detail in an analysis by William A. Dickens that
will be part of the records curated at TARL. All of the artifacts found in shovel tests
were measured at a depth of 30 to 48 cm. Except for the discovery test (Shovel Test 1)
that produced ten flakes, the artifact return was minimal. Three tests yielded three
flakes, and the remaining five positive tests only produced one flake each. Most of the
flakes are interior or tertiary, and this suggests tool modification. Without diagnostic
artifacts, the age of this site cannot be determined. The presence of choppers, scrapers,
manos, and mussel shell is an indication of procurement and processing of local flora
and fauna, and the hammerstones may represent initial reduction of cobbles for the
manufacture of stone tools. The only disturbance observed was caused by plowing that
probably reached a depth of eighteen inches. The size of this site based on shovel
testing is estimated to be approximately 20,640 square meters (5.1 acres). Site
41TV2403 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of historic places because
This site is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because it does not have the potential to yield information under Criterion D.

21

41TV2404
This site is located on the south bank of Dry Creek in a fallow field that had been
cultivated in the past. The soil is clay loam, but it is darker in color and had a greater
percentage of clay particles than present at 41TV2403 on the opposite side of the
creek. It was discovered when artifacts and mussel shell were observed on the surface.
Those collected include four scrapers, one chopper, one core, one tested cobble, and
ten flakes. Ten shovel tests were dug in the area where the artifact concentration
appeared to be greatest, but not one test contained cultural materials. Since no
diagnostic artifacts were recovered, the actual age of this site is not known. Like site
41TV2403, procurement and processing of local flora and fauna was probably a major
activity. The only disturbance observed was caused by plowing that probably reached a
depth of eighteen inches. The size of this site based on artifacts observed on the
surface is estimated to be about 13,900 square meters (3.4 acres). This site is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places because it does not have
the potential to yield information under Criterion D.

22

RECOMMENDATIONS
Not one of the three sites in the project area is viewed as significant. The six
acres where the remains of site 41TV2402 is badly disturbed, and no further work in this
area is necessary. Even though site 41TV2403 contained buried cultural materials, this
site is not viewed as significant and no further work is recommended in this area.
Cultural materials at site 41TV2404 were only found on the surface of a plowed field.
Therefore, this site is not significant and warrants no further work. No site was found on
the bluff overlooking the river, and additional work in this area is also not warranted.
The remainder of the project area is in cultivation, and not in a high probability area for a
prehistoric site. The structures depicted on earlier maps are no longer present and they
are located in fields that are currently in cultivation. No further work is recommended for
these areas. It is always possible that cultural materials will be found in unexpected
areas. Should this be the case, work in these areas should cease until the situation can
be evaluated in consultation with BVRA, the THC, and the client.

Trench dug with a tractor equipped with a bucket. Soil consisted of clay loam
with an increasing amount of clay particles as the trench increased in depth. Soil
profile was consistently a dark gray clay loam. No profile was drawn because no
discernable soil horizons were noted. No cultural materials observed, and the
only lithics present consisted of a very sparse amount of tiny pebbles. Samples
of the excavated earth was screened through ¼ hardware cloth. A surface
inspection was conducted of a plowed field adjacent to the trench. No cultural
materials were observed, and there was a virtual absence of rocks of any size.

Trench dug with a tractor equipped with a bucket. Soil consisted of clay loam
with an increasing amount of clay particles as the trench increased in depth. Soil
profile was consistently a dark gray clay loam. No profile was drawn because no
discernable soil horizons were noted. No cultural materials observed, and the
only lithics present consisted of a very sparse amount of tiny pebbles. Samples
of the excavated earth was screened through ¼ hardware cloth. A surface
inspection was conducted of a plowed field adjacent to the trench. No cultural
materials were observed, and there was a virtual absence of rocks of any size.
