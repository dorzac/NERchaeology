ABSTRACT
The repeated occurrence of flakes possessing rem­
nants of unifacially trimmed edges was noted in the
analysis of chipping refuse from two late prehistoric
sites in west central Texas. Attributes on these flakes
suggest three techniques of removal-by a burin tech­
nique, by striking the uniface on the ventral surface

Texas Archeological Salvage Project
University of Texas
November, 1969

Three seasons of salvage investigations have
been conducted in the Robert Lee Reservoir by
the Texas Archeological Salvage Project of the
University of Texas at Austin (Shafer 1967,
1969, 1970). This reservoir, located in Coke
County along the Colorado River in west
central Texas, has now been completed. Two
late prehistoric sites, Gypsum Bluff and Sand
Creek, were excavated in the spring of 1969
and large lithic collections were recovered from
them. Considerable attention has been devoted
to an intensive technological analysis of these
tools and the chipping refuse. The topic of this
paper concerns one of the findings of this
research project.
The repeated occurrence of flakes or spalls
possessing remnants of a unifacially trimmed
edge was noted during the initial sorting of the
residual flake artifacts from the two sites. These
flakes characteristically possess positive bulbs
of percussion of the kind indicative of
hand-held
percussion
flaking
(Crabtree
1968:457-458). This observation coupled with
the normal occurrence of unifacially trimmed
edge remnants on the flakes suggests that these
flakes were intentionally removed from the
edge of a unifacially trimmed core (presumably
a scraper-like tool). Examination of the
trimmed edge remnants on the flakes under a
binocular microscope (magnification, 30x)
revealed dulling and polish on several specimens
identical to that which appears frequently on
extensively worn scrapers. Conversely, an
examination of all unifacial tools (termed
scrapers) recovered from the two sites revealed
examples of retouch that corresponds to the
flakes. Such unifacial artifacts exhibiting
retouch are chiefly manufactured from large
hand-held percussion flakes, and the retouched
edges are usually (although not always) found
on the distal (Le., opposite the bulbar) end.
These retouched edges were sometimes trim­
med and exhibit wear.
It is important in this discussion to
distinguish between a trimmed edge and one

that has been retouched. The term trimmed
refers to the fine marginal chipping that occurs
along the very edge of llnifacial and bjfacial
tools. Retouching refers here to specific
techniques of removing the dulled, trimmed
edges, and rejuvenating the scraping edge.
Granted, a scraper edge can be rejuvenated by
trimming provided the edge is not too thick to
be effectively resharpened by pressure, but
eventually the bevel is going to be so steep as to
render the tool useless. Retouching removes
this steep bevel and makes the tool serviceable
again.

RETOUCH METHODS
Three methods of presumed uniface retouch
may be defined on the basis of three identified
kinds of flakes since these flakes indicate the
part of the uniface core from which they were

481

derived. For instance, retouch flakes show traits
which indicate that they were removed from
(1) the longitudinal, oblique, or transverse axis,
(2) the ventral side, or (3) the dorsal side of the
unifacial tool to be sharpened. Presumably,
rejuvenating flakes were all removed for the
same purpose by hand-held percussion flaking,
but the differences between the three removal
methods lie in the orientation of the uniface
core in regards tu the direction of the planned
blow. The methods are:

Retouch Method A: The removal of a dulled,
unifacially trimmed edge by this method is
accomplished by using the burin technique; an
excellent description of which is presented by
Epstein (1963:29-34). The trimmed edge of the
unifacial tool was struck and spalls were
removed transversely (Fig. 1 a); obliquely (Fig.

1 b); or longitudinally (Fig. 1 c), depending on
the angle of the blow relative to the unjface
edge. Spalls removed by this method possess
burin spall features; that is, positive bulbs of
percussion caused by removal blows which

[Vol. 35, No.4, 1970

produce facets that are generally flat or convex
(Fig. 3 a-d). Ripple marks caused by the force
of the blow are sometimes present, the
curvature of which indicates the direction of
the blow. Cross-sections of the burin spalls are

characteristically triangular or prismatic. Some
exhibit remnants of unifacially trimmed edges
at each end indicating such specimens were
detached transversely from a bilaterally trim­
med uniface or a flake blade (Fig. 3 c,d). Some
burin spalls exhibiting a negative bulb of
percussion on an opposing facet are also present
and in dicate that these spalls were removed in
se quence after a preceding spall had been
removed (Fig. 3 b) .

The frequent occurrence of such spalls
corresponds with a Significant number of
finished uniface tools ( scrapers) that exhibit
removal of one or more spalls struck from a
trimmed edge (Fig. 2 a·d ). These do not appear
to be true burins but the fortuitous result of a
technique to remove a dulled scraping edge.
Striking platfo rms on some may have been
prepared by chipping a broad, unifacially
prepared notch in one lateral edge of the

uniface (Fig. 2 a). Such a notch would create a
suitable striking platform for burin spall
removal allowing greater control in producing
the desired scraper angle. The angle created by
the removal of the burin spall is not usually
perpendicular to the axis of the cross section
(Fig. 2 a-c). Rather, the blow was planned in
such a way as to create an edge with an acute
angle of less than 90° on the uniface core. An
edge with an angle between 45° to 75° is
suitable for scraping purposes. For example,
Wilmsen (1968: 158-159) measured 269 Paleo­
Indian end scrapers and found edge angle values
centered on 66° to 75°; but values from 46° to
55° were also well represented.
Method A retouch is the most frequent form
recognized on the unifaces from both sites.
Trimming and use of the retouched edge is also
evident on some specimens (Fig. 2 a,c).
Attempts were made without success to fit
spalls to specific examples of scrapers exhibit­
ing this kind of retouch.
Retouch Method B: This technique involves
striking the ventral surface of the scraper near
the edge in such a way as to remove a section of
the trimmed edge (Fig. 1 d). This method
creates a sharp new edge with an angle suitable
for scraping (varying from about 40° to 70°).
Flakes produced by this technique possess, in
addition to trimmed edge remnants, tiny cones
of percussion on the ventral side (Fig. 3 e-h).
However, if a series of such retouch flakes has
been removed, the edge is usually quite sinuous
and is in need of trimming. Once trimmed,
characteristics of B-type retouch are largely
obliterated. This is so because when the tiny
cone of percussion breaks away from the parent
piece during removal, a corresponding negative
scar is expressed in the core or tool edge in the
form of a tiny, U-shaped or concave inden­
tation bordered on each side by a slight
protrusion (Fig. 2 e). The least amount of
trimming will remove these features.
There are two specimens in the collection,
one from each site, that are certainly examples
of this kind of retouch.
Retouch l'rfethod C: The trimmed scraping
edge serves as the striking platform which is
struck at an angle to remove a flake from the
ventral surface of the dull scraper (Fig. 1 e).
This technique creates a biface out of the
uniface, but the general plano-convex cross
section of the tool is usually retained (Fig. 2 g).
A portion of the dulled scraping edge is

antIQuIty

[Vol. 35, No.4, 1970

included in the removal and is retained on the
bulbar end of the retouched flake. Such flakes
are usually oval in outline and possess
prominent bulbs of percussion (Fig. 3 i-k). The
striking platforms of these flakes arc the
multifaceted trinuned edge of the uniface core.
As is the case in Method B, the newly formed
edge is quite sinuous (Fig. 2f,g). There are
several examples of this kind of retouch from
both sites.
DISCUSSION
More than one method of retouch is
sometimes found on a single specimen. For
example, one specinlen from the Gypsum Bluff
site (Fig. 3 j) exhibits attempts to remove a
unifacially trimmed edge first by Method A and
then by Method B. There is a small beak which
is created by the detachment of several burin
spalls, each of which broke away (as evidenced
by hinge fractures) without removing the
retouched edge.
Distribution of the retouched unifaces and of
fhe flakes produced by the above techniques
are presented in Table 1. Also given here is the
relative frequency of the retouched unifaces
and the three kinds of flakes in regard to the
total sample in each collection. The classifiable
flake sample includes the unmodified flakes
which possess striking platforms.
Of particular interest in these artifact
distributions is the high frequency of uniface
retouch activity. Retouching a single uniface
tool by any of the three methods (particularly
Method A, which is the most commonly
employed of the three) would not produce very
many flakes. In Method A, retouching could be
accomplished by removing one spall if all went
well (several times I have been able to
successfully remove an entire trimmed uniface
edge with one blow). At most, three or four
spalls may have to be removed to completely
refurbish an edge. Even so, to judge from the
distributional statistics, one can immediately
see the frequent use of this technique of
uniface retouch by the occupants of each site.
Retouch edge angle measurements were
obtained when possible on unifacial tools and
retouch flakes to further test the presumption
that these were methods to retouch a dulled
scraping edge. For example, it could be
expected that if the flakes were by-products of
this kind of activity, the retouch edge angles
should be consistently adequate for scraping

flakes should correspond to the complementary
angle on the edge of the unifacial tools .
Retouch edge angle measurements were only
obtained on uniface edges reSUlting from
Method A and Method B retouch (Fig. l/).
Also, retouch flakes removed by both methods
were easily measured for the obtuse angle of
removal relative to the ventral tool surface and
this angle, when subtracted from 180°, gave the
complementary or acute angle created on the
uniface core by the removal of that particular
flake (Fig. I fl. Flakes removed by both
methods were measured using a contact
goniometer. Flakes produced by Method C
retouch could not be accurately measured in
this way, however, because of the convex bulb
of percussion which creates or determines the
angle of the edge once it is removed. rn
measuring Method A flakes, the base of the
instrument (defined by line x-y, see Fig. I/) is
placed against the flat ventral surface remnant
of the flake and the revolving metal bar of the
goniometer (line z) is held against the burin
facet. The corresponding angle on the parent
piece would be the difference between the
angle just computed on the flake and 180". In
measuring Method B flakes, the ventral surfaee
remnant is also held against the base of the
instrument, and the revolving bar of the

3.0%

1.0%

12%

instrument is placed against the bulbar surface
of the flake. This angle will also give the
complementary angle of the parent piece.
Retouch edge angles on the unifacial tools are
measured by placing the ventral surface of the
specimen against the base of the goniometer,
and the metal arm is placed parallel to the flake
or burin facet (Fig. I/).
Edge angle measurements were taken on the
retouched edge of 40 unifaces from both sites
exhibiting Method A retouch. The values range
from 35° to 92"', and by inspection, there is a
significant portion of the sample falling
0
between 50° and 84 (Fig. 4). The correspon­
ding angles of 76 spalls produced by Method A
were also obtained (Fig. 4). These values range
0
from 76° to 145 with a significant modal
0
clustering between III 0 and 125 , and a
secondary peak value lying between 101° and
105°. The corresponding angle on the uniface
core in respect to the clustering should be 55°
to 64° with the primary group and 75° to 79°
with the secondary cluster.
The retouched edges of the two known
unifaces exhibiting Method B measure 48° and
54". Twenty-nine flakes produced by this
method were measured for corresponding
angles (Fig. 4). The modal increment. lies

Analysis of the attributes of three kinds of
retouch flakes which appear in waste flake
collections from two west central Texas sites
leads to the inference that these are by­
products of three methods of unifacial tool
retouch. Method A is a burin tcchnique which
removes a dulled edge. The unifacially trimmed
edge serves as the striking platform. Method B
consists of removing a dulled, unifacially
trimmed edge by striking the ventral surface of
the core artifact near the edge. Method C
consists of removing the dulled edge by striking
the dorsal surface of the tool near the edge,
creating a biface out of the uniface, but
retaining much of the plano-convex cross
section. The conclusions that these are indeed
by-products of uniface retouch are supported
by (1) the finding of unifacial tools possessing
features that would be expected if these kinds
of flakes were removed from them; (2) the
presence of the same kinds of wear patterns on
the trimmed edge remnants on the flakes that
are found on unifaces; (3) the mean angles of
the retouched edges are in general agreement
with the corresponding angles of the flakes or
spalls; (4) the retouched edges of some unifaces
are trimmed and exhibit the same kinds of wear
(dulling and sometimes polish) that is found on
unretouched edges of like specimens.
The occurrence of uniface retouch techni­
ques similar to or perhaps identical to Methods
Band C at the Piney Creek site in Wyoming

487

suggests the possibility that these techniques
may be quite widespread throughout the Great
Plains (Frison 1968). Frison noted and
described three techniques of scraper retouch at
this site; his category b flakes were removed by
a technique similar to Method B, and his
category c flakes are similar to those produced
by Method C. Future detailed technological
studies of chipped stone artifacts and waste
flakes from sites in the Plains and related areas
will undoubtedly yield some intriguing results,
and will provide the necessary data for
distributional studies for this and perhaps other
technological traits.
