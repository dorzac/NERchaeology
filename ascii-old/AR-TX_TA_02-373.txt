Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed 25646 Main Street Monopole site in northeastern Hays County, Texas. The Federal
Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1)
requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided
by the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer. The total area to be impacted is 5,625 square
feet (<0.13-acre), in addition to a 25-foot wide Access/Utility Easement. This is a new monopole
and infrastructure to replace an existing monopole at the site.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on July 12, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before seven shovel tests were excavated. No prehistoric or historic
cultural material was observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In July 2015, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within one
mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural resources
to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area.
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the PA.

Project Environment
The Project Area is situated in the northeastern portion of Hays County, within the Edwards
Plateau physiographic region of Texas, and in an area where the group(s) which occupied it were
advantageously able to exploit an ecotone encompassing riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted
plants and animals along the Balcones Escarpment. The Edwards Plateau, with elevations
reaching 2,250 ft above mean sea level (amsl) in northern Gillespie County (Allison et al.
1975:76), is a hilly region, gradually sloping to the southeast, and ending in the escarpment
running across the middle of the sub-region. The most common flora observed on the plateau
include juniper (Juniperus ashei), plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and agarita (Berberis trifoliata)
(Blair 1950:112; Van Auken 1988:45; Simpson 1988). Due to overgrazing by livestock and
restricted range fires, much of the plateau has been overtaken by juniper in modern times
(Buechner 1944:703-704; Van Auken 1993:199-210).
The Balcones Escarpment is a fault zone, consisting of blocky limestone, chalk, shale, and marl.
The escarpment slopes to the southeast from about 700-1,000 feet above mean sea level (Taylor
et al. 1991:119). The most economically important floral species are riparian nut trees, including
oak, walnut, and pecan that thrive along the rivers and creeks (Dalbey 1993:22; Van Auken
1988:55). The intertwined diversity in biotic resources existing along the escarpment provides an
ecotone in which humans could exploit a wide variety of plants and animals from season to season
(Collins 1995:366). The presence of prehistoric cemeteries found in areas along the escarpment
where seasonally rich food resources such as nut-bearing species, particularly acorn and pecan
trees, and prickly pear tunas may not be just a coincidence (Hall 1995:633-647).
More specifically, the Project Area lies at the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau, in central
Texas’s “Hill Country,” so named for its rugged, stream-eroded topography. The environmental
zone can be classified as upland. The annual average rainfall is about 33 inches per year (Batte
1984). The nearest known water source is Onion Creek, some 300 meters to the west, although
it flows only periodically. The creek is subject to flash flooding during locally heavy
thunderstorms.
Lithic resources in the form of Edwards formation chert can be observed in abundance within the
creek bed, and are available in the many cutbanks and second and third order tributaries that
dissect the Edwards formation. These resources and the documentation of multiple prehistoric
quarries along the escarpment suggest that raw materials for making stone tools were readily
available.
The predominant vegetation in the area is live oak (Quercus virginiana) and Texas cedar
3

(Juniperus ashei) (Simpson 1988:180, 301), along with native grasses, prickly pear, and yucca
in the open areas.
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the 25646 Main Street Monopole is to be constructed within Krum clay
(KrA). These deep soils are commonly found on nearly level stream terraces and valley fills in this
area of Hays County (Batte 1984). A typical soil pedon of Krum clay is as follows:
0 to 19 inches (0-48 centimeters [cm]): -- dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay, moderately alkaline and
calcareous.
19 to 49 inches (48-124 cm) – brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, moderately alkaline and calcareous.
49 to 69 inches (124-175 cm) – yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, moderately alkaline and
calcareous.

Cultural Context and Chronology

Introduction
The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archaeological region (Figure 5). The most
basic chronology of the Central Texas regions can be divided into either: (1) prehistoric cultural
groups with no specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented groups with a designated
tribal or band name.
Before Spanish soldiers
and Catholic missionaries
arrived in Texas, the
cultural activities of the
groups of prehistoric
Native Americans who
inhabited the region can
only be surmised from
what we can glean from
t he archaeol ogi cal
records at undisturbed,
and well-documented
sites. Historic cultural
groups are those
observed firsthand by the
Spanish soldiers and
priests beginning in the
late 1500s. The Spanish
then began recording
their encounters by
writing the names,
numbers, and living
conditions of the many
gro u p s of Nat i ve
Americans who lived in Figure 5. Map of Central Texas Archaeological Region (adapted
the region. However, from Black 1989).
there is a significant transition era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural
groups, and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; the transition era occurs
in the 1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Figure 6). Although
other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), the
most current and widely recognized chronology for Central Texas are those offered by Michael
5

Collins (1995; 2004).
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800 years ago
(Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique, fluted, finely flaked, and
blade-shaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools chipped on both sides, and
unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from river cobbles. Archaeologists
have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such as killsites, quarries, stone
tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in Central and South Texas;
however, no campsites or killsites have been found south of Bexar County (Hester
1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we term
as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters following
herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse that are
now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was not available, we
have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their diet by eating
turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381; 2004).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other types
of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical observations
such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central Texas archaeological sites,
archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into what we commonly
term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the Archaic has further been
defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive, they
capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).

Figure 6. Central Texas cultural chronology (primarily from Collins 1995; 2004).

Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some (e.g.,
Collins 1995; 2004) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000 and
7

4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent until
much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the climate
started changing in Central Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum of dry
climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the Native
Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods that
were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338;
Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date to this
period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous prickly
pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer and
rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:38; 20043).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they may
have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid
out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently used
over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over several
hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used to cook
not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al.
2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks are
called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred to
as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans inhabiting
Central Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over several hundred years.
Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the environment is questionable.
In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the two regions imply that change
may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995; 2004) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago. The large cooking ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned
rock middens, intensified during the Late Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although
the Native Americans of Central Texas still sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and riverine
plant foods such as nuts, the slightly cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue other
food goods. Even though by about 1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison no longer
predominated the now-dwindling grasslands of Central Texas (Dillehay 1974), the Native
Americans still hunted and/or gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, fish, and
turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, either
elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because of their generally highly nomadic
lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels until 1,000± years later (Story
1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’ hunter-gatherers not adapting to
8

the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a noticeable change in the styles/types of
killing dart points used during the Late Archaic. Dart points were manufactured to be used with
the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft with a dart point attached to it, and thrown or launched from over
the shoulder. It would not be until perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted
for use for hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart points tend to be much smaller than Middle
Archaic points, and the most common dart points that are found within the area are what
archaeologists call Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same characteristics
that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric assemblages left
behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style. Therefore, some
archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or Transitional Archaic”,
spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years ago - depending on
where in Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present archaeological sites were
living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number of burned rock midden sites
that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date to this time period, suggest
that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again take advantage of cooking and
eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g., Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found on
some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central Texas region adapted the
bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a dart point attached.
As such, the stone points devised for killing became much smaller and streamlined. In layman
terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts arrow shafts carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart
point. Archaeologists have found Edwards and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+
years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71). Concurrently, excavations by professional
archaeologists have provided evidence that Native Americans began using crude clay pottery
vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps trading vessels from the South, Southeast
Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any successful venture, the making of pottery was
refined so that vessels were used more, and the technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g.,
Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995; Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
9

ovens, or burned rock middens in which they roasted tubers, nuts, and some game animals (see
for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same period, the inhabitants may have increased
their dependence upon bison (Steele and Assad- Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests
that the sudden return of bison to Central Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains
north of Texas, and increased grassiness in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north
Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas during the
Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know that they began occupying the limestone
overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones
Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the
escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al.
1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967),
and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985).
Historic Period
Primarily beginning slightly over 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today Central Texas in everincreasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic
period in both Central Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the region. In
Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional period
between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as the
“Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and disrupted
by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in Central
Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the High Plains
of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of the
10

Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly demoralized
over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused by the forced
continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the world (Bolton
1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if not hundreds of
language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have been lost (e.g.
Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the Catholic
religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and hostile
environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support from
the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region, and
infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe, New
Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this treaty
took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of peaceful
coexistence in what is today Central Texas, in which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow
to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and
gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic.
Apaches continued to range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s,
pushed southward by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of central
Texas (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Weary of warfare with the Comanche, a few Apache
were beginning to seek asylum in the missions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around
5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast
of San Antonio (Jackson 1986).
In Hays County, a number of Spanish entradas visited the San Marcos springs and crossed the
San Marcos River below the springs enroute to east Texas in the 1600s and 1700s. Although
11

Mission San Xavier and the San Francisco Xavier Presidio were briefly located near the springs
in 1755-1756, they were moved to San Antonio. San Marcos de Neve was a failed attempt by the
Spanish to establish a settlement on the San Marcos River, a few miles south of the modern city
of San Marcos. However, after four years of flooding and Indian attacks by both Tonkawas and
Comanches, the settlement was abandoned in 1812 (Greene 1996; Horrell 1999). As for the area
around present-day Hays County, Indian hostilities were generally thwarted by the mid-1830s,
so that selected land grants issued by Mexico and the State of Texas were being occupied.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area
Hays County
The varied types of sites discovered in Hays County reflects the physiographic makeup of Hays
County that is situated predominately in the Edwards Escarpment Hill Country, versus the
Blackland Prairie located just to the east of the Project Area. That is, the number of prehistoric
lithic scatters and procurement sites in Hays County far outnumber the prehistoric open
campsites; to wit, there have been 164 lithic scatters/procurement sites documented, and 115
open campsites. Many archaeologists argue that this is due the abundance of raw material, as well
as the availability of water and subsistence resources on the Edwards Plateau and along the
Balcones Escarpment at various times in prehistory (e.g., McKinney 1981; Prewitt 1985; Collins
2004). Reflecting the same physiographic and particularly geologic makeup within the county,
there are 57 archaeological sites where burned rock middens have been documented, as well as
13 rockshelters, sinkholes, or caves.
Remarkably, there have been a relatively very high number of historic sites and historic
components on prehistoric sites recorded in Hays County. A total of 160 historic components
include such diverse entities as numerous 1800s and 1900s home sites and farmsteads, family and
communal cemeteries, log cabins, hand-dug wells, dams and mill races for gins, a lime kiln, rock
walls and stone corrals, stage stops and post offices, as well as the settlement of San Marcos de
Neve (discussed above), the General Burleson homestead site, and the route of the Spanish
Camino Real. Out of the 434 total recorded sites in Hays County, 25 have been designated as
State Archaeological Landmarks (Atlas 2015).
Archaeological Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Current Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites (Atlas 2015)
indicated that although the tower site had not been subjected to a formal cultural resources
survey, numerous other cultural resources surveys had been conducted and there are six
archaeological sites in close proximity to the Project Area. Their locations are shown in Figure
3, and the archaeological sites are briefly described in Table 1.

National Register Historic Properties within One Mile
Downtown Buda Historic District
The Downtown Buda Historic District, a six-block historic commercial zone, is located at the
heart of Buda, a traditionally rural town in northeast Hays County, about 13 miles south of
Austin, the Texas state capital. The district is typical of numerous commercial centers in towns
platted along emerging railroad lines that extended into Texas during the 1870s-1890s. It lies
entirely on the west side of the former International and Great Northern (I & GN) railroad line,
now Missouri & Pacific, and comprises Blocks 2-5 and the north half of Block 6 in the original
Town of Buda, founded in 1881. Virtually all of the town's historic brick commercial buildings
front onto Main Street, Buda's principal thoroughfare and the focus of the district. Main Street
extends along the west side of the railroad line as it passes through the small town. Most of the
district’s resources are oriented along a north/south axis, facing east toward Main Street and the
tracks but several dwellings at the rear of the lots front onto Austin Street and two commercial
buildings front side streets. The railroad line roughly parallels IH-35 about three miles to the east.
Buda is linked to IH-35 by Loop 4, once a country road with a handful of farmsteads lining its
path.
Onion Creek Post Office and Stagecoach House
The Onion Creek Post Office and Stagecoach House complex rests on a high bluff above Onion
Creek, about one quarter of a mile east of the small, Central Texas city of Buda. Buda lies about
13 miles south of Austin, in the northeast quadrant of Hays County where the gently rolling
blackland prairie begins to give way to the rocky Texas Hill Country. The city-owned complex
occupies a 51-acre tract of land on the north side of Loop 4, which connects the city of Buda to
IH-35, about one mile to the east. Set back about 150 feet north of Loop 4, the building complex
lies on a fairly flat site at the edge of bluff that drops to the creek along its north and east sides.
It is reached by a slightly curved dirt road flanked by a few trees and agave (cactus) plants. The
high, level part of the site is covered with native grasses and dotted with ancient Live Oaks. The
site drops sharply downward toward the creek on the east and is only slightly less steep on the
north, where the slope is overgrown with thick vegetation. Buildings consist of a rambling frame
house with a center-passage dwelling at its core, a one-room cut limestone post office building
with a metal shed attached to the rear elevation, a frame garage, and a frame shed. The house and
post office are the site’s most significant extant resources.

Buda United Methodist Church
This church was established in 1880 under the leadership of the rev. Thomas Garrett, one of the
pioneer Methodist circuit riders who conducted early services and camp meetings in the area
around Mountain City (2 mi. W). It was the first church in the new railroad town of DuPre, later
known as Buda, which began here soon after rail lines were completed the same year. The first
sanctuary was built at this site in 1882. Members of the congregation have included many pioneer
area settlers and prominent leaders of Buda.
Buda Christian Church
Organized in 1893, the Buda Christian Church met in the Methodist church building until a church
was built on this site in 1903. After it was destroyed in a 1909 storm, this structure was built in
1912. Membership began to decline in the 1940s, and the congregation eventually disbanded. the
building was used by various civic groups, and in 1981 housed a non-denominational church. The
one-story frame structure features elements of the Italianate and classical revival styles, with a
central, inset, pedimented entry; an offset tower; and pyramidal roof.
Buda
Originally known as Du Pre, Buda was founded along a line of the International and Great
Northern Railroad. Cornelia A. Trimble gave land for the townsite in 1881. The name "Buda" was
adopted in the late 1880s, although its origin is unclear. According to popular legends, it was
either related to Budapest, Hungary, or evolved from the Spanish word for widow, "viuda," and
honored the women who cooked in one of the local hotels. Buda was once the site of a variety
of businesses, including a theater, skating rink, newspaper, and two banks. The town was
incorporated in 1948.
First Baptist Church of Buda
In July 1882, the year after the founding of Du Pre, now Buda, M. Lawson, A. Teague and W.
A. Hancock petitioned the San Marcos Baptist Association for the formation of this church. The
first pastor was the Rev. D. A. Porter, ordained in the nearby Pioneer Baptist Church at Mountain
City. Services were conducted in a schoolhouse and a Methodist chapel until the 1890s, when the
first sanctuary was built. The church moved here in 1949, when the new stone building was
completed. Known as the Buda Baptist Church from 1889, the congregation adopted the present
name in 1967.

Project Goals and Methods

Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
14

The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC), Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the delineated
tract was conducted.
Seven shovel tests 30-cm in diameter were then excavated to between 20 and 80 cmbs (Figure
7). Soils matrices were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed
research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but
were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.

Seven shovel tests were excavated, ranging from 20 to 80 cmbs. In general, soils consisted of
dark brown clay loam in the upper 30 to 50 cmbs, underlain by brown clay, increasing in density
and scattered small (<2cm) limestone alluvial gravel content, increasing by volume with depth.
One test (ST1), was excavated in the driveway easement and encountered dense jagged gravel
immediately, suggesting a previously excavated utility trench; therefore ST 1 was terminated at
20 cmbs. Otherwise, soils were fairly uniform with no indication (other than ST1) of disturbance.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface within the Project Area was conducted, and seven
shovel tests were excavated. The surface was very even and manicured, suggesting mechanical
brush clearing and leveling in the not too distant past. No evidence of either prehistoric or historic
occupation was found either on or below the surface. Therefore, we recommend that the project
should proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered
as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such,
the project should proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural
resources are encountered during construction within the APE, work should immediately be
halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
