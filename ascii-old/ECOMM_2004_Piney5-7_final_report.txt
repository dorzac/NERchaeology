This report documents the findings and recommendations of a cultural resource inventory conducted on 1,612
acres of Federally owned land in Cass, Jasper, Angelina, Sabine, and San Augustine Counties in East Texas. The
project area includes 1,088 acres at Lake Wright Patman and 524 acres at Lake Sam Rayburn. Archaeological
fieldwork was conducted in February and March 2004 and included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by
intensive and systematic shovel testing. Nine hundred and twenty-four shovel tests were manually excavated.
Thirty-nine archeological sites were investigated including 24 previously recorded sites and 15 newly discovered
sites. Of the 24 previously recorded sites, 17 could not be verified in the field despite shovel testing. Most of these
unverified sites are located on the shoreline and have probably been eroded and destroyed since their original
recordation. These 17 sites are considered to be of unknown NRHP status pending further investigations. The
remaining 22 sites were fully documented including the 15 new sites and seven known sites. Of these 22 recorded
sites, one site is recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP, eight sites could not be clearly assessed
using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, and 13 sites are considered not eligible for the NRHP.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on seven separate tracts of land, totaling 1,612 acres, in Cass,
Jasper, Angelina, Sabine, and San Augustine Counties in East Texas. The project area includes
1,088 acres in two inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman and 524 acres in four parcels at
Lake Sam Rayburn. Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of
the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has
proposed timber harvesting within the parcels and, in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural
resource sites located on the parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the
undertaking.
Archaeological fieldwork was conducted between February 26, 2004 and March 16, 2004.
Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and systematic
shovel testing. Nine hundred and twenty-four shovel tests were manually excavated. Eighty of
the tests were positive including 70 positive tests on sites and 10 isolated positive tests.
Recovered artifacts included prehistoric flakes, ceramic sherds, and historic ceramics, metal, and
glass. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
Thirty-nine archeological sites were investigated including 24 previously recorded sites and 15
newly discovered sites. Of the 24 previously recorded sites, 17 could not be verified in the field
despite shovel testing. Most of these unverified sites are located on the shoreline and have
probably been eroded and destroyed since their original recordation. These 17 sites are
considered to be of unknown NRHP status pending further investigations. The remaining 22
sites were fully documented including the 15 new sites and seven known sites. Of these 22
recorded sites, one site is recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP, eight sites could
not be clearly assessed using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, and 13 sites are
considered not eligible for the NRHP.
Site 41CS37 is recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP.
The NRHP eligibility of sites 41AG19, AG37, CS45, CS72, CS73, CS74, CS81, CS82, CS83,
CS84, CS86, CS87, CS90, CS112, CS290, CS291, CS294, CS295, CS296, CS297, CS300, JP99,
JP126, JP127, and JP160 is unknown. These sites should be avoided and protected from adverse
impacts. If they cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to clearly
determine NRHP eligibility.
Sites 41CS38, CS46, CS75, CS88, CS89, CS292, CS293, CS298, CS299, CS301, CS302, JP159
and SB84 are assessed as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and no further work is
warranted.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.1 THE UNDERTAKING
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Lake Wright
Patman and 17,461 acres at Lake Sam Rayburn (acreages are outside conservation pools). Much
of this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the
existing management plans for the several reservoirs and in accordance with accepted
silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for selective
timber thinning. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not
clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface
but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archaeological sites, buildings,
structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).

All inventories were conducted on lands owned by the Federal

Government and managed by the USACE.
1.2 LOCATION
The project area is comprised of seven separate parcels located at Lake Wright Patman in Cass
County, and Lake Sam Rayburn in Jasper, Angelina, Sabine, and San Augustine Counties, Texas
(Figure 1-1). Together, the seven parcels total 1,612 acres and range in size from 88 acres at
McGee Hill South, to 628 acres at Mill Creek North (Table 1-1).

1.2.1 Lake Wright Patman
Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass
Counties. The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River
Counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in
honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding 2002). The dam was constructed between 1948
and 1957 for flood-control, conservation, and recreational purposes. Elevation of the
conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal elevation in winter is 220.6 ft above mean
sea level (AMSL) and 227.5 ft. AMSL in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft. AMSL.
During the summer the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation pool is
20,300 acres. Two parcels totaling 1,088 acres are currently planned for timber thinning.
The Armstrong Landing West Area is located in Cass County on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman, about 8 km northeast of Douglassville and about 30 km southwest of Texarkana
(Figure 1-2). Totaling 460 acres, this parcel is situated just west of Armstrong Landing on
County Road (CR) 2113 at Lake Wright Patman. The tract measures about 1,692 m east to west
by about 1,785 m north to south. It is located on the Douglassville USGS 7.5â topographic
quadrangle. Elevation is between 225 at the shoreline to 350 ft above mean sea level (AMSL).

The Mill Creek North Area is in
Cass County about 12 km north
northwest of Queen City (see Figure
1-2).

This parcel is located to the

west of Moores Landing Park, and
bordered on the east by CR 3558, on
the south by CR 3556, and on the
west by CR 3555.

The elevation

ranges from 225 at the shoreline to
350 ft AMSL. The blocky, angularshaped tract measures about 2.1 km

by about 1.3 km and totals about 628
acres. It is plotted on the Wright Patman Lake and Atlanta North USGS 7.5â topographic
quadrangles.
1.2.2 Lake Sam Rayburn
Lake Sam Rayburn is located on the Angelina River approximately 15 miles north of Jasper,
Texas. Authorized by Congress in 1955 for the purposes of flood control, hydroelectric power
generation, and conservation of water for municipalities, industry, agriculture, and recreation,
construction of the reservoir was begun by the USACE in 1956 and impoundment began in 1965.
Initially known as McGee Bend Reservoir, the lake was renamed in honor of Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives Sam Rayburn (USACE 2002). The lake is the largest body of water
within the boundaries of the State of Texas. At conservation pool level (164.4 ft above mean sea
level) the lake has approximately 750 miles of shoreline (USACE 2002). Approximately 17,461
acres of fee lands are managed by the USACE. Five tracts totaling 524 acres are currently
planned for timber thinning (Figure 1-3).
The McGee Hill South Area is in Jasper County just west of the Sam Rayburn Dam on the
south side of R255. The east side of the parcel consists of the area between the Dam and the
Angelina River, about 625 m north to south, and narrows to follow the south side of R255 for

about 2.3 km. The elevation ranges
from about 90 to 257 ft AMSL. The
area totals 88 acres and is plotted on
the McGee Hill and Ebenezer USGS
7.5â topographic quadrangles.
The McGee Hill North Area is
located in Jasper County just north of
the McGee Hill area (see Figure 1-3),
covering an area of land bordered on
the south by R255, on the north and

Figure 1-3 Inventory Areas at Lake Sam Rayburn.

east by Lake Sam Rayburn and Sam
Rayburn Dam, and on the west by private developed property.

This parcel replaced the

unsurveyable portions of the Hurricane Creek parcel due to heavy inundation in that area (see
Hurricane Creek Area below). This rectangular property measures 1.3 km east to west by 252 m
north to south and forms the northern side of McGee Hill. The parcel totals 74 acres and is
located on the McGee Bend USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle. Elevation ranges from about
160 ft at the shoreline to 250 ft AMSL.
The Massey Goode Branch Area is in Sabine County on the eastern shore of Needmore Point
on Lake Wright Patman; the bulk of the parcel is immediately west of Massey Good Creek and
contains the shoreline between the creek drainage and another unnamed drainage (see Figure 13). It is located about 8 km northeast of Douglassville. Totaling 113 acres, this parcel measures
about 500 m at its widest point on the south side by about 1.2 km north to south. It is located on
the Buck Bay USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle. The elevation ranges from lake level at about
160 ft to about 230 ft AMSL.
The South Powell Park Area is in San Augustine County at the end of CR 705 just to the east
of the community of Powell, on the north side of Lake Sam Rayburn. The parcel is within the
Angelina National Forest, and about 23 km northwest of Jasper (see Figure 1-3). Totaling 150
acres, about half of the parcel is a peninsula bordered by water on the east, west, and south sides
and containing a disposal pond facility, and the other half contains disused park facilities to the

north and east of Powell. The tract measures about 997 m east to west by about 1.2 km north to
south. It is located on the McGee Bend and Buck Bay USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangles.
Overall elevation is near 160 ft AMSL at the shoreline, thus making the area very swampy.
The Hurricane Creek and Islands Areas are located in Angelina County about 12 km west of
Huntington (see Figure 1-3). This parcel is located on the south side of Lake Sam Rayburn,
within a low area of land bordered by the drainage of Stanley Creek on the east side. The
elevation ranges from 160 at the shoreline to only 170 ft AMSL. As the lake elevations at the
time of the survey were high and the parcel was only slightly higher in elevation than the lake,
much of this parcel was inundated and unsurveyable. Thus, of the 173 acres initially scheduled
for survey, only 99 acres were dry enough to be shovel tested. The remaining 74 acres were
replaced by an area of equal size, McGee Hill North. The Hurricane Creek area was separated
into three mainland parcels and three island parcels, with the largest 500 m by 550 m and the
smallest 167 m by 129 m. The areas are plotted on the Etoile South USGS 7.5â topographic
quadrangle.
1.3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the region
included secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed
during the field inventory were typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus
echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly various
oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba), and the
American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Figures 1-4 and 1-5 illustrate typical landscape
views for the project.
Wildlife common to the area included whitetail deer, red fox, bobcat, tree squirrels, raccoons,
opossums, armadillo, nutria, otters, and mink. Lake habitats support a variety of turtles, frogs
and snakes, as well as largemouth bass, flathead catfish, channel catfish, white and black crappie,
white bass, and bluegill and other sunfish. Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker, as well as bald eagles, osprey, bobwhite, mourning dove, white pelicans, common
loons, herons, and egrets.

2.0 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
2.1 PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
A map and records search was conducted at the archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC Atlas online
database on January 7-8, 2004.

These searches determined that 24 previously recorded

archeological sites are plotted within the project APE, including six of the seven selected
inventory parcels. Six sites are located within the Armstrong Landing West area, and 12 sites are
located within the Mill Creek North area at Lake Wright Patman; at Lake Sam Rayburn, three
sites are located within the two McGee Hill areas, one site is present at Massey Goode Branch,
and two sites are located on the islands at Hurricane Creek (Table 2-1).
In 1970, a shoreline inventory of Lake Wright Patman, then named Lake Texarkana, was
conducted by the New Orleans District of the USACE (Briggs and Malone 1970).

This

inventory included the entire shoreline of the lake, including the banks of Armstrong Landing
West and Mill Creek North. Of the 18 previously recorded sites within these two parcels, all but
one, 41CS33, which was initially recorded in 1964, was recorded during this inventory. Each
one of these sites is described in more detail in Section 4.0.

As for the parcels at Lake Sam Rayburn, the previously recorded sites were recorded through
several different surveys or information obtained through local collectors. Two sites within the
McGee Hill area, 41JP127 and 41JP126, were located during a seismic line survey conducted by
the U.S. Forest Service in 1993. One site within the McGee Hill North area, 41JP99, was
recorded through a local informant, Andy Kyle, in 1986, but had not been systematically
surveyed. Site 41SB84, located within the Massey Goode Branch area, was initially recorded in
1980 by Carey D. Weber and the location was confirmed by Andy Kyle in 1986. Local
collectors also plotted a site, 41AG19, on one of the islands near Hurricane Creek, which was
resurveyed by R.L. Stephenson of the Smithsonian Institution in 1948. Another island included
part of site 41AB87 that was recorded in 1980 during a survey of Sam Rayburn Reservoir.
Previous inventories in the general vicinity of the current parcels have also recorded sites within
1 mile (1.6 km), including 32 sites within 1 mile (1.6 km) of Armstrong Landing West, 28 sites
within 1 mile of the Mill Creek North, 6 sites within 1 mile of McGee Hill and McGee Hill
North, 2 sites within 1 mile of Massey Goode Branch, 1 site within 1 mile of South Powell Park,
and 7 sites within 1 mile of Hurricane Creek and Islands (see Table 2-1). These had been
recorded by various persons and organizations as long ago as 1949 and the existing site
information is incomplete and non-comparable for many of the sites.

Many of the sites

contained ceramics; a few aceramic sites were presumed to date to the Archaic period.
2.2 PREHISTORIC CULTURAL FRAMEWORK
Humans have lived in the East Texas region for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of culture history has been outlined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) in a planning
document for East Texas. This framework includes Paleo-Indian populations (prior to 7000
B.C.), and Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-100 B.C.), though the Caddoan horticultural
adaptations (A.D. 900-1700).

These time periods are based on changes in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.
The prehistory of East Texas has been investigated by many archaeological investigations. For
cultural-historical details of the prehistoric period, the reader is referred to Kenmotsu and
Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993; 1995). Many small investigations have been conducted by

Page 10

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), on rural developments by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), and various projects for utilities and mineral interests. Of
these small projects, the inventories crossing lowland areas have generally recorded higher site
densities than the upland inventories. Larger investigations have been focused on reservoirs
(Perttula et al. 1998) and on the Big Thicket National Preserve (Shafer et al. 1975; Brown et al.
1999). Large investigations in the region generally show that both prehistoric and historic sites
were found adjacent to the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In general, areas around stream confluences and on small rises within floodplains had a good to
excellent chance of containing prehistoric cultural resources while historic resources can be in
more diverse conditions, including areas away from water.
2.3 HISTORIC PERIOD
The original inhabitants of East Texas are believed to have been first contacted by Europeans
between 1528 and 1533 by the Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca.

This foray may have

encountered Caddoan people somewhere between Nacogdoches, Texas and Nachitoches,
Louisiana. It was followed by the explorer Moscoso, whose report of crossing the Angelina
River mentions several distinct Caddoan groups including the Ayish, Nondacoa, Nasoni,
Nacacahoz, and Naquisca. The French Explorer La Salle in 1685 also reported Hasinai Caddo
near Nacogdoches and in 1690 the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in the area,
including two at Nacogdoches by 1716. The Spaniards reported that the local people actively
cultivated fields of maize, which they supplemented with gardens of beans, squash, and other
vegetables, as well as hunting and fishing. Trotlining was a common fishing technique. Surplus
maize was often traded with neighboring people.
The Historic Period (1700-present) describes the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and also marks a transition from the native populations to the European immigrantsâ
establishment of farms, towns, and counties.

As the indigenous groups were exposed to

Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their way
into the archaeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases, which severely reduced the populations of the Caddoan villages. The descendants of
these people now reside primarily in Texas Oklahoma and Louisiana.

2.3.1 Area of Lake Wright Patman
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route back to
New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition launched by Thomas Jefferson traveled up the Red River to
Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations as
well as raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b).

As was expected, the white population strongly

supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmenâs
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed

Page 12

white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Bakerâs gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all, and
the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.
2.3.2 Area of Lake Sam Rayburn
The first European eyes to see this part of the country were likely part of the Luis de Moscoso
Alvarado expedition, who may have traveled through the area on his return journey through
Texas in 1542 (Long 2002). Later on, French traders were traveling through the area and traded
with the native inhabitants in the 1690s (McCroskey 2002). This prompted the Spanish to pay
more attention to the region, and in 1691 Domingo TerÃ¡n de los RÃ­os cut a path that would
eventually become the Old San Antonio Road. However, settlement of the area by the Spanish
did not begin until 1716 and 1717, when Domingo RamÃ³n and Father Antonio Margil de JesÃºs
founded Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Dolores de los Ais near modern San Augustine, Mission
Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sma ConcepciÃ³n de los Hainai near modern Douglass, Mission San
JosÃ© de los Nazonis near modern Cushing, and Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de los
Nacogdoches in modern Nacogdoches (Burke 1971; Mason 1974). Presidio Nuestra SeÃ±ora de
los Dolores de los Tejas was also established at the time. Most of the area was abandoned in

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 13

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

1719 due to fighting with the French, but the Spanish returned in 1720. Soon after two trails
linked the area to the rest of Spanish Texas: the Old San Antonio Road or Camino Real,
connected the San Antonio area to Nacogdoches, and the Liberty-Nacogdoches Road headed
south from Nacogdoches to El Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity River. Missions
PurÃ­sma ConcepciÃ³n and San JosÃ© de los Nazonis were eventually moved to the San Antonio
area in 1730 and 1731, but the other missions and presidio remained in the area until the cession
of the Louisiana territory to Spain in 1763 negated the necessity of their continued presence that
far east. The missions and presidio were abandoned in 1773.
The area around the future Lake Sam Rayburn was re-inhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and his
fellow settlers in 1779, at the location of the previously abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches
area. Areas to the southeast of Nacogdoches along the Angelina River, called the Ayish Bayou
District, were also settled by the Spanish in the late eighteenth century.

Shortly after

Nacogdochesâ founding, Ibarvo built a building called the âOld Stone Fortâ for business and
administration, and the settlement became a center for illegal trade between Spanish, French, and
Americans (Long 2002c; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
Nacogdoches was the central location of politics in East Texas. The town was sacked by JoaquÃ­n
de Arredondo around 1812 for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo GuitiÃ©rrez,
it became the stage for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as well as the
center of the CÃ³rdova uprising 1838 (McDonald 1980).
San Augustine, the only other densely inhabited area during this time period, also participated
heavily in political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly
contested in the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come, and set up farms
in what would become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper Counties.
Bevilâs Settlement, later called Jasper, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil, and became the
county seat of Jasper County in 1844 (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area,
Town Bluff, was settled on the Neches River in 1833 as part of the Lorenzo de Zavalaâs colony.
Woodville was established in 1846 when Tyler became a county, and quickly established itself
as the county seat.

By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly violent conflict (McCroskey 2002). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually
erupted into the Civil War. The region was settled mostly by Southerners who carried the slaverun plantation culture with them, but unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the
environment was not conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were
poor farmers with few or no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as
some tobacco, rice, and cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the
Angelina and other navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income
from port fees. As a result, the reaction of the regionâs inhabitants to secession was mixed. The
Mexican population in Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually voted
to support the cause (Long 2002c). Angelina County was one of the few counties in the state to
reject secession altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their
Southern roots and supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin. Once the Civil
War began however, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army, supplying
troops and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to guard
against invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.
Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper were occupied by Union troops during Reconstruction, and
some KKK-like organizations were formed to force African-American activists out of the area,
but these organizations dissolved soon after they were created.

The region suffered

economically after the Civil War, and it did not begin to recover until the railroads were built in
the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end of the nineteenth
century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to be developed in full force. Towns
such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavilla, and Broaddus sprung up around new
sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of income (St.
Clair and St. Clair 1982; Wooster 2002). However, poor timber renewal practices and the
Depression caused timber sales to plummet in the 1930s, and several small towns were deserted.
In most areas livestock raising began to replace what little cotton production was present, and
modest oil extraction was developed to support the economy in Nacogdoches and Jasper
Counties. However, the primary economy remained agricultural, and the people maintained a
steady rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was revived during and after World War II, but not to

the extent of previous years.

Other areas began planting sugar cane, raising poultry, and

manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). Lake Sam Rayburn and Steinhagen Lake were completed
in the 1950s and 1960s, and tourism helped to revive the regional economy.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
The archaeological field inventory was conducted in two field sessions between February 26,
2004 and March 16, 2004, with an additional field session from April 21 to 22, 2004 to survey
McGee Hill North, which replaced portions of Hurricane Creek and Islands which were found to
be unsurveyable. Sixty-four person-days were spent in the field and the Principal Investigator
was in the field for three of the 16 field days. Methods and density of shovel testing complied
with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated by the USACE
(2002:10-44).
3.1 SURVEY TACTICS
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines drawn at 30 m
intervals on topographic maps. Each field archaeologist was given a copy of the topographic
map and was assigned a transect line. The location of each shovel test was marked by the field
archaeologist on the field map.

Transect lines were designated with an alpha prefix and

individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that shovel test G-5 identified
the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each crew member followed
his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crew members.

Occasionally, for

logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with one person digging the shovel tests and
another screening and recording the field forms, or two surveyors would âleapfrogâ along one
transect, each digging alternating shovel tests.
Special effort was made to relocate the numerous previously recorded sites in several of the
parcels. For each of these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the
location, or suspected location, of the site. The crew referred to the siteâs plot on the USGS
topographic maps at TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the
UTM (or latitude/longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible
conversion errors in coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected
location(s), the crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of
the site was seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines
of evidence.

Despite these efforts, some of the previously recorded sites were not found. Many of these sites
were initially recorded by Briggs and Malone (1970) while performing the archaeological
inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the then named Texarkana Reservoir,
now known as Lake Wright Patman. For several reasons, relocation of many of these sites was
impossible. First, many of the sites were originally noted to be small and sparse scatters of
artifacts; relocation of such âephemeralâ sites is notoriously tough. Further, many of these sites
were recorded on exposed beaches, sandbars and peninsulas that are now submerged. The 1970
inventory occurred during a period when the lake level was at an unusually low 220 ft amsl, thus
exposing considerable terrain that is now inundated. The last time the Lake Wright Patman
conservation pool was this low was in 1992. Since then, the conservation pool has not been
lower than 222 ft amsl, and when the current inventory occurred in February and March of 2004
the conservation pool was 225 ft amsl. Thus, sites recorded in 1970 at elevations of 220-224 ft
amsl would not be visible unless the site extended upslope. Given that Briggs and Malone noted
that testing upslope on the majority of the sites did not produce artifacts, coupled with the fact
that many of these sites were only a few meters wide, it is likely that these sites no longer exist.
It is also probable that in 1970, many or most of the shoreline sites recorded by Briggs and
Malone were already eroded by wave action and varying lake levels since reservoir construction
in 1956.
At selected shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations.
Where possible, tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be
preferred site locations, such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, particularly
at Hurricane Creek and South Powell Park, shovel tests could not be dug due to standing water,
erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually recorded on the shovel testing log.
All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests
were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all
excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh.

All cultural material was collected with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass
shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and
were not collected. The exceptions to this collection policy include the investigations of sites
41CS37, 41CS38, and 41CS74 at Armstrong Landing West and sites 41CS89 and 41CS302 at
Mill Creek North. Although cultural material was recovered within shovel tests at site 41CS37,
it was reburied in place at the request of the USACE (see Section 4.0). At the remaining sites,
only diagnostic material and sample collections were recovered due to high artifact quantities of
the surface artifacts. All shovel tests were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 10 to 15 m distances up to nine tests in an area. If more than one of these
tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location
was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these were not
further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated
using multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch
iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum survey cap. Caps were stamped with âECOM 2004â and with a
temporary site number for newly recorded sites and existing trinomials for prerecorded sites.
Trinomial site numbers have been requested from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), at the University of Texas, Austin and will replace the temporary field numbers used in
this draft report.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Additionally, sites along the shoreline were visually inspected
for artifact distribution, and site size was determined by the extent of the artifacts. Based on the
distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface artifacts, site boundaries were
prominently marked with pink-glo flagging tape. Sites were photograph ed and sketch mapped
and were recorded using State of Texas site forms. All excavated artifacts were recovered and
were processed and analyzed by the authors in Ecological Communications Corporationâs
(ECommâs) Austin laboratory. All artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL upon
completion of analysis.

3.2 DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a total of 540 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 1,612 acres
(Table 3-1). In an attempt to ensure greater coverage than this minimum, a total of 924 shovel
tests were actually excavated, or about 70% more than the contractual minimum. The lowest
coverage was 0.5 tests per acre at the South Powell Park and Hurricane Creek parcels at Lake
Sam Rayburn, and the greatest coverage was 0.7 tests per acre at McGee Hill North and Massey
Goode Branch at Lake Sam Rayburn. For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged about
0.6 tests per acre.

4.0 RESULTS
Within the 1,612-acre project area, 24 previously recorded and fifteen new archaeological sites
were located and investigated in order to access site size, nature of cultural resource deposition,
and their eligibility potential for consideration to the NRHP.
4.1 LAKE WRIGHT PATMAN
4.1.1 Armstrong Landing West
The Armstrong Landing West area totaled 460 acres and was completely inventoried using 275
shovel tests for a density of 0.6 shovel tests per acre. Ten cultural resource sites and six isolated
occurrences were present.

Previously recorded sites 41CS37, 41CS38, and 41CS75 were

relocated; however sites 41CS72, 41CS73, and 41CS74 could not be relocated, despite intensive
shovel testing at the locations on record (Table 4-1). The tactics used to locate previously
recorded sites are presented in Section 3.1. A map showing the locations of all shovel tests
excavated within the Armstrong Landing West area is provided in Appendix A.
Revisited Sites
Site 41CS37
Prehistoric site 41CS37 was first investigated by
avocational archeologist Janson McVay and by other
local artifact collectors sometime prior to 1970.
McVay informally described multiple burials and
house floors up to 50 cm deep but little verifiable
information remains from these early visits. Burials
were likely removed from this site prior to its
ownership by the Federal Government during the

period 1952 through 1960. Other remains may have been removed during the period of reservoir
construction, possibly into the early 1960s. In 1996 an inventory was conducted by the Fort
Worth District, USACE, in compliance with the requirements of Sections 5 and 6 of the 1990

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) but did not identify any of
these remains in the Governments possession or where such remains are currently located.
In 1970 the site was formally recorded by James M. Malone during the inventory of the
enlargement to Lake Wright Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir. Malone described
several patches of darkened soil and vandalized areas. He defined the area of occupation at about
1.5 acres (400 by 100 m). Cultural material recovered from the site in 1970 included a mano,
lithic cores, flakes, points, and plain and decorated ceramics (Texas Archeological Data Site
Form [TADSF] on file at TARL). Although McVay had previously reported house floors and
burials at the site, no evidence of either was found in 1970.
The current inspection of 41CS37 confirmed Maloneâs observation of vandalism at the site.
Within a broad area measuring approximately 50-60 m in diameter, a large number of open
excavated holes are present. Back dirt from the holes is mounded here and there, giving the area
an undulating, cratered appearance (Figure 4-2). These excavations are probably related to the
earlier pothunting efforts by the local community as well as from avocational archeologists both
before the property was acquired by the U.S. Government and during the early construction of
the reservoir. Janson McKay reported that several burials had been removed from this site as
well as from other locations in the vicinity of the reservoir, and other avocationalists were active
in this area as well. Some of the holes may be also the result of investigations conducted by the
River Basin Surveys (RBS), since almost all of the RBS excavations were left open (Stephenson
1950; Jelks1961). It is possible that some of the excavated holes may be more contemporary and
were unauthorized by the U.S. Government. At the time of the current inspection, none of the
holes appeared to be recent.
During the current investigation, two shovel tests (A8, B8) were excavated near the disturbed
areas to confirm the presence of subsurface cultural material and two more shovel tests (C8, D8)
were placed south of the area along transect lines (see Figure 4-1). All four of these tests became
waterlogged between 20 and 35 centimeters below surface (cmbs), and the soil was observed to
be very dark gray sandy clay loam, 10YR 2/1 to 10YR 3/1. Three of the four shovel tests were
negative, but the one shovel test (B8) located closest to the disturbed area contained an
unidentified bone fragment and a Caddo base sherd. Following standard protocol, the field crew

immediately contacted the USACE and further shovel testing of the site was terminated at the
request of the USACE (Stephen P. Austin, Personal Communication, 2004). Both artifacts were
placed back in the test hole at their proper depths and no additional shovel tests were dug.

Figure 4-2 Photograph of Disturbed Area, 41CS37, Facing North.

On the basis of landform and the extent of the disturbed area, the potential site boundaries were
expanded from Maloneâs original estimate of one and one half acres to about five acres,
measuring about 125 m (E-W) by 180 m (N-S). Further subsurface investigations may be helpful
in refining this estimate of site area.
Based on the previous reports and the extent of the previous disturbances, coupled with the
limited data returned from this investigation, it is likely that significant amounts of cultural
material still remain at the site Additional burials are possible. The extent of remaining
undisturbed deposits is unknown.

Site 41CS38
Site 41CS38 was originally recorded on February 7, 1970 by James M. Malone during the
inventory of the enlargement to Lake Wright Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir. The
site was described as a long low sand bar into the lake, usually flooded, with artifacts eroding out
of three sides of the peninsula covering about a 100 by 25 m area. The elevation of the site was
recorded as 221 and 223 ft AMSL (TADSF).
The current survey found the site to be considerably smaller, with artifacts covering only a small
portion of the peninsula, about 60 m (N-S) by 30 m (E-W) (Figures 4-3 and 4-4). The highest
concentration of artifacts was found in an area 20 m long by 5 to 8 m wide. The artifacts were
found lying on the ground surface, which consisted of an eroded argillic horizon (yellowish red
clay; 5YR 5/6 to 5YR 4/6) and no remaining topsoil. It is likely that the rest of the site is
underwater, considering the elevation of the recovered material is about 225 ft AMSL, and a
small island could be seen extending into the water in the same direction as the spit. Since the
only remaining cultural material was in danger of being washed away, one 5 by 5 m grid and one
5 by 8 m grid was set up at the high artifact concentration, and a surface collection was conducted.

Artifacts were collected from two collection areas in order to record the lithic artifact density and
assemblage on the sites surface. Collection Area 1 contained 88 percent (449 of 511) of all
artifacts recorded (Table 4-2). Ninety-eight percent (441 of 449) of all artifacts collected in Area
1 and 90 percent (56 of 62) in Area 2 were between 0 and 3 cm in size (Table 4-3).

One possible Perdiz projectile point was collected in the southern portion of
Area 1 (Figure 4-5). This slightly beveled point was highly retouched and did
not feature the barbed shoulders, which are commonly associated with Perdiz
points. The specimen measured 3.1 by 1.4 cm in size and was comprised of
strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) chert.
A total of six ceramic sherds were analyzed. All were described as body
sherds with grog temper and smoothed surfaces. All but one
sherd were plain. The other sherd was incised with two broad

lines roughly 6 mm wide. The sherds were predominantly 6 mm thick with heavily reduced
interiors (see Appendix C).

Site 41CS75
Like 41CS38, this site was originally recorded on February 18, 1970 by James M. Malone during
the inventory of the enlargement to Lake Wright Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir.
The site was described as a long peninsula into the lake the runs roughly east-west. The entire
surface had been eroded away leaving artifacts, lithic flakes and one partial point deposited on
the surface. The greatest concentration of artifacts was on the south shore, and the total site area
covered about 300 by 40 m. The elevation of the site is recorded to have been between 221 and
225 ft AMSL.
The current survey found the site to be in a similar condition, the sandy loam present elsewhere
in the area has been primarily washed away leaving the yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay surface. A
groundstone fragment was located about 60 m upslope on the peninsula at about 227 ft AMSL,
but the majority of the observed artifacts were found on the eroded beach area at the tip of the
peninsula (Figure 4-6). Shovel tests further up the landform did not uncover any subsurface
artifacts, and the site appeared to be located just toward the tip. Thus, the site boundary was
reduced to 100 m (E-W) by 90 m (N-S).
As the eroded artifacts at the shoreline were in imminent danger of being washed away, a
concerted effort was made to collect as much as possible (Figure 4-7). A total of 28 artifacts
were recovered from the shoreline, including burned sandstone, a hammerstone fragment, and
one fragmented and highly retouched UI projectile point. Eighty-nine percent (25 of 28) of all
material collected was between 0 and 3 cm in size. Lithic flakes (0 to 3 cm in size) comprised 75
percent (21 of 28) of all material collected (Table 4-4).
Newly Discovered Sites
41CS290
This newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman, about 140 m from the shoreline, on land with a slight incline to the north. A path

percent (43 of 44) of all artifacts were collected between 0 and 40 cmbs. The only artifact
collected between 40 and 60 cmbs was one ceramic shard in ST D4. One-hundred percent (18 of
18) of lithic material was recovered between 0 and 40 cmbs (Table 4-6).

The 41CS290 ceramic sherd sample consisted of 25 specimens including two rims and 23 body
fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of six (24 percent) sherds which
included one engraved with a pattern most similar to the Barkman Engraved as depicted in Suhm
and Jelks (1962; Plate 4n), one brushed sherd with brushing in perpendicular directions, and four
incised sherds. None of the incised sherds were indicative of a particular type with varying
numbers of lines.

Surface treatment was smoothed on all sherds.

Temper was almost

exclusively grog with only one sherd containing bone. Thickness ranged from 5 to 8 mm with
no obvious correlations with decoration, temper, or firing. Firing reduction was predominant on
12 (44 percent) of the sherds followed by 4 (16 percent) sherds with mixed oxidization and
reduction, and only one sherd completely oxidized (see Appendix C).

41CS291
This newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman, about 120 m from the shore line, on a flat area of land. The site is bordered on
the north by a rough cut two track road and on the south by a steep slope down to a drainage
running east-west (Figure 4-9). The site is at an elevation of 250 ft AMSL, and measures 52 m
(E-W) by 100 m (N-S). About 80 percent of the artifacts were found between 0 and 20 cmbs,
while the other 20 percent were found between 20 and 40 cmbs. No artifacts were recovered
below 40 cmbs.
Nine shovel tests were used to define this site. The subsurface profile of most of the shovel tests
consist of brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/3 to 5/6) sandy loam to a depth of 40 to 60 cmbs
overlying yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay. ST 3, at the southernmost end of the site near
the drainage, encountered the silty clay at 20 cmbs. Of the nine shovel tests excavated in the
area, eight were positive, containing a total of 26 artifacts (Table 4-7). Lithics comprised 65
percent (17 of 26) of all artifacts recorded.
All the artifacts recorded during shovel test excavations were collected between 0 and 40 cmbs.
However, the 73 percent (19 of 26) of all artifacts originated between 0 and 20 cmbs (Table 4-8).
The only tool recorded during shovel test excavations was a unifacially retouched scrapper
collected in ST C5 between 20 and 40 cmbs.

The ceramic sherd sample from 41CS291 consisted of nine specimens including one rim and
eight body fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of five (56 percent)
sherds which included one sherd with appliquÃ© and incising and one sherd each of appliquÃ©,
brushed, incised, and engraved. The appliquÃ© and incised sherd is most similar to the Pease
Brushed-Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962) but the decoration present is limited by the size of the
sherd. The remaining decorated sherds did not have enough decoration for typing. Surface
treatment was smoothed on all sherds and temper was almost exclusively grog with only two
sherds containing bone and grog. Thickness ranged from 4 mm to 7 mm with the majority of the
sherds (n=7) between 5 and 6 mm. Firing oxidization and reduction was almost evenly split with
five almost entirely reduced and four entirely oxidized (see Appendix C).
41CS292
This small, newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of
Lake Wright Patman, about 100 m from the shore line, on a flat area of land (Figure 4-10).
West-southwest of the site the land raises up gently to a very small hilltop, and a large drainage
is about 130 m to the south. The site is at an elevation of 245 ft AMSL, and measures 32 m (EW) by 44 m (N-S). Artifacts were found between 0 and 45 cmbs, with about half located
between 0 and 20 cmbs, and the other half between 20 and 45 cmbs. No artifacts were recovered
below 45 cmbs.
Eight shovel tests were used to define this site. The subsurface profile of most of the shovel tests
consist of brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/3 to 5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 20 to 35 cmbs
overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/6 to 5/4) silty clay. STs 2 and D10, on the western side of the
site, encountered the silty clay at 40 to 45 cmbs. Of the eight shovel tests excavated in the area,
four were positive, containing a total of seven artifacts (Table 4-9). Only one undecorated ceramic

was recorded. Lithic flakes comprised 86 percent (6 of 7) of all material recorded. The
remaining artifacts consisted of chert secondary and tertiary flakes. Eighty-six percent of all
artifacts were recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs (Table 4-10). No features, ground stone objects,
or tools were located at the site.
One sherd was recovered from 41CS292. It was a plain, badly eroded, body sherd with grog
temper completely reduced, and 5 mm thick (see Appendix C).

41CS293
This newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman on an area of land just to the west of a small drainage running north-south and
just south of a larger drainage running east-west. The land slopes upward to the west away from
the drainage, which is about 15 m away (Figure 4-11). The site is at an elevation of 255 ft
AMSL, and measures 15 m (E-W) by 15 m (N-S). Artifacts were found between 0 and 20 cmbs.
Six shovel tests were used to define this site. The subsurface profile of most of the shovel tests
consist of brown to dark yellowish brown (7.5YR 5/4 to 10YR 4/4) sandy loam to a depth of 30
to 40 cmbs overlying reddish brown (5YR 5/4 to 5/6) clay. ST L5 was the only shovel test that
yielded cultural material (one interior and exterior flake recorded between 0 and 20 cmbs). No
features, groundstone objects, tools, or ceramics were located at the site.

This newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman near the road leading to Armstrong Landing (Figure 4-12). The site extends from
the top of a gentle hillside from about 130 m west of the road, westward and downward to a very
steep drainage at its western boundary. The drainage consists of a winding cut into the base of
the slope about 2 m deep with very steep sides. Smaller cuts in the hillside funnel rainwater into

the drainage and water was present at the bottom. The site is at an elevation of 255 to 275 ft
AMSL, and measures 200 m (E-W) by 150 m (N-S). Throughout the site the typical soil pedon
consisted of brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/3 to 5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 20 to 35 cmbs
overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/6 to 5/4) silty clay.
Seventeen shovel tests were used to define the site. Of the seventeen shovel tests excavated in
the area, ten were positive, containing a total of eighteen artifacts (Table 4-11). Ceramics
comprised 61 percent (11 of 18) of all material collected while lithics comprised only 33 percent
(6 of 18).

One piece of fire cracked rock was recovered from ST 9 between 20 and 40 cmbs (Table 4-12).
No features, groundstone objects, or tools were located at the site. Artifacts were predominately
found between 0 and 60 cmbs, with 38 percent (7 of 17) located between 0 to 20 and 40 to 60
cmbs. No artifacts were recovered below 60 cmbs.

The 41CS294 ceramic sample included ten specimens. All were body sherds. Decorative
elements included incising and punctuating, brushing, and a red slip. Each was found on only
one sherd each. None of the decorative elements were identifiable as a particular type. All of
the sherds, except for the one with red slip, have smoothed surfaces. The slipped sherd was
polished. All of the sherds were grog temper and between 4 and 7 mm thick. The slipped sherd
was also the thinnest. Seven of the ten sherds were either completely or almost completely
reduced (see Appendix C).
41CS295
This newly discovered site consists of buried cultural material located on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman on a gentle slope down to the west. A steep slope down to a drainage is to the
west and northwest of the site (Figure 4-13). The drainage runs northwest to the lake. The site is
at an elevation of 255 ft AMSL, and measures 42 m (E-W) by 40 m (N-S). Artifacts were found
between 0 and 40 cmbs, with about half recovered from 0 to 20 cmbs, and the other half from 20
to 40 cmbs. No artifacts were recovered below 40 cmbs.
Eight shovel tests were used to define this site. The subsurface profile of most of the shovel tests
consist of brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/3 to 5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 20 to 35 cmbs
overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/6 to 5/4) silty clay. A total of eight artifacts were recovered
from four of the eight shovel tests (Table 4-13). Lithic flakes comprised 88 percent (7 of 8) of
all material recovered. No features, ground stone objects, ceramics, or tools were located at the
site. All of the artifacts were recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs. No artifacts were recovered
below 40 cmbs (Table 4-14).

This newly discovered historic site contains the scattered remains of an early twentieth century
occupation. It is located on the south side of Lake Wright Patman next to a gravel road that
parallels a north-south power line and measures about 65 by 70 m (Figure 4-14). The site is
situated on a plain that gently slopes downwards towards the west.

Six features were recorded on the site: (1) a slightly elevated 18 by 20 m earthen platform; (2) a
large unlined cylindrical pit; (3) a dry-laid stone wall, 10 m long by 4 m wide; (4) a large stone
pile south of the cistern, 6 by 8 m in size; (5) a faint two track road running roughly 30 m eastwest and making a curve towards the north; and 6) a rounded pit 80 cm deep by 2 m diameter.
The cylindrical pit measured 2.4 m in diameter by 2.8 m deep and had a flat bottom and a large
stone place at the northern edge (Figure 4-15). It is interpreted as a possible cistern. This pit did
not show any evidence of an interior lining, but it may have been dug to house a metal container,
which was later removed. The bottom of the pit was covered with leaves, but there was no
evidence that the pit had water at the bottom or was ever used as a well, and it is unlikely such a
large pit was dug for a privy. The earthen platform is interpreted as a pad for a temporary
shelter, possibly a mobile home.
This site lies along the edge of a parcel of land obtained by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in
fee during the construction of Texarkana Reservoir (Lake Wright Patman). The parcel is
identified as segment F-628 consisting of 83.11 acres at taking. No structure appears at this

location on either the United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangles for the area or on
any map prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The ownership history for this parcel
was almost nonexistent prior to 1906 and cannot be relied upon for completeness.

Figure 4-15 Feature 1, Possible Cistern at 41CS296.

While the site itself does not appear to have significant interest, nor does it appear that any
significant historical associations, absent an extensive and intensive background historical
research undertaking, no solid statement can be made about the siteâs historic significance as far
as historic associations with significant individuals.
Segment F-628 is part of the Squire Frazier Survey (Figure 4-16). This survey is transferred from
Charles Graham January 10, 1858 to Isam Cherry as a 640 acre tract of land. From this point on
the land is divided several times, restored in various purchases, and is subject to numerous
leases. It is likely that most, but not all, of the Isam Cherry parcel continued in the Cherry family,
but was probably used for tenant farming. Isam never appears in any census but a Franklin
Cherry appears in the 1850 Cass County census as overseer. An S. R. Cherry appears in the 1860
census in Precinct 3 as a farmer and in his household is a son, John, 11 years old. In the 1900
census John appears as a 52 year-old farmer with wife Anna and four children, still in Precinct 3.
To collect an ownership history of this type of this specific parcel would require a significant
effort and would likely result in the identification of mostly tenant farmers. Segment F-628, the

Figure 4-16 Segment F-628, Squire Frazier Survey

83.11 acres deeded to the government, that can be confirmed is the ownership of J. M Vise and a
possible ownership of the land by the Cherry family prior to that. The Vise ownership of this
parcel begins on December 31, 1906 when J. W. and J. A. Warrington warrant deed 60 acres to J.
M. Vise (Cass County Deed Records, Volume K-3, pages 174-175). There is nothing to confirm
how J. W. and J .A. Warrington received the property. J .M. Vise also receives a 27 Â½ acre
parcel from John Cherry on December 31, 1906 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 1-3, page
399). On December 24, 1917, John Cherry warrant deeds an additiona1 60 acre parcel to J. M.
Vise (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 1-4, page 308). Also on December 24, 1917 and in
the same deed, John Cherry warrant deeds a 40 acre parcel to a J. R. Griffin (Cass County Deed
Records, Volume 1-4, page 308). J. M. dies in 1918 and Edna Vise, his wife, subsequently
marries J. R. Griffin.
The next record is the warrant deed filed providing the 83.11 acres to the United States of
America from Edna Vise (Griffin) on October 22, 1951 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume
266, page 441).
Page 46

Jim M. Vise and Edna do not appear in any census records for Cass County until 1910. Both are
reported a living in the household of a John C. Vise, a 56 year old farmer in Precinct 6, in the
area of Segment F-628. Jim is reported as being 36 years old and Edna is 25 years old. Several
other members of the Vise household are in their early twenties and one name, Jimmie, is noted
as a grandson, and is five months old. Edna appears alone as head of household with her children
in the 1920 census still in Precinct 6. John R. Griffin, whom Edna subsequently marries, is also
in Precinct 6 with his wife and children in 1920. John Cherry is in Precinct 3 for both the 1860
and 1900 censuses.
During the current field investigations, a total of sixteen artifacts were recovered in five of the
eight shovel tests (Table 4-15). ST 4 contained 44 percent (7 of 16) of all material recovered.
Fifty percent (8 of 16) of all artifacts collected fell into the âBottle Glassâ category. Eighty-one
percent (13 of 16) of all material was collected between 0 and 20 cmbs (Table 4-16). All of the
recovered artifacts dated from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century,
including plain whiteware (for a more complete description of whiteware see 41CS299 below)
embossed, mold-made clear bottle glass (see 41CS299 below), and wire nails, with no defining
characteristics other than the assemblage is primarily household related material. The site was
most likely inhabited during the twentieth century before the reservoir was created, possibly by a
tenant farmer with a temporary leasehold.

Sites Not Relocated
As previously stated, this survey was unable to locate three previously recorded archaeological
sites (41CS72, 41CS73, and 41CS74) despite shovel testing at the locations on record. The
following section provides background information on each of the sites not located in the area
and states the methodology employed and results of investigation. The NRHP eligibility
determinations generated after analyzing these results are presented in Section 5.0.
Site 41CS72
Site 41CS72 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman.

According to Malone (TADSF), site

41CS72, 3 by 180 m in size, is located between two small creek estuaries on a wide, flat beach
peninsula which is normally submerged by water during the summer. Elevation was recorded as
222-225 ft amsl. Artifacts recorded at 41CS72 by Malone include plain and decorated ceramics,
as well as lithic cores, flakes, and bifaces (TADSF).
During the survey, the team used USGS topographic maps and the original site sketch map to
navigate to the recorded location of 41CS72. An intensive surface inspection was conducted of
the exposed shoreline and upslope areas. In addition, four shovel tests were excavated at the
location on record in order to assess subsurface cultural resources. The investigation resulted in
the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface. Because elevation of the conservation
flood pool at the time of field work was 225 ft. amsl, it is concluded that the original site location
is submerged.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

Site 41CS73
Site 41CS73 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), 41CS73,
measured 1 m wide by 40 m long and was located on the sandy beach of an unnamed creek
which drains into Lake Wright Patman. Elevation was recorded as 222-225 ft amsl. In addition,
the site is described as being normally submerged by the waters of Lake Wright Patman during
the summer months. Artifacts recorded at 41CS73 by Malone include flint flakes, cores, and one
biface (TADSF).
During the current survey, the team used USGS topographic maps and the original site sketch
map to navigate to the recorded location of 41CS73. An intensive surface inspection was
conducted of the exposed shoreline and surrounding area. The site coordinates were found to be
in a swampy, submerged area. Two shovel tests were placed at the nearest point on dry land, but
no artifacts were recovered. The investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or
below the surface of the site. Because elevation of the conservation flood pool at the time of field
work was 225 ft. amsl, it is concluded that the original site location is submerged.
Site 41CS74
Site 41CS74 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), 41CS74 is
located along a slightly elevated sandy peninsula that extends into Lake Wright Patman.
Elevation was recorded as 222-228 ft amsl. In addition, the site is described as being normally
submerged by the waters of Lake Wright Patman during the summer months. Artifacts recorded
at 41CS74 by Malone include lithic cores, flakes, and four contracting stem projectile points
(possibly Perdiz) (TADSF).
During the current work, the survey team used USGS topographic maps and the original site
sketch map to navigate to the recorded location of 41CS74. An intensive surface inspection was
conducted in the vicinity and surrounding areas. It was evident that the site location as plotted

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

on the TARL maps and the site description on the TADSF did not match. The sites description
more closely matched the location of 41CS75, and may be the same site. Nevertheless, two
shovel tests were placed at the area on record and no artifacts were recovered. The investigation
resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface.
4.1.2 Mill Creek North
The Mill Creek North area totaled 628 acres and was completely inventoried using 334 shovel
tests for a density of 0.53 shovel tests per acre. Nine cultural resource sites and six isolated
occurrences were present. Previously recorded
sites 41CS46, 41CS88, and 41CS89 were
relocated and recorded; however sites 41CS45,
41CS81, 41CS82, 41CS83, 41CS84, 41CS86,
41CS87, 41CS90, and 41CS112 and could not
be relocated, despite shovel testing at the
locations on record (Table 4-17). The field
tactics used to locate previously recorded sites
are presented in Section 3.1. Six new sites

were recorded within the Mill Creek North area during the survey. A map showing the locations

Revisited Sites
Site 41CS46
Site 41CS46 was originally recorded on February 10, 1970 by James M. Malone during the
inventory of the enlargement to Lake Wright Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir
(TASDF). Malone described the site as a long low island which becomes a peninsula during low
water levels containing a shallow midden in front of some willows at the beach.

As this site

description did not match the plotted location on the maps at TARL, the information was doublechecked and the coordinates for the site on the 1970 site form were found to be under Lake
Wright Patman. However, during this survey the team investigated the location on the TARL
map to try to relocate the site. The area was found to be at the western edge of a wide drainage
into the lake, heavily inundated and swampy with large amounts of thick brush (Figure 4-17).

Shovel tests at the site location revealed that no topsoil was left, only a sterile yellowish brown
silty clay surface (10YR 5/6), which was heavily saturated. This survey found the site to be an
estimated 30 by 30 m in size. Six shovel tests were excavated in the area. All encountered
saturated clay about 2 cmbs, and became completely waterlogged at 8 cmbs. All the cultural
material collected (i.e., one exterior and interior flake, one ceramic) was recovered on the surface
of ST 4. The sherd found at 41CS46 was a plain body sherd with grog temper, 6 mm thick, and a
smoothed surface (see Appendix C).
Site 41CS88
Site 41CS88 was originally recorded on February 23, 1970 by James M. Malone during the
inventory of the enlargement to Lake Wright Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir.
Malone described the site as a relatively straight stretch of beach below a sandy pine-covered hill
that contained artifacts eroding out from the beach (TADSF). Cultural material collected at that
time included large cores, lithic flakes, pitted stone, and plain and decorated sherds. The current
survey relocated the site at about 225 to 227 ft AMSL along the same stretch of beach as the
1970 investigation. The surface of the beach was comprised of strong brown sandy clay (7.5YR
4/6) and was covered with artifacts that had an eroded/secondary context (Figure 4-18). The
artifact scatter covers an area of 75 m (E-W) by 35 m (N-S). The beach itself was devoid of
foliage, but behind it was a terraced grassy area leading up to the tree line of mixed hardwoods
and long leaf pine. A horse trail crossed the grassy area and extended into the southern portion
of the site (Figure 4-19).
Three shovel tests were placed in the grassy area just above the beach where the artifact
concentration appeared highest, but no cultural material was recovered. A surface inspection of
the beach was conducted and selected artifacts were recovered, including diagnostic artifacts.
Three metate groundstone fragments were also collected on the surface. Plain ceramics and
lithic flakes were not collected. Ninety percent (9 of 13) of all artifacts collected from the
surface of 41CS88 were between 0 and 3 cm in size (Table 4-18). One Catahoula point was
collected on the surface of 41CS88 during the survey (Figure 4-20). The Catahoula specimen
measured 1.7 by 2.8 cm and was comprised of strong brown 7.5YR 5/6. The Catahoula was also
missing one of its barbs.

The 41CS88 ceramic sherd sample contained seven specimens (i.e., five body sherds, one rim
sherd, and one base). Decorated sherds included two engraved, one appliquÃ©, one brushed, and

one incised. One engraved sherds was most similar to the Crockett Curvilinear (Incised) (Shum
and Jelks 1962) type and the other was not identifiable. The appliquÃ© sherd includes one ridge
suggestive of the Nash Neck-banded variety and the incised sherd was most similar to the
Canton Incised type (Suhm and Jelks 1962). All seven sherds had smoothed surfaces and grog
temper. Thickness ranged from 4 to 10 mm with the thinnest sherd with the Crockett Curvilinear
like design and the thickest sherd the only base found on the site. Firing oxidization and reduction
was mixed with almost equal numbers of sherd in varying degrees of reduction (see Appendix C).

Site 41CS89
Site 41CS89 was originally recorded on February 22, 1970 by James M.
Malone during the inventory of the âenlargementâ to Lake Wright
Patman, then known as Texarkana Reservoir.

Malone (TADSF)

described the site as a small peninsula located in a low swampy region
thatâs normally underwater. He noted artifacts eroding out along the tan
sandy beach, covering a small area of about 5 m in diameter at about
222 to 224 ft AMSL (Figure 4-21). Cultural material collected at that
time included lithic flakes, pitted stone, and a possible metate (TADSF).

Figure 4-20 Catahoula
Point Collected on the
Surface of 41CS88.

The current investigation found the shape of the land at the site location to be altered somewhat;
instead of a small peninsula, the shore line was relatively straight with a surface comprised of
strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) to yellowish red (5YR 5/8) clay. The elevation of this area was about
225 to 227 ft AMSL. The site is located on an eroded section of beach, covering an area of about
17 m (E-W) by 20 m (N-S). The beach was devoid of foliage, but behind it was a terraced grassy
area that lead up to a tree line comprised of mixed hardwoods and long leaf pine (Figure 4-22).
Six shovel tests were excavated within the site, but no cultural material was recovered. Only one
artifact (i.e., an undecorated ceramic) was observed on the sites surface. The sherd found at
41CS89 was a plain rim sherd with grog temper, 6 mm thick, with a smoothed and eroded
surface (see Appendix C).
Newly Discovered Sites
41CS297
This previously unrecorded site is located approximately 400 m east of 41CS46 on a slightly
elevated plain which slopes down in a northerly direction to a beach. All artifacts were found
within the forested area. The beach was void of both artifacts and vegetation. The soil pedon
encountered during shovel testing typically consisted of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam
extending 0 to 20 cmbs overlying reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy-clay loam extending 20 to
60 cmbs. Shovel testing revealed the site to be approximately 80 by 130 m in size (Figure 4-23).

A total of 24 artifacts were recorded in seven of the eleven shovel tests excavated (Table 4-19).
Ceramics comprised 75 percent (18 of 24) of all material recovered. Sixty-six percent (12 of 18)
of all ceramics were recorded in STs 4 and 2. A total of six lithic flakes were collected. EightyPage 56

three percent (20 of 24) of all artifacts and ceramics (15 of 18) were recorded between the
surface and 40 cmbs (Table 4-20).
The 41CS297 ceramic sample included 18 body sherds. Decorated sherds included one each of
brushed, brushed/punctated, and engraved. None of the designs were indicative of a particular
type. The only noteworthy sherd was a plain sherd with a narrow curve suggestive of a bottle
neck. All of the sherds had grog temper and smoothed surfaces. Thickness ranged from 4 to 8
mm with the thickest sherd with the brushed/punctated decoration. Most of the sherds (n=11, 61
percent) were completely reduced, one sherd was half reduced and half oxidized, and the
remainder were completely oxidized (see Appendix C).

41CS298
41CS298 is located approximately 380 m east of 41CS297 on a relatively level grassy plain that
inclines slightly to the south. This site conforms to minimum requirements that define an
archaeological site in this area (i.e., three artifacts located in one shovel test). The typical soil
pedon encountered during shovel testing consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam 0 to 40
cmbs overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy-clay loam. Shovel testing revealed the site to be
approximately 15 by 15 m in size (Figure 4-24). A total of seven shovel tests (i.e.,. STs 1-5, 7,
O7) were excavated in order to access the nature of subsurface cultural resource deposition.
Only one (ST P7) of the seven shovel tests excavated contained cultural material, an external
flake and two ceramic specimens at 0 to 20 cmbs

The 41CS298 ceramic samples included two sherds, both from the body of a vessel; one was
brushed and one was plain. The brushed sherd was 4 mm thick and it was both completely
oxidized and had grog temper. The plain sherd was 6 mm thick and it was completely reduced
and had grog temper. Both sherds had smoothed surfaces.
41CS299
Newly discovered 41CS299 consists of a broad scattering of late nineteenth to early twentieth
century artifacts located where two old roads come together and form a âYâ shape. The only
feature recorded within the site was a 2.3 m diameter stone cairn located in proximity to the
intersection (Figure 4-25).
This site is located along the southern boundary of a parcel of land obtained by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers in fee during the construction of Texarkana Reservoir (Lake Wright Patman).

The parcel is identified as Segment B-231 and was 105 acres at taking (See Site 41CS82 for the
history of Segment B-231) Several parcels appear in the vicinity of the recorded site on the real
estate segment map prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ca. 1951) (Figure 4-26). The
ownership history is fully set out for site 41CS82 (see below).
At the time of taking in 1951, the USACE Real Estate Division reported the structures shown on
the segment map as three badly deteriorated homes and several outbuildings. All buildings were
destroyed by heavy equipment clearing in 1951. There is no indication that any of the roads in
the area were named stage routes or that they were associated with any ferry crossing at the
Sulphur River. As noted earlier, the ownership history for the parcel does not appear to have
significant interest nor does it appear that any significant historical associations with the land are
present. However, some interesting information is available regarding the family history.

Figure 4-26 Cannon Smith Survey, Segment B-231

The homesteads were almost certainly the homes of extended members of the White family since
at least 1906 when the first purchase appears to have been made. Calvin White first appears in

the 1860 census records for the free inhabitants of the Douglasville Post Office Precinct as the
one-year-old male son of William B. and Mary J. White. It is unclear whether the Douglassville
Precinct is, or includes Precinct 4 where Site 41CS299 is located. William is reported to be a 39year-old Georgia-born farmer with $1,200 in real estate. Mary is reported as being 38 years old
and also born in Georgia. A number of older siblings are in the household with Cal but none are
identified with the name of Doch, Dochie, or with an initial âDâ. The family does not seem to
appear in the 1870 census but does appear in separate households in 1880. William White (now
58 years old) appears in Precinct 3 but Mary does not appear. Cal is in Precinct 6 reporting as
being 30 years old with a wife, Mary, 26, and six children in the household. The age of Cal may
be in error. Calâs occupation is listed as farmhand, and interestingly, his race is now reported as
mulatto (âMuâ). The record now indicates his father is noted as having been born in
Massachusetts, which may also be an error on the part of the transcriber. By 1900 Cal is now
reporting in Precinct 4 as having been born in May 1858 in Texas. The entry notes his father and
mother both from Georgia per the same as the 1860 census. Cal and wife Mary have nine
children at home, several of which show up in the deed records (Joseph born in 1894, Minnie
born in 1880, and Curtis born in 1898). By this census of 1900, Cal is clearly identified as being
of African heritage. By 1930, Joseph White is reporting along with his wife and children from
Precinct 4 and can only be assumed to have settled on what was a portion of the White family
land identified as the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Segment B-231. Doch White is reported in
Precinct 2 and his relationship is still unclear.
While this occupation of this particular parcel of land by this extended family does not
necessarily impart significance to the recorded site, the social background of a free black family
in Texas in 1860, both before settling on the parcel identified as Segment B-231 and possibly
afterwards as well, is interesting and probably deserves future study by others.
During the current field investigation, a total of nine shovel tests were excavated on site
41CS299, six of which were positive. The typical soil pedon consisted of yellowish brown
(10YR 5/4) sandy loam extending 0 to 20 cmbs overlying brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy-clay loam.
Shovel testing and surface inspection determined the site to be approximately 170 by 60 m.

A variety of household related historic artifacts were observed on the site. The following
discussion provides some background information relating to historic artifacts. This information
is useful when trying to determine occupation date, site type and/or function, activity areas.
Window Glass
Window glass can be relatively dated by inserting the thickness measurement into Randall
Moirâs (1987:77) regression equation of I=84.22(T) + 1712.7 (in which âIâ equals the date of
construction, and âTâ equals the mean thickness in millimeters). Moirâs regression equation
provides an approximate date of manufacture for window glass that spans +/- seven years. The
dates generated by Moirâs equation are helpful in establishing approximate dates of building
construction episodes and/or occupation. Often times more than one date is generated when all
the window glass at a site is analyzed, thus resulting in a multimodal distribution pattern in
window glass thickness and/or dates. The generation of multimodal distribution patterns, often,
indicates more than one construction episode, or that renovation has occurred on an historic site.
Bottle Glass
Like window glass, certain aspects found in bottle glass display the physical characteristics
indicative of the technology and methods employed when it was manufactured. Characteristics
such as mold seam length, makerâs marks, and glass color provide clues as to when, and
sometimes where, a piece of bottle glass was manufactured. Knowing the approximate date of
manufacture for bottle provides clues as to the approximate time period when they were being
used at historic sites, and thus, approximate periods of occupation can be assigned to a site.
The color of glass can, in many cases, provides clues as to when certain bottles were
manufactured.

In glass production, when iron impurities in silica are exposed to extreme

temperatures, a variety of natural colors (e.g., green, light amber, pink, and aqua) can be
produced. These natural colors are common in glass manufactured prior to 1880. In 1880, the
process of preserving cooked food in glass containers was developed; this process had lasting
effects on bottle glass morphology and composition in the subsequent years to follow. In order
for the consumer to view preserved food, the demand for clear glass increased tremendously
after 1880. To produce clear glass, different compounds had to be introduced into the glass
Page 64

recipe, in order to neutralize the green, amber, pink, and aqua colors that reside in unaltered
natural glass. From 1880 to 1915, imported German manganese was the color neutralizer
predominately employed by American glass manufacturers (Munsey 1970:55). With the onset of
WWI, Germany stopped the exportation of manganese to America, thus forcing the U.S. to use a
chemical compound called selenium as a color neutralizer. Selenium was commonly used in
American glass manufacture until 1930 (when arsenic replaced selenium). Unbeknownst to the
glass manufacturers, when clear glass with manganese is exposed to the sunâs ultraviolet
radiation for extended periods, impurities within the manganese compound oxidize giving glass a
purple (amethyst) color (Munsey 1970:55). However, when glass with selenium is exposed to
the sunâs ultraviolet radiation, a light amber color is produced. Thus, whenever an archaeologist
observes purple (amethyst) colored glass at a historic site, it can be deduced that the site was
more than likely occupied during the 1880 to 1915 time period. Like purple (amethyst) glass,
temporal associations (1915 to 1930) can be given when light amber glass is observed at historic
sites. Table 4-21 gives the approximate ages that can be assigned to glass based solely on color.

Ceramics
Within different periods of American history, certain ceramic types and glazes were favored and
more common than others. Thus, characteristics such as glaze, form, and composition can
indicate approximately when, and sometimes where, ceramic goods were manufactured. The
following is a discussion of the different ceramic types and glazes that can be used as dating aids.
Within America, stoneware (a heavy and strong ceramic) was first successfully produced in 1735
on the island of Manhattan. From 1830 to 1920, stoneware was being hand produced in large
numbers from various kilns in Texas, Missouri, Ohio, California, and Arkansas (Ketchum 2000).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 65

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

The different types of glazes used on stoneware can also provide clues as to the date of
manufacture. Over different time periods, various glazes have been used on stoneware ceramics,
which can be used to determine approximately when and where manufacturing occurred. In
Texas, where stoneware continued to be produced in low quantities well into the 1950s, a
greenish alkaline âtobacco spitâ glaze was often the glaze of choice. Other popular glazes used
in Texas during the twentieth century include, Bristol Glaze (a white salt glaze) and Albany Slip
(a brown glaze). Large amounts of stoneware featuring Bristol glaze were produced in Texas
from 1920 to 1950 (Ketchum 2000).
The presence of ceramic whiteware on an archaeological site is a good indicator of nineteenth
and early twentieth century occupation. During most of the nineteenth century, whitewares in
America were primarily manufactured in Great Britain. It was only after tariffs were placed on
ceramics in 1880 that American companies (located primarily in Ohio and New Jersey) began to
produce white wares in large numbers for the American consumer (Ketchum 2000:12).
Ironstone, an inexpensive, thick, and durable form of whiteware, was produced in large numbers
by factories in northeast America from 1880 to 1920. Ironstone, which was commonly used as
tableware, was very popular during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries and is
commonly seen on historic archaeological sites (Ketchum 2000).
A total of 61 artifacts were recorded in six of the nine shovel tests excavated at the site (Table 422). ST 2 contained 51 percent (31 of 61) of all artifacts recorded. Artifacts associated with
structural material comprised 31 percent (19 of 61) of all material encountered, while household
ceramics comprised 28 percent (17 of 61) and bottle glass comprised 38 percent (23 of 61).
Ninety-five percent (58 of 61) of all material was recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs (Table 4-23).
One-hundred percent (19 of 19) of all structural, 71 percent (17 of 21) of all household ceramics,
and 48 percent (11 of 23) of all bottle glass were recorded between 0 and 20 cmbs. Of the three
artifacts recovered between 40 and 60 cmbs, two (i.e., one ceramic and clear bottle glass) were
relatively modern.

Three specimens of window glass were recovered within 41CS299 (see Table 4-22). All three
specimens were dated using Moirâs regression equation. The window glass specimens collected
at this site originated during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries (Table 4-24). A total
of 24 bottle glass shards were recorded within 41CS299 (see Table 4-22).
comprised 78 percent (18 of 23) all glass recorded.

Modern glass

Only three specimens of glass with

manufacture dates prior to 1900 (i.e., aqua) were recorded on the site. Whiteware comprised 88
percent (15 of 17) of all ceramics collected. The remaining ceramic specimens consisted of one
Albany and Bristol slipped stoneware sherd and one undecorated porcelain rim sherd (see Table
4-22). The presence of prehistoric artifacts presumes human occupation/settlement of an area
prior to 1700 (the start of the Historic Period in Texas). However, in the context of historic sites,
many prehistoric artifacts are inadvertently brought in as construction fill for structures/roads,
and thus have intrusive origins. The prehistoric material encountered in ST 4 (i.e., two external
flakes) was recovered between 20 and 60 cmbs (see Tables 4-22 and 4-23).

41CS300
41CS300 is located approximately 700 m north of 41CS299 within a flat and densely vegetated
floodplain setting.

The typical soil pedon encountered during shovel testing consisted of

yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam 0 to 20 cmbs overlying reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6)
sandy-clay loam. Shovel testing revealed the site to be approximately 60 by 20 m in size (Figure
4-27).

Page 68

Figure 4-27 Site Sketch Map, 41CS300.

A total of twelve artifacts were recorded in five of the nine shovel tests excavated on the site
(Table 4-25). Lithics comprised 66 percent (8 of 12) of all material recovered. Seventy-five
percent (6 of 8) of all lithics and 66 percent (2 of 3) of all ceramics were recorded between 0 and
20 cmbs (Table 4-26). In addition, the only specimen of FCR was recorded between 0 and 20
cmbs.
The 41CS300 ceramic sample included five body sherds and five very small sherds which were
not analyzed. Three of the body sherds were brushed, one was punctuated, and one was plain.
None of the decorations observed were identifiable with a particular type. Sherd thickness
ranged from 5 to 8 mm. Firing oxidization and reduction included two completely oxidized, one
completely reduced, and two half oxidized and half reduced (Appendix C).

sandy loam extending 0 to 20 cmbs overlying brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy-clay loam. 41CS301
conforms to minimum requirements that define an archaeological site in this area (i.e., two
artifacts located in one shovel test). The typical soil pedon encountered during shovel testing
consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam 0 to 40 cmbs overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/8)
sandy-clay loam. Shovel testing revealed the site to be approximately 15 by 15 m in size (Figure
4-28).
A total of five shovel tests were excavated in order to determine site size and nature of cultural
resource deposition. Shovel test DD6 was the only shovel test that yielded cultural material, two
exterior flakes collected between 0 to 20 cmbs. As transects DD and CC were only about 20 m

to ensure coverage both on and off the hill. However, all remaining shovel tests were negative.
41CS302
41CS302 is located on the edge of Lake Wright Patman approximately 100 m southwest of
41CS88. Upon close investigation, the site appears to be located in an area where soils within an

floodwaters and then transported down slope towards the lake forming the grassy terrace located
in the central portion of the site (Figure 4-29). The typical soil pedon encountered during shovel
testing consisted of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam extending 0 to 10 cmbs overlying
reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy-clay loam.

Shovel testing revealed the site to be

approximately 40 by 20 m in size. A small concentration of artifacts (i.e., one ceramic sherd and
five lithic flakes) was located on the edge of the grassy terrace.

Three shovel tests were placed on the more stable upland area south of the beach, but cultural
material was not encountered in the three shovel tests excavated.
One ceramic shard was recovered on the surface of the site. The sherd was an engraved body
sherd with an unidentifiable curvilinear design, 6 mm thick, containing grog temper, and a
smoothed surface (see Appendix C).

Sites Not Relocated
As previously stated, this survey was unable to verify the presence of nine previously recorded
archaeological sites (41CS45, 41CS81, 41CS82, 41CS83, 41CS84, 41CS86, 41CS87, 41CS90,
and 41CS112) within the Mill Creek North area despite shovel testing at the locations on record.
The following section provides background information on each of the sites not relocated in the
area and states the methodology employed and results of investigation. The NRHP eligibility
determinations generated after analyzing these results are presented in Section 5.0.
Site 41CS45
Site 41CS45 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), the 40 by 2
m site is located on a small sandbar island within the confines of Lake Wright Patman. Artifacts
recorded on the surface of 41CS45 by Malone include unidentified ceramic sherds, lithic flakes,
and cores. During the current survey, the team found the site to be completely underwater
(Figure 4-30). Accordingly, no work was conducted on 41CS45.
Site 41CS81
Site 41CS81 was originally recorded in February 1970 by Larry Head and James M. Malone
while performing the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the
Texarkana Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Head and Malone
(TADSF), the small (5 by 5 m) site is located on a sandy peninsula that extends into Lake Wright
Patman. Artifacts recorded on the surface of 41CS45 by Head and Malone include lithic flakes
and one unidentified projectile point (TADSF).

During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41CS81 as plotted on original site data
forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the ground surface or in surface exposures. In addition, five shovel
tests were excavated within the suspected site in order to ascertain the nature of subsurface
cultural resources. The investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the
surface of the site.

Site 41CS82 was originally recorded in February 1970 by Larry Head and James M. Malone
while performing the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the
Texarkana Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Head and Malone
(TADSF), the 300 by 150 m site is located in a drainage and series of natural terraces that have
been altered to form bluffs. A three-sided cement embankment had been constructed; mounting
blocks and steel bolts were observed at the time (TADSF).

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

This site lies on the line between two parcels of land obtained by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers in fee during the construction of Texarkana Reservoir (Lake Wright Patman). The two
parcels are identified as Segment B-234 (195 acres at taking) and Segment B-23l (105 acres at
taking). The structure identified by Briggs and Malone (1970) at this location does not appear
either on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangles for the area nor on any map
prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Several oil and mineral leases were identified for
the two parcels while in private ownership and the structure may be related to the operation of
these leases. The ownership history for the two parcels does not appear to have significant
interest nor does it appear that any significant historical associations with the land are present.
While one set of owners may have some historical interest as noted in the census records for the
period, there is nothing to indicate that particular family was settled on the particular parcel prior
to recorded ownership records from 1906 and 1919, the reported dates of ownership.
Segment B-231 is located within the Cannon Smith Survey (see Figure 4-26) provided in entirety
to James H. Johnson on May 18, 1841. Johnson provided a warrant deed to John H. Graham for
665 acres out of the Smith Survey on June 12, 1876 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume X,
page 595). Graham immediately sold the land to David P. Lindsay on 22 September 1876 (Cass
County Deed Records, Volume Y, pages 59-60). The record is unclear at this point but Graham
transfers the land to E.A. Allday, possibly because of a default on the property. E.A. Allday is
listed on the Cass County Commissioners Court and is also occasionally signing documents as
the County Clerk. Allday provides a 182-acre parcel to J.C. Adams in an instrument dated
October 27, 1884 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume P-2, page 548). This 182-acre parcel
contains the 105-acre U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fee parcel identified as B-231. Again, the
records are incomplete. This land, along with the adjoining B-234, is transferred from Adams to
F. F. (Fannie) Moore sometime around 1891. Fannie is married to a William E. Moore. The 1900
census notes W. E. Moore, occupation farmer, as being born 1852 in Mississippi and Fannie as
being born in 1863 in Alabama. W. E. Moore and wife Fannie deed this parcel to Calvin (Cal)
White, George Washington, and Randall Collins on November 30, 1906 (Cass County Deed
Records, Volume K,-3, pages 88-89). All three quit claim the land to Dochie (Doch) White, also
on November 30, 1906 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume K-3, pages 90-91). Doch is
apparently related to Cal White but the available census records don't place them in the same

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

household and the existing probates do not indicate a link. Additionally, Doch White is in the
1910 census as being 24 years of age at the time of the census. The discussion for Site 41CS299
below continues this topic. On December 14, 1938, Mary White gift deeds a parcel of land same
as that sold to White, Washington, and Collins, and same as sold from White, Washington, and
Collins to Doch White, to a Joseph White (Cass County Deed Records, Volume X-7 , page 165).
Mary is wife of Cal White and it is unclear how the transfer from Doch to Cal may have
occurred. Doch retains some part of the original 182-acre parcel and also owns a portion of the
adjoining parcel identified as B234 below. Joseph White also receives in warrant deeds a parcel
from Curtis White and a parcel from Lovie White on January 26, 1949 (Cass County Deed
Records, volume 252, page 268). Joseph, Curtis, and Lovie are children of Cal and Mary and it
can be assumed that they were provided portions of the estate at some point. An oil lease is
present in the records stating in 1946 to a Nat Curtright from Curtis which identifies the
applicable rent payments to Curtis at 32.82 acres, Joseph at 32.82 acres, and Minnie Jones
(another daughter of Cal and Mary) at 16.57 acres (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 238,
page 101). Joseph White et al., then appears in a declaration of taking dated July 5, 1951 from
the United States of America for 105 acres (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 264, page 320).
Structures were present on Segment B-231 but not at this location (see discussion for Site
41CS299 below).
Segment B-234 is also located within the Cannon Smith Survey (patent 444, Volume 7) provided
in entirety to James H. Johnson on May 18, 1841. The land follows a similar path as Segment B231 above and the land is provided to E. A. Allday, who warrant deeds a 155-acre parcel to a
James H. Adams in an instrument dated January 19, 1891 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume
M-2, page 388). This 182-acre parcel contains the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fee parcel
identified as B-231. The 155-acres, located within the parcel identified as B-234, is transferred
from Adams to Fannie Moore on June 19, 1891 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume Q-2, pages
71-72). W. E. Moore and Fannie warrant deed the 155-acres to Jim Mitchell on January 28, 1907
(Cass County Deed Records, Volume Q-2, pages 71-72). Mitchell assigns the land R. S. Allday
in a deed dated November 11, 1909, and specifically noting that the land is now 145 acres
because a 10 acre parcel has been set aside in the southwestern corner of the parcel for J. C.
Adams (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 0-3, page 274). Allday promptly transfers the 145

Page 76

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

acres to E. E. Authrey in a warrant deed dated November 20, 1909 (Cass County Deed Records,
Volume F-4, page 69). Authrey either sells or the land is assumed otherwise because it then
appears in a warrant deed for an I. S. Kilgore to Doch White on October 19, 1919 (Cass County
Deed Records, Volume M-4, page 611). Doch White transfers the l45 acres to B. F. Ellington
and Company in a warrant deed dated March 15, 1923 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume Z-4,
page 19). Doch subsequently transfers another parcel consisting of 50 acres to John Ellington, Sr.
on May 31, 1924 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume E-5, pages 124-125). It is possible that
the Ellingtons were court trustees, or that they themselves lost the property, because the land
next appears in the hands of named trustees S. H. Vance, Henry King, R. P. Dunkin, and M. T.
Brooks, as a 195 acre parcel. S. H. Vance provides an oil lease to L. A. Grelling on May 1, 1944
(Cass County Deed Records, Volume G-9, page 437). The 195 acres of land then appears in a
commissionerâs court judgment, declaration of taking by the United States of America on May 5,
1955 (Cass County Deed Records, Volume 312, pages 71-72). No structures are referenced as
being present on Segment B-234 at the time of taking.
During the current field investigation, the survey team visited the location of 41CS82 as plotted
on original site data forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and
surrounding areas. No artifacts were observed on the ground surface or in any surface exposures.
In addition, six shovel tests were excavated within the suspected site area in order to ascertain
the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The investigation resulted in the discovery of no
artifacts on or below the surface of the site, but the heavy brush in the area may have obscured
the presence of any surface features.
41CS83
Site 41CS83 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. As recorded by Malone (TADSF), 41CS83
is a linear site (3 by 100 m) located on a sand peninsula that extends into Lake Wright Patman
and is normally submerged underwater during most of the year. Artifacts recorded at 41CS83 by
Malone include, lithic cores and flakes, ceramic sherds, and one large metate (TADSF). During
the current investigation, the survey team visited the location of 41CS83 as stated on original site

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 77

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

data forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the ground surface or in exposures. Five shovel tests were excavated
in the suspected site area order to ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The
investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface.
41CS84
Site 41CS84 was originally recorded in February 1970 by Larry Head and James M. Malone
while performing the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the
Texarkana Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Head and Malone
(TADSF), the extremely small site, measuring only 1 by 5 m, is located on a small sandy
peninsula located in proximity to a swampy bog and is normally submerged underwater most of
the year. Artifacts recorded on the surface include three ceramic sherds, and one lithic core.
During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41CS84 stated on original site data
forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. The bog
plotted on the 1970 map was relocated, although its location was found to match more closely to
where site 41CS112 was plotted. Five shovel tests were excavated around the bog in order to
locate any subsurface cultural resources (Figure 4-31).

The investigation resulted in the

discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.
41CS86
Site 41CS86 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), the small
site (2 by 40 m) is located on an elevated sandy beach that is partially submerged most of the year.
Artifacts recorded on the surface include: plain and decorated ceramic sherds, lithic flakes, and FCR.
During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41CS86 stated on original site data
forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the ground surface. In addition, four shovel tests were excavated
within the suspected site area in order to ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources.
The investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.

41CS87
Site 41CS87 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while performing
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), site
41CS87 is located on a small highly eroded island of undetermined size within Lake Wright
Patman that is submerged by water most of the year. Artifacts recorded on the surface include
plain and decorated ceramic sherds, lithic flakes, and FCR (TADSF).
During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41CS87 as plotted on the original site
data forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the ground surface or in exposures. In addition, two shovel tests were
excavated in this area in order to ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The
investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface.

41CS90
Site 41CS90 was originally recorded in February 1970 by James M. Malone while conducting
the archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana
Reservoir, currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Malone (TADSF), 41CS90 is
a small site, measuring 20 by 20 m, and is located on a small sandy beach located west of a long
narrow peninsula that is submerged most of the year. Artifacts recorded on the surface include
ceramics, lithic flakes, and ground stone (TADSF).
During the current investigation, the survey team visited the location of 41CS90 as stated on the
original site data forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding
areas. No artifacts were seen on the ground surface. In addition, two shovel tests were excavated
in this area in order to ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The investigation
resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface.
41CS112
Site 41CS112 was originally recorded in February 1970 by Alton K. Briggs while performing the
archaeological inventory associated with the proposed enlargement of the Texarkana Reservoir,
currently known as Lake Wright Patman. According to Briggs (TADSF), the 20 by 15 m site is
located on a small beach which was eroding into Lake Wright Patman and is submerged by water
most of the year. Artifacts recorded on the surface include plain ceramics, lithic flakes, and
FCR.
During the current survey, the survey team visited the recorded location of 41CS112 but, as
stated above, the description of the location of site 41CS112 seemed to match more closely with
the plotted location of site 41CS84. Nevertheless, even if the two site locations were switched,
the area just east of the bog was found to be completely underwater.

Accordingly, no

investigations were conducted on 41CS112 during this inventory.
Isolated Occurrences
Ten artifacts were recovered within isolated contexts (i.e., not within a site) in shovel tests along
survey transects located in the Mill Creek North and Armstrong Landing West inventory areas.

Page 80

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

Excluding the modern debris encountered in ST 1 at Mill Creek North, all the isolated finds
consisted of small sized interior and exterior flakes (Table 4-27). Due to their isolated contexts, it
has been determined that the following artifacts will not contribute to the further understanding
of the project area and thus, will not be considered further.

4.2 LAKE SAM RAYBURN
The investigations at Lake Sam Rayburn called for the archaeological survey of 524 cumulative
acres of land located in five areas (Table 4-28). During this survey, 315 shovel tests were
excavated within the five areas. Of these, only four shovel tests contained cultural material. The
survey resulted in the discovery of two new archaeological sites within the McGee Hill land
tract. In addition, previously recorded archaeological site 41SB84 was relocated and shovel
tested while surveying the 113-acre Massey Goode Branch parcel.

4.2.1 McGee Hill South
The 88-acre McGee Hill South tract was completely inventoried using 55 shovel tests for a
density of 0.6 shovel tests per acre. As previously stated, the survey resulted in the discovery of
two previously unrecorded archaeological sites.

During the survey, previously recorded

archaeological sites 41JP126 and 41JP127 could not be relocated, despite shovel testing at the
locations on record.
Newly Discovered Sites
41JP159
41JP159 is described as a 30 by 40 m prehistoric site located along the west bank of the Angelina
River just south of the Sam Rayburn Dam and west of McGee Bend (Figure 4-32). The river
curves around the site from the east towards the west, and includes a small drainage that wraps
around the west side of the site. In this location, the site has a southern aspect and the Angelina
River is immediately south of the site. The site is situated on a low ridge or knoll which appears
to be a natural interfluve.
The typical soil pedon encountered during shovel testing consisted of yellowish brown (10YR
5/4) sandy loam extending to 50 cmbs overlying dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy-clay
loam. The site conforms to the site definition (i.e., two artifacts located in one shovel test) but of
six shovel tests excavated on this site, only on test was positive. A total of eight lithic flakes were
recorded in ST D-4 but no artifacts were recovered from any of the five other shovel tests
excavated (Table 4-29). In ST D-4, all artifacts were recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs (Table 430.
Despite the number of artifacts present in this one shovel test, the landform does not appear to be
a mound that has been formed through cultural processes. The site is immediately adjacent to the
channelized river and is only 400 m south of, and down slope from, the Lake Sam Rayburn
impoundment structure, a location which certainly received considerable disturbance from heavy
machinery during dam construction. It is possible that the artifacts present on this site represent
secondary deposits resulting from down slope erosion from the dam structure upslope.

41JP160
41JP160 is described as a 25 by 40 m prehistoric site located on a flat floodplain surface
approximately 1.6 kilometers west of 41JP159 just south of where a small unnamed dirt road
intersects R255 (Figure 4-33). A manmade ditch runs through the north-central portion of the
site adjacent to the east-west running paved road. The typical soil pedon encountered during
shovel testing consisted brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam extending 0 to 60 cmbs. A total of seven
artifacts (i.e., five external flakes and two FCR) were recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs in two of
the five shovel tests excavated within the site (Tables 4-31 and 4-32).
Sites Not Relocated
As previously stated, two previously recorded archaeological sites (i.e., 41CS126, 41CS127)
were not relocated despite intensive shovel testing at the locations on record. The following
section provides some background information on each of the sites not located in this area and
states the methodology employed and results of investigation.

The NRHP eligibility

determinations for each site are presented in Section 5.0.

41JP126
Site 41JP126 was originally recorded in December 1993 by Velicia Hubbard while conducting a
seismic line survey within the area. According to Hubbard (TADSF), 41JP126 is located on the
edge of a hill just west of the Sam Rayburn Dam and east of a large erosion gully. The site was
defined by a single positive shovel test. Artifacts recorded include lithic cores, flakes, and one
biface.
During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41JP126 as stated on the original site
data forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the surface. In addition, two shovel tests were excavated within this
area in order to assess any subsurface cultural resources. Additional shovel tests were not
possible due to the steep slopes in the area. The investigation resulted in the discovery of no
artifacts on or below the surface.

Page 86

41JP127
41JP127 was also originally recorded in December 1993 by Velicia Hubbard while conducting a
seismic line survey within the area. According to Hubbard (TADSF), 41JP127 is located on a
hill just west of the Sam Rayburn Dam just east of a steep north-south running gully. The site
was defined by a single positive shovel test. Artifacts recorded included lithic cores and flakes
(TADSF).
During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41JP127 stated on original site data
forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the surface. Six shovel tests were excavated within the site in order to
ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The investigation resulted in the discovery
of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.
4.2.2 McGee Hill North
The 74-acre McGee Hill North tract was completely inventoried using 55 shovel tests for a
density of 0.6 shovel tests per acre.

The survey resulted in the discovery of no new

archaeological sites. During the survey, previously recorded archaeological sites 41JP99 could
not be relocated, despite intensive shovel testing at the locations on record.
Sites Not Relocated
41JP99
Site 41JP99 was initially recorded by Sheldon Kindall as part of a Houston Archaeological
Society summer project. Kindall did not visit the site but based the recordation on the
recollections of avocationalist Andy Kyle who had been collecting artifacts from the area since
the 1940s. Others had also collected from this area as well and, according to records maintained
at TARL, 41JP99 has been heavily collected on for many years. Some of the projectile points
collected from this site were sorted and typed by Leland Paterson and are currently on display at
the Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center (TADSF). The site was recorded along
the northern edge of McGee Hill approximately 200 southeast of previously recorded site
41JP50. Site dimensions are not recorded but may be calculated from the site plotting at TARL
as 100 by 90 m.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 87

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

During the current survey, the team visited the location of 41JP99 stated on original site data
forms and conducted an intensive surface inspection of the site and surrounding areas. No
artifacts were observed on the ground surface. Twelve shovel tests were excavated within the
suspected site area in order to ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. These
investigations resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.
4.2.3 Massey Goode Branch
The 113-acre Massey Goode Branch tract was completely inventoried using 75 shovel tests for a
density of 0.7 shovel tests per acre. The survey resulted in the discovery no new archaeological
sites. However, one previously recorded site was relocated during the survey.
Revisited Sites
Site 41SB84
Site 41SB84 was initially recorded in 1980 by Carey Webber of the USACE who described it as
being a large Pre-Caddo/Early Ceramic to Caddo/Late Ceramic occupation.

During this

investigation Webber reported seeing numerous ceramic and lithic artifacts, including one Alba
Point, on the site surface (TADSF). In 1986 the site was recorded by Sheldon Kindall as part of
a Houston Archaeological Society summer project. Kindall did not visit the site but based the
recordation on the recollections of avocationalist Andy Kyle who had been collecting artifacts
from the area since the 1940s. Others had also collected from this area as well, and according to
records maintained at TARL, 41SB84 has been heavily collected for many years. One of the
point collections originating from this site was sorted and typed by Leland Paterson and is
currently on display at the Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center (TADSF).
Site 41SB84 is currently described as a 70 by 40 m prehistoric site situated along the edge of a
sandy ridge (Figure 4-34). It is located adjacent to an unnamed northwest-southeast running dirt
and gravel road which runs directly into Lake Sam Rayburn. The lake covers the southern edge
of the site. The typical soil pedon encountered during shovel testing consisted of dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam extending to 40 cmbs overlying yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay.

A total of six shovel tests were excavated in order to determine site size and the extent of cultural
resource deposition. Of these six shovel tests, only a single test recovered cultural material.
Within ST 3, one internal flake was collected between 40 and 60 cmbs

4.2.4 South Powell Park
The 150-acre South Powell Park area was completely inventoried using 79 shovel tests for a
density of 0.53 shovel tests per acre. No previously recorded sites were located during the
records search, and the survey resulted in the discovery of no new archaeological sites.
The area was found to have very low elevations and thus was swampy in several areas. In the
center of the parcel were located an un-maintained park facility with tables and charcoal grills,
the remains of a modern concrete structure, and several ponds surrounded by chain-link fencing.
In addition, a long line of rip-rap extended out into the water on the west side of the peninsula
and was connected to an old asphalt-covered road leading to the abandoned facility. A barbed
wire fence paralleled the road on the south side (Figures 4-35 to 4-37). Four shovel tests were
placed around the stone pile and fence, but no cultural material of any kind was recovered. In
addition, the facility, and ponds appeared to be recent operations. Most likely, a historic records
search of the area would be able to determine the function and exact age of the facility.

4.2.5 Hurricane Creek and Islands
The Hurricane Creek and Islands parcel was originally set at 173 acres, which included portions
of the mainland, one large peninsula, and three islands to the east of the mainland. Because the
water level at the time of the survey was high, large portions of the mainland, which were at low
elevations, were heavily inundated and swampy, the peninsula was cut off from the mainland to

form an island, and one of the three islands to the east was completely underwater. Observations
of the foliage in and around these areas indicate this is a common phenomenon. Thus, only
slightly more than half of the 173-acre Hurricane Creek parcel was surveyed, totaling some 99
acres. These areas were completely inventoried using 51 shovel tests for a density of 0.5 shovel
tests per acre. The survey resulted in the discovery of no new cultural resources, and previously
recorded sites 41AG19 and 41AG87 could not be relocated.
Because the Hurricane Creek and Islands parcel could not be completely inventoried, a
replacement parcel (McGee Hill North) was surveyed instead, totaling 74 acres (see above).
Sites Not Relocated
41AG19
Site 41AG19 was originally recorded before 1948 by G.E. Arnold who described the site as a
village located on the edge of a terrace overlooking the Angelina River. Early and Late stage
ceramics as well as some lithic artifacts were reported on the surface of the site.

R. L.

Stephenson also investigated the site in 1948 and described the areas as a small campsite
containing ceramics and projectile points, some of which have been collected by the property
owners.
During the current survey, the team conducted an intensive surface inspection of the island on
which the site was recorded and six shovel tests were excavated within this area in order to
ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources. The investigation resulted in the discovery
of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.
41AG87
Site 41AG87 was originally recorded by Oliver D. Bounds in 1980 on an island northwest of
Stanley Creek and south of the Angelina River. The site was described as a late lithic, PreCaddo/Early Ceramic site containing dart points, arrow points, ceramic body sherds, and some
decorated sherds. The site was determined to be less than 100 square meters and heavily
inundated (TADSF).

During the current survey, the team conducted an intensive surface inspection of the island on
which the site was recorded and six shovel tests were excavated within the area in order to
ascertain the nature of subsurface cultural resources.

Particular attention was paid to the

northern bank of the island where part of the site was located at a higher elevation. The
investigation resulted in the discovery of no artifacts on or below the surface of the site.
Isolated Occurrences
No isolated occurrences were located in any of the five survey parcels at Lake Sam Rayburn.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 SUMMARY OF RESULTS
This cultural resources inventory investigated seven separate locations in five counties of East
Texas. Two parcels were at Lake Wright Patman in Cass County, and five parcels were at Lake
Sam Rayburn in Jasper, Angelina, Sabina, and San Augustine Counties. The sample consisted of
1,612 acres and the seven parcels ranged in size from 74 acres to 628 acres. Field methods
included a pedestrian inventory accompanied by excavation of 924 shovel tests. Shovel tests
were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cm below
the surface. Overall testing density for the project was 0.6 tests per acre.
The inventory investigated a total of 39 archaeological sites including 24 previously recorded
sites and 15 newly discovered sites. No historic buildings or structures (greater than 50 years
old) were present in any of the inventory areas but the remains of several modern structures were
located at South Powell Park. Of the 924 shovel tests dug within all inventory areas, 70 were
positive for an overall yield of 7.6% (Table 5-1).

Sixty of these positive tests were on the 22

sites and 10 were isolated tests not clearly associated with any site. The remaining 854 tests
were negative, including 62 negative tests that were excavated on sites and 792 negative tests
that were dug on transects.
Of the 24 previously recorded sites, the field inventory found no trace of 17 sites despite careful
surface inspection and shovel testing in the site areas. These 17 sites were not re-recorded. The

remaining seven previously recorded sites were successfully relocated and, together with the 15
newly discovered sites, were recorded for a total of 22 recorded sites (Table 5-1)
Only seven of these 22 recorded sites yielded temporally sensitive artifacts, consisting of
prehistoric ceramics and lithics from five sites and historic material from two sites.

The

prehistoric ceramics were grog- and grog/bone-tempered Caddo and resembled sherds that have
been dated elsewhere between the periods A.D. 500-1000, 1000, 1400-1700, and 1200-1600.
The dart points have been dated from A.D. 700-1100 and 1200-1500. Both of the historic sites
date to the early decades of the twentieth century.
5.2 MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The eligibility of any given archaeological site for inclusion on the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the siteâs âsignificance,â or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known - or are
suspected - to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against a
set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.
These research questions are discussed in the planning document for East Texas (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993).
The 17 previously recorded sites which could not be verified in the field are all considered to be
of unknown NRHP eligibility subject to further investigation pending additional projects in the
area. One of the 22 recorded sites, 41CS37, is considered to eligible for the NRHP. Using the
limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear site evaluation could not be reached for nine sites.
At present, it is unknown whether or not these nine sites may be eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP and they should be protected from adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected, these
sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP eligibility. The remaining 12
sites are considered not eligible for the NRHP and no further work is warranted. Each of the
verified and recorded sites is discussed briefly below, presented in site number order. A tabular
summary for the 24 previously recorded sites is presented in Table 5-2; the 15 newly discovered
sites are summarized in Table 5-3.

Site 41AG19. The artifacts noted by Arnold at this location in 1948 were not observed on or
below the surface during the current investigation. Located on a small island, 41AG19 has, in all
likelihood, been eroded and destroyed by the waters of nearby Lake Wright Patman. The site
should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41AG87. The artifacts noted on this island in 1980 by Bounds were not observed on or

destroyed by the waters of nearby Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of
unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area

Site 41CS37. This site still contains evidence of significant cultural material with possible intact
stratigraphy and burials. In addition, the presence of subsurface structural remains or features
has not been ruled out. For these reasons, 41CS37 should be considered as potentially eligible
for NRHP listing. The site should be avoided and protected.
Site 41CS38. The presence of one probable Perdiz point on the surface of 41CS38 suggests the
site has a Late Prehistoric component which has been completely destroyed by erosion and water
inundation (see Results section above).

Due to the sites low contextual integrity, the site

contains a very low potential for further research and is recommended as not eligible for the
NRHP. The bulk of the remaining artifacts observed along the waterline during the survey were
collected. No further management is recommended.
Site 41CS45. Investigations on 41CS45 found the site to be completely submerged by the waters
of Lake Wright Patman. It is highly likely that the contextual integrity of 41CS45 was destroyed
when the site was submerged by the oncoming waters of Lake Wright Patman. The site should
be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS46. It is likely the site originally described by Malone in 1970 has been covered by
two to four feet of water from Lake Wright Patman. Unfortunately, this means that the presence
or absence of cultural material at that location cannot be verified. The site that is described here
as 41CS46 is the site located at the coordinates on the TARL map, which was found to contain
very little cultural material in a heavily disturbed and inundated area. Based on the condition of
the site and paucity of artifacts, it is considered to have very low potential for further research
and is not considered eligible for the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
Site 41CS72. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not encountered on
or below the surface. In all likelihood, 41CS72 was eroded/destroyed by the waters of nearby
Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to
future projects in the area.

Site 41CS73. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not encountered on
or below the surface. In all likelihood, 41CS73 was eroded/destroyed by the waters of nearby
Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to
future projects in the area.
Site 41CS74. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not encountered on
or below the surface during the current investigation. In all likelihood, 41CS74 was
eroded/destroyed by the waters of nearby Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to
be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS75. Unfortunately, although the variety of artifacts recovered from the site 41CS75
suggests a possible occupation surface, no discrete diagnostic material was located from the
surface artifact recovery. The topsoil has been completely washed away from the area, thus
destroying the stratigraphy, and the site contains a very low potential for further research. It is
recommended as not eligible for the NRHP. No further management is necessary.
Site 41CS81. The artifacts recorded by Head and Malone at this location in 1970 were not
encountered on or below the surface. In all likelihood, 41CS81 was eroded and destroyed by the
waters of nearby Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP
status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS82. This site was not relocated and no subsurface artifacts were recorded. The site
should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS83. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not encountered on
or below the surface. In all likelihood, 41CS83 was eroded/destroyed by the waters of nearby
Lake Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to
future projects in the area.
Site 41CS84. The artifacts recorded by Head and Malone at this location in 1970 were not
encountered. In all likelihood, 41CS84 was eroded and destroyed by the waters of nearby Lake
Wright Patman. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future
projects in the area.

Site 41CS86. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not observed. The
site has probably been eroded and destroyed by the waters of nearby Lake Wright Patman The
site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS87. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not observed. The
site has probably been eroded and destroyed by Lake Wright Patman. The site should be
considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41CS88. Site 41CS88 may possibly be related to two other sites located along the beach of
Lake Wright Patman, site 41CS89 located 80 m to the east, and 41CS302 located 100 m to the
west. Although these three sites are close in proximity, no cultural material was present between
them on the beach, and they are all considered separate sites. 41CS88 by far contained the most
cultural material. However, although the site contains valuable temporally diagnostic material,
the site itself is completely deflated and erosion and wave action has destroyed much of the
horizontal and vertical integrity. Shovel testing in more the stable areas have indicated that the
site does not extend upslope, but remains at the beach level. Thus, the site is not considered to
have significant research potential, other than as a potential source of type collections, and
should not be considered eligible for inclusion to the NRHP.

No further management is

necessary
Site 41CS89. This site is only 80m to the east of site 41CS88, which contains much more
cultural material, and the two may possibly be related. However, as the site has been similarly
deflated and water inundated, without any indication of intact subsurface material south of the
beach area, this site is not considered to have significant research potential and is recommended
as not eligible for the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
Site 41CS90. The artifacts recorded by Malone at this location in 1970 were not observed. In all
likelihood, the site has been eroded and destroyed by the lake. The site should be considered to
be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.

Site 41CS112. Investigations on 41CS112 found the site to be completely submerged by the
waters of Lake Wright Patman. It is highly likely that the contextual integrity of 41CS112 was
severely impacted when the site was submerged by Lake Wright Patman. The site should be
considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41JP99. The artifacts reported at this location were not observed. The site should be
considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to future projects in the area.
Site 41JP126. The artifacts recorded by Hubbard at this location were not encountered on or
below the surface.

The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to

future projects in the area.
Site 41JP127. The artifacts recorded by Hubbard at this location were not encountered on or
below the surface. The site should be considered to be of unknown NRHP status subject to
future projects in the area.
Site 41SB84. The site is predominately covered with water, and the upland areas only contained
one artifact. Due to the negligible data returns, the site is recommended as not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP and no further research is necessary.
41CS290. The high density and variability of artifacts suggests a relatively stable and discrete
occupation surface or surfaces. The depth of the sandy loam ranged from 0 to 60 cmbs, and the
position of the artifacts within it indicate the site may retain some good spatial integrity. In
addition, 41CS291 (see below) is located only 40 m to the west of this site and the two may be
related in some way. However, the limited data returns provided by the shovel testing tactics do
not allow a clear assessment at this time of the siteâs overall research value. As a result, it is
unknown whether or not the site may be eligible for inclusion to the NRHP.

Further

investigation of the site is warranted, and until that time the site should be preserved and
protected from adverse impacts.

41CS292.

This site is a small subsurface artifact scatter containing little further research

potential. However, it is only about 120 m to the west of site 41CS37, which is the remains of a
village site occupied from the Archaic to Late Caddo Period. It is possible that these two sites
are related but there is no substantial evidence. 41CS292 does not contain a good quantity or
diversity of artifacts and it is not recommended for the inclusion to the NRHP. No further
management is recommended.
41CS293. This site conforms to the minimum requirements that define archaeological sites in
this area (i.e., two artifacts located in one shovel test). None of the shovel tests excavated around
the one positive test contained any cultural material. A berm located to the north of the site
indicates the soil has been disturbed over the years, and this site may be just a secondary deposit
of lithic material from that activity, and not an occupation surface.

Thus, the site is not

considered to have any further research potential, and is not eligible for the NRHP. No further
management is recommended.
41CS294. This site consists of a very consistent, but sparse, scattering of artifacts across a very
wide area. It is located on the edge of a low hill and extends down slope to the west until it
terminates at a steep drainage. It is possible that some of the artifacts have been washed
downhill by water action, but it is unclear at this time. The depths of recovered artifacts also
varied widely, from 0 to 60 cmbs, with no consistent depth of recovery across the site. A stable
occupation surface may exist on the upper elevations; however, the limited data returns provided
by the shovel testing tactics do not allow a clear assessment at this time of the siteâs overall
research value. As a result, the NRHP eligibility consideration for this site is unknown. Further
investigation is warranted, and until that time the site should be preserved and protected from
adverse impacts.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

41CS295. This site is a small concentration of lithic material on a sloping ground surface near a
large drainage. The limited data returns provided by the shovel testing tactics do not allow a
clear assessment at this time of the siteâs overall research value. As a result, it is unknown
whether or not the site may be eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Further investigation of the
site is warranted, and until that time the site should be preserved and protected from adverse
impacts.
41CS296. The early twentieth century structure that once stood on this location has been
completely razed and abandoned for many years.

It is unlikely that further subsurface

archaeological investigations would contribute to a better understanding of history of the area.
However, archival research is suggested in order to clearly ascertain the sites NRHP eligibility
and until that time the site should be preserved and protected from adverse impacts.
41CS297. The density of artifacts suggests a discrete occupation area, but the vertical integrity
of the site is unclear. Since all of the artifacts appear to come from within a stable forested area,
it is possible that there are multiple occupation surfaces at this site. The limited data returns
provided by the shovel testing tactics do not allow a clear assessment at this time of the siteâs
overall research value. As a result, it is unknown whether or not the site may be eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP. Further investigation of the site is warranted, and until that time the site
should be preserved and protected from adverse impacts.
41CS298. This site conforms to the minimum requirements that define archaeological sites in
this area (i.e., two artifacts located in one shovel test). All other shovel tests excavated around
the one positive test shovel test were negative. Thus, the site is not considered to have any
further research potential, and is not eligible for the NRHP.

No further management is

recommended.
41CS299. The presence of modern glass below late nineteenth century glass and within the same
depths as prehistoric material suggests a site that has an overall low contextual integrity.
Features that are commonly associated with historic home and/or farmsteads (i.e., structural
elements, wells, stone walls) were not encountered. The lack of intact historic features at this
location, more than likely, indicates the artifacts at the site have secondary depositional origins

(e.g., litter deposited by pedestrians) and thus, do not reflect true historic occupational
components. Moreover, it is known that the structures at this site were bulldozed in 1951. The
resulting extensive surface and subsurface disturbance suggests that there is no remaining
integrity to this site. The site is not considered to have any further research potential, and is not
eligible for the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
41CS300. This site is small but contains subsurface artifact in a possibly good context. The
limited data returns provided by the shovel testing tactics do not allow a clear assessment at this
time of the siteâs overall research value. As a result, it is unknown whether or not the site may
be eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Further investigation of the site is warranted, and until
that time the site should be preserved and protected from adverse impacts.
41CS301.

This site is a small subsurface artifact scatter containing little further research

potential. As this site does not contain a good quantity or diversity of artifacts, it is not
recommended for inclusion to the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
41CS302. This site is located in a disturbed area. The soils of an upper terrace on the southern
portion of the site have been severely undercut by the lake and then eroded down slope forming
the grassy terrace located in the central portion of the site. Artifact integrity is poor. As this site
does not contain a good quantity or diversity of artifacts, it is recommended as not eligible for
the inclusion to the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
41JP159. This site conforms to the minimum requirements that designate a site in this area.
Although it is located on a mound, the landform appears to be natural, and heavy modification of
the area is evident. The sites does not appear to have any structural integrity and is not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP. No further management is recommended.
41JP160. This small site is located near a road and a manmade drainage area but the subsurface
artifacts appear to be in possibly good context. However, the limited data returns provided by
the shovel testing tactics do not allow a clear assessment at this time of the siteâs overall research
value. As a result, it is unknown whether or not the site may be eligible for inclusion to the

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
Victor Galan
INTRODUCTION
The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and decorative
techniques.

The data collected from the sherds along with comments about unique

characteristics are presented in Table C-1. As the sample size was small from each site and
being collected from the surface and shovel tests, the interpretation was broad. A total of 92
sherds were examined and described from two areas: Armstrong and Mill Creek.

In the

Armstrong area 51 sherds were found at five sites; 41CS38 (n=6), 41CS290 (n=25), 41CS291
(n=9), 41CS292 (n=1), and 41CS293 (n=10). Within the Mill Creek Area, a total of 41 sherds
were found at eight sites; 41CS88 (n=7), 41CS89 (n=1), 41CS46 (n=1), 41CS297 (n=18),
41CS298 (n=2), 41CS300 (n=5), and 41CS302 (n=1). Five additional sherds were found at
41CS300 in the Mill Creek area that were less than 10 mm in size and were therefore not
analyzed. In general, the ceramic description and analysis found the decorations and temper
suggest Caddoan fine ware and utilitarian vessels.
DEFINITIONS
Sherd attributes included collection data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel
parts were described as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally
thicker cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel.
No rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprise the surface
of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing the sherd
in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5 millimeter separation. Size was determined
as the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured in millimeters (mm) with
calipers as the maximum perpendicular distance between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
sherd by pinching the thickest portion of the sherd between parallel edges of the calipers.
Vessel manufacture included examining temper and firing techniques. For this analysis, temper
categories were bone, grog, or bone/grog.

Temper was observed using a reflective light

microscope set at 25 by magnifications. Bone temper was identified by several white angular

inclusions in the vessel paste. Grog was identified by several fine angular inclusions of fired
clay. Firing was described using Teltserâs (1994:530-543) article with a chart of oxidization
patterns in sherd cross-sections.
Decoration techniques described included decoration type, location, and surface treatment.
Decoration types included incised, engraved, punctuated, brushed, and plain categories for this
analysis.

Some decorative elements were distinctive enough to relate to a specific type;

however, without decorative elements only descriptive and manufacture data was obtained. As
stated in Suhm and Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only decorated around the
rim leaving a large portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location was on the exterior of
the sherd (convex side) only for this analysis and surface treatments were described as smooth
with surfaces being created while the vessel was wet.

SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS
41CS38
A total of six ceramic sherds were analyzed from site 41CS38. All were described as body
sherds with grog temper and smoothed surfaces. All but one sherd were plain. The other sherd
was incised with two broad lines roughly 6 mm wide. The sherds were predominantly 6 mm
thick with heavily reduced interiors. Given the total sherd count and lack of decoration, no
correlations or patterns could be determined beyond describing these sherds as Caddoan.
41CS46
The single sherd found at 41CS46 was a plain body sherd with grog temper, 6 mm thick, and a
smoothed surface.
41CS88
The ceramic sherd sample from site 41CS88 totaled seven specimen included five body sherds,
one rim sherd, and one base. Decorated sherds included two engraved, one appliquÃ©, one
brushed, and one incised. One engraved sherds was most similar to the Crocket Curvilinear
(Shum and Jelks 1962) type and the other was not identifiable. The appliquÃ© sherd includes one
ridge suggestive of the Nash Neck-banded variety and the incised sherd was most similar to the

Page C-4

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

Canton Incised type (Shum and Jelks 1962). All ten sherds had smoothed surfaces and grog
temper. Thickness ranged from 4 to 10 mm with the thinnest sherd with the Crockett Curvilinear
like design and the thickest sherd the only base found on the site. Firing oxidization and
reduction was mixed with almost equal numbers of sherd in varying degrees of reduction.
41CS89
The single sherd found at 41CS89 was a plain rim sherd with grog temper, 6 mm thick, with a
smoothed and eroded surface.
41CS290
The ceramic sherd sample from 41CS290 included 25 specimens including two rims and 23 body
fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of six (24%) sherds which included
one engraved with a pattern most similar to the Barkman Engraved as depicted in Suhm and
Jelks (1962; Plate 4n), one brushed sherd with brushing in perpendicular directions, and four
incised sherds. None of the incised sherds were indicative of a particular type with varying
numbers of lines.

Surface treatment was smoothed on all sherds.

Temper was almost

exclusively grog with only one sherd containing bone. Thickness range from 5 mm to 8 mm
with no obvious correlations with decoration, temper, or firing.

Firing reduction was

predominant on 12 (44%) of the sherds followed by 4 (16%) sherds with mixed oxidization and
reduction, and only one sherd completely oxidized.
41CS291
The ceramic sherd sample from 41CS291 totaled nine specimen including one rim and eight
body fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of five (56%) sherds which
included one sherd with appliquÃ© and incising and one sherd each of appliquÃ©, brushed, incised,
and engraved. The appliquÃ© and incised sherd is most similar to the Pease Brushed-Incised
(Suhm and Jelks 1962) but the decoration present is limited by the size of the sherd. The
remaining decorated sherds did not have enough decoration for typing. Surface treatment was
smoothed on all sherds and temper was almost exclusively grog with only two sherds containing
bone and grog. Thickness range from 4 mm to 7 mm with the majority of the sherds (n=7)

between 5 and 6 mm. Firing oxidization and reduction was almost evenly split with five almost
entirely reduced and four entirely oxidized.
41CS292
One sherd was recovered from 41CS292. It was a plain, badly eroded, body sherd with grog
temper completely reduced, and 5 mm thick.
41CS294
The ceramic sample from 41CS294 totaled 11 specimens. All were body sherds. Decorative
elements included incising and punctuating (n=1), brushing (n=2), and a red slip (n=1). None of
the decorative elements were identifiable as a particular type. All of the sherds, except for the
one with red slip, has smoothed surfaces. The slipped sherd was polished. All of the sherds
were grog temper and between 4 and 7 mm thick. The slipped sherd was also the thinnest.
Seven of the ten sherds were either completely or almost completely reduced.
41CS297
The ceramic sample from 41CS297 included 18 body sherds. Decorated sherds included one
each of brushed, brushed/punctated, and engraved. None of the designs were indicative of a
particular type. The only noteworthy sherd was a plain sherd with a narrow curve suggestive of
a bottle neck. All of the sherds had grog temper and smoothed surfaces. Thickness ranged from
4 to 8 mm with the thickest sherd with the brushed/punctated decoration. Most of the sherds
(n=11, 61%) were completely reduced, one sherd was half reduced and half oxidized, and the
remainder were completely oxidized.
41CS298
The 41CS298 ceramic sample included two sherds. Both of these are body sherds; one is brushed
and one is plain. The brushed sherd was 4 mm thick and it was both completely oxidized and

Page C-6

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,612 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake Sam Rayburn, Texas

had grog temper. The plain sherd was 6 mm thick and it was both completely reduced and had
grog temper. Both sherds had smoothed surfaces.
41CS300
The ceramic sample from 41CS300 included five body sherds and five sherdlets. The sherdlest
were not analyzed. Three of the body sherds were brushed, one was punctuated, and one was
plain.

None of the decorations observed were identifiable with a particular type.

Sherd

thickness ranged from 5 to 8 mm. Firing oxidization and reduction included two completely
oxidized, one completely reduced, and two half oxidized and half reduced.
41CS302
The single sherd found at 41CS302 was an engraved body sherd with an unidentifiable
curvilinear design, grog temper, 6 mm thick, and a smoothed surface.
RESULTS
The analysis of the ceramic collections from the sites found evidence of Caddoan utilitarian
ceramics with some finewares.

In the Armstrong Area, 41CS290 contained a sherd that

compared favorably to Barkman Engraved, and 41CS291 contained a sherd that compared
favorably to Pease Brushed-Incised. These artifacts suggest occupations between AD 1200-1600
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:7 and 119).

Neither 41CS38 nor Sites #3 or #5 contained diagnostic

sherds although the 100% use of grog temper, well produced ceramics with engraved designs are
wholly consistent with Caddo occupations.
In the Mill Creek Area, only site 41CS28 contained ceramics. These included Canton Incised
Gibson Aspect (AD 1000), Crocket Curvilinear (AD 500-1000.), and Nash Neck-banded (AD
1400-1700) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:23, 31, and 111).

Mill Creek sites 41CS89, 41CS46,

41CS294, 41CS297, 41CS298, 41CS300, and 41CS302 did not contain diagnostic sherds but the
100% use of grog temper and well produced ceramics with engraved designs are consistent with
Caddo occupations.
