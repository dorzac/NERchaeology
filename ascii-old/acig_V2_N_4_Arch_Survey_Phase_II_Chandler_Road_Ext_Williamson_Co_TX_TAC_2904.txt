Archaeological Survey of Phase II of the Chandler Road
Extension Project from CR 110 to FM 1660, Williamson
County, Texas
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

aci Cultural Resources conducted an intensive archaeological survey of Phase II of the
proposed extension of Chandler Road between County Road (CR) 110 and Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1660 in south-central Williamson County, Texas from March 18 to
June 6, 2004 (Figure 1). The project area consists of the approximately 5-mile-long, 200ft.-wide, County-controlled Right-of-Way (ROW) of the proposed extension (Figure 2).
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is the County-controlled ROW and is 121 acres.
Funding for this project will come entirely from Williamson County.
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
to locate any previously recorded historic and prehistoric cultural resources within the
project area. With the benefit of this research, a 100% pedestrian survey of the entire
project area was performed. Shovel testing was performed in areas where the soil depth
appeared to exceed 10 cm.
The proposed ROW crosses Mustang Creek and four intermittent drainages (tributaries of
McNutt Creek and Cottonwood Creek). All drainages within the APE were dry during
the survey except for Mustang Creek, which crosses the ROW midway between CR 130
and FM 1660. Shovel tests conducted at Mustang Creek and the intermittent drainages
tested negative for cultural materials and significant alluvial deposits.
There are three previously recorded archaeological sites located north and south of the
project area. Sites 41WM835, 41WM1014, and 41WM1025 are early to mid-twentieth
century historic sites. Sites 41WM835 and 41WM1025 are house/farmstead sites. Site
41WM1014 is a historic dump site. The three sites are located >1 km from the APE.
There are no previously recorded archaeological sites located within the Chandler Road
Extension ROW.
During the current survey, two newly discovered sites, 41WM1097 and 41WM1098,
were found to exist within the ROW (Figure 2). Site 41WM1097 is an early to midtwentieth century house site that is most likely associated with tenant farming. The
cultural deposits within the ROW are relatively shallow and have been disturbed by
plowing, and the site contains no features. The site is not potentially eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) due to poor site integrity and lack of significant data.
Site 41WM1098 is an early to mid-twentieth century farm complex with extant house,
outbuildings, and tenant houses. The main house and tenant houses are not located
within ROW, but an early twentieth century barn and several associated outbuildings and

features are located within the ROW. The site may be potentially eligible for nomination
as a SAL or to the NRHP under Criteria A, C, and D. Under Criterion A, the site is
associated with cotton farming in Central Texas prior to mechanization, an important
period in Texas history and in the evolution of agriculture. Under Criterion C, the site
displays characteristics of a class of architecture, particularly in the form of an early
twentieth century rural residence, a remarkably preserved barn, several associated
outbuildings, and two extant tenant houses. The barn has architectural details that are no
longer common in the region. Under Criterion D, the site may contain significant data
relating to cotton farming practices prior to mechanization and patterns in early twentieth
century farm design and implementation.
Due to the potential NRHP and SAL eligibility of site 41WM1098, aci recommends that
the ROW be shifted north to avoid the site. Martha Freeman, architectural historian, has
been consulted to address the architectural value and history of the site and make further
recommendations regarding the site (see Addendum).
A total of 38 shovel tests were executed within the ROW of the Chandler Road Extension
Project (see Figure 25). Five shovel tests executed at site 41WM1097 tested positive for
cultural materials. Four shovel tests executed at site 41WM1098 tested positive for
cultural materials. All artifacts were field-identified and field-recorded. No artifacts
were collected during any part of the archaeological survey.
This report follows the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines and is designed
to satisfy State and Federal laws and regulations. The findings of the cultural resource
survey and records search are summarized and assessments and recommendations
concerning cultural resources are presented. A brief environmental background is
provided.

INTRODUCTION
Williamson County is planning the extension of Chandler Road to connect CR 110 to the
east and FM 1660 to the west. The proposed section of road is approximately 5 miles
long. The APE consists of the proposed 200-ft.-wide ROW, which is located east of
Interstate Highway 35 and roughly midway between the cities of Round Rock and
Georgetown, in Williamson County, Texas.
The Chandler Road Extension was adopted as part of the Williamson County MultiCorridor Transportation Plan in September 1999. The proposed, ±14.0-mile-long, eastwest corridor will eventually extend from FM 1460 to US 95. The first phase of the
project, the extension of Chandler Road from FM 1460 to CR 110, was surveyed by
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (now aci Cultural Resources)
archaeologists in 2001 and is currently under construction. The second phase of the
project, the extension between CR 110 and FM 1660, is the subject of this report.
As a subdivision of the State, Williamson County is obligated to comply with the Texas
Antiquities Act and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Act.
These rules are interpreted and enforced by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

After a visit to the project location, an initial scope of work was formulated to comply
with the Texas Antiquities Code. That is, “to locate, protect, and preserve all sites,
objects, buildings…, and locations of historical, archeological, educational, or scientific
interest, including but not limited to prehistoric and historical American Indian or
aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, archeological sites of every
character…within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas.” The THC approved the initial
scope of work and Texas Antiquities Permit #2904 was issued to Sean R. Nash as
principal investigator for Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG).
Area of Potential Effects
The APE is 200 ft. wide by 5 miles long and is 121 acres. The road construction will
directly affect all surface areas within the limits of construction. Impact to bedrock is
anticipated for the upland portions of the APE. In the deeper sediments of the flood
plains, box culverts will be used, limiting the impacts to soils or sediments to
approximately 1 meter. Any additional public access to the project area will be restricted
to the ROW.
Previous Projects and Recorded Sites
A records search was conducted at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites and completed surveys within the Project
Area. There are no previously recorded historic or archaeological sites located within the
APE. There are no SAL or NRHP eligible properties in or near the project area.
If there were eligible prehistoric properties in the area, they would typically be sites
buried by alluvium or colluvium or both, rock shelter or cave sites, sites containing
burials, and sites that contain or may contain information that is significant in history or
prehistory. Eligible historic properties are typically sites associated with an important
event, set of events, or person(s) that is important in our past. Eligible historic properties
are also sites that display the characteristics of a class, style, a school of architecture, or a
period of architecture. Historic properties may also be eligible if they contain significant
data. However, the properties must display a high degree of integrity. Historic properties
are usually ineligible if buildings and structures have poor structural integrity or are no
longer present.
In 2001, aci archaeologists conducted an archaeological survey of Phase I of the
Chandler Road Extension Project from FM 1460 to CR 110. No archaeological sites or
cultural materials were found during that investigation. In 2003, aci archaeologists
conducted an archaeological survey of the Hutto Bypass Project Area, which is located
immediately south of the Chandler Road ROW. One historic site was recorded during
that investigation. Site 41WM1087, a house site located along CR 164, is comprised of
the remains of a small board-and-batten house and an artifact scatter associated with the
house. The site appears to be an early to mid-twentieth century tenant farmer’s residence.
No other sites or cultural materials were observed or recorded during the Hutto Bypass
survey.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Physiography
Elevations within the Blackland Prairie region range from 300 ft. (91 m) to 800 ft. (244
m) AMSL (Texas Parks and Wildlife 1996). The overall landform in the area of the
project is characterized by gently rolling to nearly level uplands dissected by broad,
shallow valleys. Elevations within the APE range from 850 ft. (259 m) above mean sea
level (AMSL) at site 41WM1097 to 672 ft. (205 m) AMSL at the Mustang Creek
channel.
The APE crosses Mustang Creek midway between CR 130 and FM 1660. The creek is a
tributary of Brushy Creek, which is a tributary of the San Gabriel River. The San Gabriel
River is located approximately 4.9 km north of the proposed Chandler Road ROW. The
APE also crosses four ephemeral streams that are tributaries of McNutt Creek and
Cottonwood Creek.
Flora and Fauna
Lowland soils are comprised of moderately deep clays and support tall-grasses and mixed
stands of post oak, blackjack oak, and mesquite (Texas Parks and Wildlife 1996). The
upland soils are relatively shallow and support live oak, Ashe juniper, and prickly pear
cactus. The project area lies within Blair’s (1950) Texan biotic province and the flora
and fauna of the province can be found within the APE.
Geology and Soils
Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Kau) underlies the portion of the project area west of
CR 130. East of CR 130, the underlying geologic formations consist of Pleistocene High
gravel deposits (Qhg) in the upland areas and Upper Cretaceous Ozan Formation (Ko)
along Mustang Creek and its tributaries. A northeast-southwest striking fault line bisects
the ROW at the intersection of CR 130. The upthrown side of the fault line is on the
western side.
The soils within the eastern portion of the project area are comprised of BranyonHouston Black-Burleson, which are “deep, calcareous and non-calcareous, clayey soils
formed in clayey alluvium and marine clays and shales; on ancient stream terraces and
uplands” (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS]
1983). Soils within the western portion of the project area are comprised of AustinHouston Black Castephen association soils, which are deep to shallow, calcareous clayey
soils formed in marine chalk, marl, shale, and clays; on uplands” (USDA, SCS 1983)
The soils within the uplands of the APE are generally stable to erosional and are not
conducive to preserving archaeological sites. Prehistoric sites within the upland areas are
likely to be surficial, and components would be compressed within a few centimeters of
the surface or mixed and resting on the surface. Only historic sites, structured prehistoric
sites (e.g., burned rock features), or surficial lithic scatters would likely be encountered in
these settings.
6

Soils and sediments in the lowlands of the intermittent drainages and small creeks in the
APE typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition and do not present a favorable
depositional environment for the preservation of archaeological sites (USDA, SCS 1983).
However, individual locations may have atypical physiographic features (e.g. paleo­
channels) and alluvial deposits could accumulate.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
The property falls within the Central Texas archaeological area (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archaeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Throughout its occupation, hunting and gathering is
believed to be the exclusive resource procurement strategy of prehistoric Central Texans.
Sites have been interpreted to represent relatively short-term occupations. Deeper sites
with large amounts of cultural materials are thought to be camps that were returned to
through the years, possibly on a regular basis.
Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a recent synthesis of Central Texas archaeology. The
cultural history summarized here is based in large part on his synthesis. Collins divides
the prehistory of Central Texas into 3 time periods: (1) the Paleo-Indian, (2) the Archaic,
and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these has further been divided into subperiods, such
as early and late. Smaller units of time referred to as “style intervals” are used to
coincide with the interval of use of a particular point style or group of point styles. These
style intervals can overlap or extend over more than one subperiod. Most, however, can
be used to subdivide the subperiods. Information pertaining to burned rock middens,
specifically, is based primarily on Black’s (1989) research.
Paleo-Indian (Before 8800 B.P.)
The evidence (e.g., Meltzer 1993) no longer supports the long held belief that North
American Paleo-Indians could be characterized as nomadic bands of big game hunters.
Big game hunting is indicated, particularly in association with Folsom. However, a more
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence is now evidenced at Paleo-Indian sites
across Texas and the rest of North America (e.g., Burger Bluff (41GD30) and Baker
Cave). The relatively mesic conditions that prevailed from about 11,500 B.P. allowed for
a high biomass in central Texas and the surrounding regions (Collins 1995).
Clovis and Folsom style intervals divide Collins’ early Paleo-Indian period (11,200–
10,000 B.P.). Clovis is the earliest recognized cultural horizon in central Texas. Clovis
is securely dated to between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. in radiocarbon years. The WilsonLeonard, Gault, and Pavo Real sites have recently added new data to the study of these
early peoples of what is now Texas. Kincaid Rockshelter and Horn Shelter sites also
have documented Clovis components. Clovis artifacts include prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bola stones and the unique Clovis point (Collins 1995). Clovis points are usually
lanceolate, fluted projectile or lance points (Collins 1998).
The Folsom style interval is not as securely dated, and appears to overlap with Clovis.
The finely retouched and fluted Folsom points are one of the most easily recognized
points made in the Americas. In Folsom times, more than at any other interval, people
7

were specialized hunters. Bison kills with associated Folsom points remain the typical
Folsom site type. The postulated style intervals following Folsom, known as Plainview
and Dalton-San Patrice, are not well known or clearly defined. However, evidence from
sites containing components related to them, such as Horn Shelter 2, indicate an Archaiclike hunter-gatherer lifeway (Redder 1985).
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall style intervals make up Collins’ (1995)
late Paleoindian subperiod. This subperiod is characterized as intermediate or transitional
between Paleo-Indian and Archaic (Collins 1998:63–4). Burned rock features have been
found associated with all three style intervals of this subperiod, but they are substantially
smaller and less frequent than in the Archaic (Collins 1995).
Archaic (8800–1300 B.P.)
The mesic conditions of the Paleo-Indian period come to an end during the early
subperiod of the Archaic. With the exception of the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval of
the middle Archaic subperiod, this was a more xeric time for Central Texas and the
surrounding regions. A jump in the number of ground stone tools, specifically manos and
metates suggests an increased reliance on plant resources (Collins 1995). Central Texas
Archaic sites are characterized by accumulations of heat altered rock, including those
known as burned rock middens.
Three subperiods have been defined for the Central Texas Archaic: (1) early, (2) middle,
and (3) late (Johnson and Goode 1994, Collins 1995). Early Archaic sites (8800–6000
B.P.) are recognized by the presence of Angostura, Early Split Stem, and MartindaleUvalde points. Unifacial Clear Fork tools and Guadalupe bifaces are found in early
Archaic sites along with ground stone tools and other bifacial and unifacial implements.
Early Archaic earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock are found primarily on the
better-watered portions of the Edward’s plateau, in Live Oak savanna habitats. These
earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock have been considered the technological
antecedents of the classic burned rock middens (Collins 1995). However, at Ft. Hood
seven burned rock middens were carefully dated using AMS. The features spanned from
5500 BC (early Archaic) to 1400 AD (Quigg and Ellis 1994). Two others burned rock
middens in Kerr County have been dated to the early Archaic (Luke 1980). It is possible
that these reported early burned rock ovens and accumulations may represent the same
phenomenon in a different form or stage of development (e.g., incipient).
During the first interval (6000–5000 B.P.) of the middle Archaic subperiod the climate is
somewhat more mesic. Bison populations soared. The technically impressive BellAndice-Calf Creek points were likely made primarily for killing these Bison (Johnson
and Goode 1994). By 5000 B.P., the Bison had dwindled and the climate had become
more xeric again. Burned rock middens were likely used to cook sotol and other
xerophytes that thrived during these dry years (Johnson and Goode 1994:26). The last
thousand years of the middle Archaic (5000–4000 B.P.) are divided into two style
intervals, Taylor and Nolan-Travis.
The late Archaic (4000–1300 B.P.) began during the driest time central Texans had ever
experienced. There was, however, a steady increase in effective moisture until it peaked
in the later part of the late Archaic (Collins 1995). With the increase in effective
8

moisture came the return of Bison. Six style intervals are recognized for the late Archaic:
(1) Bulverde, (2) Pedernales-Kinney, (3) Lange-Marshall-Williams, (4) Marcos-MontellCastroville, (5) Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and (6) Darl.
Late Prehistoric (1300–ca. 500 B.P., or contact)
The beginning of the late Prehistoric period is defined primarily by the introduction of the
bow and arrow. Pottery was also introduced during this time, but unlike many areas in
Texas and the rest of the New World, hunting and gathering resource procurement
strategies prevailed (Collins 1995). Many documented instances of arrow wounds are
recorded during this period (Prewitt 1974).
The late Prehistoric is divided into early and late subperiods (Jelks 1962). Each
subperiod has a single style interval. The early subperiod is represented by the Austin
style interval and the late subperiod by the Toyah interval (Collins 1995). Scallorn and
Edwards points are diagnostic of the early subperiod and Perdiz is representative of the
Toyah archaeological manifestation.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth century when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De León
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las Bendítas Ánimas and Río de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, Marques
de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through present-day
Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions (The City of Round
Rock 1998). In the mid-eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established
along the San Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753,
drought and disease made the missions uninhabitable and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002a).
Anglo-American influence in the area began during the Texas Revolution and the early
days of the Republic of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835,
continual attacks by indigenous Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his
company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of
Brushy Creek, in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called,
was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002a).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenney’s Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. By the 1840s, several
settlements existed along Brushy Creek. However, battles with the indigenous
9

population were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were
killed by Indians. By 1846, the Indian resistance has weakened, and settlers moved into
the region in increasing numbers. In 1848, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam County Judge and state senator.
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002a), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850’s and 1860’s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the
county. Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the
county remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence
farms in log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave
population increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse.
Wheat and corn were the predominant crops in the blackland prairies, and cattle and
sheep ranching was widespread throughout the county, but particularly widespread in the
hilly regions west of the Balcones Escarpment (Nash et al. 2002). Cotton was introduced
in 1850s, but it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War, but picked up again
in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisolm trail, which was established in
1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s was also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson and Travis County (Odintz 2002a).
The City of Hutto was founded in 1876 with the arrival of Williamson County’s first
railroad, the International-Great Northern Railroad. The community was named after
James Emory Hutto, a local rancher on whose land the railroad station was built. By
1884, the town had 200 residents, a school, three churches, and five cotton gins. By the
early 1890s, a bank and hotel had been constructed, and by 1896, the town had 700
residents (Odintz 2002b).
Gower, a small community located on Cottonwood Creek immediately south of the
Chandler Road APE, was the site of a mill in the 1880s and a post office in 1890s. The
community was named for its first postmaster, Bennet A. Gower. A school was
established in Gower after 1896 and operated until sometime after 1903 (Scarbrough
1973). Today all that remains of the community is a few modern residences and several
dilapidated barns and early twentieth century tenant houses. Site 41WM1098 is located
immediately north of Gower and may be associated with the community.
By the early-twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
Williamson County. Many rural railroad communities, like Hutto, prospered as cotton
processing and shipment centers. The economy of Hutto was based primarily on cottonrelated activities (e.g., cotton gins and railroad shipping) (Odintz 2002b).
With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy developed. As late as
1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By 1890, 43 percent of the
farms were worked by owners. By 1930, only 29 percent of the farms were worked by
10

owners. The tenancy rates dropped during the Great Depression (Odintz 2002a) as many
tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. By 1931, the
population in the City of Hutto had fallen from its peak of 900 in 1928 to 538 (Odintz
2002b).
The cotton industry in Williamson County and in the City of Hutto suffered economically
during the 1920s from the effects of soil depletion, falling prices brought on by
overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s
worsened the economic situation and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to
livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat
became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep, poultry farming intensified
(Odintz 2002a).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant rural populations now had easier access to the urban areas.
The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend schools outside
of their rural communities.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
(Odintz 2002a). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land
also intensified following World War II.
Local development in the mid-1980s brought a growth spurt to Hutto, whose population
had increased to 630 by 1990, and the surrounding area (Odintz 2002b). Today, the
majority of the area surrounding Hutto is rural and agricultural with cotton, corn, and
sorghum being the predominant crops. However, residential development is continually
expanding from the suburbs of Round Rock to the outskirts of Hutto. Many of the farms
surrounding Hutto are being subdivided and developed as residential neighborhoods.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
A records search was conducted at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites and completed surveys. No sites have been
recorded in the APE. Three sites, 41WM835, 41WM1014, and 41WM1025, have been
recorded near the APE (i.e., 1–2 km from ROW)
Site 41WM835 is a historic farmstead site located along an intermittent drainage
approximately 1.8 km north of the Chandler Road APE. The site was recorded by
archaeologists of Antiquities Planning and Consulting in August 1996 during a cultural
resource survey of the proposed Weathery Private Housing Development. The site
measures approximately 350 ft. (north-south) x 250 ft. (east-west) and consists of several
features and an artifact scatter. Evidence of at least four buildings, one limestone cistern,
and one well were observed. Diagnostic artifacts include crockery sherds, whiteware
sherds, square nails, automotive parts, wagon parts, pink and purple bottle glass, and a
hand-forged metal bridal. The recorder recommended that the site be protected by
11

including it in a greenbelt park and that further archival research should be conducted on
the site.
Site 41WM1014 is a historic dump/house site located approximately 2 km south of the
Chandler Road APE. The site was recorded by PBS&J in October 2001 during a cultural
resource survey of the proposed State Highway 130 Construction Project for the Texas
Department of Transportation and the Texas Turnpike Authority. The site consists of a
surficial artifact scatter that measures approximately 30 m (north-south) x 35 m (east­
west). Artifacts include glass bottles, various ceramic sherds, tin cans, toys, a 1951
license plate, and automobile tires. The site has been heavily disturbed by farming,
plowing, and grazing. No further investigation was recommended due to poor site
integrity.
Site 41WM1025 is a historic artifact scatter located approximately 1.3 km north of the
Chandler Road APE. The site was recorded by PBS&J in October 2001 during a cultural
resource survey of the proposed State Highway 130 Construction Project. The site
consists of a scatter of early to mid-twentieth century domestic artifacts. The artifact
scatter measures approximately 80 m (north-south) x 75 m (east-west) and is surficial.
Artifacts include Albany and Bristol Slip stoneware, whiteware sherds, amethyst bottle
glass, cobalt blue bottle glass, amber bottle glass, aquamarine bottle glass, embossed
bottle glass, a serving spoon, a hook, and windowpane sherds. No features were
observed. The site has been disturbed by plowing and erosion. No further investigation
was recommended.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY PROFILE
Prior to the archaeological survey, ACSG conducted an archaeological sensitivity profile
of the project area to determine areas of high and low probability for intact archaeological
sites. The sensitivity profile is based on data collected from:
(1) a records search at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded sites and
completed surveys,
(2) a study of the soils and land forms to delimit areas with the potential for buried sites,
(3) a study of aerial photographs, old county highway maps, and early GLO plat maps to
look for historic properties and historically important property owners, and
(4) a reconnaissance of the ROW to look for obvious disturbances within the project area.
The prospect of finding intact archaeological sites varies with the physiographic settings
within the APE. Two distinct physiographic settings were identified: (1) uplands, and (2)
small creeks and intermittent drainages.
Uplands
The age of the geologic formations within the APE is Upper Cretaceous and predates
known human occupation of the region. Routine contour plowing has directly or
indirectly impacted all areas within the APE (see Figure 2). All upland settings within
the APE have been directly impacted. Upland soils are formed in situ and because of the
low relief and stable clay soils surfaces are generally stable.
12

In the Central Texas Archaeological region, sites in upland areas are likely to be surficial
with all components compressed within a few centimeters of the surface or mixed and
resting on the surface (Black 1989). Any sites of this nature would have been heavily
disturbed by contour plowing and have minimal research value. Previously recorded
sites in the area fit this pattern. Upland areas have a low probability for containing intact
archaeological sites.
Small Creeks and Intermittent Drainages
Soils and sediments in the lowlands of the intermittent drainages and small creeks in the
APE typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition and do not present a favorable
depositional environment for the preservation of archaeological sites (USDA, SCS 1983).
However, individual locations may have atypical physiographic features (e.g. paleo­
channels) and alluvial deposits could accumulate. Small Creeks and Intermittent
Drainages, specifically Mustang Creek, have a higher potential for containing intact,
buried archaeological sites than the upland areas. If shovel testing indicated significant
alluvial deposits, then Backhoe trenching would be implemented at Mustang Creek or the
intermittent drainages to test for deeply buried cultural deposits.

INTENSIVE SURVEY
Methods
A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted to “identify obvious or well known properties”
and “areas where certain kinds of properties are likely to occur” [36 CFR § 64] (Derry et.
al. 1985, King et. al. 1977). These include both historic and prehistoric-aged properties.
A thorough records search was completed in order to determine: (1) if there were any
recorded sites within the project area; and (2) the nature of the recorded sites in the
general area. Based on this data, a strategy for an intensive archaeological survey of the
project area was devised. The survey strategy included a 100% pedestrian survey and
sub-surface testing. Separate methodologies of sub-surface testing were employed for
areas with a high probability of buried sites and areas with a low probability.
Sites as defined by Hester et al. (1997:42) are “any discrete, bounded location where
humans lived, worked, or carried out a task—and where evidence of their behavior can be
recovered by the archaeologist.” For practical purposes, any area where three or more
artifacts were found within a 10-m diameter was recorded. Isolated artifacts would be
plotted on a USGS 7.5’ topographic map.
Pedestrian Survey
The revised minimum survey standards, as implemented by the THC, for project areas of
200 acres or less require a transect interval no greater than 30 m. Ten-meter transects
were walked across the entire APE. Smaller transects would be employed in areas that
evidenced historic or prehistoric sites. Due to numerous recently plowed fields, the
overall ground visibility was excellent and allowed for a confident appraisal of the APE.
Areas of better visibility within the poor visibility areas received additional attention. If
an artifact were found, the surrounding area would be cleared and carefully searched.
13

Notes were taken describing conditions, environmental factors, and any other factors
affecting the survey. Photographs were taken of environmental settings, cultural artifacts,
and features encountered during the survey. All naturally exposed profiles were
examined.
The soils within the APE are generally stable to erosional and are not conducive to
preserving archaeological sites. Prehistoric sites within the upland areas are likely to be
surficial, and components would be compressed within a few centimeters of the surface
or mixed and resting on the surface. Only structured sites, like burned rock middens, or
surficial lithic scatters would likely be encountered in these settings. If surficial sites
were encountered, a random sample of artifacts would be field-identified to quantify the
density of the scatter and the types of artifacts present. No artifacts were collected during
any part of the survey.
If any previously recorded sites were located within the Chandler Road APE, they would
be revisited and reassessed for potential significance. Newly discovered sites were
investigated and recorded at TARL. If the surface visibility at the sites is less than 30
percent, then a minimum of six shovel tests were executed to delimit site boundaries.
Based on the results of the shovel tests and surface inspection, the newly recorded sites
were evaluated for potential significance.
Sub-surface Examination
Shovel Testing
The minimum survey standards for Texas, as implemented by the THC, require 16 shovel
tests per mile in a linear project, unless the geomorphology or terrain conditions
demonstrate that this number is unnecessary. Based on the background research and an
environmental assessment, a scope of work was formulated to account for the presence of
highly disturbed agricultural areas.
Fewer shovels tests than the number required by the minimum survey standards (i.e., 16
per mile, per 100-ft. width of new ROW) were anticipated in the project area. The
subsequent pedestrian survey results confirmed that the majority of the project area is
located in an upland setting with heavily plowed surfaces. With this in mind, shovel tests
were conducted at the Principal Investigator’s discretion.
Shovel tests were placed in areas where the soils and sediments appeared to be relatively
intact. In order to confirm the absence of buried, intact archaeological sites, some shovel
tests were placed in areas that contained thin soils or were disturbed by cultivation or
other agricultural activities. Areas where soil profiles were naturally exposed through
erosion were also examined. Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to
the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible. Positive shovel tests were dug in levels no
thicker than approximately 20 cm. Negative shovel tests containing sterile, homogenous
clay were dug in levels corresponding to the natural stratigraphic boundaries. Excavated
sediments were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth unless high clay or water
content required that the material be troweled through or sorted by hand. Shovel test
locations were mapped by global positioning systems (GPS). Notes were taken
describing the zone, depth, soils, stratigraphy, and any artifacts found. If a site were
14

located during the pedestrian survey, additional sub-surface testing would be conducted
to evaluate the depth and nature of cultural deposits. The minimum survey standards for
Texas require at least 6 shovel tests to define site boundaries, unless the site has more
than 30 percent surface visibility.
The uplands of the APE are low probability areas. Upland soils are formed in situ and
because of the low relief and stable clay soils surfaces are generally stable. Sites formed
in upland settings on stable clay surfaces are likely surficial or mixed and compressed
within the top few centimeters. These surficial sites will most likely be sparse lithic
scatters, burned rock features, or historic sites.
Due to contour plowing of the project area, all upland surface sites within the project area
are thoroughly disturbed. Upland areas were ground-truth tested with at least one shovel
test. If ground truth testing showed a favorable depositional environment for buried sites,
additional shovel tests would be performed.
In high probability areas, where alluvium or colluvium could accumulate, buried sites are
far more likely. For this reason, shovel testing was concentrated in these areas.
However, streams within the project area typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition
and do not develop significant alluvium deposits or terraces. If initial shovel tests
showed a poor depositional environment, fewer shovel tests than required under the
minimum standards would be performed.
Overall, the soils within the project area are clay soils that were formed during the
Pleistocene or earlier and predate known human occupation of the region. These soils are
stable to erosional and have a low probability of containing buried cultural deposits.
Backhoe Testing
Testing of areas that may contain deeply buried sites is required by the THC minimum
Standards. Proposed locations of bridges or any other constructions that may impact
alluvium deeper than 1 m would be tested with a minimum of one backhoe trench. The
backhoe trenches would be approximately 4 m to 8 m long, 2 m wide and would be dug
to the water table, bedrock, or the reach of the backhoe. Profiles would be examined,
described, and photographed. Representative profiles would also be drawn and/or
photographed.

RESULTS
Pedestrian Survey
For the pedestrian survey and subsequent shovel testing, the project area was divided into
four sections based on the locations of existing roads crossing the APE and geographic
characteristics.

15

Section 1
This portion of the APE begins at CR 110 and terminates at CR 118. The environment in
this section is characterized by livestock pastures and recently plowed fields (Figure 3).
Near the western terminus of the APE at CR 110, the ROW crosses an unnamed tributary
of McNutt Creek (Figure 3). The Creek, which was not flowing during the survey,
contains insignificant alluvial deposits. Approximately 1.17 km east of CR 110, a small
stock tank is located within the ROW (Figure 4). The tank has been partially filled with
refuse, including modern household garbage, brush, fence posts, and a variety of
construction materials. Several mature hackberry trees are rooted in the tank’s banks,
indicating that the tank is not a recent construction. A small scatter of bricks is located
2–3 m east of the dam’s eastern bank. The bricks are marked “Mexia” and may have
originated from a cistern or well in the area.
Approximately 1.26 km east of CR 110 (~90 m east of the stock tank), the ROW crosses
site 41WM1097, an early to mid-twentieth century house site. The site is located at the
crest of a ridge in a large cow pasture. At 850 ft. AMSL, the site is located at the highest
elevation within the project area. The site appears to be confined to a low rise on the
ridge top and is bound to the east by a row of hackberry trees that mark an old fence row.
A single hackberry tree that is located at the southern boundary of the ROW, southwest
of the fence row, may mark the approximate location of a house. The bulk of the
surficial artifacts are concentrated around this single hackberry.
A modern house site is located roughly 144 m south of the APE and site 41WM1097.
The site is comprised of an extant metal outbuilding/garage and the visible footprint of a
house. The footprint contains exposed plumbing, a cistern or septic tank, and a surficial
scatter of modern household artifacts. The house and outbuilding are not present on a
1985 USGS topographic map of the area, but are present on a 2000 aerial photograph.
The house may have burned or been razed sometime between 1985 and 2000. Because
the site is located outside the ROW, further investigation is prohibited. It is unclear
whether site 41WM1097 and the modern house site are associated.
The portion of the APE between site 41WM1097 and CR 118 crosses recently plowed
fields (Figure 4). Surface visibility in the plowed field is excellent due to the lack of
ground cover. No cultural materials were observed in this portion of Section 1.
No cultural materials were collected in Section 1.
Section 2
This portion of the APE begins at CR 118 and terminates at CR 100. The easternmost
portion of this section crosses a large cow pasture that appears to have been regularly
plowed in the past. An unnamed tributary of Cottonwood Creek crosses the ROW
approximately 250 m east of CR 118. The tributary, which was not flowing during the
survey, contains insignificant alluvial deposits. A small shotgun-style house is located
approximately 150 m north of the ROW (Figure 5). The building appears to be an early
twentieth century tenant farmer’s residence. Approximately 180 m north of the ROW
and directly east of the shotgun house, a cluster of outbuildings mark the nucleus of a

historic farmstead site. There may have been an older home near the outbuildings (a twohole privy was observed near the outbuildings when accessing the ROW), but the site is
now occupied by a modern, pre-manufactured home.
The ROW ascends a ridge slope east of the Cottonwood Creek tributary. The area is
comprised of horse and cow pastures, but has been routinely plowed in the past (e.g.,
artificial terracing is evident along the contours of the ridge slope and shallow soils near
the ridge summit have been disturbed to bedrock) (Figure 5).
As the ROW descends the eastern ridge slope, artificial terracing is evident and bedrock
fragments are ubiquitous on the surface. Approximately 1.2 km west of CR 118, an
intermittent drainage crosses the ROW. Bedrock is exposed in the bed of channel. The
drainage, which originates at a vacant farm complex located roughly 250 m north of the
ROW, appears to be man-made or intentionally modified (Figure 6).
The topography levels out roughly 125 m east of the drainage. This portion of the APE is
located in a large, recently plowed field that was being cultivated during the survey
(Figure 7). At the southern boundary of the plowed field, an east-west oriented, manmade canal crosses the ROW. South of the canal, the ROW crosses another recently
plowed field (Figure 7).
At the eastern terminus of Section 2, adjacent to CR 100, the ROW crosses site
41WM1098. The site is an early twentieth century farm complex that is comprised of a
house, barn, several outbuildings, a windmill, a well, and two tenant houses. The ROW
cuts through the center of the site. The main house and five outbuildings are located
north of the ROW, and the two tenant houses are located south of the ROW. The barn,
windmill, well, and six outbuildings are located within the ROW. No cultural materials
were collected in Section 2.
Section 3
This portion of the APE begins at CR 100 and terminates at FM 130. The section crosses
routinely plowed fields, which were being cultivated during the survey (Figure 8).
Approximately 540 m east of CR 100, the ROW crosses an intermittent drainage. The
drainage, which was not flowing during the survey, contains insignificant alluvial
deposits. East of the drainage, the ROW ascends a ridge between the Cottonwood Creek
valley and the Mustang Creek valley. Near the crest of the ridge, a corral, livestock tank,
and ruinous shed are located within the ROW (Figure 8). These features are modern
constructions. No other features or artifacts were observed within the APE. East of the
corral, the ROW crosses a recently plowed field bordered by a mobile home park to the
south. The mobile home park extends for approximately 530 m along the southern edge
of the ROW and terminates at CR 130. No cultural materials were collected in Section 3.
Section 4
Section 4 begins at CR 130 and terminates at FM 1660. The majority of Section 4 is
comprised of recently plowed fields and cow pastures (Figure 9).

Midway between CR 130 and FM 1660, the ROW crosses Mustang Creek, which was
flowing during the survey (Figure 9). The creek channel meanders through a narrow
pasture that is bound to the east and west by recently plowed fields. The active creek
channel is deeply entrenched, and a relic channel is located roughly 10 m east of the
active channel. The cut banks of the active channel and shovel tests indicate that
sediment deposition is balanced by erosion and that there are no significant alluvial
deposits along the creek.
East of Mustang creek, the ROW crosses a recently plowed field before terminating at
FM 1660, roughly 1 km northeast of Mustang Creek. No cultural materials were
observed or collected in Section 4.
Newly Recorded Sites
41WM1097
Description:
Site 41WM1097 is located on a ridge top in Section 1, midway between CR 110 and CR
118. The site is comprised of a sparse artifact scatter that extends the full width (i.e., 200
ft.) of the ROW (the scatter may extend beyond the northern and southern ROW
boundaries) and approximately 187 ft. along the length of the ROW (northeast­
southwest) (Figure 10). A dilapidated fence row marks the eastern boundary of the site
(Figure 11). The western boundary of the site appears to correspond to a change in
surface topography. The site is located on a low rise at the crest of the ridge. The rise
may be the byproduct of years of plowing, which has contributed to the degradation of
the surrounding surfaces, or a natural feature attributed to underlying bedrock shelves
that stair-step down the ridge slope. Surface visibility at the site averages 45 percent.
The bulk of the artifacts are located at the base of a lone hackberry tree at the southern
edge of the ROW (Figure 11). The vegetation in this area is sparse, suggesting that this
may be the footprint of a building (Figure 12). The fence row at the eastern boundary of
the site is marked by a row of hackberry trees that is oriented roughly north-south. A
cedar fence post leans against the trunk of each tree (Figure 12). Some of these fence
posts have embedded machine-cut square nails. A second fence row is located
approximately 100 ft. northwest of first fence row. Three of the trees in this fence row
have been blown down. No additional features were observed at the site.
Aerial photographs, USGS topographic maps, and site survey sketch maps suggest that
the site is approximately 1.25 acres (roughly the area of the low rise).
Cultural Materials Collected/Observed:
Artifacts include glass container fragments, window pane sherds, unidentified metal
fragments, rubber shoe soles, a dry cell battery core, crushed enameled pots, wire nails,
wood screws, wire fragments, whiteware sherds, and one machine-cut square nail
fragment. The bulk of the artifacts suggest an early to mid-twentieth century occupation.
The machine-cut square nail is the only artifact that can be dated to the nineteenth

century. It is possible that the nail or a board with the embedded nail was recycled from
another site.
Assessment:
The site appears to be an early to mid-twentieth century house site, probably a tenant
farmer’s residence. The small building footprint (i.e., the area of the artifact scatter near
the lone hackberry) suggests a shotgun-style house, probably one very similar to extant
tenant buildings in the project area. It is very likely that the site is associated with early
twentieth century cotton farming and is probably representative of many of the early
twentieth century farming sites surrounding the project area.
A main farm house was likely located where a grove of hackberries now stands south of
the ROW, approximately 275 m southwest of site 41WM1097. A surface inspection near
the grove revealed amethyst (manganese-tinted) glass fragments, which suggest a late
nineteenth to early twentieth century occupation. A 1985 USGS topographic map does
not show any buildings at that location, but a 2000 aerial photograph shows what appears
to be a house and an outbuilding ~90 m and ~50 m, respectively, north of the grove. The
outbuilding is still present. The house is not. According to the USGS topographic map
and the aerial photograph, the house and outbuilding were constructed sometime after
1985, and the house was razed or burned sometime between 1985 and the present. A
surface inspection of the house site revealed a scatter of modern domestic artifacts,
exposed plumbing on the surface, and partially exposed cistern or septic tank. Since the
house site and outbuilding are located outside the ROW, further investigation is
prohibited.
Site 41WM1097 appears to have been significantly disturbed by land clearing and routine
plowing. The surface of the site appears to have been scraped, perhaps when the building
was razed. A large push pile located approximately 68 m northeast of the lone hackberry
may be the surface layer that was removed from the site. Investigation of the push pile
for artifacts was unsuccessful due to a large prickly pear cactus growing on the pile. In
addition to the land clearing, the area appears to have been regularly plowed.
No clear pattern of artifact distribution or cultural stratification is apparent. The cultural
deposits are very shallow and mixed or mixed and resting on the surface. The diagnostic
artifacts can be dated to the early and mid-twentieth century. Only one artifact, a
machine-cut square nail fragment, can be dated to the late nineteenth century. The square
nail however is not a clear diagnostic because it may be a recycled item.
Due to poor site integrity and lack of significant data, site 41WM1097 is not eligible for
nomination to the NHRP or as a SAL and does not warrant further investigation.
41WM1098
Description:
Site 41WM1098 is located in Section 2, adjacent to CR 100. The site is an early
twentieth century farm complex comprised of farm outbuildings and farm-related
structures, a house, and two tenant houses. The house and five of the outbuildings are
29

located north of the proposed ROW. The two tenant houses are located south of the
proposed ROW. The ROW cuts through the western and central portion of the site
(Figures 13 and 14). An early twentieth century barn, a well, a windmill, and six
outbuildings are located within the ROW.
The site is L-shaped with one arm extending southwestward from CR 100 and
terminating at an unnamed tributary of Cottonwood Creek. The other arm extends
southeastward, paralleling the unnamed tributary and terminating at Cottonwood Creek.
The main portion of the site is located in the northern arm that extends from CR 100.
The southern arm is a narrow pasture connecting the main portion of the site with the two
tenant houses along Cottonwood Creek. The total area of the site, including both arms, is
approximately 4.5 acres.
There are 22 features at site 41WM1098. Thirteen of these features are located within the
Chandler Road ROW (Figures 13).
Features within the ROW
Feature 2
Feature 2 is a small, dilapidated pole shed located adjacent to a fence row at the northern
boundary of the site (Feature 15). The shed measures roughly 6 ft. (north-south) x 10 ft.
(east-west) x 5 ft. tall and is constructed of small-diameter cedar logs that support a roof
framed with 2 x 4 dimensional boards and covered with corrugated sheet metal. The shed
has no walls and apparently functions as a cover for two livestock watering troughs (i.e.,
a cast iron bathtub and a large-diameter metal pipe with poured concrete floor).
Feature 3
Feature 3 is a small outbuilding located approximately 43 ft. southeast of Feature 2
(Figure 15). The shed measures approximately 8 ft. (northeast-southwest) x 9 ft.
(northwest-southeast) and is approximately 8 ft. tall. The shed has board-and-batten
siding and corrugated sheet metal roofing. Corrugated sheet metal also covers the eastern
and the northern walls of the building. The building is framed with 2 x 4 dimensional
boards and has wire nails throughout. A door is located in the southern wall. The door is
attached to the building with cast iron strap hinges and is latched with a horseshoe placed
through a hasp. The building may have functioned as a storage shed for livestock feed or
supplies. It does not appear to be currently used.

Feature 4
Feature 4 consists of a windmill (4a) and well (4b) located approximately 56 ft. 6 in.
northeast of Feature 3 (Figure 16). The windmill straddles a brick-lined well and a fence
row located adjacent to the well. The fence row marks the approximate northern
boundary of the site. The windmill is an all metal construction and has a fully encased
gear box. The windmill vane is marked “The Wonder Model B” and “Made at Elgin Ill.”
The base of the windmill stand measures approximately 6 ft. x 6 ft., and the windmill is
approximately 30 ft. tall and has ~6 ft. diameter blades. The windmill pumps water from
the well for livestock. A subsurface pipe leads from the windmill to what may be a water
tank tower near the main barn. Sections of the pipe are exposed on the surface and have
rusted through.
Feature 5
Feature 5 is small outbuilding at the southern edge of the site, immediately south of the
main barn. The shed is constructed of cedar log and hand-hewn timber uprights and 2 x 4
cross members and rafters. The roofing and siding are corrugated sheet metal. The
southern wall of the shed is open. The building measures approximately 16 ft. 6 in. x 14
ft. x 6 ft. 6 in. tall. The building may have been a shelter for livestock. At least one of
the upright timbers appears to have been recycled from another building or structure. It is
a hand-hewn timber with embedded machine-cut square nails and hand-cut mortises
(Figure 17). The other uprights are unhewn cedar logs.
Feature 6
Feature 6 is a wooden platform on four splayed wooden legs (Figure 17). It is located
approximately 6 ft. southwest of the barn. The platform legs are unhewn logs that have
been reinforced by 2 x 6 diagonal cross members. The platform is constructed of 4 x 6
boards laid side-by-side. A subsurface pipe originating at the well and windmill appears
to terminate near the platform. The associated pipe suggests that the platform may have
supported a water tank. No water tank or evidence of a water tank was found.
Feature 7
Feature 7 is a fenced enclosure or corral that measures approximately 72 ft. 6 in.
(southeast-northwest) x 322 ft. 6 in. (northeast-southwest). Feature 7 encompasses
Features 1–6.
Feature 8
Feature 8 is small fenced enclosure or corral that measures approximately 37 ft. 6 in.
(southeast-northwest) x 45 ft. (northeast-southwest). This enclosure is located adjacent to
the main barn, on the southwestern side of the barn.

33

Feature 9
Feature 9 is a small fenced enclosure or corral that measures approximately 30 ft.
(southeast-northwest) x 50 ft. (northeast-southwest). This enclosure is located adjacent to
the main barn, on the southeastern side of the barn.
Feature 10
Feature 10 is a large, front-gable barn located at the center of the site. The barn, which
measures approximately 41 ft. 9 in. (southeast-northwest) x 97 ft. (northeast-southwest),
is completely clad in corrugated sheet metal (Figure 18). Close inspection of the building
revealed the original board-and-batten siding preserved under the corrugated sheet metal
siding. A large section of the original siding is exposed on the southeastern side of the
barn under a later shed-roof addition (Figure 19). The siding retains much of the original
red barn paint. Many of the original architectural elements remain (e.g., intact trim,
doors, stalls, loft access doors, and loft ladders).
The interior of the barn is divided by a center passageway (Figure 19). Various storage
rooms are located north of the passageway. Animal stalls and feed troughs are located
south of the passageway. Some of the timber posts supporting the loft along the
passageway have embedded square nails and appear to be hand-hewn (Figure 20). A few
of the storage room doors also have embedded square nails. The majority of the building
however contains wire nails (e.g., the board-and-batten siding and many of the interior
framing elements are fastened by wire nails). It is likely that some of the older interior
elements have been recycled from another location(s).
The barn has at least three later additions. These include two, front-gable, pole-barn
additions on the southwestern side of the barn and a shed-roof addition on the
southeastern side of the barn. The two pole-barn additions may have been separate
outbuildings at one time that were subsequently connected to the barn by the addition of
common roof. The roofed space between the pole-shed additions and the main barn
functions as a garage for a small tractor. The original southwestern wall of the barn is
visible within this garage (Figure 20).
The shed-roof addition on the southeastern side of the barn extends into Feature 9, a
fenced enclosure on the southeastern side of the barn. The shed-roof addition may have
been added to garage farm machinery or shelter livestock.
Feature 11
Feature 11 is a small outbuilding located approximately 36 ft. 7 in. northeast of Feature 9
(the corral southeast of barn) (Figure 21). The building measures roughly 10 ft.
(northwest-southeast) x 11 ft. (southwest-northeast) and is approximately 7 ft. 6 in. tall.
It appears to be a chicken coop and incubator. The building has a shed roof and is clad
entirely with corrugated sheet metal. The building has two openings, one in the lower
left corner of southeastern wall and one in the lower right corner of northeastern wall.
Screens have been placed over these openings. A door is also located at the corner of the
southeastern wall. The building has been wired for electricity and contains an empty
34

light socket. A table is located under the light socket. A small enclosure fenced with
chicken wire is located south of the building. This enclosure appears to be a chicken run.
Feature 12
Feature 12 is similar to Feature 11 but has an end-gable roof, a large screened opening in
the southeastern wall, and a narrow door in the northeastern wall (Figure 21). The
building measures approximately 12 ft. (northwest-southeast) x 10 ft. (southwest­
northeast) and is roughly 11–12 ft. tall. The building is clad completely in corrugated
sheet metal and is connected to the fenced “chicken run.” Roosting perches are still in
place within the building.
Feature 13
Feature 13 is a small outbuilding located approximately 13 ft. northwest of the two
chicken coops (Features 11 and 12). The building measures 6 ft. (east-west) x 8 ft.
(north-south) and is approximately 4 ft. tall. It has a front-gable roof and corrugated
sheet metal roofing. The siding consists of vertical wood planks covered with remnants
of asphalt shingles. The building has been wired for electricity and has a single light
socket. The building also has a wooden floor. Due to the proximity of two chicken
coops and the presence of a light socket in the building, Feature 13 is most likely
associated with poultry and/or egg production.
Feature 22
Feature 22 is a concrete bridge or low water crossing that crosses the intermittent
drainage at the eastern edge of site 41WM1098. The bridge measures approximately 10
ft. wide (northeast-southwest) x 20 ft. (northwest-southeast). Erosion has undermined the
bridge causing it to sink considerably. A large eroded hole is located at southern edge of
bridge.
Features outside the ROW
Feature 1
Feature 1 is comprised of two ruinous livestock troughs (Feature 1a and Feature 1b)
(Figure 21). Each trough is constructed of large log piers set in in the ground. Plank
boards are fixed to the piers to form two rectangular boxes, each measuring
approximately 3 ft. 6 in. wide x 9 ft. 6 in.–10 ft. long x ~3 ft. tall. The two troughs are
oriented roughly northwest-southeast and are aligned end to end, 13 ft. apart.
Feature 14
Feature 14 is a pole shed located approximately 31 ft. 6 in. northeast of the main barn.
The building measures approximately 20 ft. x 20 ft. and is currently used to store farm
machinery. The end-gable building is clad entirely with corrugated sheet metal. The
southern side of the building is completely open. Feature 14 appears to a more recent
construction.
35

Feature 15
Feature 15 is an end-gable pole shed located approximately 6 ft. 5 in. northeast of Feature
14. The shed is similar to Feature 14 and appears to be a more recent construction. The
building measures roughly 16 ft. 8 in. (north-south) x 36 ft. 6 in. (east-west) and is
completely clad with corrugated sheet metal, except for the western wall, which has
white board-and-batten siding. The southern wall of the building is completely open.
Dimensional lumber and wire nails were used throughout, and some of the interior boards
appear to have been recycled (i.e., traces of white paint on interior boards). Feature 15 is
currently for farm machinery storage.
Feature 16
Feature 16 is the main house (Figure 22). It is a ca. 1910 cottage with hipped roof, white
ship-lap siding, and asphalt shingles. Five columns at the front entrance rest on a low
wall that encloses an inset porch and is an extension of a battered skirt that extends
around the base of the building. According to the current tenant, Tim Krueger, the
building had a rear porch, but it was closed in some years ago. The building also had two
interior chimneys, but they were removed during past renovations (personal
communication 2004).
The house, which appears to rest on a pier and beam foundation, has severe settling
problems. The northeastern corner of the building has settled significantly lower than the
rest of the building. The clapboard skirting around the foundation has buckled, and the
southern wall and roof line has shifted considerably. The windows in the southern wall
are no longer aligned.
Feature 17
Feature 17 is a large outbuilding associated with the house (Figure 23). The building has
front gables, corrugated sheet metal roofing, white board-and-batten siding, and exposed
rafter ends. A door and single window are located in the northern (front) wall. The
building appears to be contemporaneous with the house and may be a workshop or
garage.
Feature 18
Feature 18 is a small, front-gable outbuilding located behind the main house (Figure 23).
The building has board-and-batten siding and asphalt shingles and has been painted white
to match the house. A door is located in the eastern wall. A shed addition is located on
the southern side of the building. The addition has two windows in the southern wall and
a narrow door in the eastern wall. This building may have been a privy that was later
converted to a storage shed.
Feature 19
Feature 19 is a small corrugated metal outbuilding with shed roof. The construction
appears to be very recent and may be a storage building or pump house for a well.

Feature 20
Feature 20 is small front-gable building located south of the ROW, near Cottonwood
Creek (Figure 24). The building appears to have board-and-batten siding and corrugated
sheet metal roofing. According to Tim Krueger (personal communication 2004), the
building was a “hand house” occupied by tenant farmers during cotton season. The
building is located at the edge of a plowed field and does not appear to be currently used.
Feature 21
Feature 21 is another tenant house located south of the ROW, near Cottonwood Creek
(Figure 24). The building has a hipped roof and appears to be an L-shaped plan. It
appears to have board-and-batten siding and corrugated sheet metal roofing. The
building is located in a plowed field and does not appear to be currently used.
Cultural Materials Collected/Observed:
Cultural materials that were observed at the site include wire nails, barbed wire fencing,
an amethyst glass container finish fragment, a 1933 license plate, and various twentieth
century farm machinery and farm-related equipment. Shovel tests conducted at the site
uncovered wire nails and fragments of tie wire.
The majority of the artifacts at site 41WM1098 are twentieth century items. The only
artifact that could clearly be a nineteenth century item is the amethyst glass container
finish fragment (Figure 24). The fragment comes from a blown-in-mold bottle with a
tooled finish. The amethyst color is produced by the solarization of manganese in the
glass. Manganese was added to glass as a bleaching agent between ca.1885 and 1917.
Assessment:
The site is an early twentieth century farm complex that appears to be associated with
cotton production. According to Tim Krueger, who is the current tenant (personal
communication 2004), the main house was constructed in ca. 1910 by a bachelor farmer,
and the two houses south of the site were occupied by farm hands during cotton season.
Krueger states that the main barn is for the most part intact, except for the corrugated
siding and roofing, which replaced the original wood shingles. The interior of the barn
has not been modified. The stalls, troughs, and storage rooms are all original. The house
has been slightly modified. The rear porch has been closed in, a bathroom was added,
and two interior chimneys were removed. The remainder of the house appears to be
original (see Addendum for detailed site history).
Shovel tests results indicate sparse cultural deposits within the ROW. Artifacts are more
likely to be found in the vicinity of the house, outside the ROW.
Site 41WM1098 is representative of early twentieth century agriculture, specifically
cotton farming, prior to mechanization in south-central Williamson County. For this
reason, the site is potentially eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion A. The
site is also potentially eligible under Criteria C and D. The site displays a high degree of
integrity and significant characteristics of a class of architecture (e.g., early twentieth

century farm design), and the site may contain significant data relating to cotton farming
practices and farm landscape design in the early twentieth century. With an extant house,
outbuildings, tenant houses, and farm-related structures, the site provides an opportunity
to study past farming techniques, such as using seasonal help and draft animals, and
patterns in farm complex design and agricultural implementation on the eve of fully
mechanized farming.
Shovel Test Results
A total of 38 shovel tests were executed within the Chandler Road ROW. Of the 38
shovel tests, 7 were executed at site 41WM1097 and 6 were executed at site 41WM1098.
Section 1
Shovel Tests 15–25 and 32–38 were executed in Section 1.
Shovel Test 15 was executed at the edge of a large pasture. The shovel test profile
contains dark gray clay at 0–23 cmbs, underlain by dark gray clay with light gray mottles
to a depth of 57 cmbs. The upper 23 cmbs appears to be a plow zone. The shovel test
was sterile.
Shovel Tests 16–25 were executed at site 41WM1097, a historic homestead site. Shovel
Test 16 was executed near the center of the ROW, between two dilapidated fence rows.
It contains dark brown silty clay loam and many angular limestone fragments. Degrading
bedrock was exposed at 10 cmbs. One wire nail was uncovered at 0–10 cmbs. No other
artifacts were observed or collected.
Shovel Test 17 was executed near a dilapidated fence row, at the eastern site boundary.
The shovel test contains light grayish brown silty clay loam to a depth of 20 cmbs. This
level appears to be a plow zone. One wire fragment, 1 clear glass fragment, 1 amber
glass fragment, and 4 unidentified, corroded metal flakes were found at 0–20 cmbs. At
20–40 cmbs, the shovel test contains degrading bedrock and mottled white, yellow, and
light brown chalky clay. No artifacts were observed in Level 2.
Shovel Test 18 was executed at the southern boundary of the ROW, approximately 5 m
south of a lone hackberry tree that marks a surficial artifact scatter. The shovel test was
executed at the edge of a shallow depression that appeared to be cultural feature.
Numerous window pane sherds and bottle glass fragments were observed on the surface
near the depression. The soil profile in ST 18 contains dark brown silty clay loam with
common limestone fragments at 0–12 cmbs. Three clear glass fragments, 1 unidentified,
corroded metal flake, 1 wire nail, and 1 small coal fragment were found at 0–12 cmbs.
At 12 cmbs, degrading, fractured bedrock was exposed. The shallow depression appears
to be a natural formation, the byproduct of a fractured substrate.
One machine-cut square nail fragment was found on the surface at the edge of the shovel
test. The nail fragment may indicate a late nineteenth or early twentieth century
occupation or that some of the building materials were recycled from an older site.
Nearby fence posts also have embedded machine-cut square nails. No other square nails
were found at the site.

Shovel Test 19 (Figure 26) was executed west of the lone hackberry, near the center line
of the ROW. The shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay loam with many
subangular to angular limestone fragments. Degrading bedrock was exposed at 10 cmbs.
Artifacts observed in ST 19 include 1 wire finishing nail, 1 bolt with nut, 2 wood screws
(1 slotted, 1 Philips head), 1 tie wire fragment, 1 amber glass fragment, 1 clear glass
fragment, 1 unidentified, corroded metal fragment, and 1 aluminum, angled plate
fragment. The aluminum fragment suggests a post-World War II occupation.
Shovel Test 20 (Figure 26) was executed near the northern fence row, at the northern
ROW boundary. At 0–15 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay loam
and common, angular to subangular, limestone pebbles. Artifacts include 1 unidentified
metal plate, 2 small-diameter, metal pipe fragments, 7 tie wire fragments, 1 barbed wire
barb (flat-type), 1 fencing staple, 1 clear glass fragment, and 5 wire nails. At 15–27
cmbs, the shovel test contains many degrading bedrock fragments. Degrading bedrock
was exposed at 27 cmbs. One tie wire fragment was found in Level 2.
Shovel Test 21 was executed near the center line of the ROW, at the eastern edge of the
site. The shovel test contains grayish brown clay loam at 0–12 cmbs. This appears to be
a plow zone. At 12–22 cmbs, the shovel test contains degrading, chalky bedrock with
pockets of grayish brown clay loam. No artifacts were observed in ST 21.
Shovel Test 22 was executed near the center line of the ROW, at the western edge of the
site. The shovel test contains grayish brown clay loam with many degrading bedrock
fragments. Bedrock was exposed at 18 cmbs. No artifacts were observed.
Shovel Test 23 (Figure 27) was executed immediately east of a stock tank, east of site
41WM1097. At 0–30 cmbs, the shovel test contains grayish brown clay loam that
becomes more clayey with depth. This level appears to be a plow zone. At 30–39 cmbs,
the shovel test contains grayish brown and light brown mottled clay loam. The matrix is
very compacted at 39 cmbs. No artifacts were observed in ST 23.
Shovel Tests 24, 25, and 32–34 were executed in a large pasture east of the stock tank.
Shovel Test 24 contains dark grayish brown clay loam and many limestone flecks and
small angular limestone pebbles at 0–22 cmbs. This level appears to be a plow zone. At
22–30 cmbs, bedrock was exposed. No artifacts were observed in ST 24. Shovel Test 25
(Figure 27) contains light gray silty clay and many limestone flecks and chalky
inclusions. The high limestone content appears to be the result of plowing. Plowing has
disturbed the underlying bedrock, bringing many bedrock fragments to the surface and
mixing fragments in the surface layer. At 15–20 cmbs, soft chalky bedrock was exposed.
No cultural materials were observed in ST 25.
Shovel Tests 32–34 were executed in a large pasture east of site 41WM1097. Shovel
Test 32 contains dark gray clay and many limestone flecks at 0–15 cmbs. This level
appears to be a plow zone. At 15–40 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark gray clay that
becomes slightly browner with depth. There are fewer flecks than Level 1, and the
matrix is more compacted. Shovel Test 33 contains dark gray clay and many degrading

limestone fragments and flecks. Degrading bedrock was exposed at 16 cmbs. Shovel
Test 34 contains dark gray clay at 0–20 cmbs. At 20–40 cmbs, the matrix contains light
gray mottles that increase in number with depth. No cultural materials were observed in
ST’s 32–34.
Shovel Tests 35–38 were executed along an intermittent drainage and in agricultural field
at the western terminus of the APE. Shovel Test 35 was conducted approximately 20 m
east of CR 110 and 60 m north of the intermittent drainage. The shovel test contains dark
gray, sticky clay to 56 cmbs. Limestone flecks were observed at 0–30 cmbs. Shovel Test
36 (Figure 28) was executed on the left bank of the intermittent drainage, approximately
8 m south of the drainage channel. The shovel test contains light grayish brown loamy
clay at 0–10 cmbs and dark gray clay at 10–50 cmbs. The dark gray clay contains
common limestone flecks and few buff mottles at 50 cmbs. No significant alluvial
deposits were found in ST 36. Shovel Tests 37 and 38 were conducted in a routinely
plowed field east of the drainage. Shovel Test 37 (Figure 28) was executed on a ridge
slope. It contains light gray silty clay with many limestone flecks and pebbles.
Degrading bedrock was exposed at 10 cmbs. Shovel Test 38 was executed on the ridge
top. It contains dark gray silty clay at 0–52 cmbs. The matrix is damp and sticky and
becomes lighter gray with depth. A few well rounded chert pebbles were observed at 50–
52 cmbs.
Section 2
Shovel Tests 3–12 and 26–31 were executed in Section 2.
Shovel Tests 3–5 were executed in a pasture on a ridge slope. Shovel Test 3 (Figure 29)
contains reddish brown silty clay loam and common degrading limestone fragments at 0–
20 cmbs. Chalky, degrading bedrock was exposed at 20–27 cmbs. No cultural materials
were observed in ST 3. Shovel Test 4 contains reddish brown silty clay loam at 0–22
cmbs and many degrading limestone fragments. Degrading bedrock was exposed at 22
cmbs. No cultural materials were observed in ST 4. ST 5 contains sticky and compacted
dark gray clay at 0–9 cmbs. This level appears to be a plow zone. At 9–52 cmbs, soil
profile contains dark gray clay and many limestone flecks. The limestone flecks are
concentrated primarily at 9–30 cmbs. The matrix is moist and sticky with darker gray
clay mottles and veins. Light gray mottles are present at the bottom of level.
Shovel Tests 6–8 were executed in a large pasture immediately east of CR 118. Shovel
Test 6 (Figure 29) contains dark gray clay at 0–25 cmbs. This level appears to be a plow
zone. At 25–38 cmbs, degrading bedrock was exposed. The bedrock is very soft with
pockets of dark gray clay mixed with degrading bedrock fragments. No cultural
materials were found in ST 6. Shovel Test 7 was executed near an unnamed tributary of
Cottonwood Creek. The shovel test contains dark gray clay with some light gray mottles
at 0–55 cmbs. The matrix grades to a lighter gray color with depth. No cultural materials
or significant alluvium was found in ST 7. Shovel Test 8 contains dark grayish brown
clay at 0–16 cmbs with many angular limestone pebbles. At 16–20 cmbs, degrading
limestone bedrock was exposed.
Shovel Tests 9–11 were executed in an agricultural field on a ridge slope. Evidence of
routine contour plowing (e.g., artificial terraces, plow furrows) was observed along ridge
53

slope. Shovel Test 9 (Figure 30) was executed near the crest of the ridge to confirm the
presence of thin, disturbed soils. The shovel test contains brown silty clay and many
limestone flecks and fragments at 0–16 cmbs. At 16–25 cmbs, soft, degraded limestone
bedrock was exposed. No cultural materials were observed in ST 9. Shovel Test 10 was
executed near an intermittent drainage that originates at a vacant farm complex north of
the ROW. At 0–25 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay with few
limestone fragments. Light gray mottles are present at 20–25 cmbs. This level appears
to be a plow zone. At 25–41 cmbs, the shovel test contains lighter gray clay. No cultural
materials were observed in ST 10. Shovel Test 11 was executed near the toe of the ridge
slope. At 0–35 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark gray clay that is very sticky and damp
with brown mottles. Degrading bedrock was exposed at 0–35 cmbs. The ground in the
area of ST 11 is saturated with water, and water pooled at the bottom of ST 11.
Shovel Test 12 (Figure 30) was executed along a man-made canal separating two recently
plowed and planted fields. The shovel test contains homogenous dark gray clay at 0–55
cmbs. No cultural materials were observed.
Shovel Tests 26–31 were executed at site 41WM1098, a historic farm complex located
adjacent of CR 100. Shovel Test 26 was executed within a fenced enclosure/corral
(Feature 7, see Site Description above) at the southwestern boundary of the ROW, near
an intermittent tributary of Cottonwood Creek. At 0–26 cmbs, the shovel test contains
dark brownish gray silty clay and very few subangular limestone pebbles. The matrix
grades to a darker gray clay with depth. At 26–42 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark
gray clay and many limestone flecks. The matrix grades to a lighter gray clay with depth.
No cultural materials were found in ST 26.
Shovel Test 27 was executed near a windmill and well at the northern boundary of the
fenced enclosure (Feature 7). At 0–50 cmbs, the shovel test contains homogenous dark
gray clay with many limestone flecks. One fragment of tie wire was found at 0–20 cmbs.
No other cultural materials were observed. Shovel Test 28 (Figure 31) was executed
along a fence at the southern boundary of the fenced enclosure (Feature 7). The shovel
test contains dark brownish gray clay and common limestone flecks at 0–22 cmbs. At
22–46 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark gray clay with light gray mottling and many
limestone flecks. The matrix becomes lighter gray with depth. No cultural materials
were observed in ST 28.
Shovel Test 29 (Figure 31) was executed at the eastern edge of Feature 7, adjacent to the
main barn (Feature 10) and a second fenced enclosure (Feature 8). The shovel test
contains dark brown, humic clay at 0–13 cmbs (manure level). At 13–40 cmbs, the
matrix is dark gray clay with many limestone flecks. The matrix grades to a lighter gray
color with depth. At 20–40 cmbs, 1 wire nail and 6 wire fragments were observed. The
artifact zone may have been the natural surface when the barn was constructed. The
overlying burden appears to be comprised of manure and livestock bedding that has
accumulated since the barn was constructed. At 40–51 cmbs, the shovel test contains
very compacted dark gray clay and common limestone flecks and degrading limestone
fragments. The matrix is this level is lighter in color than the previous level and
corresponds to the dark gray clay found in ST’s 27 and 28. No cultural materials were
found below 40 cmbs.

Shovel Test 30 was executed approximately 3 m east of a third fenced enclosure (Feature
9). The shovel contains dark gray clay at 0–28 cmbs. One wire nail fragment was found
at 0–20 cmbs. At 28–43 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay that
becomes more brown (slightly yellow/olive) with depth and many limestone flecks. No
cultural materials were observed below 20 cmbs.
Shovel Test 31 was executed east of Feature 13, at the northeastern boundary of the
ROW. The shovel test contains dark gray clay at 0–28 cmbs. One wire nail was found at
0–20 cmbs. At 28–50 cmbs, the shovel test contains many limestone flecks and common
degrading limestone fragments. The matrix becomes slightly browner with depth. No
cultural materials were observed below 20 cmbs.
Section 3
Shovel Tests 1 and 2 were executed in Section 3. Shovel Test 1 (Figure 32) was executed
near an intermittent drainage that bisects a large, recently plowed field. The shovel test
contains dark gray clay at 0–44 cmbs. The upper 15 cmbs appears to be a plow zone. At
44–58 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay with light gray mottles. No
cultural materials were observed in ST 1.
Shovel Test 2 (Figure 32) was executed in a corral that is located near the center of the
ROW. At 0–23 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark grayish brown clay. This level
appears to be a plow zone. At 23–46 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark gray clay with
few light gray mottles and subangular limestone pebbles. No cultural materials were
observed in ST 2.
Section 4
Shovel Test 13 and 14 were executed in Section 4. Shovel Test 13 (Figure 33) was
executed along a fence row that bisects the Chandler Road ROW. At 0–14 cmbs, the soil
profile contains dark grayish brown clay and common subrounded chert and limestone
pebbles. The matrix is very humic, with corn cob fragments and leaf litter comprising a
majority of the matrix. At 14–36 cmbs, the shovel test contains dark gray clay with
common chert and limestone pebbles. The matrix at this depth is very firm and sticky.
The soil profile at 36–54 cmbs contains many chert and limestone pebbles and small
cobbles. No cultural materials were found in ST 13.
Shovel Test 14 (Figure 33) was executed at Mustang Creek. It contains homogenous
dark gray clay at 0–62 cmbs. No cultural materials or significant alluvium was found in
ST 14.
Backhoe Trench Test Results
The pedestrian survey and shovel test results revealed poor depositional environments, in
which stream terrace development and the preservation of archaeological deposits were
impeded by erosion. No alluvial deposits deeper than 1 m were located within the flood
plain of Mustang Creek or the intermittent drainages. Therefore, backhoe trenching was
not performed during the archaeological survey.

CONCLUSIONS
Results of the archaeological survey show that the majority of the APE has been
thoroughly disturbed by routine contour plowing.
There are three previously recorded archaeological sites located 1–2 km from the
Chandler Road APE. The sites are early to mid-twentieth century house/dump sites. No
previously recorded archaeological sites are located within or adjacent to the ROW.
Two newly recorded sites, 41WM1097 and 41WM1098, were found to exist within the
Chandler Road ROW. Site 41WM1097 is comprised of an artifact scatter and dilapidated
fence row. The site appears to mark the location of an early to mid-twentieth century
house, probably similar to extant shotgun-style houses near the project area. The site
may have been the residence of a tenant family during the early part of the twentieth
century. Shovel test results indicate that cultural deposits are shallow (≤20 cmbs) to
surficial and appear to represent a single twentieth century component. The site has been
heavily disturbed by plowing and grazing and may have been mechanically scraped. Due
to poor site integrity and insignificant data, the site is not potentially eligible for
nomination as a SAL or to the NRHP. The site represents a negligible cultural resource
and does not warrant further investigation.
Site 41WM1098 is a historic farm complex located adjacent to CR 100. The site is
comprised of a ca. 1910 house, several outbuildings, a metal-clad barn, a windmill, a
well, and two tenant houses. The main house, 5 of the outbuildings, and 2 tenant houses
are located outside the ROW. The main barn, the windmill, the well, and 6 outbuildings
are located within the ROW. The barn is the central element within the ROW. The barn
retains its original board-and-batten siding and architectural details under a more recent
sheet metal exterior. Red barn paint is still evident on the original siding. Stalls and
troughs within the barn are intact and the doors and loft ladders are still in place. Except
for the more recent sheet metal exterior, the barn is remarkably intact.
Site 41WM1098 is representative of early twentieth century agriculture; specifically
cotton farming, in Central Texas. The site displays a high degree of integrity and
significant architectural characteristics to be potentially eligible for nomination to the
NHRP and as a SAL. The site may also contain significant data relating to cotton
farming practices and farm landscape design in the early twentieth century. With an
extant house, outbuildings, tenant houses, and farm-related structures, the site provides an
opportunity to study past farming techniques, such as using seasonal help and draft
animals, and patterns in farm complex design and agricultural implementation in the
early twentieth century.
The ROW was shovel tested for buried cultural deposits and the presence of alluvial
deposits. All shovel tests tested negative for prehistoric cultural materials and revealed
poor depositional environments, in which the preservation of archaeological deposits
were impeded by erosion and routine plowing. Due to routine plowing, the APE
possesses minimal potential for intact archaeological sites. Five shovel tests executed at
site 41WM1097 tested positive for historic artifacts, and four shovel tests executed at site
41WM1098 tested positive for historic artifacts. The artifacts, which include numerous
wire nails, are indicative of a twentieth century occupation.
62

Creeks and intermittent drainages within the APE are generally erosional or exhibit
erosion balanced by deposition. Typically, this type of depositional environment does
not result in significant alluvial deposition or terrace formation. Preservation of intact
archaeological sites in this depositional environment is unlikely (USDA, SCS 1983). The
creek and intermittent drainages within the APE was shovel tested for buried cultural
deposits and the presence of alluvial deposits. None were found. Due to the shallow
depth of alluvial deposits (<1 m), no backhoe trenches were excavated.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Due to severe disturbances and lack of significant data, site 41WM1097 does not warrant
further investigation and is not potentially eligible for nomination as a SAL or to the
NRHP.
Site 41WM1098 may be potentially eligible for nomination as a SAL or to the NRHP
under Criteria A, C, and D. Under Criterion A, the site is associated with cotton farming
in Central Texas on the eve of agricultural mechanization, an important period in Texas
history and in the evolution of agriculture. Under Criterion C, the site displays
characteristics of class of architecture, particularly in the form of an early twentieth
century rural residence, a remarkably preserved barn, several extant outbuildings, and
two tenant houses. The barn has architectural details that are now rare in the region.
Many of the barns of that period have been razed and replaced with modern buildings or
are heavily dilapidated. Under Criterion D, the site may contain significant data relating
to cotton farming practices prior to mechanization and patterns in early twentieth century
farm landscape design. The extant tenant houses, associated outbuildings and features,
and the main house provide a model for the study of similar sites.
Because of the site’s potential NRHP and SAL eligibility, aci recommends that the
ROW be shifted further north (approximately 950 ft.) to avoid the site and potential
problems posed by the site. As it stands, the current ROW cannot be shifted further south
or it will encroach on additional historic sites. If it is shifted north, the ROW will cross
plowed fields. An architectural historian was consulted to address the architectural
significance and history of the site and make further recommendations regarding the site
(see Addendum).
No further archaeological work is warranted for the remainder of Phase II of the Chandler
Road Extension Project. It is aci’s recommendation that all parts of the Chandler Road
APE be cleared for construction except site 41WM1098. If any cultural remains are
encountered during construction, all work should cease, and an aci professional
archaeologist should be called to assess the site. If the site is assessed to be significant,
further consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer should be pursued.

Historical Summary of Site 41WM1098
By Martha Doty Freeman

Site 41WM1098

Site History:
Site 41WM1098 is located on 120 acres in the George Keith Survey, a 1,280-acre
headright patented to Keith on September 25, 1852 (Deed Record 194:221–222).i
Following Keith’s death, his widow (Lavina), son (Oliver), and daughter (Susan) deeded
600 acres of the Keith headright to William and Lou E. Wiess, V. and Mary E. Wiess,
and O. M. and S. H. Kyle (Deed Record 37:144–145).
In 1875, when the 600 acres surrounding present-day 41WM1098 were conveyed
by the Keith heirs, both they and the Wiess family were residents of Jefferson County.
There is no indication that either family ever lived on the Williamson County headright,
and all subsequent transactions were made in Jefferson County. In 1890, however, as
population and agricultural production hit new highs in Williamson County, William
Wiess began to sell off tracts in the Keith Survey. On December 8, he sold 60 1/7 acres
in the northeast and central portions of the tract on which 41WM1098 is located to C. W.
(also appears as C. H.) Flynn for $1,563.00 (Deed Record 56:166–167). Two months
later he sold the 30 acres adjoining the Flynn tract to E. P. Kendall for $780.00 (Deed
Record 56:575–576). On November 16, 1891, he sold another 85 acres in the Keith
Survey west of the Flynn and Kendall tracts to Edward Rogan for $2,252.50 (Deed
Record 60:113–114).
In December 1892, E. P. and Sallie A. Kendall sold their 30 acres to C. W. Flynn
(Deed Record 63:53), who then owned 90 1/7 acres, or the eastern three-quarters of the
present-day 120-acre tract on the east line of the Keith Survey and adjoining present-day
County Road 100 (CR100). Flynn and his wife held the 90 1/7 acres until August 1,
1906, when they sold the property to A. P. Rydberg for $7,650.00 (Deed Record
119:436–437), a price that suggests the existence of improvements.ii Two years later,
Edward Rogan and his wife, Hannah, sold the 85 acres they had purchased in 1891 to J.
D. Tinning for $8,500.00 (Deed Record 131:493). On January 1, 1910, Tinning sold the
85 acres to A. P. Rydberg and C. H. Anderson (Deed Record 138:198), who immediately
partitioned the property. Rydberg, who owned the 90 1/7 acres adjoining present-day CR
74

100, received a 30.62-acre tract to the west, so that his farm then totaled 120 acres (Deed
Record 138:200). Anderson received the balance of 57.14 acres to the southwest of the
Rydberg tract (Deed Record 138:199).
Williamson County, like most of central and western Texas, suffered a
devastating drought in 1917–1918, and bales ginned in Williamson decreased by well
over 50% from 1916 yields (Belo & Company 1925:225; The Dallas Morning News,
August 25, 1918). Good rains in 1919–1920, however, brought record crops, and with
them a spurt of economic activity in real estate and construction.

The Rydbergs

purchased property in Georgetown in 1919 and sold their 120-acre farm late the same
year to Oskar Gren for $24,154.00 in cash and notes, a considerable sum for the time.
They then moved to Georgetown and lived in a house near Southwestern University.
Oskar Gren was unable to pay all the notes on the former Rydberg property, and
in January 1932, he had to re-convey the land to the Rydbergs (Deed Record 269:119–
120). A. P. Rydberg died in Georgetown on January 29, 1940, and left the 120-acre farm
on the Keith Survey, 38.77 acres in the Brown Survey near Hutto, his home on half a
block in Georgetown, and miscellaneous property (Probate File No. 3697). His widow,
Hanna, then moved to Austin where her son, Paul, her daughter-in-law, Bertha, and her
granddaughter, Joyce, lived. She died in Austin on June 24, 1954, and left the 120-acre
farm, a home in Hyde Park, and miscellaneous property to her son, Paul Rydbert (Deed
Record 401:65–73; The Williamson County Sun, July 1, 1954:3).

In 2004, the

Williamson County farm is owned by Paul and Hanna Rydberg’s daughter, Joyce Elaine
Rydbert Chaney.

Summary:
The property on which 41WM1098 is located may have been improved and
occupied as early as the 1890s, when it was owned by C. W. Flynn. Flynn held the
property until 1906, when he sold it to A. P. Rydberg, a farmer who was born in Sweden
on April 11, 1867. He immigrated to Texas in 1891 and settled in rural Williamson
County (Williamson County Sun, February 2, 1940:1), by that time a destination point for
Scandinavians who moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s, established farms, and
swelled the populations of Hutto and other Williamson County towns where they built
churches, businesses, and educational institutions.

According to a granddaughter

(Chaney 2004), Rydberg and his Swedish wife, Matilda, married in 1901. The couple
75

first lived on property west of and adjoining the current 120-acre tract, then moved to the
new property after purchasing a portion of it in 1906. According to a former tenant
(Schneider 2004), Rydberg and a neighbor named Johnson, who lived on the adjoining
farm to the north, built a barn (41WM1098, Feature 10) on the property sometime after
1906. An increase in valuation from $2,700 in 1907 to $4,050 in 1908–1909 also
suggests that Rydberg was working to improve his farm.
Rydberg worked as a carpenter, constructing houses in the Hutto area (Hanson
2004) while operating his farm. According to Schneider (2004), Rydberg or Oskar Gren,
who bought the property in 1919, tore down the old house in which the Rydbergs had
lived from 1906–1919 and built the house presently on the property. After 1932, the
property reverted to the Rydbergs, and it was occupied by tenants, one of whom made
substantial changes. Some time after 1960, Raymond Schneider built two tractor sheds,
and in the 1970s or 1980s, he made alterations to the barn built by Rydberg and Johnson.
The east end of the structure was on the verge of collapse, and so Schneider removed the
original steeply pitched metal roof, lowered it substantially, and clad the structure in
metal (Schneider 2004).

Recommendations:
The Antiquities Code of Texas (amended September 1, 1997) requires that, to be
eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, a structure or building must
have 1.) been “the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States
or the State of Texas,” 2.) been “significantly associated with the life of a famous
person,” 3.) been “significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important
principle or ideal,” 4.) represented “a distinctive architectural type and [have] value as an
example of a period, style, or construction technique,” or 5.) been “important as part of
the heritage of a religious organization, ethnic group, or local society.”
A review of the history of the development of Site 41WM1098 and of the
buildings that will be impacted by road construction suggests that they are not eligible for
landmark designation under criteria 1, 2, or 3 because the farm was not the site of a
significant event, it was not significantly associated with a famous person, and it was not
significantly associated with an event that symbolized an important principle or ideal.
However, one structure at the farmstead—the ca. 1906 barn constructed by Swedish
immigrant, carpenter, and farmer A. P. Rydberg and his neighbor, Mr. Johnson—may
76

have significance because it “represents a distinctive architectural type and has value as
an example of a period, style, or construction technique” and because it “is important as
part of the heritage of a[n] . . . ethnic group. . . .” While a portion of the barn was altered
in the last 30 years when its architectural integrity was negatively impacted by a change
in the roof profile, the balance of the structure—interior layout and spatial organization—
and its materials retain a high degree of integrity. It remains an agricultural artifact from
the period of Williamson County’s greatest agricultural-based economic boom, and it is
associated with the activities of Swedish farmers and builders who comprised an
important, ethnically distinctive population in Williamson County.

All references to deed and other legal records are to Williamson County instruments.
Tax records showing an appraised value of $1,350 in 1904 and 1905 suggest the presence of modest
improvements on the 90 1/7 acres. The sales price of $7,650 suggests considerably greater improvements
at the time of sale, or perhaps reflects the desirability of farm land in Williamson County where the second
greatest amount of cotton in Texas was baled in 1900-1901 (Odintz 1996:6:994).
