A Visual Key for the Identification of Otoliths

Laurie S. Zimmerman, D. Gentry Steele, and Joffre D. Meyer

ABSTRACT
Examination of fish remains from Texas Gulf Coastal sites can provide
valuable information concerning both subsistence patterns of aboriginal
populations and paleoenvironments. Although otoliths, or ear-stones, are
one of the most commonly preserved fish elements, they are uncommonly
recovered or analyzed. To encourage and facilitate future studies, this paper
provides a visual key for the identification of otoliths from common Texas
Gulf Coastal fish, and provides descriptions of each fish’s gross features,
ecology, characteristic otolith, and reported occurrence in the archeological
record. A method for estimating fish size is also presented.

INTRODUCTION
The study of fish remains from Texas Gulf Coastal sites can provide valuable
information regarding seasonality, subsistence, and paleoenvironmental inferences
(Casteel 1976). One of the most commonly preserved elements of fish useful for
specific identification is the otolith, or ear-stone. Although otoliths are a commonly
preserved element of fish found in the archeological sites, they are typically
underrepresented in the archeological literature for two reasons--their small size
and the limited literature available concerning their structure and classification.
Olsen (1968) also noted these problems in the analysis offish remains, stating
that
1. A review of the published literature documented the paucity of material.
2. Investigators report finding fish without indicating which element or
elements were recovered.
3. Many investigators are unfamiliar with the elements of a fish, so they
may overlook small elements such as otoliths during excavation.
4. A lack of reference material; the keys that do exist are complicated.
Several factors account for the fact that otoliths in particular are underrecorded
in archeological sites. They include inadequacies in research design and in
collecting, recovering, and reporting techniques. Research design can be a vital
factor in recovery of information from an archeological site. From 1870 to 1950,
when the field of zooarcheology was in its formative period (Robison 1978),
emphasis was not placed on recovery of faunal remains from archeological sites.
Instead, material culture was the focus of most investigations. This is reflected in
the literature published during the early period of zooarcheology. It may look as if
fish were not used as a resource by aboriginal populations in some Gulf Coastal

areas, but that appearance only reflects the fact that the research designs of many
early excavations did not focus on the analysis of subsistence strategies.
A second factor influencing data on otoliths is recovery techniques. Otoliths
are not commonly recovered because of their small size; the usual screen size for
archeological excavations is quarter-inch (Hester 1980, Hester et al. 1975). Casteel
(1972) and DeMarcay and Steele (1986), however, point out that many small fish
remains as well as other faunal remains pass through a quarter-inch mesh. In one
study, Fitch (1969) has even documented a 100 percent loss of fish otoliths by
sieving through a quarter-inch mesh screen, so it is clearly essential to fine-screen
archeological sites in order to recover otoliths. A review of the literature shows that
a variety of recovery techniques have been used on the Texas Gulf Coast sites. The
methodology varied from making only surface collections to using a backhoe, to
actually fine-screening the site. With the first two techniques, the otoliths probably
would not be recovered, except fortuitously.
The last factor is the actual documentation of information in the literature.
Eight sites could not be fully integrated into this study because of ambiguity in the
reported data. In some cases, it was noted that fish bones, or just fish, were recovered
(Campbell 1956, Hole and Wilkinson 1973, Patterson and Ford 1974). In other
instances, the species was listed, but no other information was provided, such as
identification of the specific element of the fish (Aten 1983, Dillehay 1975, Gilmore
1974, Hester 1975). Although it is important that the occurrence of fish was noted
at these sites, the importance of implementing precise recording practices should be
stressed as well.
In spite of these difficulties, fish otoliths have been recovered and reported
from sites along the Texas Gulf Coast, and 11 common Texas Gulf Coastal fish were
included in this investigation (Table 1), but it is important to point out thatLutjanus
campechanus, Bairdiella chrysura, and Paralichthys lethostigma have not been
reported in any of the Gulf Coastal sites in this survey. More than 100 site reports
were examined, and 32 of these documented the presence of fish remains. Otoliths
were recovered at 24/32 sites (Table 2, Figure 1). Examination of the tables makes
it apparent that most of the archeological sites yielding otoliths are in Nueces and

Kleberg counties, but this is a reflection of the work of several scholars who are
interested specifically in the prehistoric use of marine resources (Breuer 1957,
Carlson, Steele, and Bruno 1982, Hester 1971, Smith 1984, Steele and Mokry
1983). For example, Carlson, Steele, and Bruno (1982), Hester (1971), Smith
(1984), and Steele and Mokry (1983) have completed extensive studies in which
seasonality determinations were based on examination of the otoliths recovered. In
addition, Breuer (1957) had determined that the black drum had been an important
food resource at the Loyola Beach site, based on the large number of otoliths
recovered. Therefore, these studies, which focused on the use of prehistoric
resources, were greatly enhanced by examination of the otoliths, documenting a
more accurate picture of the subsistence strategies of these aboriginal populations.

Coastal fish and documents their occurrence in the archeological record and the
relationship between fish length and otolith length. For each of the species included
(Table 1), ecological information and a brief description are provided.
MORPHOLOGY OF OTOLITHS
Otoliths are the ear-stones situated within the inner ears of higher bony fish and
cartilaginous fish; they float in a liquid called endolymph that fills a chamber behind
the cranium. The piezoelectric properties they possess enhance the fish’s equilibrium and hearing (Casteel 1976:18).
Carlstrom (1963:441) recognized two basic forms of otoliths--statoconia and
statoliths. Statoconia are the small particles composed of calcium phosphate found
in the Cyclostomata (cyclostomates), Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish), and the
Chondrostei (chondrosteans) (Casteel 1976:19). Statoliths are the large solitary
ear-stones found in all of the Teleostei, or higher bony fish, except for the sturgeon.
They are composed principally of aragonite and conchiolin and forms of calcium
carbonate (Casteel 1976:19, 20).
Most of the Actinoptergians (ray-finned fish) and nearly all Teleosteans
(teleosts) have three pairs of statoliths (Nolf 1985:6). There are three types of
statoliths--the sagitta (arrow), the lapillus (small stone), and the asteriscus (star)
(Casteel 1976:20). Although all three types are present in each fish, the sagitta
otolith is generally the largest of the three, particularly in the Sciaenidae family, fish
that are common to Texas coastal waters.
In general, the otolith has an inner and an outer face. The outer face can be either
concave or fiat and consists of a series of bumps and ridges. The edges of the outer
surface may be crenulated. Concentric growth rings are visible on the outer face,
surrounding the core area. The most distinctive patterns, which characterize the

specific level (Figure 2), are on the inner face. The sulcus, a deep groove on the
inner face, occurs in each of the three types of otoliths. It is divided into two parts-the ostium, or wider anterior region, and the cauda, the narrow taillike posterior
section. The cauda bends toward the ventral margin (Ffizzel and Dante 1965). The
colliculum is the area within the sulcal groove. The rostrum and antirostrum are
present in otoliths with slanted anterior ends. The rostrum is the anteriormost point
on the otolith, and borders the ventral margin. The antirostrum is roughly 40°
behind the rostrum and is on the dorsal margin. In this sample, the Sparidae,
Bothidae, and Lutjanidae families have rostra and antirostra.
The postrostrum and pararostrum are present in otoliths with slanted posterior
ends. Thepostrostrum is the posteriormost projection and is near the ventral margin.
The pararostrum is about 20° dorsal to the postrostrum. An excisura, or notch, may
be present at either the anterior or posterior end, separating the postrostrum from the
pararostrum or the rostrum from the antirostrum (Messieh 1972, see Figure 2).
Four primary margins describe the orientation of a sagitta otolith, anterior,
posterior, ventral, and dorsal. The ostium is always anterior, and the cauda is in the
posterior part and bends toward the ventral margin, so the dorsal margin is the one
the cauda points away from. To side otoliths in the family Sciaenidae, the otolith
should be oriented with the rostrum at the bottom. The eauda of the sulcus will point
in the direction of the side from which the otolith comes (Simons 1981).
Of the three types of otoliths, lapillus otoliths are the least distinctive in shape;
only the sulcal and antisulcal ends are identified. The sulcus usually is not well
developed (Figure 3). The Ictaluridae and Ariidae catfish families are unique in that
they have large lapilli.

IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIES
This section provides diagrammatic representations and descriptions of the
otoliths and fish found in archeological sites along the Gulf Coast of Texas.
Table 3 summarizes the dimensions and localities of the Gulf Coastal Fish that
were included in this study.
Order: Ostariophysi
Family: Ictaluridae
Genus: Ictalurus
Species: Ictalurusfurcatus (Lesueur)
Common name: Blue catfish
Note: Since there are very few differences between Ictalurusfurcatus and Arius
felis, only one set of drawings (Figure 4, Ariusfelis) is given for both species. The
differences are explained in the text.
Body: The body is light to slate blue, without scales. It has eight barbels on the
lower jaw and 30 to 50 anal rays. The blue catfish can be distinguished from the
channel catfish because the former has a greater number of anal rays and does not
have spots on the body. The blue catfish typically reaches 45.5 cm in length, and
weighs between 0.23 and 0.25 kg (I-Ioese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: The blue catfish is common in low salinity habitats, although in winter it
will head for open bay waters. Blue catfish breed when the water temperature
reaches 21.1° to 23.8°C. The diet of the blue catfish consists of insects, crayfish,
mussels, fish, plants, and carrion. Its distribution extends from the Mississippi
Valley to Mexico (Hoese and Moore 1977).
Otoliths: The lapillus, the most distinctive otolith in the Ictaluridae and the Ariidae,
is heart-shaped (Figure 4). The inner face is concave and the outer face is almost
flat. The upper margin has a protuberance projecting outward. The sulcus extends
in a half circle, 180°, along the sulcal end. It is a narrow groove in the inner surface
of the lapillus. There are no crenulations along the sulcal end. The flat outer surface
is fairly smooth, with no crenulations (Figure 3).

Archeological Sites: The genus Ictalurus has been reported from sites 41CHl10
and 172; 41JK147 and 91; and 41AU36, 37, and 38 (Table 2). In sites 41CH 172
and 41CH110 it is not stated whether otoliths were collected but only that the genus
Ictolurus was present.
Order: Siluriformes
Family: Ariidae
Genus: Arius
Species: Ariusfelis (Linnaeus)
Common name: Sea catfish, Hardhead
Body: Ariusfelis, the hardhead, is a scaleless fish with large spines on the dorsal
and pectoral lines (Figure 4). The body is blue on the sides, with a white venter.

outer face; C, ventral view; D, inner face; length 1.15 cm; width .97 cm.
There are six barbels on the lower chin. Most hardheads weigh less than 0.45 kg,
and typically reach a length of 61.0 cm (Compton 1975, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: Adult hardheads eat almost anything. The young will eat mucus, scales,
or ectoparasites by scraping the sides of other fish; adults will eat rotten fish or
whatever is available. They are most abundant in bays and the shallow part of the
Gulf during the summer months when they spawn. The males carry the fertilized
eggs in their mouths until they hatch. The distribution of the hardhead extends from
Massachusetts to Mexico (Compton 1975, Gough 1979, Hoese and Moore 1977).

Zimmerman , Steele, and Meyer-- Identification of Otoliths

183

Otoliths: The lapillus is enlarged in both the Ariidae and the Ictaluridae (Figure 4;
Table 3). The lapillus is round and dome shaped with a flat bottom. The outer
surface is flat, fine grained, with no crenulations. There is a small cylindrical
protuberance at the upper margin of the lapillus with a tiny notch on the antisulcal
end. Ariusfelis is smaller than Ictalurusfurcatus and has a less distinctive sulcus.
Archeological Sites: The species Arius cf. felis has been reported from sites
41NU102 and 103 (Figure 1; Table 2).
Order: Perciformes
Family: Lutjanidae
Genus: Lutjanus
Species: Lutjanus campechanus (Poey)
Common name: Red snapper
Body: The red snapper is marked by a reddish hue, with alternating dark and light
vertical bands (Figure 5) and a dorsal area that is darker than the light-colored belly.
The dorsal and caudal fins are dark; there can be a diffused black spot above the
lateral line, near the caudal fin. The red snapper weighs between 0.45 kg and 1.8
kg, but can reach 13.6 to 15.9 kg. Red snappers are 25.4 cm long by the first year

and probably grow 7.62 cm per year until age four. They are found in the Gulf of
Mexico, on the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, and Yucatan (Bryan 1971, Compton
1973, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: The red snapper inhabits hard irregular limestone formations that rise
above the floor of the Gulf, far from shore. These snapper banks are scattered at
depths between 40 and 100 fathoms in the Gulf of Mexico. Very young fish have
been caught on muddy and sandy bottoms in the Gulf. Spawning on the Texas coast
lasts from early June through the middle of September (Bryan 1971, Compton 1973,
Klepper 1966, Stevens 1969).
Otoliths: The sagitta otolith, though very large, is similar in structure toArchosargusprobatocephalus, the sheepshead (Figure 5; Table 3). The thick anterior end
slants at a 40° angle forming a rostrum and an antirostrum. The ventral edge is
nearly straight. A notch on the dorsal margin, below the point where the ostium and
cauda join, has a pinhole structure unique to the red snapper in this sample of fish.
The posterior end is slanted, giving it a postrostmm and pararostrum. The ostium
is deepest on the dorsal margin and is less pronounced on the ventral margin,
extending to the anterior part. The cauda is very pronounced; it does not reach the
ventral margin. Small crenulations on the anterior and posterior parts are visible on
both the inner and outer faces. On the outer face, there is a pronounced rib formed
by the sulcal groove, and, in addition, small transverse ribs run perpendicular to the
central rib.
Areheological Sites: This genus has not been reported from the Texas Gulf Coast.
Order: Perciformes
Family: Sciaenidae
Genus: BairdieIla
Species: Bairdiella chrysura (Lacepede)
Common name: Silver perch
Body: The body is light silvery with yellow to silvery yellow fins. The lateral line
is clearly marked (Figure 6). The fish is rather small, reaching only 15.24 to 30.48
cm, and usually weighs less than 0.227 kg (Compton 1976, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: The silver perch lives in lagoons and bays and can withstand a wide range
of salinities. Adults move to the Gulf in the winter and return to the coast to spawn
in the spring. Silver perch eat crustaceans, worms, and small fish. The young are
usually found in the protective grass beds (Compton 1976, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Otoliths: The sagitta otolith has a unique irregularly triangular shape (Figure 6;
Table 3). There is a projection at the corner formed by the posterior and ventral
edges when viewed on the inner surface; another projection is visible on the dorsal
side. The sulcus is deep and well defined; the ostium is deep and straight. The cauda
is short, L-shaped, and curves almost to the ventral margin. There is a groove just
below the cauda on the posterior end. The outer surface is slightly irregular. The
anterior half has the greatest height (Chao 1978).
Archeological Sites: There are no recorded sites for this genus.

Order: Perciformes
Family: Sciaenidae
Genus: Cynoscion
Species: Cynoscion arenarius Ginsburg
Common names: Sand seatrout, sand trout, white trout
Body: The body of the adult is silvery to blue gray, with a yellow-green back
(Figure 7) on which are large irregular spots. The sand trout is usually less than 45.7
cm long and rarely weighs more than 0.45 kg. The young differ from adults in the
faint crossbands visible on their backs (Compton 1974, Hoese and Moore 1977,
Moffett and McEachron 1976).
Habitat: The sand trout lives in the coastal bays and shallow near-shore Gulf from
southern Florida to the Gulf of Campeche. The adults spawn in the deeper channels
near the tidal inlets of the bays and remain there until about March to early April,
when they are fully grown. Adults also can be found in the shallow bays and will
remain throughout the winter if the water temperature does not fall far below 20°C.
The young prefer back bays because of the lower salinity and the protection they
afford from larger fish. Older fish prefer the primary bays and shallow Gulf waters.
The sand seatrout can withstand the rapid temperature and salinity changes of the

Texas bays (Compton 1974, Hoese and Moore 1977, Moffett and McEachron
1976).
Otoliths: Cynoscion arenarius has an elliptical sagitta otolith (Figure 7; Table 3).
The inner side is well developed. The oval-shaped ostium almost reaches the
anterior margin. The cauda is noticeable but faint, becoming less distinct toward the
ventral margin. There is a poorly developed marginal groove on the dorsal part. The
posterior half is slightly thicker than the anterior half. On the inner face, the
posterior part has a slightly scalloped appearance. Cynoscion arenarius, which
does not have well-developed cauda, can be differentiated by that characteristic
from Cynoscion nebulosus, which does have a well-developed cauda.
Archeological Sites: The genus Cynoscion and the species Cynoscion arenarius
have been reported from 41JK147 and 91; 41NU102 and 103; 41SP43, and
41CH172 (Figure 1; Table 2). The genus Cynoscion was reported from sites
41SP43 and 41CH172, but it is not known whether otoliths were recovered.
Order: Perciformes
Family: Sciaenidae
Genus: Cynoscion
Species: Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier)
Common names: Spotted seatrout, Speckled seatrout
Body: The body of the speckled seatrout is silvery with a greenish back (Figure 8;
Table 3); the back, dorsal, and caudal fins have many dark spots, and the inside of
the mouth is orange. Adult speckled seatrout spawn in the bays; typically, mature
fish range between 30.0 and 35.5 cm in lenth and weigh approximately 0.23 to 0.45

kg. Older fish may reach 76 cm in length and 28.7 kg in weight. (Becker 1964;
Hoese and Moore 1977). The young have a similar spotted pattern (Hoese and
Moore 1977).
Habitat: During their first year, the young usually are found in grass flats. The
adults live in deeper areas and sometimes can be sighted over oyster reefs. Adult
speckled seal!out spawn in the bays, and reach about 1.22 meters in length (Becker
1964, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Otoliths: Cynoscion nebulosus has a narrow elliptical sagitta otolith that is very
similar in appearance to the otolith of Cynoscion arenarius (Figure 8; Table 3).
Distinctive features of Cynoscion nebulosus are (1) The cauda bends more but does
not reach the dorsal margin, (2) The anterior half is narrower than in Cynoscion
arenarius, (3) The ventral margin of Cynoscion nebulosus is straighter, but the edge
is more jagged, (4) There are more crenulations on the outer surface, (5) The dorsal
margin bends inward more at the midpoint in Cynoscion nebulosus, and (6) The
posterior half of the otolith in Cynoscion nebulosus is thicker than the anterior half,
pointed rather than rounded, and lacks the toothlike serrations of the posterior end
of Cynoscion arenarius.
Archeological Sites: The genus Cynoscion and the species Cynoscion nebulosus
have been reported from 41JKgl and 47, 41NU221, 102, and 103; 41KL13, and
41CH172 (Figure 1; Table 2). The genus Cynoscion was present at site 41CH172,
but it was not stated that otoliths were recovered.

(B-D): B, outer face; C, ventral view; D, inner face; length 1.275 cm, width .86 crn.
Body: The Atlantic croaker, silvery when young, has a brassy yellow hue and
irregular brown streaks as an adult (Figure 9). Adults weigh from 0.11 to 0.23 kg,
and, occasionally, as much as 2.3 kg. The typical body length ranges between 24.0
cm and 30.5 cm (Compton 1974, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: The Atlantic croaker can be found in bays and on the Gulf margin. In the
summer, the young live in the deeper parts of the bays, but depart by fall. Atlantic
croakers are winter spawners. Their distribution extends from Cape Cod to Central
Mexico (Compton 1974, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Otoliths: The sagitta otolith of the Atlantic croaker has a unique shieldlike form
(Figure 9; Table 3). On the outer surface is a hooklike phalange on the dorsal
margin. The large ovoid ostium is faint and does not reach the anterior margin. The
cauda is more pronounced and slants towards the posterior end. The posterior end
is thickest, due to the many spurs, or humps, projecting from the outer surface close
to the dorsal margin (Chao 1978).
Archeological Sites: The species Micropogonius undulatus has been reported
from 4ling.J102, 103, and 221; and at 41SP43 (Figure 1; Table 2). At site 41SP43
only the occurrence of the genus Micropogonius was noted.

Species: Pogonius cromis (Linnaeus)
Common name: Black drum
Body: The black drum is the largest sciaenid in the Gulf of Mexico, weighing as

dark bands. In larger fish the banding becomes obscured so the body appears darker.
The underside of the lower jaw is covered with large barbels. Typically, black drum
range in length from 40.6 to 50.8 cm and weigh from 6.6 kg to 8.8 kg. Large
specimens may weigh as much as 35.4 kg. The black drum is found from Massachusetts to Argentina, but it is more abundant off the South Texas coast (Breuer
1977, Cook 1974, Compton 1975, Hoese and Moore 1977).
Habitat: This species frequents shallow bays and lagoons, the large grinding
molars in its throat aid in chewing shells of mollusks. The black drum spawns in
both winter and spring; its annual spawning run into the bays is from late December
through April (Breuer 1977, Cook 1974, Compton 1975, Nuckles 1967, Simmons
1962).

190

Texas Archeological Society

Otoliths: The sagitta otolith of the black drum is semicircular, or D-shaped, thin,
and has a large sulcus (Figure 10; Table 3). The ventral margin is evenly curved and
convex; the dorsal margin is fairly straight. There is a projection on the dorsal
margin near the point where the ostium and cauda are joined. The large, roundish
ostium does not reach the anterior end. The J-shaped cauda has a pointed distal end
that does not reach the ventral margin. The outer surface has crenulations and a
distinct core area. The posterior half is slightly thicker. The highest part is in the
center, giving the sagitta a domelike yet concave appearance in lateral view. There
is a faint marginal groove between the dorsal margin and the sulcus (Chao 1978).
Archeological Sites: The genus Pogonias and the species Pogonias cromis have
been reported from 41CF29; 41 SP27 and 43; 41JK41; 41KL22, 33, 71, 74, 37, 30,
and 13; 41KN3; 41CHll0 and 29; and 41NU221, 185, 101,102, and 103 (Figure

41CHll0, and 41NU185.
Order: Perciformes
Family: Sciaenidae
Genus: Sciaenops
Species: Sciaenops ocellata (Linnaeus)
Common names: Channel bass, Red drum, Redfish
Body: The body of the redfish is silvery when young, turning coppery brown or
reddish as it matures (Figure 11). There usually is a single large black spot above
the lateral line in front of the caudal fin, but some redfish have additional spots

(Hoese and Moore 1977). Red drum are among the fastest growing fish. By one
year, they reach 27.9 cm and 0.45 kg, by two years, 55.8 cm and 1.59 kg; by three
years, they may reach 61.0 cm and 3.6 kg. Mature fish may weigh in excess of 22.7
kg (Simmons 1962; Simmons 1965; Simmons 1976).
Habitat: The redfish is predominantly a bottom feeder, commonly engaging in an
activity called tailing, in which the fish, in a head-down position, searches the
substrate for small crabs, fish, and shrimp. The adults are largely solitary, living in
shallow water habitats such as bays, but they also move in schools. In fact, redfish
migrate in large numbers to the Gulf in the fall as temperatures decline and return
to the bays and inlets in the spring. During the fall and winter, the redfish spawn just
off the shore along the bay inlets before moving out to the Gulf (Simmons 1962,
Simmons 1965, Simmons 1976).
Otoliths: The sagitta of the redfish is thick and rectangular, with a distinct sulcus
(Figure 11; Table 3). The ostium of the sulcus is pear shaped and not well
pronounced; its expanded part reaches the anterior margin of the sagitta. The cauda
is J shaped, with a narrow distal end that approaches the ventral margin. The dorsal
margin of the otolith is slightly crenulate, whereas the ventral margin is curved and
convex. The outer surface has both ridges and crenulations. The cauda is slightly
deeper than the ostium. In lateral view it is convex. The posterior is the thickest part
of the sagitta otolith (Chao 1978).
Archeological Sites: The species Sciaenops ocellata has been reported from
41SP43; 41KL33 and 13; 41NU101, 102, and 103; and 41CH172 (Figure 1; Table
2). The species Sciaenops ocellata was reported from site 41CH172, but it was not
stated that otoliths were recovered.
Order: Perciformes
Family: Sparidae
Genus: Archosargus
Species: Archosargusprobatocephalus (Walbaum)
Common name: Sheepshead
Body: The body of the sheepshead is gray, greenish yellow, or bronze, with seven
dark vertical stripes (Figure 12); the belly is white. Coloration fades with age. The
body is flattened sideways, and there is along dorsal fin. The tail is not deeply forked
and has rounded edges that separate the sheepshead from other members of the
family Sparidae. The name sheepshead was derived from its buck-toothed
appearance. The front incisors are broad and flat, and adjacent to these are peglike
canines. Next to the canines are globular and molarlike cheek-teeth. The average
weight is 0.9072 to 1.814 kg. Typical length of sheepshead range between 35.6 cm
and 45.7 cm. Some fish, however, attain a maximum weight of 13.61 kg and 76.2
cm in length (Hoese and Moore 1977; Pearsall 1966; Simmons 1962).
Habitat: The sheepshead are bottom feeders that are attracted to substrates covered
with barnacles or inhabited by crustaceans. Their diets change in the hottest part of
the summer to algae. They are commonly found in bays over shell reefs. From late
winter to early spring the sheepshead move in schools back to the shallow water

bays to spawn (Hoese and Moore 1977, Pearsall 1966, Simmons 1962, Swann
1964).
Otoliths: The sagitta otolith is small but similar in basic structure to Lutjanus
campechanus, the red snapper (Figure 12; Table 3). The anterior margin slants at
a 40° angle, creating a rostrum and antirostrum. The anterior margin is thin and
highly serrated, unlike the red snapper. The dorsal margin has a very slight slant.
The ostium reaches the anterior margin, and the cauda is straight with a slight bend
toward the ventral margin. The outer face shows an axis formed by the sulcal
groove. The side view is concave. The posterior end also is slanted, giving that
margin a pararostrum and a postrostmm. Serrations are visible on both the dorsal
and ventral sides. There is a marginal groove on the dorsal side adjacent to the
sulcus.
Archeological Sites: The species Archosargusprobatocephalus has been reported
from 41CH172 and 41JK91 (Figure 1; Table 2). It was not stated whether otoliths
were recovered at 41CH172.

Order: Pleuronectiformes
Family: Bothidae
Genus: Paralichthys
Species: Paralichthys lethostigma (Jordan and Gilbert)
Common name: Southern flounder
Body: The dorsal surface of the southern flounder is dark olive to light brown; the
ventral surface is white (Figure 13); the the dorsal surface is capable of changing
color upon stimulation. The eyes and coloration are on the left side; the blind side
is pale. There are light tan spots on the fins. Newly hatched fish are symmetrical,

with one eye on each side of the head, but after the fish reaches a critical size, one
eye migrates, find the pigment disappears from the blind side. Typically, female
southern flounder range from 30.5 cm to 40.6 cm and weigh from 0.45 kg to 0.68
kg. Males rarely exceed 30.5 cm. Large specimens may reach 71.0 cm and weigh
5.9 kg (Compton 1976, Hoese and Moore 1977, Simmons 1962, Simmons 1964,
Stokes 1975).
Habitat: Southern flounders prefers loose substrate so they can bury themselves
in order to catch small fish, squid, shrimp, and other crustaceans. The young are
found in shallow bays. The usual season of abundance extends from early spring
into November or December. In the fall, the adults leave the bays to spawn; severe
cold will cause a mass migration for spawning from the shallow bays into the Gulf.

194

Texas Archeological Society

Warmer conditions tend to cause these large flounders to disperse over a greater
period of time. Southern flounder are commonly found from North Carolina to
Florida and from Florida to northern Mexico (Compton 1976, Hoese and Moore
1977, Simmons 1962, Simmons 1964, Stokes 1975).
Otoliths: The sagitta otolith is extremely small, flat, and almost symmetrical along
the Y axis (Figure 13; Table 3). The anterior margin forms a40° angle and is slightly
jagged. There is a rostrum and an antirostrum. A notch or excisura at the base of
the posterior margin separates the postrostrum and pararostrum. The posterior
margin is straight. The sulcus is narrow and not differentiated into an ostium and
cauda. The outer side has prominent growth rings.
Archeological Sites: This genus has not been reported from sites on the Texas Gulf
Coast.
ESTIMATING SIZE OF FISH
Estimation of fish size is important when dealing with archeological remains
for three reasons. First, the size of a fish can suggest its importance as a subsistence
item. Second, some inferences may be made about the techniques used in obtaining
fish, especially in the absence of cultural remains. For instance, small fish probably
were trapped, netted, or poisoned, whereas large fish probably were speared or
hooked. Finally, some ecological information can be gleaned from fish remains. By
associating skeletal elements with specific levels, it is possible to infer habitats
based on the ecology of modem fish. Reitz, Quitmeyer, Hale, Scudder, andWing
(1987:306) have noted that small individuals of a particular species may have been
caught in an estuarine nursery, whereas those of larger species may have been
caught offshore, so fish size can provide valuable insights.
In several investigations the relationship between otolith length and fish size
(Casteel 1976, Eziuzo 1963, Fitch and Brownell 1968, and Reitz et al. 1987) has
been examined, and it has been determined that an allometric relationship exists
between bone and body mass (Reitz et al. 1987). This is biologically more sound
than work of some previous investigators who suggest that there is a linear
relationship. Those who support a linear relationship assume that shell or bone
dimensions increase in a constant ratio with body mass ~eitz et al. 1987), but this
is not the case.
Fish grow continuously throughout their lives, but the growth rate is not
constant; after sexual maturity the rate decreases. Environmental changes, too, can
affect the growth rates of fish. Casteel (1974:572, 1976:65, 66) has shown that the
growth rate of fish is directly related to temperature variations, with increases in
temperature promoting increased growth. These visible increments in growth in the
otoliths are biological evidence supporting an allometric relationship between
otolith size and fish size.
A second important fact is that in many cases where a linear relationship is
considered, an average-size criterion must be established for each species of fish,
and factors such as age, sexual dimorphism, and temperature variations--which can
cause extreme discrepancies in size within species--are not taken into account.

Zimmerman , Steele, and Meyer ~ Identification of Otoliths

Casteel (1976) has summarized and compared five methods of estimating fish
size from skeletal elements. These methods are the single regression, double
regression, proportional, White’s Technique, and Cook and Treganza’s technique;
the two most accurate are the single and double regression (see Reitz et al. 1987).
In order to investigate this issue, nineteen otoliths from Cynoscion nebulosus
were measured from the postrostrum to the rostrum (Table 3). These measurements
were compared to the actual fish length, using a simple regression, and the following
equation was derived: log Y = log a + b(log X). Log Y is the length of the fish, b
is the slope of the line, a is the y-intercept, and log X is the length of the otolith. This
equation can predict total length for Cynoscion nebulosus for which the actual
length is unknown by substituting the otolith length into the equation. Similarly,
fish weight can be estimated from otolith length by deriving an equation from a
known population of fish. The results of this investigation indicate that a relationship, albeit not a strong one, does exist (Figure 14). The correlation coefficient was
.778. These findings are similar to those of Reitz, Quitmyer, Hale, Scudder, and
Wing (1987). The sample that was used for this study did not include any juvenile
fish, and, in addition, most of the adults were in the same size range, so the lack of
variation within the sample can explain why the correlation was not strong.
Regression techniques are adequate for estimating gross fish size (either fish length
or fish weight), but the technique produces only an estimate.
A study by Eziuzo (1963) and Fitch and Brownell (1968) uses a two-step
process. The length of the fish is estimated from the length of the otolith, using the

double regression method, and the weight of the fish is predicted from this estimated
length. In this study, however, the length of the fish is already known, so the second
step would be to examine the data in order to determine the fish weight based on the
fish length.
As a general guide, Table 3, which documents fish size and otolith length of the
specimens used in this study, can be consulted.
