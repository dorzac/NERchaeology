ABSTRACT
Between February 27 and 29, 2008, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., at the request of
CIVILCORP, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s Abilene District conducted
an intensive archeological survey at two bridges (Bridges 1 and 2) in the FM 89 right-of-way at Elm
Creek in Taylor County prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction.
Augmented by shovel testing and backhoe trenching, investigations discovered no archeological materials
at Bridge 1. Survey efforts did however discover the remnants of prehistoric site 41TA283 in the right-ofway near Bridge 2. Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends that because no archeological deposits were
discovered at Bridge 1, in conjunction with a lack of research potential for the part of site 41TA283 in the
right-of-way, the proposed construction should not affect any archeological historic properties (36 CFR
800.4(d)) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12) and should, therefore, be allowed to proceed as planned without
further archeological investigations. No artifacts were collected during field investigations. Curation was
unnecessary.

INTRODUCTION
Between February 27 and 29, 2008, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) at the request
of Civil Corp and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District
conducted intensive archeological surveys at two bridges on FM 89 at Elm Creek in Taylor County prior
to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (Figures 1 and 2). The linear
project areas are located in west-central Taylor County just northwest of the US 89/US 277 intersection.
Construction at each location would occur within the existing FM 89 right-of-way (ROW) and involve the
removal of the existing bridges in preparation for new structures and widening and paving of the approach
roadway at the ends of both bridges. Further, two temporary two-lane detours would be established within
the ROW to divert traffic around each bridge during construction. The bridges are approximately
1,290 feet apart, with the western bridge identified as Bridge 1 and the eastern bridge identified as
Bridge 2.
The existing FM 89 ROW is 100 feet wide with a roadway that consists of two 11-foot wide lanes and
two 2-foot wide shoulders for an overall width of 26 feet. The proposed approach roadways would be
widened to 30 feet and include two 11-foot wide lanes and two 4-foot wide shoulders (Figure 3). The
existing bridge (Bridge 1) at the western crossing of Elm Creek is 75 feet long and 28 feet wide and
would be replaced. The existing bridge (Bridge 2) at the eastern crossing is 90 feet long and 28 feet wide.
The proposed detours would be 24 feet wide with two 12-foot wide lanes. Combined, the two temporary
1,550-foot long detours would extend approximately 3,100 feet and pass on the north side of the highway
at Bridge 1 and the south side of the highway near Bridge 2 (Figure 4).
The proposed construction area for Bridge 1, including the planned detour, is about 1,550 feet long, 100feet wide, encompasses 3.6 acres, and includes a 473-foot long western approach roadway, a proposed
150-foot long and 32-foot wide bridge, and a 217-foot long eastern approach roadway. The planned
construction area for Bridge 2 is 1,550 feet long, 100 feet wide, encompasses 3.6 acres, and consists of a
245-foot long western approach roadway, a proposed 210-foot long and 32-foot wide bridge, and a 350foot long eastern approach roadway. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) (including the detours) is
approximately 3,100 feet long, 100 feet wide, and encompasses 7.20 acres. Available construction plans
indicate that the maximum depth of impacts for bridge columns would be 10 feet for Bridge 1 and 15 feet
at Bridge 2. Because roadway improvements would utilize a significant fill section for the approach
roadways at both bridges, the maximum depth of impacts related to the approach roadways would be
two feet.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed
in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must

identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs. Surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) issued by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) in accordance with the provisions of the code. Investigations were
conducted under TAP No. 4816 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
Additionally, it is presumed that the project will utilize funds from the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) and as such, the proposed construction is also subject to the provisions of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the NHPA is to consider the effects on
significant cultural resources by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal
property. The act, which created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory
Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment
when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal
agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal agencies. The federal regulatory process is
described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the regulations of the agencies and
federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural resources under federal law is
tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined by National Park Service
(NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. All work was conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the First
Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the
THC.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located in west-central Taylor County near the community of View, Texas. This area
is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas that is characterized by a gently undulating to
rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern
margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock Escarpment on the region’s western edges
(Jordan et al. 1984).
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The bridge locations are underlain by the Lower Cretaceous-age Antlers Sand formation that consists of
sand, sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and quartzite. The conglomerate constituent contains black chert
(Barnes 1972). There is no Holocene alluvium (clay, silt, and sand floodplain and low terrace deposits)
mapped along Elm Creek at either bridge location.
Soils at both bridges consist of Colorado loam, frequently flooded, that formed in deep calcareous
alluvium. A representative profile exhibits light brown loam from 0 to 6 inches below ground surface (A
horizon) overlying a reddish brown loam C horizon between 6 and 60 inches below ground surface
(Conner 1976).
FLORA
Taylor County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron Smithii). A mesquite-grass association is common and dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis grandulosa) and some juniper (Juniperus ashei), with various species of grama
(Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida spp.) and broomweed (Gutierrezia texana). Shorter grass species
include buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) and various grama grasses. Aerial photography indicates that
adjacent land use is open range.

CULTURE HISTORY
The project area is located in the southeastern extent of the Southern Plains and the southwestern edge of
the Rolling Plains. This area lacks the cultural syntheses that other regions of Texas have. The earliest
systematic investigations in the region were conducted by E. B. Sayles (1935) during his survey of Texas
archeology. The most exhaustive, long term archeological studies in the area were conducted to the north
at Lubbock Lake (Johnson and Holliday 1995) and at Justiceburg Reservoir, now Lake Allan Henry
(Boyd et al. 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1994; Boyd 1997). Five broad periods typically define the
prehistoric cultural history of the project area. They include the Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, and
Protohistoric periods (Johnson and Holliday 1995). Earlier chronologies incorporate the Ceramic and
Protohistoric into a single Late Prehistoric period (Suhm et al. 1954). As only prehistoric cultural
resources were identified during this survey, this background is limited to a general overview of regional
prehistory.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The earliest well-documented evidence of human occupation in the region appears in the Paleoindian
period during the Late Pleistocene around 9,500 B.C. at the Blackwater Draw, Miami, and Lubbock Lake
sites (Johnson and Holliday 1995:552). During the Late Pleistocene the environment was humid with
mild winters and summers and the mean temperature was lower than it is today (Johnson 1986).
Grasslands covered much of the plains, and many small streams crossed the countryside (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:552).
Megafauna such as mammoth, Bison antiquus, camel, giant turtle, horse, short-faced bear, giant beaver,
and peccary inhabited this landscape (Hester 1972). The common view is that paleoindians were nomadic
hunter-gathers who followed large game and lacked many semi-permanent or permanent structures
(Johnson and Holliday 1995), but recent evidence suggests that a more diversified and complex lifeway
may have existed. The tool kit from this time included large, intricately worked, fluted, lanceolate stone
points that were probably hafted on a spear-like weapon. These points include Clovis, Folsom, Midland,
Plainview, and Firstview styles.
ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the cooler and wetter climates of the Late Pleistocene gave way to the warmer and drier Holocene,
there were marked changes in fauna and flora of the region. The large mammals vanished from the
landscape, possibly aided by overhunting. In the midst of this dramatic environmental shift, a range of
cultural changes mark the beginning of the long Archaic period (6,500 B.C. to 700–900 A.D.). With the
majority of the large mammals gone and the environment drier, Southern Plains cultures became more
sedentary and dependent on B. bison, which had replaced the larger B. antiquus, and smaller game such as
deer and rabbit. While lanceolate projectile point forms remained in use during the Early Archaic,
stemmed dart points began to proliferate and eventually replace the lanceolate forms altogether. The dart
points were better suited to the lightweight shafts propelled by the atlatl, and the entire toolkit was better
adapted to small game. Ground-stone artifacts found at sites of this age may be indicative of a more
generalized diet containing more plant material.

Population grew during the Archaic despite the changing climates and resource base. Boyd et al.
(1989:44) discuss a number of climatic “shifts” during the Archaic that are marked primarily by drier
episodes. Each shift indicates a potential change in priorities between plant and animal resources. Shift 1
(6,500 B.C. to 4,400 B.C.) roughly corresponds with the Early Archaic of the Central Texas chronologies.
Bison were the most important food and plants less important. Shift 2 (4,400 B.C. to 3,500 B.C.)
correlates with the Hypsithermal, or Drought 1. The Hypsithermal was a global phenomenon during
which warmer, drier conditions and prolonged, severe droughts affected much of North America. During
this time, the parched grasslands and warmer temperatures of the Southern Plains became less attractive
to bison (Johnson and Holliday 1995:526). Bison herds traveled south into the area less frequently, and
people became more dependent on plant resources (Dillehay 1974). Water became critical during the
prolonged droughts of the Hypsithermal. At the Mustang Springs Site, seven wells that date to this time
were documented by Meltzer (1991). Shift 3 (3,500 to 3,000 B.C.) marked a return to more mesic
conditions. Bison returned to the area in greater numbers and once again became an important food
resource.
Between 3,000 B.C and 2,500 B.C, Johnson and Holliday (1995:526) postulate another prolonged hot and
dry period (their Shift 4 or Drought 2) that was less severe than the earlier Hypsithermal. As bison ranged
the cooler northern plains, plant resources again became a dietary staple. Shifts 2, 3, and 4 overlap with
Middle Archaic (ca. 3,500 B.C. to 1,100 B.C) dates from adjacent cultural chronologies. The final climate
shift (Shift 5) occurred between 2,500 and 1,000 B.C. and is once again identified with a reliance on bison
as the primary diet. Shift 5 overlaps with the beginning of the Late Archaic (ca. 1,100 B.C to 600–700
A.D.), during which time the climate stabilized and conditions developed that have remained to the
modern era (Johnson and Holliday 1995:528).
CERAMIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The Ceramic Period (ca. 600–700 A.D. to 1540 A.D.) is denoted by the appearance of two technological
innovations: ceramics and the bow and arrow. Arrow points, dart points, and coarse-tempered cordmarked ceramics were found associated with each other at Deadman’s Shelter. This seems to indicate that
there was a transition between technologies rather than an abrupt switch (Hughes and Wiley 1978).
Diagnostic materials for the period are corner-notched Scallorn points and ceramic trade items from the
Mogollon and Puebloan cultures (Perttula et al. 1995).
The Protohistoric period (1540 A.D. to 1750 A.D.) was defined by Johnson and Holliday (1995:530) as
the presence of Europeans in the New World but the apparent lack of European items in the archeological
record. The typical arrow point associated with this time period is the triangular, often serrated Garza
point (Turner and Hester 1999:215). Very little is known about this period, but Hickerson (1994:24)
believes that the area was populated by the Jumano Indians by the time of the Coronado expedition. By
the early 1700s, the Jumanos were eradicated by disease and the Apache, whom they had been battling
with for decades or more (Hickerson 1994). Later the Apache were supplanted by the Comanche, who
controlled the area until the 1870s (Lowry et al. 2002:5).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Archeologists from B&A performed a background review prior to field investigations to determine the
locations of any previous investigations and/or previously recorded sites within a 1,000-meter search
radius of the project area. The review, which involved an examination of records at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), found
seven (41TA5, 41TA34–36, 41TA39, 41TA66, and 41TA83) previously recorded archeological sites and
one previous project area within a 1,000-meter search radius around the APE.
Except for site 41TA5, the previously documented sites were recorded in 1928 and 1929 by E. B. Sayles.
The archived site locations for these sites were extrapolated from Sayles’ 1928 field notes and plots on
the Abilene, Texas 30-minute topographic quadrangle to 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles by
personnel from TARL in the 1980s. Thus, the accuracy of their locations is questionable (TASA).
Approximately 650 meters west of Bridge 1 is 41TA34, a prehistoric open camp site on the north bank of
Elm Creek between the confluence of Elm Creek and an unnamed tributary. The site was described as
occupying about five acres with buried deposits between 0 and 30 centimeters below grounds surface.
About 100 meters or less east of 41TA34 is prehistoric site 41TA36 that was also recorded by Sayles in
1928. The site was described as occupying two acres on the north bank of Elm Creek. Neither
descriptions of 41TA34 and 41TA36 describe the types of artifacts or cultural features identified on site.
Approximately 120 meters due south of Bridge 1 is prehistoric site 41TA39, an open site with a surface
and subsurface lithic scatter likely associated with natural gravels in or adjacent to Elm Creek, as
immediately south of the APE here is a gravel quarry (TASA). Roughly 170 meters due north of Bridge 1
is 41TA83 that was recorded as a prehistoric site with surface and subsurface lithic scatters occupying
about three acres (TASA).
Approximately 70 meters north of Bridge 2 is prehistoric open camp 41TA35 that consists of a surface
and subsurface scatter of chipped-stone debitage. Four hundred meters north of Bridge 2 is 41TA5, an
open prehistoric site with a surface and subsurface scatter of lithic debitage, scrapers, and blades. One
burned rock midden was also recorded. This site was recorded in 1969 by a local avocational archeologist
(TASA).
Approximately 800 meters southeast of Bridge 2 is 41TA66, a large prehistoric lithic scatter (TASA).
Included within the northern margins of 41TA66 is an historical marker (THC Marker no. 2626) located
along a county road commemorating the 1541 Coronado Expedition believed to have passed through this
area “en route from New Mexico to the fabled…’Quivira’ (TASA).”
In 1998 a large project area consisting of numerous linear survey areas surrounds the bridge locations.
The survey was sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) but TASA contains
no additional data, such as who conducted the survey, etc. It does not appear that any archeological or
historical resources were recorded.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological survey at the bridge locations involved surface and subsurface (shovel testing and backhoe
trenching) investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the
significance of any discovered cultural resources. Surface investigations consisted of an intensive 100
percent pedestrian survey of each bridge location by two archeologists systematically examining the
ground surface for archeological remains. Where possible, cutbank profiles were inspected for the
presence of any buried cultural materials. All investigations were thoroughly photographed.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters on a side and excavated in arbitrary 10-centimeter levels with a
square-head shovel. All appropriate data was recorded on a B&A shovel test form and sediments removed
from shovel tests were screened through 0.25 inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery. Additional
documentation included detailed descriptions of the proposed construction areas, and locational data
obtained with a hand-held GPS receiver for backhoe trenches and shovel tests.
All trenching activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary damage to potentially
buried cultural deposits. Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) long,
1.0 meter (3.3 feet) wide, and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep. Following excavations, archeologists
immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, cultural features, and/or soil
anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench were described in detail on a
B&A geologic profile form and photographed with a digital camera. All backhoe trench locations were
plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Previous construction of both a buried telephone cable and a water pipeline on the north and south sides
of the existing FM 89 ROW at both bridge locations significantly disturbed (horizontally and vertically)
the remnants of the original landform and soils that remained in the ROW following highway
construction cut-and-fill activity. Subsurface testing at both bridges revealed zones of truncated to intact
sand, sand loam, and clay overlain by a zone of disturbed, mechanically compacted clayey and rocky
roadway construction fill, though some dense gravels were encountered during trenching at Bridge 2
(Figure 5).
Subsurface investigations at Bridge 1 involved the excavation of three backhoe trenches (BHTs 1 through
3) to a maximum depth of 160 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 6; Appendix A). Trenching was
not possible in the southeast quadrant of the crossing due to exposed sandstone bedrock (Figure 7).
Examination of BHTs 1 and 2 identified three stratigraphic zones while BHT 3 contained only two zones
(see Appendix A). No surface or subsurface archeological material was discovered at Bridge 1. Similarly,
investigations west of Bridge 2 discovered no archeological deposits. However, investigations east of
Bridge 2 discovered the remnants of prehistoric site 41TA283 within the northern margins of the ROW.
SITE 41TA283
This site is a prehistoric campsite measuring approximately 2 meters north-south by 75 meters east-west
that was identified by a scatter of chert debitage and burned rock in the ROW exposed on the face of the
road cut and adjacent ground surface east of Bridge 2 (Figure 8; see Figure 7). At this location along the
north edge of the FM 89 ROW, roadway construction left a narrow (approximately two meters wide)
remnant of the original ridge that trended southeast before truncation by highway construction (Figures 9
and 10). The site extends north out of the ROW onto adjacent private property but there is no surface or
subsurface evidence that the site extends to the south side of FM 89. It is possible that the site is part of
previously recorded site 41TA35 that is about 70 meters north-northeast of Bridge 2. Ground surface
visibility was approximately 40 percent across the site area.
Subsurface investigations to delineate boundaries for 41TA283 east of Bridge 2 included the excavation
of 11 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches. The excavation of BHTs 1 and 2 discovered no buried
artifacts (see Appendix A). Shovel testing discovered a random vertical distribution of artifacts in five
shovel tests (nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9) between 10 and 30 centimeters below ground surface (Table 1). Shovel
Tests 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 contained no artifacts.
Artifacts on site included roughly 40 pieces of chipped-stone debitage and 10 pieces of burned and firecracked sandstone rock from surface and subsurface contexts, with burned rock only observed on the
ground surface (see Table 1). The debitage assemblage was predominately secondary and tertiary flakes
and flake fragments, suggesting that later stages of lithic reduction and/or biface thinning or retooling of
formal tools occurred. Several of the shovel tests contained abundant water-worn gravels from 10 to
30 centimeters below ground surface intermixed with artifacts. This strongly suggests that the artifacts are
in secondary contexts (i.e., flood event and/or extensive vertical disturbance from utility and roadway
construction) (see Table 1).

Investigations at Bridge 1 discovered no surface or subsurface archeological materials. Considering the
level of previous impacts to the existing ROW, the random vertical distribution of subsurface artifacts, the
lack of diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of cultural features, it is the opinion of B&A that the remnant of
41TA283 within the FM 89 ROW is not intact and cannot provide any new or important data concerning
regional prehistory. As such, the research potential of the site has been exhausted by formal site
recording.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts at Bridge 1 on Elm Creek discovered no archeological materials. However,
remains of prehistoric campsite 41TA283 were discovered in the APE east of Bridge 2. The site is a lowdensity, horizontally discontinuous surface and subsurface scatter of debitage and burned rock lacking
cultural features. An unknown proportion of the site was removed during preparation of the road cut when
the highway was constructed.
The cultural deposit at 41TA283 is displaced from primary context by buried utilities and roadway
construction. In the margins of the ROW on both the north and south sides of FM 89 is a buried telephone
cable and water pipeline, the construction of which further impacted the part of the site remaining in the
ROW. Additionally, the presence of water-worn gravels from the same depths (10 to 30 centimeters) as
artifact recovery in several suggests that the cultural material has been re-deposited by flooding. A lack of
temporal diagnostics prevents attributing an age to site use. An undetermined percentage of the site
continues north of the ROW onto private property in the direction of previously recorded site 41TA35,
which is approximately 70 meters north-northeast of Bridge 2. Investigations were not possible beyond
the ROW to determine if 41TA283 is actually a part 41TA35. The site does not extend to the south side of
the ROW.
It is the opinion of B&A that, given the previous level of disturbances within the ROW, the lack of an
isolable living surface, the random vertical distribution of artifacts within a 20-centimeter thick zone, no
cultural features, and no temporal diagnostics, site 41TA283 has little research potential and does not
warrant formal SAL designation or inclusion to the NRHP. Although the research potential of the part of
the site north of the ROW is unknown, the part of site 41TA283 in the ROW would not be recommended
as a contributing element if the remainder of the site outside the ROW was determined to have a high
research potential and was eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and/or formal SAL designation.
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain
previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12).
B&A recommends therefore that because no archeological deposits were discovered at Bridge 1, in
conjunction with the lack of research potential for the part of site 41TA283 in the ROW, the proposed
construction on FM 89 at Elm Creek should not affect any archeological historic properties pursuant to 36
CFR 800.4(d) or SALs and the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as planned without
further archeological investigations.
If it is determined that the proposed construction requires impacts to occur outside the FM 89 ROW then
additional archeological investigations will be necessary in those areas prior to any construction,
particularly the area north of 41TA283. In the event that previously unidentified archeological deposits
are discovered during construction, all activity in the immediate area of discovery should cease
immediately and the TxDOT archeological staff should be contacted to initiate accidental discovery
procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
