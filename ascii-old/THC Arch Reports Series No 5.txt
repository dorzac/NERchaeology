ABSTRACT
Eighty­eight undisturbed and unmarked grave
shafts and 20 disturbed graves, along with 102
early­ to mid­20th­century historic features, were
identified within the forgotten and built­over Old
Brownsville City Cemetery, called Campo Santo
Viejo (41CF194). The grave shaft features were
located within Cameron County–owned public
property of Block 144 of the original townsite,
across from the Cameron County Courthouse
(Oscar C. Dancy Building), in the heart of
downtown Brownsville, Texas. Texas Historical
Commission archeologists, with the assistance of
Anthony & Brown Consulting, conducted Phase I

testing investigations that included remote sensing
(magnetometer and subsurface interface radar),
followed by Phase II visual subsurface testing using
mechanical and hand scraping. The investigations
were conducted in July and August 2005 in
consultation with Cameron County Commissioners
Court officials. The site was designated a State
Archeological Landmark in April 2005. In January
2006 a county resolution (based in part on recom­
mendations by the THC) was adopted to preserve
the county­owned portions of the cemetery within
Block 144, where graves were present, by creating
a memorial park and erecting a historical marker.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the final results from an
archeological field assessment of identified grave
shaft remains from the Phase I and II testing
investigations of the newly discovered Old
Brownsville City Cemetery site, commonly called
Campo Santo Viejo (41CF194). The investigations
were conducted by Texas Historical Commission
(THC) archeologists in consultation with Cameron
County officials. The site is a ca. 1848–1900
cemetery that is located on publicly owned lots
of the original Townsite Block 144 in downtown
Brownsville, Texas. The site was originally slated
to be impacted by the development of parking
spaces and a utility annex building planned by
Cameron County during the restoration of the
Cameron County Courthouse (also known as the
Oscar C. Dancy Building). No visible evidence
had remained of the cemetery site until the county
discovered human remains while digging trenches
for the utility annex building in fall 2004. John
Keller, archeologist with Southern Archaeological
Consultants, was contracted along with physical
anthropologists to assess and complete an osteo­
logical analysis of the human remains within the
trench and backfill and to do further scraping
within the impacted area of Lots 10 and 11 of
Block 144. A report was completed in spring 2005
that included results showing densely packed grave
shafts and human remains within the small survey
area Keller examined. Keller completed a site
form, and the site received an official trinomial
designation, 41CF194.
On April 14, 2005, the cemetery site was
designated a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
However, to comply with preservation laws

regarding cemetery sites and for the county and
THC to be able to plan appropriately, the extent
of the graves and their spatial distribution within
the cemetery needed to be assessed. As part of the
Phase I testing investigations, THC archeologists
conducted a remote sensing survey using a magne­
tometer. In addition, David O. Brown of Anthony
& Brown Consulting conducted remote sensing
using a ground interface radar (SIR). Remote
sensing was carried out in July 2005 under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 3860. Although results
were positive for potential grave shafts, they
were too inconclusive to establish their extent
and spatial distribution within the publicly owned
portions of the cemetery site (Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9,
10 and the western half of Lot 11) within Block
144. Therefore, THC archeologists conducted the
second part of Phase II testing, which included
mechanical and hand scraping portions of the
seven publicly owned lots to evaluate visually
the extent of undisturbed burials present in the
cemetery. Fieldwork was carried out within a
three­week period, from August 8 to August 27,
2005.
This report documents the methodologies
and results of the investigations, which identified
210 cultural features, including 88 undisturbed
grave shaft features, 20 disturbed (probably previ­
ously exhumed) graves, and 102 historic and/or
modern cultural features within 9 backhoe trenches.
The study positively identified the presence of
grave shafts within Lots 2 and 3; on the eastern
portion of Lots 4 and 9; and the western portion
of Lot 10. The tested portions of Lots 7 and 8
and the western half of Lot 4 did not show any
xi

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page xii

evidence of having grave shafts. No human
remains or artifacts were collected. Cameron
County Commissioner’s Court officials and the
THC administration discussed these results, and

a resolution was passed to preserve the entire
cemetery within the publicly owned lots of Block
144 that contain the identified graves by creating
a memorial park and erecting a historical marker.

INTRODUCTION
His specific tasks were to:

In September 2004 human remains were encoun­
tered during a construction project on a utility
annex for the historic 1912 Oscar C. Dancy
Building in downtown Brownsville, Texas. The
Dancy Building, which is the Cameron County
Courthouse, has been vacant for several years.
It has been renovated for reuse by the county, in
part from a Preservation Trust Fund Grant awarded
by the THC. The annex was planned to house
HVAC and other utilities for the Dancy Building.
During the excavation of trenches for water,
electrical, and other utility lines for the annex
on an existing parking lot on Block 144 of the
Brownsville Original Townsite Subdivision, workers
at the site noticed human remains coming from
the backhoe trenches and stopped work. Since
the land for the annex was owned by Cameron
County, the discovery came under the jurisdiction
of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Work on the
utility trenches stopped to allow the situation to
be assessed further, and the Archeology Division
of the THC was contacted. A field visit by THC
staff on October 4, 2004, confirmed that human
remains had been encountered and that these were
most likely part of the 1848 Brownsville City
Cemetery, commonly referred to as Campo Santo
Viejo and shown on early Brownsville maps as
being located on Block 144.
Assessment by the THC resulted in the
recommendation to Cameron County officials
that an archeologist be hired to investigate the
damage to the cemetery and to recover human
remains and any associated artifacts from the back­
dirt piles. John Keller of Southern Archaeological
Consulting was hired to conduct the fieldwork.

1. Shovel shave and trowel scrape all the open
walls of the utility trench to expose the grave
shafts that might have been damaged by trenching;
2. Recover any additional remains uncovered
during the trench scraping;
3. Prepare measured profile drawings of all grave
shafts exposed in the trench;
4. Collect all human remains from the trench and
backdirt piles;
5. Have all human remains examined and docu­
mented by a qualified physical anthropologist;
6. Document any exposed grave shafts;
7. Have a physical anthropologist examine any
remains exposed;
8. Scrape away enough soil in the proposed
annex location to expose any other grave shafts
that might be present;
9. Map all of the burials and the trench with a
Total Data Station; and
10. Prepare a report on the fieldwork.
The fieldwork was conducted by Keller and
a field crew from October through December
of 2004. This work identified 57 features and
discovered 24 previously unknown and undisturbed
burial shafts. In addition, the work recorded 8
disturbed burials in the utility trench and identified
the remains of 19 individuals from the soil removed
during the original utility trench construction.
Additional stripping was undertaken to find other
burials in the area, but this work was terminated
shortly thereafter. County officials wanted to
consult with the THC before any additional
archeological activity was conducted. A report of
1

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 2

remote sensing to see if graves could be detected.
Two techniques were used: magnetometry and
ground interface radar (SIR). Both techniques are
reported elsewhere in this paper, and both were
inconclusive for the prediction of burials. The site
contains too much magnetic clutter to allow the
magnetometer to locate anomalies that could
convincingly be termed graves. The SIR did some­
what better, but an objective view of the data shows
that, it, too, was unable to precisely estimate either
the number or the extent of the graves. This view,
as readers will see, is somewhat at odds with the
conclusion reached by the authors of the SIR section
of this report. The fact remains that the SIR work
was too inconclusive for the field archeologists
to use to determine answers to the two major
questions: the number of graves and their spatial
distribution. In reviewing the results of the SIR
work again for this publication, we remained
convinced of our conclusion. But we do provide
the authors’ own conclusion on their SIR study.
One point of clarification is needed: The authors
note that at some locations, the SIR picked up
graves that were not seen during the mechanical
scraping. While this may be true in a few cases in
between identified graves, in areas where burials
were not present, there are not burials deeper in
the soil that were undetected by the scraping
activity. We know this because in these areas the
depth of the scraping extended to a depth that
any burial, if present, would have been exposed.
Since the remote sensing effort did not provide
the needed precise information about the graves
present at Campo Santo Viejo, the decision was
made for the THC to conduct additional fieldwork
to scrape the upper 20 to 30 cm of soil from the
site and to identify grave shafts through visual
inspection. This technique has been used exten­
sively in archeology to find graves, and nearly
always the process of removing the topsoil from
a site will show the outline of the shaft dug for
the placement of a coffin. This work was begun
in August 2005 and took three weeks to complete.

the findings was submitted by Keller (2005) in
the spring of 2005 to fulfill the terms of Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 3586. In addition, Keller
filed a State of Texas Archeological Data Site
Form and received an official trinomial number,
41CF194, for the Campo Santo Viejo cemetery
site. Based on Keller’s 2005 findings and
recommendations of the THC, the site received
a State Archeological Landmark designation on
April 14, 2005.
The occurrence of many graves in the area
impacted by the utility trench resulted in discussions
between the THC and Cameron County officials
on the best use of the publicly owned portions of
Block 144, specifically Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10,
and the western half of Lot 11. Other lots on
Block 144 are privately owned, are not currently
being impacted, and therefore are not under
consideration in this report. Some of these lots
almost certainly have human graves present on
them as well.
The original plan, prior to the discovery of the
human remains, was for a utility annex and parking
lot for the Dancy Building to be constructed on
portions of Block 144. Obviously, the presence of
human burials meant that construction over the
graveyard was not possible. Either the graves had
to be identified and removed or another location
for the utility annex and the parking lot would need
to be found. The time frame for building the annex
was such that it was moved to the northwest corner
of the block occupied by the Dancy Building.
However, Cameron County officials felt that the
publicly owned portions of county­owned lots
were critically needed for parking, and additional
space was not readily available for substitution.
However, before plans for a parking lot could
move forward, the number and extent of the
graves needed to be determined.
Consequently, the THC Archeology Division
began a testing program at the cemetery under the
co­direction of Jim Bruseth and Maureen Brown
(Principal Investigator). The first phase involved
2

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 3

Trenches about 3 m wide were placed over much
of Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and the western half of
Lot 10. In addition, a larger area was scraped over
the upper half of Lots 2, 3, and 4 to identify all
grave shafts in this area.
The 2005 scraping activity, in conjunction with
Keller’s 2004 work, was successful in identifying
the extent of the graves in the county­owned

proposed parking lots areas. The study positively
identified the presence of grave shafts within Lots
2 and 3; on the eastern portion of Lots 4 and 9; and
the western portion of Lot 10. The tested portions
of Lots 7 and 8 and the western half of Lot 4 did
not show any evidence of having grave shafts.
The fieldwork also allowed THC archeologists
to estimate a total of 300 to 350 interments.

SITE DESCRIPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Figure 1. Location of the city block (144) that contains the
remains of the Campo Santo Viejo Cemetery. USGS East
Brownsville (TX) Topo.

The Campo Santo Viejo Cemetery site, designated
as 41CF194, is located in the downtown area of
the city of Brownsville, in Cameron County, Texas
(Figure 1). Brownsville is across the Rio Grande
from the Mexican border city of Matamoros,
Tamaulipas, at the southernmost tip of Texas. The
city is located at the southern terminus of U.S.
Highways 77 and 83 and the Missouri Pacific and
Southern Pacific Railroads, and it is a major port
of entry into Mexico (Handbook of Texas Online
2008). The site is less than 2,000 feet from (and
approximately seven city blocks northeast of) the
present Rio Grande and is completely within the
floodplain of the river (Keller 2005:3).
Campo Santo Viejo is located just north of the
Oscar C. Dancy Building within city Block 144.
Block 144 is bounded on the east and west between
11th and 12th Streets and on the north and south
by East Jackson and East Monroe Streets. Within
the publicly owned portions of Block 144, owned
by Cameron County, the site lies within Lots 2, 3,

4, 9, and 10 (Figures 2 and 3). However, there
exists the probability that the cemetery extends
into the private properties within Block 144, which
is outside the scope of this project. It is transected
in an east­west direction by a central alleyway. As
Keller (2005:3) mentioned, clusters of historically
significant structures are extant in the immediate
vicinity, including the Oscar C. Dancy Building,
the Laiseca hardware building, the Field/Pacheco
complex, and the Iglesia Luterana El Calvario
(Mexican Lutheran Church). Besides the alleyway,
additional disturbances overlaying the cemetery
include a septic lift station building, two domestic
structures and previously demolished domestic
structures north of the alleyway, and previous
commercial structures and an asphalt parking lot
in the southern portions of Block 144.
Cameron County is on a flat plain that slopes
gently to the northeast. The greater part of the

and moderately well­drained silty loams and silty
clays. The site is within the Rio Grande­Urban
land complex (RU). The Rio Grande­Urban complex
is in the built­up areas of cities and towns. The
entire acreage is in Brownsville. The Rio Grande
soil has a surface layer of light gray calcareous silty
loam about 9 inches thick. The underlying material,
reaching to a depth of about 63 inches, is light
gray and very pale brown stratified silty loam and
very fine sandy loam. Even with the development
of single­unit dwellings and industrial buildings,
streets and paved parking lots in downtown
Brownsville, only minor alterations to the Rio
Grande soils have taken place. This complex
supports large mesquite, hackberry, ash, and ebony
trees. The high alkalinity and high lime content
of the soil material has caused concern about how
to manage urban development due to the possible
corrosive effects to pipelines and steel and chlorosis
of some plants (Soil Survey of Cameron County
1997:30).
Block 144 has a few trees, all of which are
probably less than 100 years old, including a
Mexican or Rio Grande ash (Fraxinus berlandier­
ana), a large live oak (Quercus virginiana), and
several recent fruit trees associated with domestic
occupations. Established cemeteries, by contrast,
often have large numbers of mature trees (Keller
2005:3).

Campo Santo Viejo site, is an alluvial plain or delta

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Town Company and began laying out and selling
lots in the new town they called Brownsville.
Merchants on both sides of the border quickly
recognized the advantage of shipping goods to
Brownsville, and as a result of the flourishing
commerce, numerous stores sprang up along
the riverfront.
The original 1848 Brownsville Townsite
consisted of 308 squares or blocks of property, each
300x260 ft, to be subdivided into 12 individually
numbered lots (50x120 ft, with a 20­ft alleyway)
(Brownsville original Townsite subdivision, Map
Records of Cameron County Vol. 5:3, in Keller
2005:6, and Fernandez 2005:1). In January 1849,
Brownsville became the seat of the new Cameron
County, and a post office, public buildings, and a
city cemetery (called Campo Santo) were added.
The town grew rapidly that year, mainly from an
influx of refugees from Matamoros and Forty­
Niners taking the Gila route to the goldfields of
California. A cholera epidemic in the spring of
1849 reportedly killed nearly 2,000 people, about
half the population.

A brief history of Brownsville and Campo Santo
Viejo Cemetery is presented in this section. For
more extensive historical background and archival
research, see “El Viejo Campo Santo (1851–1870)”
by Eugene Fernandez, executive director of the
Friends of the Brownsville Historic City Cemetery
(Fernandez 2005), and John Keller’s (2005) site
report on the 2004 investigations.

Early Settlement
Although the Brownsville area was explored as early
as the seventeenth century, the first settlers did not
arrive until the latter part of the eighteenth century,
when the community of San Juan de los Esteros
(present­day Matamoros) was established across the
Rio Grande in 1765. In 1781 Spanish authorities
granted 59 leagues of land on the northern bank
of the river, including Brownsville, to Jose Salvador
de la Garza. Before 1846, when United States
troops under General Zachary Taylor arrived, only
a small settlement consisting mainly of herder and
farmer huts from Matamoros was in the area.
During the Mexican­American War in 1846,
Taylor’s forces began construction of a fort near
the settlement, later named Fort Brown in honor
of Major Jacob Brown, who died during a Mexican
attack on the stronghold. Richard King, Mifflin
Kenedy, and Charles Stillman had set up a transport
company during the war to haul American troops
and supplies up the river (Handbook of Texas
Online 2008a). In 1848, after the war, the Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the area as part
of the state of Texas. During the same year, Charles
Stillman purchased a large part of the Garza grant,
He and his associates formed the Brownsville

Brownsville Burial Grounds
Brownsville’s first cemeteries were the 1846 “Old
Post Cemetery” and 1847 “New Post Cemetery”
(Fernandez 2005:16). When the original Brownsville
Townsite was established in 1848, one complete
block was appropriated for a municipal burial
ground, later known as Campo Santo Viejo. It
was initially on the northeastern outskirts of town,
clustered in thicket and cactus, at the juncture of
the road to Point Isabel (now Port Isabel) and
Brazos St. Jago.
7

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 8

By 1850, just two years after the townsite was
officially established, Brownsville town leaders
wanted to move the city cemetery to a new location
due to vandalism, the surge in growth and devel­
opment, the derelict condition of the cemetery,
and the concern over its size limitation (especially
in the wake of the epidemic and population
increases). By 1851 town planners had found a
new site: two contiguous parcels (Blocks 128 and
129) located seven blocks to the west, on the bank
of the Resaca de las Hornellas, at what is now the
Corpus Christi Bridge (Fernandez 2005:2).
Due to many factors—including a slowing of
the population growth, bandit raids in the 1850s,
the yellow fever epidemic of 1858, and the Civil
War—it was not until 1863 that a mandate was
issued to close the old cemetery. After a major
transfer of graves in 1863, the city claimed in 1864
that formal measures had been taken to declare
the old site abandoned, although there is no
formal record of this activity, and burials probably
continued at both sites (Keller 2005:8). It was not
until January 1870 that the new grounds were
formally leveled and graded, the first mention of
the purchase of a cemetery plot occurred, and
631 trees were planted (Brownsville, City Board
of Aldermen Minutes, April 11, 1870, p. 210, in
Fernandez 2005:4; Keller 2005:8).
On March 22, 1870, a resolution was entered
into the council records that clearly mandated
decommissioning of the old city burial grounds.
An eight­month public notice was published in
the local newspaper giving notice that family and
friends should take steps to transfer the remains
of loved ones to the new site by December 1870.
After that time “all remains then not removed will
be disinterred by the city and taken to the new city
cemetery” (Brownsville, City Board of Aldermen
Minutes, March 22, 1870, p. 156, and May 12,
1870, p. 219; Fernandez 2005:5; Keller 2005:8).
After 1870 the majority of residents adopted the
new site for their burial ground, as evidenced
by many elaborate above­ground 19th­century

mortuary monuments and tombs of wealthy
Brownsville residents as well as provisions for a
pauper’s field at the new facility (Fernandez
2005:5; Keller 2005:8). However, perhaps due
to strong folk ties, clandestine burying, or the
five­dollar fee at the new site, there is evidence
that some of the city’s dead continued to be
buried at the old cemetery site, which was already
known as Campo Santo Viejo, at least until the
1880s and perhaps as late as 1910. The final
reference to any sanctioned mass transfer of
remains occurred just before the opening of the
new Cameron County Courthouse in 1912. At
this point, the city would have had an interest in
improving the real estate surroundings (Fernandez
2005:5–6; Keller 2005:8).
In summary, the Campo Santo Viejo site was
used as a cemetery intermittently between 1848
and 1910. Transfers or interments were made from
the old Campo Santo to the new cemetery starting
in 1852. Fernandez (2005:6) notes, however, that
the recordkeeping methods during this period
were not consistent or reliable. He found in the
city records between 1849 and 1870 evidence of
39 individuals listed as the “earliest recorded
graves now located at the new city cemetery
deceased prior to the mandate to decommission
the old cemetery” and 54 burials recorded at the
Campo Santo Viejo site between 1870 to 1880
(Fernandez 2005:10–12, 14–15).

The old and new city and military post ceme­
teries were not the only burial grounds in the
Brownsville Townsite area. Fernandez (2005:16)
provides a chronological listing of the various
cemeteries that served the local population, from
the town’s beginning to modern times (Table 1).

20th­Century Structural Development
of Block 144
By 1900 the old cemetery had apparently been
“officially” forgotten and the property was begin­
ning to be put to other uses. Block 144 reverted
to the ownership of the New York and Brownsville
Improvement Company. The first sale of Block
144 lots began in 1904 with the sale of Lots 1 and
2 to Wilebaldo Cantu. Cantu built several framed
houses that he and his family lived in for many
years (Keller 2005:10) (Figure 4). From 1905 to
1908, Meliton Cross purchased Lots 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, and 9, where he built a thriving complex
that consisted of a lumber, hide, and bone yard
and a hardware company (Figure 5). In 1924
Cross sold his interests to the Eagle Pass Lumber
Company, which continued to operate in the same
capacity as a thriving lumberyard until 1943
(Figure 6).

The remaining lots (10, 11, and 12) of Block
144 were purchased in 1905 by Adolfo Garza
and Company (El Globe Grande), who built and
operated a grocery on the southeast corner. In
1943, half of Lot 11 and all of Lot 12 were sold
to the Texas District Evangelical Lutheran Synod,
who built the Mexican Lutheran Church; they
remain the owners today (Fernandez 2005:18).

The Cameron County Courthouse (the Oscar C.
Dancy Building) was constructed in 1912 within
Block 121, directly across the street and south of
Block 144. Beginning in 1943, the northern lots
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) were purchased for residential
use by individual Mexican American families from
the Eagle Pass Lumber Company (Fernandez 2005:
19). In addition, from 1943 to 1963 the Grand
Lodge of Order of Herman and Brownsville
Building Corp. owned the southwestern lots (7, 8,
9, and half of Lot 10). In 1963 Cameron County
purchased these lots for use as a parking lot. In
1973, the remaining half of Lot 10 and half of Lot

11 were also purchased for parking lot use by the
county (Fernandez 2005:18).
During the 2005 project, Lot 1 contained a
vacant building owned by the Mexican Lutheran
Church. Lots 2, 3, and 4 were publicly owned
vacant grassy lots with several standing trees.
Lots 5 and 6 contained several private residential
dwellings. These northern lots were bisected east­
west by an alleyway. Lots 7, 8, 9, 10, and half of
Lot 11 were asphalt­paved and semi­paved public
parking lots. Half of Lot 11 and Lot 12 contained
the privately owned Mexican Lutheran Chuch,
which held services regularly.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Drs. Thomas Pozorski and Shelia Pozorski of
the University of Texas–Pan American were
engaged as consultants to analyze and report on
the human skeletal material recovered during the
course of the 2004 project. The analysis included
an osteological inventory of remains (Appendix
I in Keller 2005) and a determination of the
minimum number of individuals (MNI) present
within the disturbed areas, as well as an assessment
of gender and age (Pozorski and Pozorski in Keller
2005). Results of the project determined that the
population represented by the recovered human
skeletal remains consisted of at least 9 adults, 4
young children, and 6 infants or fetuses, for a total
of 19 individuals. Researchers further identified at
least one adult female and 7 adult males between
the ages of 20 to 24 and 39 to 44 years; the
majority of the infants were between the ages of
0.5 and 1.5 years (Pozorski and Pozorski in Keller
2005). This assessment by age, which found
primarily young to middle­aged adults and very
young to young children, may reflect demographics
at the time when the cemetery was used, especially
the very high infant and young child mortality.
However, the large number of very young children,
some of whom may have been from miscarriages
or stillbirths, suggested that the cemetery may have
continued to be used informally as a burial site
for these remains (Pozorski and Pozorski in Keller
2005:3).
Hand­wrought and machine­cut coffin nails
were the most common artifacts recovered from
the burials. Artifacts identified as being intrusive
and unrelated to the burials included animal bones
(cow, chicken, pig, and rodent) and domestic

From October to December 2004, John Keller of
Southern Archaeological Consultants and a field
crew were contracted by Cameron County to
conduct fieldwork to investigate damages to the
previously forgotten and unrecorded Campo Santo
Viejo cemetery site and to recover human remains
and any associated artifacts from the backdirt piles
(Keller 2005). The project was prompted by the
encounter of human remains during the county’s
excavation of two utility trenches in a parking lot
within Block 144 that was associated with the
Cameron County Courthouse (Dancy Building)
Restoration Project. Other than archival research
and old maps, there was no previous indication
that Block 144 contained the ca. 1848–1900 Old
Brownsville City Cemetery site.
Keller and the field crew screened backdirt from
the two previously excavated county utility trenches
and mechanical and hand scraped an area approxi­
mately 50 by 75 ft where the previous proposed
utility building pad was to be located. They shovel­
shaved and trowel­scraped all the open walls of the
utility trenches to expose the grave shafts that
might have been damaged by trenching. In addition,
they recovered more remains uncovered during the
trench scraping; prepared measured profile draw­
ings of all grave shafts exposed in the trench; and
collected all human remains from the trenches
and backdirt piles. A complete examination and
documentation of human remains was conducted
by qualified physical anthropologists. Finally, Keller
and crew documented all exposed grave shafts and
features; mapped all the burials and trenches with
a Total Data Station; and prepared a final report
(Keller 2005).

cultural materials, such as window glass, bottle
glass, brick fragments, ceramics and metal, and
modern debris (such as plastics, corroded metal
fragments, and a 1972 nickel) (Keller 2005:16).
During the archeological investigations—which
included mechanical stripping of a 50x75­ft area
with a smooth backhoe bucket and the scraping of
walls and the bottom of the previously disturbed
utility trenches—researchers identified 57 features.
Twenty­four features were identified as previously
unknown and undisturbed grave shafts and/or
shallow graves, and 8 were disturbed grave shafts
(or possible exhumations) (Keller 2005:Figure 2).
At a depth of approximately 46 cm (18 in) below
the present surface, the rectangular stains of
apparent grave shafts were almost immediately
apparent. Keller (2005:17) stated that the stains
were almost textbook in their clarity—straight­
sided, with sharp corners and differing from the
surrounding matrix in both color and texture.
The corners or outlines of each feature were
marked with pin flags. This provided the Total
Data Station operators with reference points and
served to locate each feature before the soil dried
out and the visual aspect of the features began to
fade. The majority of the grave shaft features were
quite regular and rectilinear in appearance, but
some appeared highly irregular or even globular.
The latter were believed to be exhumations.
The majority of the interments were aligned
perpendicular to the street and appeared regularly
spaced and in accordance with a somewhat
planned cemetery. Most grave shafts were aligned
in the traditional way, toward the rising sun, so
that the deceased could be buried “facing
Jerusalem” in accordance with religious custom.
Thus what appeared to be north­south alignment
was actually more east­northeast to west­south­
west. Keller (2005:20) and Fernandez (2005)
suggested the apparent plan that emerged was
one of two generally parallel rows of grave shafts,
an 8­ to 10­ft­wide carriageway, and then another
two rows of grave shafts. However, the 2004

excavations revealed that not all the features were
laid out according to this plan. Several were
“misaligned” at an angle, or cut into or overlapped
other grave shafts and thus were believed to be
later, less carefully placed or clandestine interments
made after the legal abandonment of Campo
Santo Viejo.
In addition to the nondisturbed and disturbed
grave shaft features associated with the Campo
Santo Viejo cemetery site, several historic features
and artifacts relating to the overlying 20th­century
residential dwelling (ca. 1930) were discovered.
These included a burned area with a brick base,
several trash pits, a gas line trench, post molds,
and a massive roughly circular disturbance centered
on an apparent well (Keller 2005:18–27). Domestic
artifacts exposed within the features included
window glass, bottle glass, domestic ceramics,
brick, metal fragments, and plastic.
Each feature was exposed to investigate
its character and extent and then marked,
photographed, and digitally mapped using a
Total Data Station but was not further disturbed.
This procedure met all contract requirements,
limited disturbance to the site, and allowed county
officials and the Texas Historical Commission to
determine proper management (Keller 2005:18).
Final procedures included plans for reburial of
the human remains as set forth by Cameron County
and the Texas Historical Commission. The plan
was adopted to ensure proper treatment of the
collected remains, allowing the same environmental
conditions to operate on the collected materials
as on the undisturbed remains in the rest of the
cemetery, and to enable future researchers to
isolate and precisely locate the remains collected
during the 2004 investigations. The utility trenches
were lined with commercial landscape fabric,
which was chosen for its durability, permeability,
and protective qualities. Once the fabric was
installed, the entire area was backfilled using the
soil collected during the stripping and screening
process. Three metal fence posts were installed at
12

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 13

the northeastern corner of the backfilled utility
trench. Final plans stipulated procedures for reburial
to take place after the 2004 phase of investigations.
When the human remains and other collected
materials were ready for reburial, a one­meter­

square area was excavated in the above­marked
location, and the material was placed within and
then backfilled (Keller 2005:33). A report on the
findings was submitted by Keller (2005) to fulfill
the term of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3586.

2005 ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING INVESTIGATIONS
The discovery of many graves during the 2004
investigations of Campo Santo Viejo Cemetery site
(41CF194) resulted in further discussion between
the THC and Cameron County officials on how to
proceed with the courthouse restoration project.
The presence of human burials meant that either
the graves had to be identified and removed or
another location would need to be found for the
utility annex and the parking lot. The time frame
for building the annex was such that it was moved
to the northwest corner of the block occupied by
the Dancy Building. However, before plans for a
parking lot could move forward, the number and
extent of the graves needed to be determined.
The THC Archeology Division initiated testing
investigations at the site under the co­direction
of Jim Bruseth and Maureen Brown (Principal
Investigator). Prior to beginning the work, THC
archeologists prepared a scope of work and
submitted an application for a Texas Antiquities
Permit. During the first phase, the archeologists
conducted remote sensing investigations to see if
graves could be detected. Two techniques were
used: magnetometry and ground interface radar
(SIR). However, because the remote sensing results
were inconclusive in determining precise informa­
tion needed about the number of graves and their
spatial distribution, the decision was made for the
THC to conduct a second phase of testing, which
involved additional fieldwork to mechanically and
hand scrape the upper 20 to 30 cm of soil from
the site and to identify grave shafts through visual
inspection. The original antiquities permit was
amended to include this Phase II testing in August
2005. This technique has been used extensively in

archeology to find graves, and nearly always the
process of removing the topsoil from a site will
show the outline of the shaft dug for the place­
ment of a coffin. The field methodology and
results of the testing are described below.

Archeological Testing Phase I:
Magnetometer Survey
by Jim Bruseth
In July 2005, THC archeologists under the
direction of Jim Bruseth conducted a magnetometer
survey over the publicly owned lots of Block 144
(Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and the western half of
Lot 11; Figure 7). The purpose of the survey was
to look for any evidence of graves that were part
of the Campo Santo Viejo cemetery. The survey
was conducted with a hand­pulled aluminum cart
holding two Geometrics cesium sensors. The sensors
were mounted on the axle of the cart and spaced
50 cm apart and 25 cm above the ground. The
cart was pulled by an operator carrying a
Geometrics G­858 data­logger console attached
by cable to the sensors on the cart (Figure 8).
This resulted in two rows of readings 50 cm apart,
collected at 10­cm intervals, for a density of about
20 readings per square meter.
The area to be surveyed was laid out in a
north­south/east­west grid of 10­m quadrants, and
the overall grid size was entered into the console
attached to the cart. Magnetic data were then
collected by pulling the cart along the north axis
of the grid. Plastic traffic cones were placed at
10­m intervals along the survey transects to serve
15

as fiducial marks, or known points on the grid to
track the position of the magnetometer. To record
when the sensors crossed a known grid point, a
small plastic flapper was placed on the cart axle.
It flapped when it encountered a cone, providing
a visual and auditory marker for the operator,
who registered the point on a switch connected
to the console.
The base station was placed away from the site
area so it would not be affected by intrusive sources
of magnetism such as passing cars or the movements

of people. The console was set to the “base station”
mode and continuously collected data for eventual
downloading and diurnal correction of the moving
sensors’ data.
The data collected by the mobile magnetometer
and the base station were downloaded using
Geometrics Magmap 2000, Version 4. This
program retrieves the data from the consoles
and allows processing to remove dropouts,
eliminate value spikes, and make corrections for
diurnal fluctuations in the earth’s magnetic field.

found. There is simply too much magnetic clutter
obscuring fainter anomalies.
The second area for discussion is the survey
over Lots 7 and 8. These lots had been used as a
parking lot, and a layer of asphalt covered them.
Numerous small dipole anomalies are seen in the
magnetic survey map over these lots. There is a
general tendency for all of the anomalies to be
smaller and less intense—a phenomenon largely
due to the covering of asphalt, which diminishes
the magnetic intensity of the ferrous artifacts. The
larger anomaly seen on the western edge of Lot 7
is from a metal signpost located just off the map
near 11th Street.
The final area surveyed was over Lots 9,
10, and 11. This is the area where graves had
been previously encountered by workers during
construction of the annex and during 2004
archeological testing (Keller 2005). The magnetic
survey for this area showed fewer anomalies but
higher magnetic readings, indicating the presence
of large pieces of ferrous materials. A linear
anomaly is seen in the lower half of Lot 9 and
runs diagonally from southwest to northeast.
This turned out to be a pipe from a utility line

The program also contains a destripping algorithm
to remove heading errors potentially introduced
with bidirectional surveys.
After processing in Magmap 2000, the magnetic
data were exported into Surfer, Version 8, for
contouring into a two­dimensional spatial map
(Golden Software, Inc. 2003). A Kriging gridding
algorithm was employed, and the final map was
produced using the shaded relief map options.
These map options were selected instead of a
line­contour or color map because the human eye
can more readily observe subtle changes in shades
of gray than in multitudes of contour lines or
highly varying colors.
Figure 7 shows the results of the magnetometer
survey. The survey can be divided into three areas
for discussion. The first area is on Lots 2, 3, and 4.
Here several very irregular anomalies can be seen
trending generally north­south. They represent
debris from houses that were extant on these lots
in the 20th century. Some of the anomalies are
caused by underground pipelines that brought gas
and water to the houses. However, because of the
large quantity of post­cemetery debris found across
Lots 2, 3, and 4, no evidence of graves could be

have been useful in the location of buried cultural
features in far West Texas (Brown 1992; Brown
and Frederick 1994; Brown et al. 2000; Brown
and Willis 2004; Driver and Brown 1994) as well
as East Texas (Brown 1998, 1999; Brown and
Anthony 1998; Brown et al. 1997; Galan et al.
1999). SIR investigations have also been successful
in studies of cemeteries of various ages in a variety
of settings (Goodman and Nishimura 1993; Mellett
and Geismar 1990; Persons 1990), including the
Rio Grande Valley near El Paso (Driver and Brown
1994; Willis 2002), the Hill Country near Kerrville
(Brown 1993; Brown and Driver 1993), and in
East Texas. Many of these studies have shown
remarkable successes in high clay content soils
such as are likely to be present in the Brownsville
area. A recent study with a similar configuration in
the Beaumont Clay soils of the Houston area (Brown
and Anthony 2005) failed to locate burials (the
absence of which was verified by later trenching)
but did record a number of anomalies in this soil.
The Brownsville Campo Santo Viejo radar
study used an SIR­3000 system manufactured by
Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI). Two
antennas, with center frequencies of 270 MHz and
400 MHz, were brought along for the investiga­
tions. Initial testing suggested that the 400 MHz
antenna would be more useful in the Campo Santo
Viejo study because of the higher resolution and a
cart configuration that worked better with the
somewhat rough surface of the study area. The
400 MHz antenna is capable of moderate to fine
resolution down to about a foot or less, with a
maximum effective range of more than 10 ft under
ideal conditions. All of the recorded runs were
undertaken with this 400 MHz antenna.
SIR is an active electromagnetic prospection
system that transmits a low­frequency electromag­
netic signal from an antenna located near the
ground surface. As subsurface materials of differing
electric potential are encountered, the original
transmitted signal may be absorbed or reflected
back toward the antenna. These returning signals

that once connected to a house on the lot. The
magnetic survey of this area did not conclusively
locate graves, and the results are largely due
once again to the presence of large quantities of
magnetic clutter over the lots.
Overall, the magnetometer survey of the
publicly owned lots on Block 144 did provide
an accurate picture of magnetic anomalies in the
soil. However, the site has been heavily modified
by later residential and commercial activities,
and these occupations have left enough debris—
magnetic clutter—to mask the more subtle magnetic
signatures of individual graves.

Archeological Testing Phase I:
Subsurface Interface Radar (SIR) Survey
by David O. Brown and Dana Anthony
At the request of the THC, a subsurface interface
radar (SIR) investigation was conducted in select
areas of the block of land north of the courthouse
in downtown Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.
David Brown conducted the study on July 26 and
27, 2005. The purpose of the remote sensing was
to help identify and verify the extent of the historic
cemetery, part of which was unearthed during
utility construction. The study was undertaken
in tandem with magnetometer investigations that
were being conducted by the THC at the same
time. The radar investigations were conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3860 obtained
by the Texas Historical Commission.
Ground­penetrating radar investigations have
been used in prospection at archeological sites
around the world, with investigations of both
historic and prehistoric sites yielding productive
results (Conyers and Goodman 1997; Heimmer
1992; Vaughan 1986). Because of radar’s ability to
locate buried features such as walls, foundations,
and pits, it has been particularly successful in
historical archaeology and the study of prehistoric
structural remains. In Texas, SIR investigations
18

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 19

are registered by a receiving antenna located
beside the transmitter. A virtual subsurface profile
that records differential electrical potential is
constructed by this register of the reflected waves,
with rapidly returning waves logged first and later
returns logged after these in the data set for each
run. The image of returning waves, visible on the
built­in computer screen of the SIR­3000, can be
varied by a series of controls and filters that affect
the processing of the signal as well as its presenta­
tion. The soil depth represented by the image is
controlled by varying the cutoff of return times of
the waves in nanoseconds (billionths of a second).
The return times are dependent upon the
velocity of the electromagnetic waves through the
subsurface material. Since velocities can vary
dramatically for different soil materials (and for
the same material under different conditions of
moisture), the return time in nanoseconds could
represent very different depths, and it is up to the
operator to estimate the electrical potential of the
sediments being investigated (short of actually
testing the electromagnetic potential of the sedi­
ments in a laboratory). The conductivity of a
particular material is described as its dielectric
potential and is occasionally expressed in two­way
slowness values (i.e., the travel time down and
back in certain materials per a given distance
unit such as a meter). Sample values listed in SIR
operation manuals (Geophysical Survey Systems,
Inc. 1994:22–23) range from 2 nanoseconds to
travel a foot and back in air to 18 nanoseconds
round­trip in a foot of water, which is one of the
slower materials. The sandy loam surface soils,
reported in the Campo Santo Viejo area by Keller
(2005), have return­trip values that range from
13 nanoseconds per foot in dry conditions to
25.5 nanoseconds per foot in wet conditions.
The underlying clays are for all practical purposes
impenetrable by the radar.
At best, these values represent ideal conditions.
Moisture content, for example, can drastically
alter the values. Also, while small amounts of

moisture can enhance differences between
reflective surfaces, saturation can mask targets
and surfaces (Conyers 2004). The degree of soil
structure, soil cracking, gravel and caliche horizons
can also alter theoretical travel times. While sandy
soils are generally the best medium for radar
investigations (Brown 1992; Brown and Frederick
1994), good results are possible under certain
conditions in areas with clayey and caliche­rich
soils (Brown 1993, 1998, 1999; Brown and Driver
1994). Metals, salt water, and other excellent
electrical conductors absorb the waves and thus
it is generally impossible to identify anomalies
within or below these materials.

Methods
Ultimately, Block 144, where the cemetery is
located, was covered with later construction,
some of which has by now been removed. Of the
12 lots platted on the block, the greater part of
five lots is open on the south half of the block,
leaving only the area of the Lutheran Church
building at the southeast corner and a small utility
substation at the rear of that. Only three lots—
Lots 2, 3, and 4—are open on the north half. The
open area on the south half of the block, largely
covered with asphalt pavement (except where
excavated by Keller in 2004), is about .9 acres,
while the smaller area on the north half, a grassy
open area with a handful of small trees, is about
.4 acres. The 20­ft­wide alley, also thought to
possibly contain burials, is 20 ft wide and 300 ft
long, an area of just over .1 acre. Overall, there
were a bit less than 1.5 acres of open land on the
block at the time of the investigations.
As expected, an extant asphalt parking lot on
the south half of the block presented only minor
difficulties in penetration by the radar; GPR is
routinely used to test the thickness of asphalt layers
in highways (Maser et al. 2003; Rhazi et al. 2003).
Unfortunately, the surface of the east half, roughly
Lots 9, 10, and 11, was still partly covered with
debris from Keller’s 2004 trenching. Patches of
19

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 20

144 cemetery, Keller’s (2005) maps show that
most but not all of the burials are laid out in a
north­south orientation relative to the arbitrary
grid north (that is, they are actually laid out
southwest­northeast), making grid east­west runs
the best for radar recognition. Unfortunately,
because of the fence and asphalt bumpers, as
well as the remains of Keller’s 2004 trenches,
east­west traverses were extremely limited.
Instead, the
primary runs on the south half
of the block were north­south, with one area of
overlapping east­west runs along the south edge
of the block.
The THC metric grid was laid out relative
to the lines of the block with its origin at the
southwest (actual west) corner of the block. All
of the radar runs were undertaken on this grid
using a calibrated survey wheel to maximize
locational accuracy.
Radar runs were undertaken in four areas,
three on the south half of the block and one on
the north half. For convenience, these are simply
designated as Areas I, II, III, and IV (Figure 9).
Area I was a north­south area crossing portions
of Lots 9 and 10. Two different overlapping sets
of runs were undertaken in this area, each with
different time and gain setting to maximize
information return. These overlapping sets are
designated as Ia and Ib. Area II was an east­west
sample area located across portions of Lots 2, 3,
and 4 on the north half of the block. Area III was
a north­south sample tract located to the west of
the temporary construction fence traversing portions
of Lot 8. Finally, Area IV encompassed the series
of east­west runs at the extreme southern edge of
the block, crossing most of Lots 9, 10 and 11.
The results of the runs are described below.
Overall, 129 radar runs were completed in the
various areas. This included 79 north­south runs
undertaken in Area I, located primarily on Lot 9
and extending onto Lot 10; 10 east­west runs in
Area II on the north side of the alley; 16 north­
south runs in Area III on Lot 8; and 24 east­west

earth and loose gravel made the surface generally
rough over much of the area, leading to very noisy
runs and some difficulty in recognizing genuine
subsurface anomalies. Likewise, Keller’s 2004
trenches were backfilled but the surface had not
been smoothed, and the extremely rough surface
made passage of the radar a challenge and the
subsequent data extremely difficult to interpret.
With a broad east­west trench (the block and this
part of the city was laid out at a 45­degree angle
to the north, and the trench actually runs north­
west­southeast, but for the purposes of the investi­
gations, the numbered streets were considered to
run north­south, and the grid directions were
established as such) cutting across parts of Lots 9
and 10, and a cyclone construction fence running
along the approximate boundary between Lots 8
and 9, it was difficult to initiate long runs in either
cardinal grid direction. Several linear asphalt humps
ran north­south through the entire parking lot,
making long east­west runs even more difficult.
On the north side of the block, the grassy area
of Lots 2, 3, and 4 had an uneven surface with just
enough trees to make consistent parallel long runs
difficult. This area was covered by considerable
trash as well (the magnetometer investigations
noted iron objects on the surface or shallowly
buried), and the remains of utility pipes were visible
in areas. It is likely that the foundations of houses
previously removed from this area were still
extant, although they were almost certainly pier
foundations and perhaps not a major obstacle to
remote sensing.
Because of the numerous obstacles to long,
continuous runs, which would have been faster
and more accurate, the radar investigations were
undertaken in several smaller segments. These
segments were limited by the fences, humps, and
other various obstacles in what should have other­
wise been an ideal area to traverse. In many, if not
most, historic cemeteries, burials are laid out in an
east­west orientation, and the best angle for the
radar traverses is north­south. In the skewed Block

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 22

runs on Lots 9, 10, and 11 along the south edge
of the block. All of the runs were spaced at 50­cm
intervals except those in Area III, which were
undertaken at 1­m intervals (with a three­meter
gap where several trees impeded continuous
coverage). Data on these runs are presented in
Table A.1.
The runs were conducted at various settings.
As noted above, depth is a function of the time
allowed for the registration of returning waves, as
measured in nanoseconds. The Campo Santo Viejo
runs were undertaken at various time settings from
30 to 70 nanoseconds; the majority were set at 50
nanoseconds, which should sample an area between
about 2 and 5 m depth, depending on the dielectric
potential of the subsurface matrix. Without a
determination of this potential for the actual soils
onsite, and without a test target of known depth,
it is frequently necessary to overestimate the
dielectric potential to be sure that the suspected
targets are included. Additionally, the recognition
of features can be difficult if the target features
are at the bottom of the sample area; GSSI
recommends a study depth of about 1.5 times
the primary target depth.
With one exception, the other parameters were
standard ones for the 400 MHz antenna. The
exception was scans per meter, which varied from
40 scans per meter for the first set of runs in Area
I to 60 scans per meter across the rest of the sets
of runs. A higher number of scans per meter
increases the resolution of the profile image but
also slows down the speed at which the antenna is
dragged. A single test run was conducted at 100
scans per meter, but it was determined that this
unacceptably slowed the speed of data acquisition
and thus it was not used for further runs.
Distances were measured with a GSSI survey
wheel that was recalibrated each time the cart
was broken down and reassembled. A total of 512
samples were taken at each scan.
Upon return from the field, the raw data were
examined visually using various programs available

from GSSI, including RADPRINT, RADVIEW, and
RADAN 5.0. The data from the various runs were
manipulated within RADAN, using various filters
and transformations to examine the patterns and
clean up the data. Profiles were also output from
RAD2BMP, which creates a Windows Bitmap file
from the proprietary DZT format. These BMP
files were examined in Adobe Photoshop and
anomalies marked with guides. The guide locations
were later converted to grid coordinates and the
anomalies assembled into a master table, a simplified
version of which is presented as Table A.2.
The radar data were collected with three­
dimensional analysis in mind, and three­dimensional
sets were created for each of the study areas. Slices
of these sets were then examined to determine any
spatial patterning that might be present. Several of
these slices are presented as figures in the following
pages. Perhaps due to somewhat noisy data, these
slices show little cohesive patterning and are less
effective in revealing potential grave anomalies
than the individual profiles. In an attempt to
further explore the possibility of three­dimensional
patterning, the radar data were processed through
the freeware program GPR PROCESS developed
by Larry Conyers and Jeffrey Lucius, and the
data were output into Golden Software’s SURFER
for plotting. While the resulting plots are visually
easier to interpret than those developed in the
proprietary RADAN software, it was clear that
these would not be sufficient to accurately
describe the layout of the graves. While it shows
some promise for future analyses, this process is
vastly more time­consuming than the proprietary
analytical tools.
The 129 runs at the Campo Santo Viejo site
recorded more than 1,450 anomalies, most of
which were minor and had no connection to burials.
The anomalies do include some definite burials,
however, mostly seen clearly along the south edge
of the block but present in several other areas as
well. Some anomalies may relate to architectural
features or associated residential utility trenches.
22

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 23

These are generally amorphous and shallower than
the burials, which are typically illustrated on the
radar chart as distinct, discrete dots or elliptical
masses often topped by circular reflections of a
different weight or color.

Results in Area I
Area I consisted of a series of north­south runs
across the asphalt­covered parking lot area on the
south side of the block and east of the temporary
cyclone fence surrounding the proposed construc­
tion area. This area was traversed twice at differ­
ent nanosecond settings. The first pass consisted of
51 runs at half­meter intervals between E50 and
E71.5 from N1 to N36 at 70 nanoseconds. Six of
these runs were duplicates or problematic and
were discarded from the set, yielding a sequence of
44 runs covering an area of 810 sq m (1,540 linear
meters). The second pass was undertaken later the
same day in two different sets, one with 11 runs
between E60 and E65 from N1 to N36 at 50
nanoseconds, and the other with 16 runs between
E65 and E72.5 from N1 to N36 at 30 nanoseconds.
Together these second­pass runs, also undertaken
at half­meter intervals, covered an area of 486 sq m
(910 linear meters). This second set was run to
examine portions of the known cemetery area
(as previously exposed in the east­west trench by
Keller that cut across this area) at a somewhat
higher resolution. Data collection was limited to
a smaller vertical section by substantially reducing
the nanoseconds of collection time and by increas­
ing the scans per meter from 40 to 60, creating a
more detailed picture of potential anomalies closer
to the surface.
A comparison of runs along the same grid
lines shows notable differences in the number of
anomalies noted. Runs 34, 64, and 65 all traversed
the E65 grid line from N1 to N36 at different
machine settings (Figure 10). The first of these,
Run 34, at the deeper 70­nanosecond setting, with
only 40 scans per meters, only yielded 6 anomalies.
Run 64, the last of the first half of the second

pass, at 50 nanoseconds and 60 scans per meter,
recorded 10 anomalies, while the overlapping
Run 65, undertaken at 30 nanoseconds and 60
scans per meter, recorded 13. As expected, the
greater resolution provided by raising the sampled
depth clarified the profile view and increased the
number of observed anomalies. In the first, the
512 samples recorded at each scan were distributed
across a 70­nanosecond profile, with each sample
recording the incoming data at .1367­nanosecond
intervals, while in the third, the 512 samples
recorded at each scan were distributed across a
30­nanosecond profile, with the samples recording
data at .0586­nanosecond intervals, creating a
denser data set.
Examination of the anomalies in these three
sets suggests that the higher resolution of the third
set did not necessarily yield evidence of burials not
noted in the first, but may have provided more
information to distinguish burial anomalies from
non­interment or even noncultural anomalies.
Using data from Keller’s 2004 excavations and
from subsequent trenching by the THC in 2005,
23

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 24

with no burials found fewer anomalies. The west­
ernmost 20 runs of the first set encountered 80
anomalies, an average of 4 per run, while the east­
ernmost 24 runs yielded more than twice as many
anomalies at 164, or 6.8 per run. Further dividing
the eastern segment of the first pass into areas
equivalent to the two segments of the second pass
yielded 63 anomalies in 11 runs to the west, an
average of 5.7 per run, and 101 anomalies in 13
runs to the east, an average of 7.8 per run—a
roughly similar percent of increase between the
first and second sets in each pass (35.6 percent
in the first pass and 37.5 percent in the second),
suggesting that the increase could be more than an
artifice of the higher resolution of the easternmost
runs in the second pass.
Total numbers aside, it is clear that not all of
the anomalies noted are burials, although it is very
difficult to distinguish in some cases. There are
definitely fewer “burial­like” anomalies in the
westernmost data set, west of E60, which
corresponds with the THC trenching. Figure 11
illustrates runs in this area along the E52, E55,

it appears that all three of these overlapping passes
yielded some evidence of the actual recorded
interments on this line (i.e., Features 49 and 105)
as well as a possible third burial feature between
these two and a fourth closer to the sidewalk at
the south edge of the block. Other possible burials
might be present just to the north of Keller’s trench
and just a few meters south of the east end of the
run, although no obvious anomalies were recorded
in the area where the northernmost THC trench
found a gap between burials along this grid line.
The comparison of other redundant and parallel
runs yields generally similar data. Runs at the
same resolution along the same grid line recorded
roughly the same number of anomalies, with
higher­resolution passes often producing more
anomalies. Based on the preliminary examination
of these initial duplicate and parallel runs, the
decision was made to sample other areas at 50
nanoseconds and 60 scans per meter, greatly
improving on the resolution over the 40 scans
per meter used in some tests, and keeping the
depth at 50 nanoseconds to avoid missing possible
deeper echoes.
The first pass recorded a total of 244 anomalies,
or an average of 5.6 per run. The west half of the
second pass (at 50 nanoseconds) recorded 142
anomalies, or an average of 12.9 per run, while
the east half (at 30 nanoseconds) recorded
284 anomalies for an average of 17.8 per run.
These discrepancies are due in part to the higher
resolution of the second­pass runs, which not
only yielded denser data but a much cleaner and
stronger signal. The differences between the west
and east half of the second­pass runs is probably
due in part to the increased resolution, but some
of the differences may be attributable to an apparent
slight increase in anomalies from west to east. The
THC trenching revealed no burials west of about
the E57 or E58 grid line, an area included in the
first pass but not the second. This western area
had fewer anomalies in the first pass. The area of
the first pass roughly equivalent to the trench area

and E58 grid lines. Although these runs are
relatively noisy, with several minor anomalies,
much of the noise and several of the anomalies
are thought to be due to surface roughness. There
are no obvious “burial anomalies” in runs along
the E52 and E55 grid lines, with only several
vague possible interments represented at the left
side of the E58 run.
There also appear to be fewer obvious burial
anomalies north of Keller’s east­west trench than
south of it (in fact, there are fewer anomalies
overall north of Keller’s 2004 trench). In part this
may be due to the fact that the THC trench that
actually recorded burials in this area was just at
the edge of the radar runs in Area I. Because of
the temporary construction fence along the alley
in place at the time of the fieldwork, the runs only
reached about midway across where the trench
would later be excavated. Since the last meter or
two of any run are usually difficult to interpret
because of typical “startup” type anomalies, this
entire area was all but invisible to the radar.
Between the later THC trench and Keller’s trench,
the radar also noted relatively few anomalies,
so it will be interesting when all the data are
collected to determine what the differences might
be in this area.
It should be noted that Keller’s east­west
trench in this area created havoc with the run data,
generating false anomalies from the extremely
rough surface. A close examination of the runs
shows a strong correlation with the radar anomalies
and Keller’s actually recorded burials, but the
non­burial anomalies are seemingly as strong as
those noted with actual burials in other parts of
the area. This finding simply reiterates the necessity
for a clean, smooth surface for accurate recording
of subsurface anomalies with radar. Given the
noise, the general similarity between various
anomalies, and the apparent differences in the
depth of burials, it was impossible to extract a
clear three­dimensional time slice of Area I (or any
of the other areas for that matter) that showed a

Figure 12. Area I three-dimensional slices near top (left) and
base (right).

pattern of burials, even though many of these were
clearly visible in the profiles. Figure 12 shows
slices near the top of the profile (where Keller’s
trench and an asphalt parking bumper are the
clearest images) and near the bottom (where a
concentration of anomalies is noted near the south
end of the slice where actual burials were noted
but were not easily separable in the slice). Note
the odd anomaly that appears to curve off to the
northeast in the bottom slice. While this may be
an artifice of the analytical process, it could be
a feature related to the early­ to mid­twentieth­
century residence located in this general area.

Results in Area II
Area II consisted of a series of east­west runs in
the grassy field that spread across Lots 2, 3, and 4
on the north side of the alley. A total of 10 runs
were undertaken in this area at one­meter intervals
along grid lines from N47 to N58 (skipping the
N51 and N52 lines that had trees present) between
E54 and E95. These runs were all undertaken at
50 nanoseconds and 60 scans per meter. The
ground surface in this area was rougher than the
debris­covered asphalt on the south half of the
block but not nearly so rough as the earthen
25

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 26

Despite the good correlation between radar
anomalies and observed grave shafts along this
grid line and several others undertaken in Area II,
three­dimensional slices of the area do not accurately
depict either the known graves or the recorded
anomalies. Figure 14 shows one of the slices from
near the middle of the radar profile. While few of
the graves or anomalies can be correlated with this
image, the overall image does suggest a series of
grave­like features, including some that appear to
follow the slight grid northwest­southeast angle of
many of the recorded interments. This image is
substantially more definitive than any of the other
slices, perhaps because it is the only area not over­
lain by asphalt, although that seems an unlikely
explanation. Note that this image was compiled
from radar runs at one­meter intervals, unlike the
half­meter intervals of the other areas, and includes
an area in the middle (from N50 to N53) where
the slice data are only estimated from surrounding
runs. Presumably if this area had better original
control, this slice would better resemble the actual
interment data.

surfaces where Keller’s trenches had been excavated
in that area. The grid was not marked as clearly
in Area II, and the plotting precision for the runs
and anomalies may not be as good in this area
(the less well marked grid led to the decision to
run at one­meter intervals since there was not
sufficient control to keep good half­meter spac­
ing). The 410 m of linear radar runs in Area II
traversed an area of approximately 420 sq m.
A total of 135 anomalies were noted in Area
II, an average of 13.5 anomalies per run and .33
per linear meter, fewer than seen in several of the
run sets on the south side of the block. Some of
these 135 anomalies were clearly related to vegeta­
tion and surface roughness, and some are thought
to be related to the foundations or utility trenches
from buildings that once stood in this area. Others
are thought likely to be burials, and in fact the
THC excavations in this general area did recover
evidence of a fairly large number of burials.
Figure 13 illustrates the radar pass along N53
in Area II. Three THC trenches recorded seven
grave shafts crossing this grid line. The seven shafts
(marked by boxes in the figure) are congruent
with recorded radar anomalies. At least eight other
anomalies noted along this line could represent
burials, although this cannot be demonstrated
without further subsurface investigations.

Results in Area III
Area III consisted of a series of north­south runs
in the asphalt­covered parking lot west of the
temporary construction fence present at the time
of the investigation. These runs sampled Lot 8 on
the south half of the block. A total of 16 runs
were undertaken in this area at half­meter intervals
along grid lines from E40.5 to E48 between N1
and N40 (these runs were extended right up to the
alley, whereas runs in Area I were hindered by the
construction fence just inside the property line in
that area). These runs were all undertaken at 50
nanoseconds and 60 scans per meter. In this area,
624 linear meters of radar runs covered an area of
about 320 sq m.
A total of 215 anomalies were noted in this
area, an average of 13.4 per run and .34 per linear
meter, a number roughly equivalent to that seen
in Area II on the north side of the block. Although
26

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 27

the surface of this area was covered by small gravel
and tiny patches of mud and grass growing through
cracks in the asphalt, this surface was actually
much smoother than that of all of the runs over
asphalted surfaces to the east. In fact, the surface
was essentially smoother than on any other run.
Some surface anomalies were observed, but in
general, these were excluded from the analysis.
While the runs in this area show a number
of anomalies, they are generally weak, and few,
if any, have the characteristic signature of human
burials (see Figure 15 for a sample of several runs).
At least some of these anomalies are thought to
be related to the houses and commercial buildings
that once stood in this area. The possibility that
one or more represent interments cannot be ruled
out, but it would appear that if there are graves in
this area, they are significantly fewer in number.
Some of the more prominent anomalies are visible
in the three­dimensional slices illustrated in
Figure 16. Unfortunately, as with the other three­
dimensional slices, random noise overwhelms the
subtle anomalies, leaving only the strongest visible
in the slices.
Despite the relatively high number of anom­
alies in this area, the average number per run or
per meter is well below that seen in Areas I (at
least in the higher­resolution second pass) and IV,
where burials are known to occur. The anomaly
density of Area III, on the other hand, is nearly
identical to that of Area II, where burials were
also noted. In spite of the possible comparisons
between raw numbers of anomalies, an examination
of the types of anomalies seen in Area III suggests
that many of these possible subsurface features are
not burials but either soil features or the subsurface
remains of houses that once stood here.

intervals. The southernmost five runs (from N0.5
to N2.5) extended from E50, just east of the
temporary construction fence, to E88, just west
of the fence of the Lutheran Church located on
the corner of the block. North of this, an asphalt

Area IV consisted of a series of east­west runs
along the south edge of the south half of the block.
These 24 runs extended across Lots 9 and 10
following grid lines from N0.5 to N12 at half­meter

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 28

hump between E56 and E57 reduced the length
of the runs to 28 m, from E60 to E88. As with the
previous few sets of runs, these were all undertaken
at 50 nanoseconds and 60 scans per meter. In all,
722 linear meters of radar runs were completed in
Area IV, traversing a total area of 366 sq m.
Radar runs were considered critical in this area
for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was
that the previous trenching by Keller had recorded
a number of burials at the eastern end of this area.
It could therefore be used to anchor the runs and
to verify the radar signature of an interment in the
local soil and moisture conditions. It was also
considered necessary to conduct east­west runs in
the area where known burials had been recorded.
Most of the burials noted by Keller (and later by
the THC) were oriented north­south, thus the
north­south runs in Areas I and III are considered
relatively inefficient in identifying burials at that
same orientation. Finally, it was thought important
to have some overlap between the north­south
runs of Area I and the east­west runs of Area IV,
yielding a higher degree of confidence in the
results. In a perfect world, the entire cemetery
would be crisscrossed by overlapping north­south
and east­west runs for maximum verifiability.
All but 178 sq m of this area, roughly half the
total size of Area IV, overlapped with Area I.
No attempt has been made to do a complete
correlation of anomalies within the overlap area,
but many of the same anomalies are seen in both
areas. As noted above, the most effective radar
runs in a cemetery area cross the graves on their
short axis, in this case from east to west. Runs
along the long axis of the burials (as in Area I)
make the recognition and interpretation of anom­
alies much more complicated. In fact, it is much
easier to identify specific anomalies as interments
in the Area IV runs than in Area I, even in the
overlap area and even where the locations of
graves are known from trenching.
Figure 17 shows a sample of radar runs along
grid lines N3, N7, and N11 in Area IV. The some­

what lighter area beginning just to the left of the
center of the run and extending to the right side
represents Keller’s trench, where the number and
location of burials are presumably known. The far
left side of the middle run, N7, was also sampled
by a THC trench.
A total of 451 anomalies were noted in these
runs, an average of 18.8 per run, or about .62
anomalies per meter. This is the highest density of
anomalies in the project area. Some of the anomalies
are undoubtedly related to surface roughness; in
addition to the previously trenched area at the east
end of this run, the surface was very rough along
the edge of the block and at the extreme west end,
where surface obstacles forced abandonment of
the westernmost 10 m of the originally planned
run area. Many of the anomalies in this area,
however, could be signals of actual interments.
Both Keller and the THC recovered evidence of
a number of burials along the southern edge of
this area; as many as 37 burials were recorded by
Keller and the THC in excavation of a bit more
than half of the immediate area studied. Since
each burial could generate multiple anomalies on
28

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 29

adjacent runs, it is not impossible that as many as
a fourth to a third of the noted anomalies related
to known burials. More burials are expected in
the portions of this area that were not trenched
in the preliminary investigations.
Figure 18 shows a series of anomalies along
the N4 run that crossed as many as 22 known
burials along the south edge of this area. The
boxes on the figure mark the area of known
graves from trenching (in several cases, these are
clearly overlapping or adjacent burials), and most
are matched by relatively strong anomalies. The
easternmost half of the chart, with single­ and
double­digit feature numbers, was excavated by
Keller before the radar investigations, while the
western half, with three­digit feature numbers,
was excavated and recorded by the THC after the
radar study. Most of the interments crossed by the
N4 run are aligned north­south, with the excep­
tion of Feature 14 and perhaps Feature 15 (which
could be a child burial if it is mapped correctly).
The anomaly associated with Feature 14 is clearly
different than most of the others and is less oval
and apparently longer, suggesting that it does
represent an east­west interment. The Feature
15 anomaly, on the other hand, does not seem
substantially different from other north­south
interments. The long Feature 103 appears to be
two adjacent north­south interments from the
map, and, in fact, the radar strip chart shows a
strong single anomaly at the right side of the box
and a somewhat weaker one extending out along
the west edge of the box. Curiously, there appears
be a strong anomaly between the anomalies that
represent Features 10 and 11. Since this area has
been scraped and no burial recognized in this area,
it may well be little more than the lateral echoes of
the two extant features; on the other hand, it could
be possible that a somewhat deeper burial was not
recognized between the two known individuals.
Finally, an attempt to map the spatial layout of
possible interments in Area IV using the time slice
method was even less successful than in the other

mapped burial features (boxes).

areas, due to an apparent power issue caused by
changing batteries in the middle of the series.
This is not a phenomenon that the author has
encountered before, but may be due to automatic
resetting of gain parameters upon the restart of
the machine. These slight differences in gain did
not affect the analysis of the strip profiles, but
could not be factored out of the three­dimensional
data and make the three­dimensional analysis
difficult to interpret. Figure 19 shows one such
three­dimensional set in Area IV (note that the dark
area at the left edge was not included in the run).
This figure does show considerable returning
wave activity in just those areas where apparent
burials have been identified in the profile data,
although the “anomalies” identified are not quite
discrete enough to be associated with known or
suspected burials. As with much of the other data
from this area, the presence of burials is fairly
obvious, but an actual count cannot be made.
Nonetheless, the suspected burial anomalies in this
figure do seem to line up with the rows of burials
initially identified by Keller in his trenching.

Conclusions
Four areas of the Campo Santo Viejo site were
sampled with SIR for a total of 129 radar runs.
29

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 30

These 129 runs, conducted mostly at half­meter
intervals, covered 4,206 linear meters within an
area of about 2,000 sq m (Table A.1). More than
1,450 anomalies were noted in these runs, at least
some of them apparently related to known and
suspected burials in the Campo Santo Viejo ceme­
tery (Table A.2). Figure 20 shows the layout of these
anomalies plotted on the site grid. Note that the
anomalies plotted in Area I include both passes
through this area (which also overlap with the por­
tion of the Area IV run at the bottom of the block).
The majority of these anomalies are probably
not related to extant graves or exhumations. The
high number of anomalies is thought to be in part
due to considerable noise that seems to have been
generated by the particular combination of a rough
surface and the radar configuration. Nonetheless,
a large number of anomalies were observed in the
area of Lots 9, 10, and 11 on the south half of the
block (Areas I and IV) and Lots 2, 3, and 4 on the
north side of the block (Area II). Although the
possibility that some of the anomalies observed
on Lot 8 of the south half of the block (Area III)
could be interments cannot be ruled out, the vast
majority of these anomalies are quite different in
form, size, and depth than the actual burial anom­
alies seen in other areas.
As with many such ground­penetrating radar
studies, many of the anomalies recorded simply
indicate slight differences in soil moisture that
are related to natural pedological differences.
Differences in soil moisture content can radically
affect the dielectric constant of a particular material
and thus the two­way travel time of the antenna
signal. Such differences in electromagnetic conduc­
tion properties allow radar to recognize different
soil layers in both natural (i.e., soil horizons and
depositional strata) and artificial (i.e., pits, artificial
fills, etc.) situations. In the case of burials, both the
pits and the remains themselves may alter wave
transmission and thus yield an anomaly. Dielectric
differences between the pit and the remains could
even mask or confound the actual location of the

Figure 20. Plot of Campo Santo Viejo anomalies on site grid.

feature. At the Campo Santo Viejo cemetery site,
it appears that the interments themselves, the
coffins and the human remains, yield stronger
signals than the pits. Unfortunately, not enough
runs were undertaken over suspected exhumations
to be certain of this, but the anomaly configurations
nonetheless do suggest such a pattern.
In the end, despite the noisy data, the radar
was actually highly successful at recognizing burials.
The greatest limitation of the current study, aside
from the surface noise problems, was the limited
field and analysis time. With a greater allocation
of field time to conduct overlapping runs at several
different settings (perhaps even with different
antennas), and with adequate lab time, it should
be possible to locate and map the majority of the
burials. It is impossible to state what degree of
precision could be achieved by such intensive
radar investigations, but with some of the surface
noise problems fixed (mostly by simply cleaning
the mud and gravel from atop the asphalt and
smoothing the surface of the former trenches) it
would not be unreasonable to reach 90 percent
accuracy in identification or better.
Would it be possible to reach 100 percent
accuracy with the radar? Such a recovery rate is
probably only possible in small cemeteries with
perfect conditions; ultimately, excavations are
generally necessary to achieve such a degree of
30

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 31

certainty. On the other hand, the radar has several
advantages over gradall scraping. First and foremost,
it is nondestructive. In cases where this is impor­
tant, radar is likely to be the best remote sensing
technique in many different environments.
Secondly, radar can be significantly cheaper than
gradall scraping when the project is extended
beyond the usually high startup costs of the typical
one­ or two­day project. Even in cases in which a
gradall will ultimately be used to scrape before
removal of burials, radar is cost­effective, since it
allows some degree of planning prior to actual
exposure. Thirdly, the radar is likely to be more
effective that any physical scraping method to
determine if burials are still present in pits, since it
generally views the actual remains rather than the
pit in most cases. And finally, the radar is not likely
to be fooled where pit outlines are vague or inde­
terminate. At the Campo Santo Viejo site, there is
at least one location, and perhaps several, where
the radar scan detected evidence of a burial that
was not noted by the scraping.

care for the previously forgotten cemetery site and
remains. Before fieldwork began, the project area
boundaries and visible surface features were digitally
mapped using a Total Data Station (TDS). Since
the project area was in downtown Brownsville, in
a commercial and residential area, a temporary
chain­link fence was installed to protect the
exposed grave shafts and to keep people and animals
away. The fence remained in place until after the
final fieldwork and backfilling was completed.
The mechanical scraping was conducted using
a backhoe and operator provided by the county.
To evaluate the spatial patterning and extent of the
graves within the county­proposed parking lot
areas of the cemetery, archeological testing sampling
methods were used. These included placing eight
trenches (numbered 1 through 8) about 3 m wide
over Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and half of Lot 10. A
methodology was put in place to quickly record the
grave shaft and other features before visibility
diminished. Where the grave shafts from the 2004
investigations were previously noted, the upper
soil and asphalt debris was mechanically scraped to
a depth of approximately 20 to 30 cm, then hand or
shovel scraped to further delineate the contrasted
dark stained soil that distinguished the grave shaft
features. Immediately, feature corners and outlines
were marked using pin flags. Pin flags were then
labeled with a sequential feature number, beginning
with Feature 101 within Trench 1 (so as not to
duplicate feature numbers used during the 2004
investigations). Each feature was immediately
recorded digitally using a TDS, and feature location,
type, orientation, grave shaft, possible exhumation,
single or double grave, shape, and other distinguish­
ing attributes were noted in a feature log (Appendix
B). Twentieth­century historic and modern features
and associated artifacts were recorded in the
same manner. No artifacts or human remains
were collected during the 2005 investigations.
In addition, features were digitally photographed,
and feature forms, profiles, and plan maps were
completed. Trenches 1, 2, and 8 were excavated

Archeological Testing Phase II:
Mechanical and Hand Scraping
Investigations

Methods of Field Investigations
The second phase of archeological testing by the
THC included mechanical and hand scraping of
the upper 20 to 30 cm of soil on the publicly
owned lots of Block 144 (Lots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10
and the western half of 11). The work took place
during a three­week period in August 2005. The
purpose of the testing was to precisely identify the
number or extent of graves present and the spatial
distribution of the graves within the Campo Santo
Viejo cemetery site through visual inspection. With
these results, the THC would be able to report the
findings to Cameron County officials, and both
public agencies could then decide how to properly

4 to identify all grave shafts. Upon identifying the
extent of the graves within Trench 9 in association
with the rest of the cemetery grave evidence,
Trenches 1 through 8 were backfilled, and a
temporary metal T­post fence was placed around
the perimeters of the newly discovered cemetery
boundaries. Site recommendations were then sent
to Cameron County. However, in January 2006,
Cameron County officials and THC decided to
officially preserve the entire area (Lots 2, 3, 4,
half of Lot 9, 10, and half of Lot 11) as Campo
Santo Viejo memorial park and place a historical
marker at the site. At that time, Trench 9 was
backfilled and the 2004 previously recovered
human remains and associated materials were
reinterred within Lot 10 (see Previous Archeological
Investigations section). The reinterment was
witnessed by THC archeologists, Cameron County
officials, and representatives from Southern
Archaeological Consultants, Inc.

in an east­to­west direction along the Block 144
grid to slightly overlap with the previous 2004
archeological investigations, picking up where
they left off (Figure 21).
No prior investigations were conducted on
the publicly owned vacant lots (2, 3, and 4) in the
northern half of the project area. Trenches 3, 4, 6,
and 7 were excavated in a north­to­south direction
along the Block 144 grid within Lots 2, 3, and 4.
Trench 5 was excavated in an east­to­west direction.
The mechanically scraped trenches in this upper
area were placed between and around trees and
larger vegetation to maximize the space to get the
backhoe in and out of the relatively small area and
to evaluate the extent of grave shafts. In addition,
since one possible outcome of this project would
be to preserve the area of the cemetery within Lots
9, 10, and 11, transferring the graves from Lots 2,
3, and 4 to this area, a larger area called Trench 9
was scraped over the upper half of Lots 2, 3, and

this area, it became evident that this was the
southwestern Campo Santo Viejo cemetery site
boundary, as shown clearly in Figures 22a and 22b.
Grave orientation was to the north in most cases,
but it is interesting that within Trench 1, which
is the closest to the East Monroe Street southern
boundary of Block 144, the majority of the grave
shafts are oriented in a grid north pattern and are
fairly even, which may be evidence of a row of
graves. Grave shafts within Trenches 2 and 8 are

scraping in the eastern end of Trenches 1, 2, and
8 within the eastern half of Lot 9 and the western
half of Lot 10. In this southern portion of the
project area, 24 undisturbed grave shafts and 5
disturbed graves were discovered (not including
the grave shaft counts from Keller’s 2004 investi­
gations). However, trench excavations within Lots
7, 8, and the western half of Lot 9 revealed no
evidence of either undisturbed or disturbed human
graves. Therefore, with the absence of graves in

mixed in orientation, with most oriented toward
true north, as Keller (2005) observed during the
previous 2004 investigations.
Test excavations of Trenches 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
9 identified 64 undisturbed grave shafts and 15
disturbed graves within the northern or upper
area of the project area north of the alleyway in
the vacant lots (2, 3, and 4). Figures 22a and 22c
shows that evidence of graves was present over the
entire northern vacant lots, except within the
western portion of Lot 4. The western cemetery
boundary for the upper portion was in a straight
line with the southern boundary. Many of the grave
shafts are concentrated in the eastern half of Lot 4
and within the southern half of Lots 2, 3, and 4.
The majority of grave shafts identified in the upper
portion are oriented toward true north; however,
a few grave shafts identified from the northern
portion of Trenches 6 and 9 are oriented at a slight
angle to the north­northeast. These are clustered
together and perhaps were part of a row or family
plot. Two adjacent grave shafts (Features 286 and
287) within the southwestern section of Trench 9
were facing in the opposite, or east­west, direction.
In addition to the associated cemetery burial
features, other cultural features identified during
the Phase II testing included a dog burial (confirmed
by a consulting onsite osteologist), 13 historic
features, 80 post molds, and 9 utility pipe trenches
associated with the commercial and residential
structures and outbuildings that once overlaid the
cemetery. A description of the individual backhoe
and hand­scraped trench excavations follow.

Figure 23. Trench 1 mechanical scraping, facing grid west.

Portions of nine undisturbed single grave shafts
(Features 101, 103–105, 107–109, 111, and 112),
one possible double grave shaft (Feature 106), and
two probable disturbed double graves (Features
102 and 110) were identified within the eastern
half of Lot 9 and the western half of Lot 10, an
area approximately 18 m distance from the eastern
end of Trench 1. Three grave shafts protruded
from the south wall profile, but the majority or
nine appeared to be in a row and protruded from
the north wall profile (Figures 24 and 25).
Features 106 and 107 are shown in Figure 26.
The grave shafts were originally placed in a
sandy A horizon soil (10 YR 6/2) from 30 to 45
cm below surface. This was covered by about 15
cm of disturbed fill from the various 20th­century
commercial and residential occupations over the
cemetery. Over this was a 3­ to 5­cm layer of clay
base fill from the parking lot, which was then
covered by a heavy 10­cm layer of caliche fill,
which was capped with the final 2­ to 3­cm asphalt
layer. Grave shaft types and sizes are described in
more detail in the following section.
In addition to grave shafts, Trench 1 contained
two post­1900 historic features (Features 113 and
116), 7 post molds, and a utility (or possibly a
foundation) setting trench. Feature 113 was a ca.
1­m trash pit or large post mold. It is associated
with a dwelling that was located in the eastern

Trench 1
Trench 1 was located parallel to and about 3 m
north of the East Monroe Street, or southern,
boundary of Block 144 (see Figures 22a and 22b).
It was approximately 3 m wide by 45 m long and
was excavated to a depth of about 45 cm below
surface. Backhoe scraping began in the western
half of Lot 10 and continued west across Lots 9, 8,
and the eastern half of Lot 7 (Figure 23).

half of Lot 9, as shown on the 1919 Sanborn map
(see Figure 5). The utility was oriented in a north­
south direction and continued across and through
Trench 2 (see Figures 22a, 22b, and Appendix B).
It was also encountered near the western boundary
of Lot 9, which was where a large lumber shed
had been located (see Figure 5).
Feature 116 consisted of a large brick founda­
tion (ca. 13 m long) protruding from the south
wall profile and a 60­cm section of brick footing
(3 bricks wide) protruding from the north wall
profile of Trench 1 (Figure 27). The brick footing
was dry­layed at the base and mortared on top.

At least four bricks had an “LM” manufacturing
mark (Figures 28 and 29).
The post molds discovered within the interior
of the foundation would have supported interior
walls or hardwood floors. Archival records and the
1919 and 1926 Sanborn maps show this location
as being the main building of the J.S. & M.H.
Cross Lumber Company, which later became the
Eagle Pass Lumber Company, which encompassed
the southwest corner of Block 144 within Lots 7
and 8 (see Figures 5 and 6). Both Sanborn maps
show three storefront rooms facing East Monroe
Street labeled “Hardware, Paints & Oils,” with

rooms behind labeled as “Ware Rooms” and
“Office” and a covered porch or storage space in
the back. This large building was apparently in
commercial use from ca. 1914 to the 1930s, when
the lot was converted to a parking lot for the
courthouse (Fernandez 2005:38).

Trench 2
Trench 2 was excavated in the county parking lot
in the middle of Lots 7, 8, and the western two­
thirds of Lot 9 (see Figures 22a and 22b). Trench 2
was approximately 3 m wide by 36 m long and
was mechanically and hand scraped to a depth of
38

about 45 cm below surface. On the east end the
trench extended 2 m into the utility trench exca­
vated during Keller’s 2004 investigations. Here the
trench was excavated to a depth to where Keller
had placed protective black fabric over the base
of the trench. Portions of two undisturbed single
grave shafts (Features 122 and 123) and two previ­
ously disturbed or probable exhumed single graves
(Features 124 and 125) were identified within the
eastern half of Lot 9 in an area less than 5 m long.
The graves stopped along the same north­south
line as the graves in Trench 1.
Historic features identified in Trench 2 included
the utility setting trench described above (Feature
128), which extended through both Trenches 1
and 2, three post molds (Features 126, 127, and
132), a gas pipe (Feature 129), two grounding rods
(Features 130 and 131), another setting trench
toward the western end of the trench (Feature
134), and a large, roughly circular (approximately
2.5 m diameter) trash pit or possible unlined
cistern or privy pit (Feature 133, Figure 30).
The pit (Feature 133) was filled with early­
20th­century rubble and artifact fragments.
Artifacts were identified and recorded in situ but
not collected. The feature was surface recorded
only, and no further excavations were conducted.
Artifacts included several rusty metal spikes, rusty
39

nails, unidentifiable metal objects, oyster shells,
white undecorated ironstone or semi­porcelain
ceramic sherds (including a cup rim, a bowl base,
and miscellaneous body sherds), a small blue edge­
decorated ironstone ceramic plate rim sherd, glass,
brick, animal bones, and charcoal fragments. White
ironstone ceramics became popular after the Civil
War and are still commonly used today as thick
restaurant or “hotel” ware. It is difficult to
determine whether or not the trash pit or cistern
debris was associated with the residential dwelling
occupation and perhaps the outbuilding that is
shown on the 1906 Sanborn map (see Figure 4)
or if it was associated with the lumber company
building or outbuildings shown on the 1919 and
1926 Sanborn maps (see Figures 5 and 6).
Trench 3
Trench 3 was the first backhoe trench dug in the
northern or upper section of the county­owned
vacant lots; it spanned the middle of Lot 2 (see
Figures 22a and 22c). Trench 3 was approximately

Figure 31. Photo of Trench 3, which exposed 18 grave shafts.

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:56 PM Page 40

165–167, 169, 171, 173, and 220) and 1 very
irregularly shape previously disturbed or probable
exhumed grave (Feature 152) were identified and
recorded within Trench 3. Figure 32 is a plan and
west wall profile sketch showing the Feature 156
grave shaft, which protruded from the west wall.
The exhumed feature included a large, irregu­
larly shaped (ca. 2x2­m) multiple grave that may
have been a burial for two or more individuals.
Interestingly, all 13 undisturbed grave shafts and 1
disturbed grave were densely concentrated only in
the southern half of Lot 3 in Trench 4. No graves
were present in the northern half of the lot within
the scraped trench (see Figures 22a and 22c). All
the graves identified in Trench 4 were oriented at
an angle toward true north. In addition, one very
dense cluster contained four overlapping grave
shafts (Features 165, 166, 167, and 220) that were
arranged together as if placed in a row. They may
represent a family unit or extended family plot.
Feature 220, a possible infant burial, slightly over­
lapped both Feature 166 on one side and Feature
167 on the other. Feature 166 also overlapped
Feature 165. Analysis of findings was further com­
plicated by a historic sewer pipe (Feature 168) that
bisected and was on top of these four grave shafts
features (Figure 33). Historic features identified in
Trench 4 include a roughly circular shaped and
burned trash pit or cistern/septic pit (Feature 164).
The surface and outline were exposed at 33 to 36
cm below surface and revealed a few pieces of
glass and ceramics with fill. The western portion of
the feature extended into the west wall of Trench
4. Exposed dimensions are 148 cm north­south
by 92 cm east­west. Two setting trenches, both
bisecting Trench 4 in an east­west direction, were
identified. Feature 168, as mentioned above,
included a sewer pipe trench that cut across a
densely clustered row of four grave shafts. Feature
172 was a historic trench. In addition, eight post
molds were identified (Features 154–155,
159–163, and 170). These were scattered through­
out the southern third of Trench 4 within Lot 3.

3 m wide by 31 m long and was excavated to a
depth of about 35 to 45 cm below surface. It should
be noted that the northern end of Trench 3 was
opened up and incorporated into a larger mechani­
cally scraped area that was designated as Trench 9.
Grave shaft features were immediately identified
during the first scrape in the southern end of
Trench 3. Portions of 10 undisturbed single grave
shafts (Features 135–140, 143, 144, 210, and 215)
and 8 previously disturbed or probable exhumed
single graves (Features 141, 142, 147, 207, 208,
212, 214, and 216) were identified and recorded
within Trench 3 (Figure 31).
Eight of the undisturbed grave shafts were
concentrated in the southern half of Trench 3,
while the majority of the previously disturbed or
probable exhumed graves were in the northern
half of Trench 3 toward the northern boundary
of Block 144.
Historic features identified in Trench 3 included
five post holes (Feature 145, 146, 148, 149, and
213), two small and a portion of one large, roughly
circular (approximately 3 m in diameter) historic
pits or cisterns (Features 217, 219, and 209), one
large historic pipe trench (Feature 218), and one
modern pipe (Feature 211). Historic features are
believed to be associated with either previous
residential dwellings or outbuildings or the lumber
shed (see Figures 4–6).
Trench 4
Trench 4 was excavated in the northern or upper
section of the county­owned vacant lots; it
spanned the middle of Lot 3. It was ca. 3 m wide
by 30 m long and was mechanically scraped to a
depth of about 35 to 45 cm below surface. It
should be noted that the northern end of Trench 4
was opened up and incorporated into a larger
mechanically scraped area that was designated as
Trench 9. Grave shaft features were immediately
identified during the first scrape in the southern
end of Trench 4. Portions of 13 undisturbed single
grave shafts (Features 150, 151, 153, 156–158,
40

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:57 PM Page 41

Figure 32. Plan view and west wall profile of partial grave shaft, Feature 156, in Trench 4.

The historic burned trash pit or cistern feature
and the post molds are probably associated with
a dwelling that faced East Jackson Street and its
outbuildings, as shown on the 1906 Sanborn map
(see Figure 4). The sewer pipe trench and the
setting trench may be associated with the dwelling
or the large lumber shed illustrated on the 1919
and 1926 Sanborn maps (see Figures 5 and 6).
Trench 5
Trench 5 was located approximately 4 m inside
the southern boundary of Lot 4 and just inside the
western boundary of Lot 3. It was mechanically
scraped by the backhoe to a depth of about 35 to

Figure 33. Plan of cluster of grave shaft features (65–167

206) were oriented at an opposite angle to true
north, toward the north­northeast direction (see
Figure 22c).
Historic features identified in Trench 6 included
3 post holes and 1 pot hole (Features 193–195
and 199).

45 cm (see Figures 22a and 22c). The trench was
ca. 3 m wide by 13.5 m long. Mechanical scraping
immediately revealed the evidence of the Campo
Santo Viejo remains. Portions of 8 undisturbed sin­
gle grave shafts (Features 174, 176–178, 183, 185,
186, and 188), one undisturbed double grave shaft
(Feature 179), and one previously disturbed or
probable exhumed single grave (Feature 175) were
identified. All the grave shafts were in the eastern
two­thirds of Trench 5.
Historic features identified in Trench 5 included
5 post holes (Features 181, 182, 184, 187, and
190) and one irregularly shaped (60 cm by 1 m)
trash pit (Feature 180) that was located directly
on top of the double grave shaft, Feature 179.
On the surface, the trash pit contained a few glass
fragments, rusty nails, charcoal, and animal bone
fragments. These features are probably associated
with a previous early­ to mid­20th­century out­
building. In addition, a modern electric utility
pipe and trench were encountered within Trench
5 (Feature 189). No features were identified within
4 m of the western end of Trench 5.

Trench 7
Trench 7 was located approximately 3 m parallel
to and inside the western Lot 4 boundary. The
trench was ca. 3 m wide by 24 m long and was
mechanically scraped to a depth 35 to 45 cm below
surface. It should be noted that the northern end
of Trench 7 was opened up and incorporated into
a larger mechanically scraped area, which was
designated as Trench 9. Only two features were
found. Portions of two undisturbed single grave
shafts (Features 221 and 222) were identified
extending out from the eastern wall profile within
6 m of the southern end of Trench 7. No other
grave­related or historic features were identified.
This further verified the results from Trenches 1,
2, and 5, which identified the western boundary
of Campo Santo Viejo cemetery as approximately
4 m inside the western boundary of Lot 4.

Trench 6
Trench 6 was located about 5 m north of Trench 5
within Lot 4 (see Figures 22a and 22c). The trench
was 3.5 m wide by 22 m long. A large tree pre­
vented the trench from spanning the entire north­
south length of Lot 4. Backhoe scraping revealed
11 undisturbed single grave shafts (Features 191,
196, 197, 198, and 200–206) and one irregularly
shaped disturbed or probable exhumed double
grave (Feature 192). It should be noted that the
northern end of Trench 6 was opened up and
incorporated into a larger mechanically scraped
area, which was designated as Trench 9. Grave
shafts appeared to be densely clustered within
about a 7 m section at the southern end of Trench
6. There was an approximately 4­m gap with no
graves, then grave shafts were more scattered in
the northern ca. 12.5 m section of the trench.
Interestingly, six grave shafts (Features 201–

Trench 8
Trench 8 was excavated in the southern or lower
section within the county­owned parking lot (see
Figures 22a and 22b). It was parallel to the north­
ern lot boundaries and encompassed the western
half of Lot 7, all of Lots 8 and 9, and the eastern
half of Lot 10. It was located about 3 m south of
the alleyway that bisected the lots in half in Block
144. Trench 8 was approximately 3 m wide and 47
m long and was mechanically and hand scraped to
a depth approximately 45 to 49 cm below surface.
Grave shaft features were immediately identified
during the first scrape in the eastern end of Trench
8. Portions of 11 undisturbed single grave shafts
(Features 225, 230, 231, 233, 234, 236, 238, 239,
240, 242, and 245), one undisturbed double grave
shaft (Feature 226), and one previously disturbed

were aligned at a slight angle toward true north.
Historic features identified in Trench 8 included
a possible cistern/septic pit (Feature 229), 2 pipe
trenches (Features 253 and 255), a dog burial
(Feature 268), and 44 structural post molds and
concrete pier/post supports (Features 224, 227,
228, 232, 235, 237, 241, 243, 245, 246–252, 254,
256–267, 269–283). Except for the dog burial, the
historic features and posts appear to be all related
to two large lumber sheds that appear on the 1919

or probable exhumed single grave (Feature 223)
were identified and recorded within Trench 8.
All the grave shafts and graves were concentrated
in the eastern 17 m of Trench 8, or approximately
7 m east of the western boundary of Lot 9. No
further evidence of cemetery site remains were
identified beyond this point. Trench 8 results
further confirmed the western extent of graves
present within the cemetery. Grave shafts in
Trench 8 were fairly densely placed, and most
43

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:57 PM Page 44

and 1926 Sanborn maps (see Figures 5 and 6).
Two historic setting trench features (253 and 255)
cut across Trench 8 in a north­south direction and
lined up with the pipe trench features discovered
in Trenches 1 and 2. This long, continuous setting
trench aligns with the western wall of the lumber
shed, which lines up parallel to the western
boundary for Lot 9. Post molds in the eastern half
of Trench 8 were also probably associated with the
lumber shed on Lot 9.
The possible cistern/septic pit feature (229)
within Trench 8 extended from the north trench
wall, and ca. 125 cm were exposed during scraping
activities in the bottom of the trench. The pit was
an irregularly shaped rectangle that contained
early­ to mid­20th­century artifacts and disturbed
portions of two single grave shaft features, 230 and
231 (Figure 34). This feature is in the approximate
location of the small rectangular room in the
northwest corner of the Lot 9 lumber shed, as
shown on the 1926 Sanborn map (Figure 6).
Several brick fragments found in the north
wall may represent structural remains of the
cistern/septic feature. Artifacts (recorded but not
collected) included brick fragments, metal scraps,
nails, wire fragments, window glass fragments, a
spark plug, brown beer bottle glass, clear bottle
glass fragments, and a soda bottle base with the
mark “PEERLESS BOTTLING WORKS
BROWNSVILLE, TEX.”
The posts and concrete pier supports exposed
in the western half of Trench 8 were probably
from the early­20th­century lumber shed building
that was near the northern Lot 7 and 8 property
lines (see Figures 5 and 6).
Test investigations in the western end of Trench
8 identified a confirmed dog burial (Feature
268) (Figure 35). The feature was 27 m from the
west end of the trench and approximately 7 cm
from the north wall. Maximum dimensions were
37 by 70 cm. Apparently special care was taken
to bury the dog in a metal container, since rusted
metal fragments were present with the exposed

Figure 35. Dog burial (Feature 268) in the western end of
Trench 8.

dog remains. Exposed identifiable canine bones
included portions of the rib cage, vertebrae frag­
ments, leg bone fragments, and cranial fragments.
The dog burial was reburied or backfilled with
the original trench soil at the end of the August
2005 testing project.
Trench 9
After the number and extent of the grave shaft
results were analyzed during the Phase II testing
field investigations for Trenches 1–8, it was decided
to conduct a more complete scraping of the upper
or northern portions of Lots 2, 3, and 4, which
encompassed the northern halves of Trenches 3, 4,
6, and 7 (see Figures 22a and 22c). This was desig­
nated as Trench 9. The large backhoe­scraped area
measured roughly 42 m east­west by 18 m north­
south. The additional scraping resulted in identifying
19 more undisturbed single grave shafts (Features
284–289, 291, 292, 296–302, and 307–310), and
4 more previously disturbed or probable exhumed
single graves (Features 303–306).
The majority of the undisturbed additional
grave shafts were located in the newly scraped area
between Trenches 6 and 7, a few scattered grave
shafts between Trenches 4 and 6, and one grave
shaft and three previously disturbed or exhumed
graves along the northern wall of Trench 9 (see
44

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:57 PM Page 45

Grave Shaft Features
A total of 88 undisturbed grave shaft features and
20 disturbed (probable previously exhumed) grave
features were discovered and recorded within
the Campo Santo Viejo cemetery site (41CF194)
during the Phase II testing investigations. The
grave shaft features are described below.
Undisturbed Grave Shafts
Of the 88 total undisturbed grave shafts identified,
35 were completely exposed grave shaft features in
which full dimensions were available. Fourteen
more had estimated dimensions available. The
remaining 39 were only portions of features that
protruded out from trench wall profiles or were
disturbed by overlying historic or modern features.
Several undisturbed graft shaft features were
believed to be probable double burials since they
were nearly twice the width of the average single
burial. Based on the THC and Keller’s (2005)
trench profiles, the grave shaft depths below surface
varied between approximately 15 to 46 cm below
surface with the average in the upper 15 to 25 cm
below surface and/or parking lot base. Of the 49
single grave shaft features, the majority were
straight­sided, rectangular­shaped shafts. Single
grave shafts ranged from very small (30 cm wide
by 65 cm long; Features 169 and 183) to very large
(100 cm wide by 240 cm long; Feature 286). The
largest are probably adult male burials, while the
smallest are probably infant burials. The 49 single
grave shafts were grouped by general age categories
based on estimated maximum grave shaft length
and the estimated maximum height of the individ­
ual, keeping in mind that children’s coffins would
have been considerably smaller than adult­sized
coffins and placed within the measured shaft
(this would have varied greatly, but is useful in
determining the possible number of individuals per
average age range). The single graves are estimated
to contain burials of 3 infants (65–100 cm), 8
toddlers and small children (110–130 cm), 8 older
adolescents or very small adults (140–160 cm),

Figure 36. Grave shaft Features 286 and 287, facing eastwest within Trench 9.

Figure 22a). Horizontal exposure of Trench 9
identified a large concentration of grave shafts
within the eastern three­quarters of Lot 4 with
sporadic individual graves inside the western 4 m
of Lot 3. Therefore, Trench 9 test investigations
further confirmed the boundary for the northwest
section of the Campo Santo Cemetery. In addition,
undisturbed grave shafts did not continue past
the southern boundary of Trench 9, which was
approximately in the middle of Lots 2 and 3;
instead, there is a large gap in the northeastern
quad of the upper or northern two lots where
there are no cemetery burials except for a few
scattered, previously exhumed graves along the
north and east boundaries. Within the concentrated
area of Lot 4, a few rows of grave shafts were
detected as having from 4 to 6 graves in each. In
addition, the graves shafts were either oriented
grid north or at an angle toward north­northeast.
Two undisturbed rectangular single grave shafts
(Features 286 and 287) were positioned in an
east­west direction and side by side (Figure 36).
Within the large scraped area, three pot hole
features (293, 294, and 295) that were identified
adjacent to the probable exhumed graves and only
one post mold feature (290) were discovered. No
other historic features were identified within
Trench 9.

Figure 37. Feature 183, probable infant burial, showing
grave shaft and wooden coffin outline.

Figure 38. Feature 158, probable large adult grave shaft and
wooden coffin outline in Trench 4.

10 small adults (170–190 cm), and 20 larger adults
(200–240 cm).
Evidence of wooden coffin outlines and their
associated coffin tacks were identified in only a
few grave shaft features, which provided more
detailed measurements of both grave shaft and
coffin size. A good example was Feature 183, the
smallest grave shaft, presumably for an infant. It
was 30x65 cm, with a barely visible very small
wooden coffin outline that measured approximately
15x55 cm; the foot end tapered to just 12 cm in
width (Figure 37).
In this instance, the shaft was originally dug just
large enough to bury the tiny grave. A much larger,
presumably adult, burial is grave shaft Feature 158
(Figures 38 and 39). The grave shaft outline meas­
ured approximately 225 cm maximum length by
55 cm wide at the north end and 80 cm wide at
the south end. The wooden coffin outline within

the shaft measured 190 cm long by 25 cm wide at
the north end and 40 cm wide on the southern
end. A coffin length of approximately 6.2 ft in
length is evidence for a probable large adult male
burial. The maximum space between the coffin and
the grave shaft outline was approximately 25 cm.
Since the project scope was to identify the
extent and number of grave shafts present within
the Campo Santo Viejo cemetery site, only a few
coffin outlines were exposed as describe above,
and results therefore did not include descriptions
of coffin or casket types, hardware, etc. However,
the two coffins that were identified were both
rectangular­shaped wooden coffins that were
slightly larger on the head end and tapered toward
the feet. During the latter half of the 19th century,
the standard American and British hexagonal coffin
(wider at the shoulders, narrowing toward the head
and feet, with a one­piece lid that was separated

from the rest and fixed down with screws) was
gradually replaced by the rectangular coffin or
“casket” because the appearance of the standard
coffin—which simulated the human outline—grew
distasteful to many because of the morbid image it
conveyed (Tine and Boyd 2003:27). Besides various
types of wood, iron caskets became common.

Figure 40. Feature 111, a square-shaped grave shaft.

During this period, the local cabinet or furniture
maker also served as an undertaker. In contrast to
the 18th­century use of generalized hardware
forms on coffins (i.e., tacks or hinges that would
not be out of place on household furniture), by
mid­19th­century, coffin builders used hinges,
tacks, and other fittings specifically designed for
mortuary use (Bell 1990:57).
In addition to the straight­sided rectangular­
shaped grave shafts, one possible grave feature was
a 42x42­cm square shaft with an irregular­shaped
burned area in the center (Feature 111, Figure 40).
This feature may have been evidence of a cremated
burial, or there is the possibility of it not being a
graft shaft at all but the remains of a charred post
mold. The average dimensions for rectangular
double grave shaft features were 140 cm wide by
200 cm long (as exhibited in Feature 179).
In a few instances, as mentioned in the trench
descriptions above, grave shaft features overlapped
others, as with the clustering of Features 165, 166,
167, and 220, exposed within Trench 4 (see Figures
22c and 33); Features 176, 177, and 178 in Trench
5 (Figure 41); and 139, 140, 143, and 144 within
Trench 3 (see Figure 22c). These findings may be
evidence of burials of nuclear or extended families.
Or they may be evidence of dense burying (as in
times of epidemics), or perhaps burials that hap­
pened at different periods, especially if the records
47

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:57 PM Page 48

for the placement of previous burials were lost or
forgotten. A fourth possibility is that these over­
lapping burials—and burials that are not oriented
into rows—may be clandestine or illegally placed
(Fernandez 2005; Keller 2005). However, Feature
220 is believed to be a young child’s grave, due to
its small size. It is possible, at least in this case, that
the infant was buried with family. However, the
only evidence for this is the grave shaft size and
spatial placement, not the physical human remains.

sometime during the mid­ to late 19th century,
especially during the period after the new
Brownsville cemetery opened its gates. In contrast
to the undisturbed grave shafts, which were
square­edged and rectangular­shaped, the disturbed
grave features were very irregularly shaped or
even rounded or globular. From the 20 identified,
12 were believed to be single graves and 5 were
probable double or multiple graves due to their
large size. Investigations resulted in identifying 7
complete single exhumation features, 5 complete
double exhumations, and portions of 8 possible
single exhumations. The exhumation features
ranged in size from ca. 100x140 cm for the smallest
(Feature 304) to ca. 190x430 cm for the largest
(Feature 305).

Disturbed Graves (Probable Exhumations)
A total of 20 previously disturbed or probable
exhumed grave features were identified during
the Phase II testing investigations. These features
are believed to have been previously exhumed

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
3. Remove the graves only from the area where
they are more scattered, converting that area to
a parking lot and converting the area with the
densest graves into a memorial park. The removed
remains would be reburied in the area where the
other graves lie.
On January 3, 2006, an official resolution was
adopted by the Commissioners Court of the
County of Cameron, Texas, “Agreeing to a cost
offset for the Dancy Building Restoration Project
from the Texas Historical Commission, Agreeing
to preserve the Old City of Brownsville Cemetery,
and Providing for related matters” (see page 51).
The resolution was signed and sealed by County
Judge Gilberto Hinojosa, county commissioners
of four precincts, and the county clerk.
Upon receiving the resolution, the THC
carried out the recommendations as outlined in
the resolution. At the end of January 2006, the
THC archeologists monitored backfilling of Trench
9 and the removal of the temporary fencing. In
addition, the human remains that Keller (2005)
recovered and analyzed were reburied together
in a wooden box, due to their disarticulated and
unprovenienced origin. The reinterment was
placed in the disturbed utility trench where they
originated. Cameron County representatives and
Mr. John Keller were present, and the reinterment
process was conducted by THC archeologists,
including Mr. Mark Denton. The reinterment
location was mapped with a Total Data Station,
and photographs were taken. No artifacts or
cultural remains were collected and therefore
no repository was required to fulfill the final
requirements of the project.

The 2005 Phase II testing investigations, in con­
junction with Keller’s 2004 work, was successful
in identifying the extent of the graves in the county­
owned lots that contained the remains of the Old
Brownsville City Cemetery, also known as Campo
Santo Viejo (41CF194), a designated State
Archeological Landmark. The cemetery site is a
significant cultural resource. The study positively
identified the presence of grave shafts within Lots
2 and 3; on the eastern portion of Lots 4 and 9;
and the western portion of Lot 10. The tested por­
tions of Lots 7 and 8 and the western half of Lot 4
did not show any evidence of having grave shafts.
The fieldwork also allowed a total estimate to be
made of 300 to 350 interments. Based on these
results, recommendations were made by the THC
to the county that there were three ways to pro­
ceed that would fully comply with the law and the
preservation of the cemetery. In brief, these
options were:
1. Remove all graves to a new location, probably
the new City of Brownsville Cemetery, which would
require a physical anthropologist’s examination of
all graves.
2. Leave graves in place and acquire other land for
parking. This option included recommendations
for creating a memorial park over the land con­
taining the graves, with grass or other shrubbery
planted in the area. A historical marker would be
placed to denote the location and significance of
the site. Other land near the courthouse would
be acquired for parking. Figure 42 is a plan map
illustrating the graves shafts present within a “no
disturbance” zone, illustrated in green.

Cameron County and Texas Historical Commission Resolution
WHEREAS, the Texas Historical Commission has provided grant funds to Cameron County, Texas, to assist
with the restoration of its Historic 1912 County Courthouse, also known as the Oscar C. Dancy Building;
and
WHEREAS, during said restoration, a cemetery was discovered adjacent to the Dancy Building on land
intended to be used as parking for the building; and
WHEREAS, said cemetery is believed to be the earliest recorded cemetery of the City of Brownsville, Texas;
and
WHEREAS, state law requires that graves be removed and that a district court withdraw the cemetery’s
dedication before any other use is instituted or that the graves and the cemetery be preserved in place;
and
WHEREAS, both Cameron County and the Texas Historical Commission desire that the cemetery be
preserved and the parking issue be resolved in the most cost efficient and expeditious manner consistent
with bestowing honor on the remains of the early deceased residents of Cameron County;
and
WHEREAS, cemetery preservation and parking resolution is imperative to complete the restoration of the
Dancy Building:
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COMMISSIONERS COURT OF THE COUNTY OF
CAMERON, TEXAS
1. THAT Cameron County and the Texas Historical Commission do hereby agree that the steps listed
below will be taken to preserve said cemetery, allow for parking for the Dancy Building, and provide for the
reimbursement of additional work on Dancy Building Restoration Project to help offset the cost to Cameron
County for cemetery preservation and any improvements to the surrounding land.
2. THAT Lots 7, 8, and the western portion of Lot 9 (as defined on the ground by the Texas Historical
Commission on the attached map), Block 144, Brownsville Original Townsite are ready for County use for
parking for the Dancy Building and that fencing currently around the property will be removed upon notice
to the Texas Historical Commission from the County.
3. THAT the County will locate and acquire additional property adjacent to the Dancy Building that will
supply additional parking spaces.
4. THAT the Texas Historical Commission will assist the County in the acquisition of additional property for
parking, to make up the loss of parking land that will remain a cemetery, at a price that is mutually agreeable
and in the best interest of the State of Texas.
5. THAT upon determination of the cost of the above items, the Texas Historical Commission will amend its
current grant agreement with the County, under the Texas Historical Courthouse Preservation Program, to
cover an equivalent amount of allowable costs for the Dancy Building Project Restoration, in an amount not
to exceed Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00).
6. THAT the County, at its expense, will create a memorial park on all cemetery areas where graves have been
identified and will place an appropriate historical marker to commemorate the cemetery, such areas being
more particularly described as Lots 2, 3, 4, 10, the eastern portion of Lot 9 (as defined on the ground by the
Texas Historical Commission on the attached map) and that part of Lot 11 owned by the Cameron County,
Block 144, Brownsville Original Townsite.
CONSIDERED AND ADOPTED THIS 3RD DAY OF JANUARY, 2006, BY THE COMMISSIONERS COURT
OF CAMERON COUNTY, TEXAS.

CampoSantoFinal:CampoSanto 4/8/10 4:57 PM Page 52

In conclusion, the THC’s evidence positively
confirmed the cemetery remains in portions of the
county­owned public lots within Block 144. The
THC only tested the area within the scope of this
project. However, based on these results and archival
evidence, there is a high probability that grave shafts
and evidence of human graves exist under the
city’s alleyway and the Lutheran Church–owned
portions of Block 144. In addition, archeological

investigations will be needed for any future devel­
opment for the quarter of Block 144 that currently
contains private rental/residential housing.
In the end, the goals of the preservation efforts
by Cameron County and the THC to preserve the
Old City Cemetery as a memorial park are to
provide awareness and appreciation of the newly
discovered old cemetery for both locals and visitors
to the area.
