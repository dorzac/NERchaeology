Abstract
In February 2017, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an intensive
archeological survey for proposed improvements to Interstate Highway (I) 35 from South
of State Highway (SH) 80 to North of Ranch-to-Market (RM) 12 through the City of San
Marcos in Hays County, Texas (CSJ No. 0016-03-114). The proposed project would realign
entrance and exit ramps, reconstruct frontage roads, make intersection improvements
at SH 123, replace frontage road bridges over the San Marcos River and Willow Springs
Creek, replace bridges at SH 123/Guadalupe Streets, and construct a new shared-use
path along the northbound frontage road to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian use.
The total project length is 2.58 miles and the project area encompasses 116.7 acres.
AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7880.
The scope of the work for the survey focused on inspection of the area affected by bridge
replacements at the San Marcos River and Willow Creek only. Archeological investigations
consisted of a pedestrian survey, excavation of nine shovel tests, and six backhoe trenches
within those portions of the Area of Potential Effects (APE) with potential for archeological
deposits. Archeologists observed numerous landscape modifications resulting from
transportation, commercial, and other earth-moving activities within the APE. However,
cultural material associated with two archeological sites was still present at the San
Marcos River. Lithic material documented during trenching along the east side of the river
is associated with Site 41HY261, which was documented in 1994. One new prehistoric
site, 41HY534, was recorded on a terrace west of the river. Site 41HY534 consists of
lithic debris and faunal bone fragments. Artifacts associated with Site 41HY261 are not
considered to contribute to the eligibility of the site, and Site 41HY534 is not considered
eligible within the APE. This report recommends that no additional archeological work
within any part of the APE is warranted at this time. No artifacts were collected during this
survey. All documents and photographs generated during this survey will be permanently
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Management Summary
In February 2017, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological
survey in advance of the proposed improvements to Interstate Highway (I) 35 from South
of State Highway (SH) 80 to North of Ranch-to-Market (RM) 12 on behalf of the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in Hays County, Texas (CSJ No. 0016-03-114). The
project is 2.58 miles in length and encompasses 116.7 acres of existing right-of-way (ROW)
plus 0.298 acres of driveway licenses (Figure 1).
Currently, I-35 is a six-lane divided highway with two-lane frontage roads running parallel
to the highway. The proposed project would realign entrance and exit ramps, reconstruct
frontage roads, make intersection improvements at SH 123, replace frontage road bridges
over the San Marcos River and Willow Springs Creek, replace bridges at SH 123/Guadalupe
Streets, and construct a new shared-use path along the northbound frontage road to
accommodate bicycle and pedestrian use. The proposed improvements are designed to
enhance mobility and accommodate increased traffic due to population growth and new
development in the City of San Marcos.
The project will require no new ROW, although 18 driveway licenses would be needed to
accommodate access from adjacent properties. These driveway licenses would encompass
0.298 acres in total.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint
of the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact and project specific locations.
Thus, the APE for archeological resources will cover a total distance of approximately 2.58
miles and encompasses approximately 116.7 acres of existing ROW, plus 0.298 acres
of driveway licenses. The maximum depth of impacts would be four feet or less except
at Willow Springs Creek and the San Marcos River where impacts from new bridge piers
would extend greater than 25 feet into the subsurface.
The project is being funded with federal transportation dollars provided by FHWA and will
take place on ROW owned by the State of Texas. Therefore, Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) apply.
AmaTerraâs work conformed to the guidelines under 36 CFR Part 800 and 13 TAC Chapter
26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 and ACT, respectively.
Currently, the majority of the APE is maintained as roadway, with commercial and
residential development abutting it. These areas have almost no potential for archeological
materials. However, the area around the San Marcos River has a very high number of
previously recorded sites and background research suggests that the floodplain within
the existing ROW could be relatively intact. Coordination with TxDOT resulted in a survey
recommendation for the portion of the project around the San Marcos River and Willow
Creek (Figure 2), where archeological materials could be present.

Archeological Resource Survey of I-35, South of SH 80 to North of RM 12, Hays County, Texas

AmaTerraâs archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and backhoe trenching within the designated survey area. Field investigations took place
on February 8-10, 2017 under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7880. Rachel Feit acted as
Principal Investigator and Joshua Hill served as Project Archeologist. A total of 40 person
hours were expended in the field in support of this project. Shovel testing and backhoe
trenching around the San Marcos River did produce low density archeological materials
consisting primarily of prehistoric flaking debris. Artifacts recorded in trenches east of
the river are associated with site 41HY261, and were probably washed downslope. Site
41HY534 was identified on the west side of the river on a terrace. However, no intact
features were documented in either location, and in general investigators observed that
soils within the survey were typically disturbed to a depth of approximately 30 centimeters.
This report recommends that no further archeological work within the APE is warranted at
this time. No artifacts were collected during this survey. All documents and photographs
generated during fieldwork for this project will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
This report is divided into six chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented
during the project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter
6 presents the summary and recommendations. Appendix A includes current schematics
and profiles and Appendix B contains the shovel test results.

Chapter 2

Environmental Background and Setting
The project area is located along I-35 in San Marcos, Texas in an area that is almost
completely urbanized. Residential and commercial development around the project area
has mostly occurred since the 1950s, and increased after the construction of I-35. Prior to
the construction of the highway, most land around the APE was utilized for farming.

2.1	Environmental Setting
The project is located within the Blackland Prairie vegetative region (Stahl and McElvaney
2012). More specifically, it is located within the San Marcos River Floodplain. In Texas, crop
production (i.e., cotton, and grain sorghum) has thoroughly impacted the original Blackland
Prairie (Omernik and Griffith 2009; Stahl and McElvaney 2012). Annually, the ecoregion
receives approximately 33â34 inches of precipitation and has a mean air temperature of
67 degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2016).
The deep soil deposits of the Northern Blackland Prairie support numerous tall-mid
grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon
gerardii), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), eastern
gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum), which are the
natural vegetative species for this environment (Omernik and Griffith 2009). In addition,
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis laevigata),
juniper (Juniperus ashei), and live oak (Quercus virginiana) are often observed within
the low flat woodlands along streams located within the Blackland Prairie (Omernik
and Griffith 2013). Since the nineteenth century, human land modifications along with
ranching/grazing activities have resulted in a dramatic increase in invader flora species
(e.g., mesquite, buffalo grass).

2.2	Topography
Overall, the APE is flat plain, though the survey area is located within the terrace slopes
flanking the San Marcos River and Willow Creek, which feeds into the San Marcos River
east of the project area. Elevation within the survey area varies between 550 and 570 feet
above mean sea level.

2.3	Geology and Soils
Geologically, the project area is characterized by alluvial sediments transported and
deposited by the San Marcos River. The project crosses two natural waterways: the San
Marcos River and Willow Springs Creek slightly to the south. According to the United States

Department of Agriculture â Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web
Soil Survey (2016), soils within the APE consist of Krum Clay (1â3 percent slopes), Branyon
clay (0â1 percent slopes), Houston black clay (1â3 percent slopes), Lewisville silty clay
(1â3 percent slopes), and Tinn clay (0â1 percent slopes, frequently flooded). These soils
are deep clays that develop atop Cretaceous limestone; however, surface sediments in
the APE are primarily Holocene and Pleistocene alluvium associated with the San Marcos
River drainage basin (Bureau of Economic Geology 1979). Holocene soils in undisturbed
contexts tend to have high potential to contain buried intact archeological deposits and
these deposits may extend beyond the maximum depth of manual shovel testing (80â100
cm [31â39 inches]). According to the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the
Austin district (Abbott and Pletka 2015), the area around the San Marcos River is classified
as having high potential (Map Units 6, and 9) for deep prehistoric archeological deposits,
and moderate potential for shallow deposits. The remainder of the APE generally has low
to moderate potential for prehistoric archeological remains (Figure 3).

Chapter 3

Cultural Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004).
The cultural chronology is typically divided into four major periods: Paleoindian (15,000â
8500 years before present (BP)), Archaic (8500-1250 BP), Late Prehistoric (ca. 1250â
250 BP), and Historic (250 BP to present) (Perttula 2004). The Prehistoric periods are
principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points and other technologies,
but are intended to delineate change in socio-cultural patterns. However, cultural change
proceeded at somewhat different rates across Texas. In some regions, hunting and
gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory; in others, cultures with farming and
settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures in Central Texas appeared to maintain a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric Period, with
moderate changes in technology.

3.1	Paleoindian (ca. 15,000â8500 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred between 16,000 and 14,500 BP
(Gilbert et al. 2008, Pitblado 2011), and until recently, it was generally thought that
the Paleoindian Period in Texas did not begin until around 12,000 BP (Perttula 2004).
However, new evidence from the Debra Friedkin and Gault sites in Central Texas have
begun to push the date of earliest occupation back to around 15,000 BP (Swaminathan
2014; Gault School 2016). As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials in
the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the archeological
record. These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears.
Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such as
mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse were hunted (Black 1989). In addition
to megafauna, Paleoindian groups also subsisted on antelope, turtle, frogs, rabbit, fish,
other small animals, and some flora (Bousman et al. 2004). Stylistic changes in projectile
point technology occurred during this later portion of the period, eventually shifting to
Dalton, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. While widespread in geographic range,
these types occurred in high densities in the High Plains and Central Texas (Meltzer and
Bever 1995). Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter
and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001), gradually shifting to drier and warmer conditions
during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off during the
shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns relied more upon smaller game and plant
foraging.

3.2

Archaic in Central Texas (ca. 8500â1250 BP)

The Archaic period, broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic sub-periods,
signifies a more intensive exploitation of local floral and faunal resources with diversification

of lithic technologies (Collins 2004). The archeological record begins to indicate more
widespread use of burned rock middens, a wider variety of site functions, and more
localized geographic distributions of these materials.
Hester places the Early Archaic between 7950 and 4450 BP based on Early Corner
Notched and Early Basal Notched projectile points (1995:436â438). Collinsâ dating of the
Early Archaic period to 8800â6000 BP is founded on unstemmed point types (1995:383).
Around 8000 BP, styles transitioned to stemmed varieties such as the Martindale and
Uvalde (Black 1989), but unstemmed Early Triangular points were also in use as well
(Turner and Hester 1999). With the extinction of megafauna, changing subsistence
patterns show an increased reliance on deer, fish, and plants. In the archeological record,
this trend equates to greater densities of ground stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock midden
features, and task specific tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe and Nueces
bifaces (Turner and Hester 1999). A great deal of Guadalupe Bifaces are recovered near
river drainage systems like the San Antonio River, flowing toward the Gulf Coast off the
Edwards Plateau, and are thought to function as primarily woodworking tools in a hafted
capacity (Black and McGraw 1985). Most Early Archaic open-campsite concentrations
were distributed along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau in areas
with reliable water sources. Population densities were relatively low and consisted of small
bands with a fairly high degree of mobility (Story 1985:39). Loeve-Fox, Jetta Court, and
Sleeper sites are representative sites of the Early Archaic (Collins 1995).
Middle Archaic materials date from about 6000 to 4000 BP, with increased occurrence of
multiuse bifacial knives and burned rock middens (Collins 1995). Diagnostic points from
this period include Bell, Andice, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. The Tortugas point also appears
in Middle Archaic contexts and possibly earlier (Turner and Hester 1999). According to
Collins (1995, 2004), large-game hunting of bison still occurred in the beginning of the
Middle Archaic, and the climate became much drier toward the end of the Middle Archaic.
This climatic change necessitated a heavier reliance on sotol and acorn harvesting (Collins
2004; Weir 1976). An expansion of oak woodlands on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment may have been conducive to the intensified exploitation of certain plants (Weir
1976). This period also experienced population increases, and it is possible that previously
scattered bands of hunter-gatherers began to combine harvesting and processing efforts
(Weir 1976). Panthers Spring Site, Landslide, Wounded Eye, and Gibson sites demonstrate
cultural trends of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995).
The last sub-period of the Archaic falls between 4000 and 800 BP (Collins 1995). Dart
points of the Late Archaic are somewhat smaller, triangular points with corner notches
such as the Ensor and Ellis (Turner and Hester 1999). Other Late Archaic points include
Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). It is not entirely clear whether
this period experienced a rise (Collins 1995; Prewitt 1981) or decline (Black 1989) in
population numbers, but large cemeteries, grave goods, and exotic trade items are known
to occur at this time at sites such as Loma Sandia, Rudy Haiduk, Silo, Ernest Witte, and
Morhiss Mound in Central and South Texas. Evidence from the Thunder Valley sinkhole
cemetery has suggested that territoriality may have been a social feature of the Late
10

Archeological Resource Survey of I-35, South of SH 80 to North of RM 12, Hays County, Texas

Archaic, possibly as a result of population increase (Bement 1989). The frequency of
burned rock middens and open campsites appears to increase. Characteristic Late Archaic
sites include the Anthon and Loeve Fox sites (Collins 1995).

3.3	Late Prehistoric (ca. 1250â250 BP)
There exists some degree of overlap between diagnostic tools that are considered Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric, but the commonly held date for the beginning of this interval
is 1250 BP. A hallmark transition for this period is the introduction of the bow and arrow,
which enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest prey from greater distances with a lesser
need for brushless, wide open spaces required for atlatl manoeuvrability. The use of arrows
is indicated by smaller-sized projectile points such as Perdiz and Scallorn. Another turning
point in the Late Prehistoric period is the first substantial presence of pottery in the northern
South Texas Plain and Central Texas (Black 1989; Collins 2004; Story 1985). Incidences of
burned rock middens and ground stone artifacts increased as Late Prehistoric populations
relied more heavily on plant food consumption. Many Late Prehistoric sites rest along
creeks during this period as opposed to dispersing along other landforms. Researchers
generally agree that during the beginning of this period there was a drop in population
(Black 1989). Although burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points
have been recorded (Goode 1991; Houk and Lohse 1993), most researchers argue that
such cases are rare. However, the âheyday of middeneryâ eventually peaked during the
Late Prehistoric (Black et al. 1997). Inter-group conflicts between various bands of huntergatherers may have also been an issue, based on evidence of arrow inflicted deaths
seen in human remains from various Late Prehistoric cemeteries. Sites with distinct Late
Prehistoric components include the Kyle, Smith, and Currie sites (Collins 1995). Interval
divisions for this period are the Austin and Toyah phases. Johnson (1994) believes these
phases may possibly be two distinct cultures (see Black et al. 1997).
The Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric eventually demonstrated intensive use of burned
rock middens (Black et al. 1997), and includes the appearance of diagnostic point types
Scallorn and Edwards (Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999). During this phase, the use
of burned rock middens is still quite widespread and may even be on the rise (Mauldin et
al. 2003). The Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric suggests interaction between Central
Texas and ceramic-producing traditions in East and North Texas with the presence of bonetempered, plainware ceramics (Perttula et al. 1995). Ceramics were in common usage
in East Texas by 2450 BP, but the first Central Texas plainwares did not appear until ca.
650/700 BP. Other technological traits of this phase include the diagnostic Perdiz point,
alternately beveled bifaces, and specialized processing kits as an adaption to flourishing
bison populations (Ricklis 1992).

3.4	Historic (250 BPâPresent)
The effect that Europeans had on Indians in Texas prior to about 1700 is not wellunderstood. What is known is that the initial wave of Spanish and French missionaries
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

11

Archeological Resource Survey of I-35, South of SH 80 to North of RM 12, Hays County, Texas

and explorers spread disease that killed, displaced, and fragmented a huge percentage
of the population. Based on available information, the Historic Period in Central Texas is
characterized by the displacement of indigenous groups by other Native American and
Mexican groups (e.g. the Comanche and Coahuiltecan groups), and significant cultural
and political change influenced by European contact (Collins 2004). Spanish Missions had
little direct impact in Central Texas, but European influence had a significant impact on
indigenous groups. Historians believe that pressures caused by European contact, directly
or indirectly, led to intense territorial disputes, further destabilizing Native American
populations. Archeological sites dating to this period contain a mix of both European
(e.g., metal and glass arrow points, trade beads, and wheel-made or glazed ceramics) and
traditional Native American artifacts (e.g., manufactured stone tools).
European settlement in Hays County occurred in the mid-nineteenth century (Texas State
Historical Association [TSHA] 2016). The early economy of the area was based on farming
and ranching. The railroads began building lines through Hays County in the 1880s, which
contributed to economic growth at the end of the nineteenth century (TSHA 2016).
Several early Spanish colonization attempts occurred in San Marcos: In 1755 the Spanish
established the San Xavier Missions and Presidio near the headwaters of the San Marcos
River. These were moved after only eight months and the Spanish completely abandoned
the area until 1808, when San Marcos de Neve was founded. Indian raids, however, caused
settlers to flee by 1812, once again leaving San Marcos largely depopulated. It was not
until 1846 that settlers of European descent returned to the San Marcos area. Thomas
McGehee and William Moon are generally considered to be the first settlers in the area.
McGehee settled near San Marcos Springs, while Moon settled on the site that became
the town of San Marcos. Soon several members of Jack Haysâ Texas Rangers established
homes and businesses near San Marcos. By 1848 two stagecoach lines ran from Austin
to San Marcos. In 1851, Edward Burleson, William Lindsey and Eli Merriman laid out the
town center. Lindsey operated a shingle production business, Burleson operated the first
sawmill in San Marcos, and Merriman was the townâs first doctor. San Marcos became
the regional center for ginning and milling agricultural products from around Hays and
Comal Counties. Cattle and cotton were the leading products from surrounding farms and
ranches (TSHA 2016).
Growth of San Marcos was slow until 1881, when the International & Great Northern
Railroad was built along the edge of town. Population doubled as a result of increased
access to products, markets and other towns. In 1903 the Southwest Texas State Normal
School (now Texas State) opened, along with the San Marcos Baptist Academy, and these
universities drew additional population to the town. During the middle of the twentieth
century, Aquarena Springs and Wonder Cave opened as visitor attractions and tourism also
became an important industry in San Marcos. Today, the town relies heavily on the income
and population generated from Texas State, and has become a bedroom community for
neighbouring Austin (TSHA 2016).

3.5	Land Modifications and Historical Land Use
Topographic maps from 1910â1911 show that the project APE was outside San Marcos
town center. At that time, the APE contained a few farmhouses, mainly clustered around
the San Marcos River and Willow Creek (Figure 4). A 1958 aerial photograph of the project
area shows that I-35 was being built, and within the APE was mostly still a two-lane highway.
Residential and commercial growth had spread from the town center to the APE (Figure 5).
Currently, most of the property in and around the APE has been developed as roadway
or for commercial use. The construction of I-35 and adjacent development has almost
certainly destroyed the structures depicted in the APE on the 1910â1911 topographic
maps.
Residential or commercial land use abuts most of the APE. Common disturbances within
the APE include artificially levelled and paved surfaces, soil berms, and buried utility lines
and poles (Figures 6 and 7). Disturbances occur throughout the APE since residential and
commercial development is prevalent in the area.

Previous Investigations
A number of previous investigations have occurred within and around the APE and there
are dozens of sites in and around San Marcos. Background research for this project
consisted of an online records search through the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC)
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; accessed April 2016) and a review of historical maps and
aerial photographs. Research focused on the identification of archeological sites, sites
listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs),
sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), Official Texas Historical
Martkers (OTHMs), cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological surveys within
0.62 miles (one kilometer) of the APE (Figure 8). The search identified 13 archeological
sites, numerous previously conducted archeological surveys, five National Register sites
and two National Register districts, one RTHL and two historical markers within a kilometer
of the APE. Although none of these cultural resources are mapped in the APE, survey may
reveal that one or more of the archeological sites extend into it. Further detail about the
archeological sites is provided below:
â¢ Site 41HY133 was recorded in 1977 as a multicomponent site observed on the surface
and up to at least 80 centimeters below surface. It was listed as an SAL in 1987 and
is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. The site is located along the San Marcos
River approximately 2,800 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY134 was originally recorded in 1977 as a multicomponent site spanning
the Paleoindian through historic periods. It was listed as an SAL in 2005 and is
considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. The site is located along the San Marcos
River approximately 300 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY135 was recorded in 1977 as a prehistoric campsite on a prominent knoll
overlooking the San Marcos River at its confluence with Purgatory Creek. It was listed
as an SAL in 1987 and is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. The site is located
along the San Marcos River approximately 3,000 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY141 was also originally recorded in 1977 as a multicomponent site spanning
the Paleoindian through historic periods. It was listed as an SAL in 2005 and is
considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. The site is located along the San Marcos
River approximately 1,000 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY164 was recorded in 1982 as the location of Thompsonâs Dam and Millrace.
The site was part of an antebellum plantation during the mid-nineteenth century. Today
the only structure features evident are the remains of a dam and millrace along the
San Marcos River. Prehistoric features and artifacts have also been documented at

the site. The site is listed in the NRHP and as a SAL. The site is located approximately
1,500 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY166 is a prehistoric to historic period site, originally recorded in 1984. Site
recorders noted Montell and Ensor dart points, along with a possible Castroville preform
in shovel tests and backhoe trenches. Archeological deposits ranged in depth from
10-150 centimeters below the surface. Other materials observed included burned rock,
charcoal, bone and mussel shell and historic period materials. Further archeological
testing to determine NRHP/SAL-eligibility was recommended. The site is located along
the San Marcos River approximately 2,400 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY167 was recorded in 1984 on the site of the former Fish Hatchery. It is a
prehistoric site characterized by flakes, an arrow point preform, mussel shell, and bone
buried up to depths of 55 centimeters below the surface. A basin-shaped charred
lens of charcoal and burned rock was observed in one backhoe trench. Historic period
debris was also noted in one corner of the site. Recorders indicated that the site has
potential for NRHP/SAL-eligibility, but at present its eligibility is undetermined. The site
is located approximately 3,300 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY261 is a multicomponent Paleoindian through protohistoric period campsite,
and historic period dam and millrace along the San Marcos River. The site was first
recorded in 1994 and has been resurveyed and re-recorded several times since then. It
is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP and was listed as a SAL in 2013. Although
the site has been documented on multiple occasions no data recovery investigations
have ever taken place. The site is located approximately 200 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY393 was recorded in 2005 as a prehistoric site containing chert flakes, animal
bone, charcoal and fire cracked rock in shovel tests to depths of 50 centimeters. No
intact features were observed and the site was recommended as not eligible for listing
in the NRHP. It is located 1,200 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY425, also known as Rogerâs Ranch, represents the remains of a 1912â
1950s river resort. The site was recorded in 2006 prior to City of San Marcos park
improvements. Recorders observed house foundations and domestic debris in shovel
tests and backhoe trenches. Further testing was recommended to determine NRHP/
SAL-eligibility. The site is located approximately 1,500 feet from the APE in a city park.
â¢ Site 41HY432 consists of a low density scatter of prehistoric lithic debitage and burned
rock, located on the east bank of the San Marcos River. Artifacts were recovered
between approximately 10 and 70 centimeters below the surface. It was recorded in
2007 in advance of construction of a pedestrian bridge and recommended as not
eligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL. The site is located approximately 3,300 feet
from the APE.

â¢ Site 41HY489 was recorded in 2013 prior to construction of an apartment complex
along the San Marcos River. It is a prehistoric lithic scatter with a historic period
domestic debris component. Prehistoric materials consisted of secondary and tertiary
flakes and one fire cracked rock. Historic period debris included whiteware, wire nails,
a belt buckle, bottle glass shards, and various metal fragments. Material was observed
on the surface and in shovel tests and was believed to extend deeper. Site recorders
believed the site may be associated with Site 41HY164, Thompsonâs Dam and Millrace.
The site was recommended for further testing along the river, but was determined to be
not eligible where the apartments were constructed. The site is located approximately
300 feet from the APE.
â¢ Site 41HY517 is characterized by a historic period structure foundation and domestic
debris scatter. It was recorded in 2015 during a survey of Veteranâs Park. Recorders
documented eight building foundations still in place along with a window glass, nails,
bottle glass, crown caps, and pop tops and other twentieth century debris. The site
form notes that the area was formerly a neighborhood comprising about 30 houses.
The site is located about 200 feet from the APE in Veteranâs Park. It is considered not
eligible for NRHP/SAL-listing.
To summarize, the search of previous investigations found many archeological sites within
close proximity to the APE with the potential for four of them (Sites 41HY517, 41HY489,
41HY134, and 41HY261) to extend into the APE. Of these four sites that may extend into
the APE, three of them are listed in the NRHP or as SALs. Previous work in San Marcos has
documented sites of both historic and prehistoric period significance and for this reason,
an archeological survey was conducted in the APE around the San Marcos River.

Methodology
Prior to the field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the
potential for buried or near-surface historic archeological materials. This research involved
examining historical maps (Perry-CastaÃ±eda Library 2016) and aerial photographs. As
mentioned above, archeologists consulted soils and PALM data and the Atlas to assess the
potential for prehistoric archeological sites within the APE. Consulting these resources not
only allowed investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded archeological
sites within the APE, but also to gain a sense of site types (e.g., historic or prehistoric),
artifact types, and average depth of cultural material below the surface, among other
things.
Archeological investigations were carried out in accordance with the THC/Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) survey standards (as referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy).
These standards recommend one test every 328 feet (100 m) for linear projects less than
100 feet in width. AmaTerra physically inspected about 24.9 acres or about 0.5 miles
of the total 116-acre APE which were determined to have potential to contain cultural
resources. This inspection was conducted on foot through visual reconnaissance, through
shovel tests and backhoe trenches. Archeologists observed multiple areas of disturbance,
including bridges and bridge piers, drainage ditches, utility and gas lines, and paved
areas. These areas were photographed, and archeologists made notes on the conditions
they encountered during their investigations. Shovel tests were deemed unwarranted
at a number of locations given the obvious disturbances. Archeologists shovel tested in
some of these locations to confirm disturbance of soils. As a result, nine shovel tests
were distributed throughout the APE in an effort to assess potential for any archeological
remains.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 80 cm
below the surface or until restrictive features (e.g., water or basal clay) were encountered.
The shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm increments and all soil was screened through
a Â¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a
standardized form. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. This archeological
investigation was a non-collection survey; therefore, any artifacts encountered during the
course of the work were returned to their original location.
Backhoe trenching along the San Marcos River and Willow Creek was conducted in
accessible locations without obvious signs of disturbance to assess potential for deeply
buried deposits. If buried archeological resources were present, backhoe trenches would
help define the horizontal and vertical extent of those deposits. During this investigation, six
trenches were excavated within the project area. Investigators screened a representative
sample of each soil strata from the trenches. Profiles were recorded, and all trenches were
photographed and documented on standardized forms.

An archeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural materials or features
older than 50 years of age within a given area. The definition of a site is: (1) five or more
surface artifacts within a 15-m (50-foot) radius; (2) a single cultural feature, such as a
midden or cistern, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing; (3) a positive
shovel test containing at least five total artifacts; or (4) two positive shovel tests located
within 30 m (98 feet) of each other. Archeologists documented one area containing
archeological material which met these criteria; it was designated Site 41HY534. Cultural
material recorded in another location is probably associated with Site 41HY261.

Results
AmaTerra surveyed the APE through visual inspection, shovel testing, and backhoe
trenching on February 8 through 10, 2017. Archeologists found the terrain to be largely flat,
sloping towards the San Marcos River and Willow Creek, and the ROW was typically open
with mowed grasses or interspersed with trees and shrubs along the drainages. Much of
the project area has been disturbed by previous roadway construction and development
along I-35, buried utilities, and modifications along drainages which cross the APE (Figures 9
through 11).

under the I-35 Bridge (facing east).

Investigators had access to the entire survey area, and surveyed all 24.9 acres within the
identified high probability segment. The visual survey included a walkover inspection of
the ground surface within the ROW. Surface visibility was typically low or poor in the survey
area due to grass coverage and vegetation. No artifacts were observed on the surface
during pedestrian survey.
In addition to the visual inspection, nine shovel tests and six backhoe trenches were
excavated within existing ROW in order to evaluate the APE for the presence of subsurface
archeological deposits (Figure 12). Archeologists did not conduct subsurface excavation
in obviously disturbed areas. These areas included the buried utility corridors along the
frontage roads, soil berms, paved areas, and concrete-lined drainage facilities. Trenching
was conducted along the San Marcos River and Willow Creek to investigate the potential for
deeply buried archeological deposits. Trenches were placed in locations which appeared
not to be previously disturbed where the backhoe could gain access. Two trenches were
placed near Willow Creek and four were placed near the San Marcos River. Cultural
materials associated with 41HY261 were documented in two of the trenches placed on the
east bank of the San Marcos River. One new archeological site (41HY534) was documented
within the survey area on the west side of the river, and five shovel tests excavated within
the boundary contained cultural material.
A typical soil profile in undisturbed areas of the APE consisted of a very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay which extended past 80 centimeters below
surface (cmbs) or terminated between 40 and 80 cmbs when a yellowish brown (10YR
5/6) or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay was reached. In shovel tests disturbed soils
did not typically extend deeper than 25 cmbs. Average shovel test depth was 70 cmbs,
though shovel tests terminated between 40 and 80 cmbs (Figure 13). Cultural materials
were observed in five shovel tests, which were all located on a terrace west of the river and
south of the northbound I-35 frontage road in a location designated 41HY534.

6.1	Site 41HY534
Site 41HY534 is located on a terrace bend of the San Marcos River of I-35 (Figures 14 and
15). Within the APE, the site extends along approximately 60 meters of the northbound
frontage road. The site was located via shovel testing within a three-meter strip of the
ROW between a corridor of buried utilities and the edge of the APE. The site boundary
within the APE was defined based on the presence of cultural material in that thin strip
of intact landform. To the north of the site, steep slopes and extensive erosion make
additional intact material unlikely. To the south, the ROW constricts and is wholly disturbed.
Additionally, construction of a pump station and the roadway have disturbed archeological
deposits within the existing ROW to varying degrees. The typical depth of disturbance was
20 cmbs. Prehistoric components also likely extend southeast to the edge of the river,
which probably defines the site boundary to the east and north. Investigators observed
structural foundations outside the APE adjacent to the river, which may have impacted
41HY534 if the site does extend to the edge of the terrace in that location.

Soil profiles within the site consisted of a mottled gravelly dark yellowish brown (10YR
4/4) silty clay overlying a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay. The upper zone
is interpreted to be disturbed and mixed with fill material, while the lower zone was
considered to be intact soil deposits. Shovel tests within the site typically extended to a
depth of 70 cmbs until encountering highly compacted soils. One shovel test encountered
brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) basal clay at approximately 40 cmbs.
All five shovel tests excavated on the terrace within the APE contained cultural material
(Table 1). Given the small sliver of testable land within the APE, this number of tests was
judged sufficient to define the site limits with respect to the ROW. Artifacts recorded at the
site include five flakes, seven pieces of lithic debris, three faunal bone fragments, and two
shards of dark green glass (Figures 16 and 17). The glass shards were identified in disturbed
soils, which also contained prehistoric materials, and are considered modern intrusions
associated with the highway or the relocation of the pump station (Figure 18). The amount
of prehistoric material recorded within the disturbed soil zone suggests that the site, as
encountered within the APE, has limited integrity. No backhoe trenches were excavated at
Site 41HY534 because impacts from the shared use path at this location will not extend
below three feet. Site 41HY534 is a prehistoric site of unknown age, since no temporally
diagnostic artifacts were recorded within the APE. The site probably extends outside of the
APE and may contain eligible cultural deposits, but given the very narrow sliver of the site
within the APE, no further work is recommended at this time.

6.2	Trenching Results
Six backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated within the project area. Two were excavated
around Willow Creek and four were placed around the San Marcos River (see Figure 12).
Soil profiles typically consist of dark brown or dark yellowish brown silty clays overlying a
brown or yellow brown basal clay deposit (Table 2). Neither trench placed near Willow Creek
north of the highway (BHTs 1 and 2) recovered cultural material, but two (BHTs 3 and 4) of
the four trenches placed on the east bank of the San Marcos River did uncover prehistoric
cultural material.
Trench 1 was placed near the southwest corner of the project area adjacent to a modified
section of Willow Creek. Construction of the drainage did not impact the soil deposits, and
trenching uncovered intact silty clay soils (Figure 19). The trench was terminated at 2.5
meters in depth in a sterile clay deposit.

Figure 19. Profile drawing of BHT 1.

Trench 2 was placed near Willow Creek, adjacent to the southbound I-35 Frontage Road.
The trench profile confirmed the modification of this part of the APE by roadway construction
and maintenance. A layer of topsoil overlays crushed limestone road grade and other fill
material.
Trench 3 was placed north of the southbound I-35 Frontage Road bridge near the frontage
road connector east of the San Marcos River. The first 40 cmbs have been disturbed by
roadway and bridge construction, but the rest of the deposit appears to be undisturbed
alluvial deposits (Figure 20). The deposits in Zone 2 (40â80 cmbs) appear to be flood
deposits, or an old drainage channel or alluvial eddy; one flake was recorded in these
deposits (Figure 21). A 10-centimeter thick shell lens was recorded at 110 cmbs on the
east side of BHT 3. It is probable that the flake recorded in Zone 2 was washed in from
somewhere upslope or upriver based on the nature of the deposit.

Trench 4 was placed southwest of BHT 3, adjacent to the river. Zone 1 (0â40 cmbs) is a
flood deposit which has been at least partly disturbed based on the presence of asphalt
and modern trash. Zone 1 is underlain by a 10-centimeter thick sand lens, which sits atop
a clay deposit (Zone 3) (Figure 22). The water table was encountered at 1.5 meters below
the surface. A small flake was recorded in the wall of Zone 3, and was the only artifact
recorded within the trench.

Figure 22. Profile drawing of BHT 4.

Trench 5 was placed adjacent to the river between the highway bridge and the northbound
frontage road. The deposits within the trench are mostly disturbed within the first 80 cm
of the excavation. Zone 3 is a terrace deposit, which appears to have been excavated into
previously. No cultural material was recorded in BHT 5 and the water table was encountered
at 1.5 meters below the surface.
Trench 6 was placed northeast of BHT 5 and south of the I-35 bridge. The deposits in BHT
6 are significantly different than those recorded in BHTs 3, 4 and 5. Crushed limestone
construction fill was recorded to a depth of 60 cmbs, and compacted mottled clay was
encountered between 60 cmbs and 1.5 meters in depth. No cultural material was recorded
in BHT 6.

6.2	Site 41HY261
As previously described, two trenches (BHTs 3 and 4) contained a small amount of cultural
material. BHT 3 documented a flake 40â80 cmbs and a thin shell lens at 100 cmbs. This
shell lens was within a brown silty clay (10YR 4/4). BHT 4 contained one flake at a depth of
50â120 cmbs within a brown mottled clay deposit (10YR 4/3). Both trenches were placed
north of the southbound I-35 frontage road bridge between the San Marcos River and the
frontage road connector. The water table within BHTs 3 and 4 was encountered at depths
of 120â150 cmbs, preventing further exploration. Two additional trenches place nearby,
BHTs 5 and 6, contained no cultural material. In the case of BHT 6, disturbances due to
road construction were encountered to a depth of 60 cmbs.
The flakes and shell material documented in the two trenches were attributed to existing
Site 41HY261, which was recorded on the same side of the San Marcos River less
than 200 feet north of the APE. Site boundaries for 41HY261 were therefore extended
to include the area adjacent to the San Marcos River within the APE. According to the
site form, Site 41HY261 consists of multiple prehistoric components ranging in age from
Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods. The main portion of the site, outside the
APE, is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP and as a SAL. However, these multiple
components were not documented within the APE. Given that the material encountered in
BHTs 3 and 4 within the APE was sparse, it is recommended that what remains of the site
within the APE is not eligible for NRHP/SAL listing and no further work is warranted.

On February 8 through 10, 2017, AmaTerra surveyed a segment of the I-35 corridor along
which improvements have been proposed in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. The project
was conducted under the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA and all work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26 as well as 36
CFR 800. Because work was conducted in conjunction with TxDOT, all work was subject to
Section 106 review.
AmaTerra archeologists conducted an intensive archeological survey of a segment along
I-35 adjacent to the San Marcos River where improvements have been proposed for the
highway and the Frontage Road. The surveyed area covered 24.9 acres of the total 116.7acre APE for the proposed project. One hundred percent of the segment was surveyed. The
remainder of the APE did not warrant any archeological investigations, as it is completely
disturbed from urban and roadway development and has no potential to contain intact
resources. The survey included a visual inspection, nine shovel tests, and six backhoe
trenches. The visual inspection revealed an APE heavily impacted by previous construction
of the roadway, drainage modifications, and utility lines. Shovel testing revealed disturbed
soils (very dark grayish brown or dark yellowish brown silty clays) on the surface throughout
much of the APE. Shovel tests were distributed across the survey area of the APE to
confirm disturbance and identify intact soils, which contained cultural deposits. Backhoe
trenching was conducted along the San Marcos River and Willow Creek. Cultural material
was encountered during shovel testing and trenching along the San Marcos River.
Archeological deposits were only encountered on a terrace west of the river and the flood
plain east of the river. One new prehistoric site, 41HY534 was documented on the west
side of the San Marcos River within the APE. Five shovel tests were excavated where
possible within the APE and all were positive for cultural material. The site likely extends
well outside of the APE to occupy the entire terrace within a bend in the San Marcos River.
These deposits have not been evaluated and therefore the overall eligibility of the site
remains unknown. However, within the APE investigators noted extensive disturbance and
very little of the site remains intact. No further work is recommended at 41HY534 within
the APE.
Cultural material found in two backhoe trenches was documented as an expansion of Site
41HY261, previously recorded just north of the APE. Site 41HY261 is already considered
eligible for NRHP/SAL-listing. However, like 41HY534, the material in these two trenches
within the APE is sparse. It is recommended that the materials found within the ROW have
no potential to contribute to the siteâs eligibility and therefore, no further investigations are
warranted for Site 41HY261 within the APE.

This report recommends that no NRHP eligible archeological sites would be impacted
within any of the APE for the I-35 project. In the unlikely event that construction activities
should contact significant archeological deposits in areas already surveyed, all work in the
vicinity should cease until such time as those materials can be evaluated by a professional
archeologist and the results of that evaluation are reported to the THC.
This report is submitted in fulfilment of Antiquities Permit No. 7880. No artifacts were
collected during this survey. All documents and photographs generated during fieldwork
for this project will be curated at TARL.
