ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey on an estimated additional 34.4 hectares (85 acres) of property proposed for
construction of the West Ranch (West) Residential Development (WRWRD) in Galveston
County, Texas, located immediately northwest of property surveyed by Foradas (2006).
Field investigation consisted of surface inspection, walkover and subsurface testing
along 23 transects distributed among 6 survey segments (Segments A through F), one of
which (Segment F) has been previously surveyed. Surface survey indicated that project
Segments A, D, and E appear to have been severely impacted by recent cutting and filling
associated with recent construction in the project area. Most of Segment C was found to be
disturbed by historic rice cultivation and other agricultural practices, processes that
historically also affected Segments A, B, D, E, and F.
Subsurface testing was concentrated in Segments B and C, which consist of a wooded
portion of Slone Subdivision Lot B and the interfluve near an intermittent tributary of
Chigger Creek flowing south to north through the center of the parcel. Subsurface testing
included excavation of 46 shovel/auger tests and cutbank inspection in Segment F. In some
instances, the depth of shovel tests were extended using a 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) diameter
Oakfield soil probe to penetrate the hard Lake Charles clay Bss1 and Bss2 horizons in these
soils that underlie the entire project area. Testing also determined that the PleistoceneHolocene boundary in the Lake Charles series soils lies close to the surface and is accessible
by conventional shovel testing methods.
Investigations revealed that upland portions of the project area were disturbed by
historic rice and fig cultivation, while fluvial and colluvial erosion and construction of
irrigation networks associated with agricultural practices impacted areas along drainages.
During this investigation, no cultural remains or features associated with archaeological
resources were detected. No further work is recommended on the project, and HRA Gray &
Pape recommends that the proposed construction project be cleared to proceed.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas
(HRA Gray & Pape) to perform an intensive cultural resources survey on 34.4 hectares (85.0
acres) of property proposed for the construction of the West Ranch West Residential
Development (WRWRD), a residential development bordering the West Ranch Residential
Development (see Foradas 2006) in Galveston County, Texas (Figure 1).
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the project would affect
any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not
previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the project’s Area of Potential
Effect (APE).
All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the
Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (NHPA) guidelines. The project was conducted as part
of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Individual Wetland Permit application (Permit No.
IP-24151) (United States Department of the Interior [USDI] 1983).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area (Figure 1) is roughly rectangular in shape and situated on entirely
privately owned property in a previously cultivated rice farm, fig orchards, and cattle ranch on
the Slone Subdivision of the B.W. Camp Rice Farms in the John Dickinson League (see Figure
2). The property is bounded to the north by the sloping south bank of Chigger Creek and to the
south by the right-of-ways (ROWs) of an ethane pipeline and Farm-to-Market (FM) 518 (also
called Friendswood Road). The west boundary of the project area is formed by fenced private
property. The east boundary of the project area is inside previously surveyed property on the
West Ranch Residential Development (Foradas 2006). Current plans call for the construction of
a residential development situated on upland portions of the parcel north of FM 518 that will
border the West Ranch Residential Development survey (see Figure 2).
Recent aerial photographs (United State Geological Survey [USGS] 1995), satellite
images (USGS 2002), and topographic maps (USGS 1982) show that the parcel has been
impacted by several modern disturbances including commercial rice farming, fig farming, and
cattle grazing (see Foradas 2006).
Vegetation in the parcel consists largely of grasses across the relatively level uplands.
Secondary hardwood forest, grass and brush cover are limited to vegetated portions of sloping
riverbanks of Chigger Creek and its tributary streams of Chigger Creek, one of which cuts

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

The project area is contained entirely on the upland interfluve south of the south (right)
bank of Clear Creek (see Figures 1 and 2). The following section provides a discussion of the
general geomorphological characteristics found in Galveston County. This is followed by
discussions of soil morphology, climate, and floral and faunal species typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas
coast and associated inland areas, which includes Galveston County, resulted from depositional
conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the
northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment
load capacity of the region’s rivers. Galveston County is underlain by relatively recent
sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Pleistocene to the
Holocene (Crenwelge et al. 1988:101; Van Siclen 1991, Aronow 2005).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in
modern-day Galveston County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to predate
human occupation in the region and the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned
stratigraphically between the Beaumont and recent deposits. These terraces date to between one
hundred thousand to four thousand years ago and are characterized as consisting “of up to three
inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander
scars…indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater than
that seen today” (Abbott 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or thin
Holocene deposits, laid down in the Galveston County area by alluvial or eolian factors, or
potentially, marshy environments.
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these “Deweyville” formations are completely buried by Holocene
sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces that are situated
between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have been relatively elevated
and dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by aggrading overbank deposits
(Abbott 2001: 16). Given their physical characteristics, the “Deweyville” terraces may have
been attractive loci for human occupation during the Holocene. While primary “Deweyville”
deposits have a low potential for archaeological remains, the age of these formations are not

5

clearly established. Therefore, the possibility for buried archaeological remains exists within
portions of the “Deweyville” formation (Abbott 2001: 106).

SOILS
Soils in the project area are nearly level clayey and loamy soils developed on prairies that
are grouped in the Lake Charles-Backliff association (Crenwelge et al. 1988:6, sheet 7). The
soils of this association developed on the clays, silts, and fine sands of the Late Pleistocene age
Beaumont formation (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992), which is locally represented by barrier island
and fluvial facies (Barnes 1992). Typically, the prehistoric archaeological sites that occur on
these soils are surface sites (Abbott 2001:141-143, table 9).
The proposed project area contains soils mapped as consisting entirely of two Lake
Charles series soils (Crenwelge et al. 1988:24-26, 87-88, sheet 7; Soil Survey Staff, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA]
2005). The first is Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (abbreviated “LaA” in Crenwelge et
al. 1988: sheet 7) is a nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soil found on broad uplands. In
Galveston County, it is described as having Ap/A-horizons composed of very dark gray clay
from 0 to 62 centimeters (0 to 24 inches). The lowest A-horizon is underlain by a dark gray clay
Bg1-horizon from 62 to 129 centimeters (24 to 51 inches) and a gray clay Bg2-horizon below
this, to a depth of approximately 157 centimeters (62 inches). This soil is typically moderately
acid in its upper part becoming moderately alkaline with depth.
The second is Lake Charles clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes (abbreviated “LaB” in Crenwelge
et al. 1988:sheet 7) exhibits similar A-Bg1-Bg2 horizonation and acidity but is typically a gently
sloping, somewhat poorly drained soil found adjacent to upland drainages such as Chigger and
Clear Creeks. One key difference between LaA and LaB is that LaB has a loamier upper layer
(Ap/A-horizons).
When dry, the Ap/A-horizons in Lake Charles clay can be very hard. When moist, they
are generally very firm but crumbly and when wet, extremely plastic and sticky, and slowly
permeable. The Bg1 is often mottled with light yellowish brown and reddish yellow. The Bg2
is lighter in color, alkaline, and contains occasional concretions of calcium carbonate. As with
overlying clayey layers, when moist, the Bg2 is very firm. When wet, it is extremely sticky and
plastic, slowly permeable, and grades into the parent material of yellowish-red calcareous clays
at depths of 1.5 to 2.4 meters (5 to 8 feet).
The surface of Lake Charles series soils in the greater Houston area often exhibits gilgai
microrelief (also called “hog wallow” microrelief). This is described by Mowery et. al.
(1960:11, figure 4) in his soil guide to neighboring Fort Bend County. Typically, layers in areas
between the hog wallows are 13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick, while the surface layer
in hog wallows can be up to 152 centimeters (60 inches) thick. The surface layers also range in
color from gray to black in areas of gilgai microrelief (Mowery et. al. 1960:11). The gilgai are
attributed to shrink-swell processes in clays. Shrinkage of clay caused by water loss during the
dry season results in the formation of large cracks that are open to the surface. The cracks are

6

subsequently filled by granular Ap/A-horizon materials, and during the wet season the water
saturated clay soil expands sealing the cracks and pushing soil on either side of the crack
upwards. The net result is gligai microrelief: low depressed areas (gilgai) where cracks used to
be and slightly higher areas away between cracks (see Foth 1978: figure 11-24; Mowery et al.
1960:11).
In this pedogenic context, the probability of detecting deep subsurface cultural materials
in the Lake Charles Bg2-horizons is extremely low. This is because the dense clayey subsoil
horizons of the Lake Charles series in Galveston County apparently formed by weathering of
Beaumont formation sediments of Pleistocene age. It is also highly likely that near-surface soil
horizons developed on sloping riverbanks such as those of Clear and Chigger Creeks may
contain cultural materials, but that such materials are likely to be in secondary context, derived
from local weathering of higher landscape surfaces and redeposited by wind, colluvial, and
fluvial processes.
It should also be noted that these soils are mapped in Potential Archaeological Liability
Map (PALM) Unit 4 (Abbott 2001:figure 66). The PALM system is a model developed by the
Texas Department of Transportation to help assess the geoarchaeological likelihood of detecting
significant prehistoric cultural resources in various geomorphological settings in the greater
Houston area (Abbott 2001:151-168). For PALM Unit 4 the probability of detecting significant
resources is very low due largely to processes of urbanization associated with the growth and
expansion of the Houston area in the twentieth century (Abbott 2001). Lake Charles soils are
well suited for development, rice cultivation and use as pasture, and they were historically used
in that capacity (see Crenwelge et al. 1988). As a result of these historic uses, relatively flat
areas near water sources that may have been suitable for prehistoric occupation are often
disturbed by historic agricultural practices.

CLIMATE
Galveston County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Summers are hot and humid; winters
are warm and only occasionally experience incursions of polar air from the north... The average
daily temperature in the summer is 83 degrees Fahrenheit with an average winter temperature of
47 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainfall is highest in the summer and early fall with an average yearly
total of 100.9 centimeters (39.73 inches) (Crenwelge et al. 1988).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Present-day Galveston County is located near the western edge of the Austroriparian
biotic province and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas
suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by
vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluxuation during

7

the Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that
seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to an oak
savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include currently
present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as bison, and, in
localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse
collection of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration
activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the removal of native
plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various elms, cedar,
oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry
are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the
Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species. Black bear and
bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration activities,
especially those associated with rice farming, have resulted in the removal of native plant and
animal species from the area (Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The upper Texas coast is viewed by many researchers as a buffer zone between cultural
regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an interface
between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines, both Shafer
(1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record of this region as
Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and
chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74) states, “it loosely
connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the
southeastern Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric archaeology of Southeast Texas
represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Researchers have identified six archaeological time periods associated with Native
Americans in what Perttula (2004:figure 1.1) calls the southeast Texas archeological region,
which includes Galveston County (Hall 1981; Patterson 1995; Perttula, ed. 2004; Ricklis 2004;
Story 1990). In general, these include the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late
subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists
within the region agree on the general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on
the temporal boundaries of these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1995) chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000
B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600),
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian (A.D.
1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas chronology that includes
Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000
B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late
Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Perttula (2004:table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004:figure 6.1.1) provide
a recent chronology for the Upper Texas Coast that is also applicable to the Project area and
includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-6000 B.C.), Early
Archaic (6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500-200 B.C.);
Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 700-1250), Final
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Early Historic (A.D.
1700-1800) periods.
All of the chronologies developed by these researchers are based primarily on changes in
projectile point technologies, and the introduction of pottery to the region. Despite their
differences, it is also generally recognized by all these researchers that a broad-based hunting

9

and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods up to and during early European
contact in southeast Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
The Island of Galveston, for which the county is named, was first encountered by
Europeans when Juan de Grijavla made landfall on the island in 1519. Various early explorers
knew the island as Isla de Malado, the “Isle of Misfortune” or the Isla de Culebras, the “Isle of
Snakes.” It is thought that the Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, as a member of
the Narvárez expedition in 1528, was shipwrecked on the island. In 1685, the French explorer
René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, sought to challenge the Spanish for control of the area.
He is credited with naming the island “San Louis” in honor of Louis XIV of France. In 1783,
José Antonio de Evia, a Spanish navigator, surveyed the waters near the island and named the
bay Galvezton after Viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez. The island was known as San Luis for a time,
but by 1820 had become known as Galveston Island (Daniels 2005; McComb 1986).
The year 1815 marked the beginning of the Anglo-American presence in the area. Henry
Perry and Warren D. C. Hall, former members of the Gutiérrez-Magee expedition, made landfall
on the peninsula north of the island with three ships and 200 men. Perry named the point for
Simón Bolívar, who had commissioned him to disrupt Spanish commerce in the Gulf. In 1817,
Laffite established a fort on the island he named Campeche, after a town on the Yucatan
peninsula. The fort was destroyed by a storm a year later, but by 1819 the settlement had a
population between 1,000 to 2,000 people (Daniels 2005).
Under Spanish rule population growth continued at a slow pace. After the Texas
revolution, an increase in the flow of commerce through the port consolidated the island’s
importance as a finance and trade hub. The port shipped cotton and cottonseed oil, as well as
cattle, sugar, and other locally produced commodities (McComb 1986).
Galveston County was founded in 1838 from portions of Harrisburg, Liberty, and
Brazoria counties. When Texas joined the union Galveston was the largest city in the state. By
the Civil War, however, the city of Houston had begun to overshadow Galveston as a port of
entry for shipping and as a manufacturing center. By 1880, the county of Galveston had
population of approximately 24,100 and the city was still the largest in the state (Kleiner 2002).
The hurricane of 1900 dramatically altered the course of development in the county. It
was the most costly natural disaster in terms of lives lost in U.S. history to that time, and resulted
in the deaths of between 10,000 and 12,000 people on the island. In spite of this, the county
continued to flourish until the Great Depression. This decline lasted until the 1970s when
preservation efforts were undertaken to revitalize historic portions of the island (McComb 1986).
Much of the current commercial activity in the county is associated with the
petrochemical industry, although tourism, medical services, and waterborne commerce are also
important to the area (Kleiner 2002).

10

Friendswood was established as a Quaker colony in the spring of 1895 by Frank Jacob
Brown and Thomas Hadley Lewis (Key to the City 2005). For much of the past century
agriculture, including cattle ranching, rice farming, and truck crop production (vegetables, figs)
supported the local economy. Rice and fig farms were generally small tenant enterprises
operating on leased land, while large ranches were a common component of the landscape south
of Houston into the 1950s (Crenwelge et al. 1988; Haskell 1912; Voellinger et al. 1988). The
remains of many of the rice operations, now converted to pasture are still visible in contemporary
aerial images (compare Crenwelge et al. 1988: sheet 7; Jack Ammann Photographic Engineers,
Inc. [JAPE] 1955a, 1955b; USGS 1995, 2005).
The town remained a relatively small Quaker agricultural community into the 1950s. The
city grew rapidly in the 1960s as more people moved to the suburbs of Houston and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) facilities in nearby Ellington Field and Clear
Lake grew (Carlson 1999; Kleiner 2001, 2002).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A brief overview of selected research projects conducted in close proximity to the study
area is presented below. The results of the background investigation regarding the presence of
cultural resources near the current project area are presented in Chapter VI.
The University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of the USACE, assessed potential flood
control impacts to cultural resources located along Clear Creek (McGuff and Cox 1973). The
survey included the extreme northeast portion of the project area along Clear Creek and portions
of Chigger Creek upstream from the project area (see Figure 1). A total of 76 prehistoric and 2
historic sites were identified, none of which were in the current project area. It was determined
that 51 prehistoric and 1 historic sites could be adversely affected by proposed flood control
modifications. The prehistoric sites were situated within two specific loci and as such were
deemed to represent a type of site density not previously observed in the area.
Recommendations were made for the avoidance of these resources and plans for the mitigation
of these sites were proposed in the event avoidance was not possible. The USACE, Galveston
District also supported more recent corridor surveys, including a survey along Chigger Creek
upstream from the project (Guevin 1991), a pipeline crossing survey near Friendswood, and Site
41GV9 (Chaffin-Lohse 1979).
Some of the more recent work in the area has been tied to Harris County Flood Control
District (HCFCD) projects along Clear Creek and its tributaries in Harris and Galveston Counties
(see Howard et al. 1990; Mahoney 1998a, 1998b; Mahoney and Moore 1998). Howard et al.
(1990) surveyed an 8-kilometer (5-mile) stretch of Clear Creek between Friendswood and
League City in the two counties. That HCFCD survey covered a large area on the Harris County
side of Clear Creek (see Figure 1). It also revisited Sites 41GV8, 41GV9, and 41GV54 and
recorded 5 new prehistoric and 3 new historic sites. Five of these sites (41GV9, 41GV103,
41HR632, 41HR633, and 41HR635) were recommended potentially eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Mahoney (1998a, 1998b) conducted a survey of a
proposed detention basin and recorded Sites 41HR829 and 41HR830 which are discussed below.
Turpin (1994) reported on a cultural resource survey of 21 hectares (52 acres) for the
proposed League City Park along Magnolia Creek, southeast of the project area (see Figure 1).
That project documented the remains of a burned and demolished post-1941 house bordering the
proposed trail (recorded as Site 41GV135). More recently, SWCA Environmental Consultants
(Skoglund and Barile 2003) surveyed 60.7 hectares (150 acres) along Clear Creek and revisited
Site 41HR830. It should also be added that in an effort to understand the rice farming industry
south of Houston, a report by Voellinger et al. (1988) documenting the results of the Natchez
survey in neighboring Fort Bend County was consulted.
It is clear from these studies that little is known about the archaeology of the area south
of Chigger and Clear Creeks in and around southeast Friendswood, Galveston County. Though

12

previous investigations along Clear and Chigger Creeks have detected prehistoric and historic
archaeological sites on landforms similar to those in the project area, the 1973 USACE,
Galveston District study (McGuff and Cox 1973) was the only one that actually covered portions
of the project area (see Figure 1); and it did not detect any sites within the APE. Sites recorded
by these previous surveys within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area are discussed
in Chapter VI with respect to the development of survey methodology.
Due to the strong evidence of rice agriculture over much of the project area three surveys
conducted by HRA Gray & Pape in the past few years (Baird and Hughey 2003; Foradas 2005;
Hughey 2004) and an older survey conducted by Espey Huston & Associates, Inc. (Voellinger et
al. 1988), all of which were conducted by in areas containing former rice fields in Harris and
Fort Bend Counties were also reviewed to help develop a methodology for the current survey.
The three surveys conducted in Harris County by HRA Gray & Pape as were part of
remedial wetland mitigation projects. Baird and Hughey’s (2003) and Hughey’s (2004) surveys
background research documented older studies in the area. Their methodology included
walkover, shovel testing, and the excavation of deep test trenches in a 100-meter (328-foot)
swath paralleling Clear Creek. The swath was part of a larger, approximately 54 hectare (144.5
acre) area situated between I-610 and Clear Creek, located south of the current project.
For both the Baird and Hughey (2003) and Hughey (2004) surveys, it was agreed by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the USACE to limit the archaeological survey to the
100-meter (328-foot) swath of less disturbed land paralleling Clear Creek. This was done
because it was determined that sections north of the tree line along Clear Creek contained land
previously disturbed by rice farming activities. Areas north of the swath, in which greater
subsurface disturbance had occurred were subjected to visual inspection during the two projects
(see Baird and Hughey 2003; Hughey 2004). Foradas (2005) used a combination of studies of
aerial imagery and soil survey maps to assess historic and recent land use in an area that remote
sensing images indicated had been severely disturbed by rice farming and construction. Ground
truthing by walkover and probing confirmed this. All three investigations resulted in the
discovery of no historic properties. It should also be noted that among the portions of these three
project areas found to not require additional subsurface testing, were large areas mapped in Lake
Charles clay (LaA), which are ideally suited to rice agriculture (Baird and Hughey 2003; Foradas
2005; Hughey 2004; Crenwelge et al 1988:24).
Voellinger et al. (1988) presented the results of the Natchez survey conducted in the late
1980s in Fort Bend, County. As with the more recent HRA Gray and Pape studies in former rice
fields, the Natchez survey did not record any sites in former rice fields. However, that study did
record two irrigation pump facilities (Sites 41FB151 and 41FB152) situated along canals and
natural drainages bordering rice fields, a typical arrangement in the region (see Haskell 1912).
Site 41FB151 is situated on a slope above drainage into Brushy Lake and is recorded as
the remains of vertical centrifugal irrigation pump facility probably used for rice cultivation
(Voellinger et al. 1988:77). Features recorded at the site include three concrete blocks with rebar
bolts through their center, an old well, and portions of a foundation pad constructed of wooden
logs or railroad ties. Shovel tests produced some charcoal but no other cultural remains, and the

13

informant interviews indicated that there were other outlying buildings but that these were
destroyed. A channelized drainage cut into the creek bank, and an access roadway along the
shoulder of the slope are also situated near the site (Voellinger et al. 1988:72-77, figures 16 and
17). The site was typical of many other pump wells used to irrigate a single field during the
early to mid twentieth century, lacked integrity, and was to be impacted by construction of a
recreation area, therefore no further work was recommended and the site was ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP (Voellinger et al. 1988:110, table 5).
Site 41FB152 described by Voellinger et al. (1988:77-88) is a much more extensive
industrial irrigation facility, identified as the remains of “the Second Lift Pumping Plant of the
Old Brazoria Rice and Irrigation Company”(Voellinger 1988:82) built in 1902 and abandoned in
1938 (Voellinger 1988:82-88). The site is situated above an old canal with a portion of it sitting
in the canal, approximately 60 meters (197 feet) south of Highway 6 and encompasses a 2,500
square meter (26,912 foot area). Features recorded at the site included remains of reinforced
concrete and manufactured brick foundations of an intake pump, a primary pump/motor
assembly outflow structure, a holding tank, fuel storage area, and a control room; and the
remains of a wooden shed (see Voellinger et al. 1988:figure 21). Upright metal bolts in 10centimeter (4-inch) square holes used for fastening machinery were also preserved in some of the
foundations.
A large brick scatter was also present over the site and extended into the canal. Some of
the brick apparently represented remains of a wall collapse, rather than discard of bricks into the
canal. Artifacts recorded at the site included bricks and brick fragments, milled lumber, and
corrugated metal sheeting apparently used for the roofing. Additional brick fragments, as well as
coal pieces, quartzite gravel were recovered from shovel test. In addition, plans for portions of
the facility and other archival data were located during archival research for the Voellinger
(1988:77-88, figures 19 through 25b) study.
Voellinger et al. (1988:110, table 5) recommended the site eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion A because “the site is directly associated with a trend in the local history [growth of
rice agriculture]” (Voellinger et al. 1988:110) and Criterion D because “the site is
intact...although no machinery remains the footings and foundations are present” (Voellinger et
al. 1988:110). However, the site was not to be impacted by that project, and not recommended
for further work unless it was to be impacted by future construction projects. The field
methodology developed using the data derived from these previous investigations is summarized
below.
The most recent survey in the project area was conducted by Foradas (2006), in the
immediately adjacent 50.6 hectare (125 acres) West Ranch Residential Development (see Figure
1). Foradas (2006) identified 3 historic archaeological sites and 4 modern trash scatters within
the West Ranch Residential Survey project area. Site 41GV158 consisted of the remains of a
small historic to modern farmstead along Friendswood Road (FM 518). Artifacts and features
identified at this site, including cement piers associated with three or more structures and a
shallow trash deposit containing bottles and pottery fragments, date to the early to mid-twentieth
century. The original structures have been removed or demolished and possibly burned, and all
but one subsurface test were negative. Sites 41GV159 and 41GV160 both dated to the late

14

nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. Site 41GV159 consisted of the remains of a rice
irrigation pumping facility along the right bank of Chigger Creek, and is similar to better
preserved facilities elsewhere in the region. Site 41GV160 represented the remains of a historic
refuse deposit identified during shovel testing. All three sites lacked integrity, and no additional
investigations were recommended at any of the three sites.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This cultural resources survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily cultural
resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess effects to cultural
resources impacted by construction activities initiated by this project. The methodology developed
by Foradas (2006:14-18) as modified by his results was used as the methodology in this survey.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The project area is situated on 34.4 hectares (85.0 acres) of land proposed for the
construction of a residential development. The archaeological survey project area is defined as all
property within the proposed project APE.
A key factor in creating a strategy for sampling a project area is in developing a predictive
model whereby testing can be concentrated most efficiently in areas with the greatest potential for
containing intact cultural resources. These models are based on soil and topographic characteristics,
including variations in elevation, distance to existing or remnant water sources, and plant
communities. Generally, these include areas located near existing watercourses. These models
serve as heuristic devices that assists researchers in devising sampling strategies best suited for
collecting data in given environmental settings. The predictive model developed for this project
area, as well as the results of previous studies, indicated that the entire area held a low potential for
containing intact prehistoric cultural resources and a moderate to low potential for historic
resources.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line research
archives maintained by the THC. Site file research was performed in order to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of the project areas, and
all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent to the project APE.
Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey. Additional
documentary research consisting of research in county archives to reconstruct the chain of title
and help identify past land use and cultural features on the property was also conducted.
Together, these data provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the
surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an
overview history of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of
Galveston County’s prehistory and history.
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. The goal of the research efforts was to produce a

16

listing of all archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area, and all
historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the project’s APE.
As part of the literature search, HRA Gray & Pape created a series of tables to document
previously identified resources located within a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) radius of the project area.
Cultural resources identified during this literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. A table summarizing
previously recorded resources near the boundaries of the current project is provided in chapter VI.

ORAL HISTORY AND INTERVIEW METHODOLOGY
Oral historical research conducted concurrently with fieldwork and report writing as part
of Foradas’s (2006) study was utilized for this project. Attempts were made to locate and
interview (in person or by telephone) primary and secondary informants contacted during that
study. Primary informants include individuals that worked or resided in or very near the project
area. Secondary informants in this study included individuals that may not have worked or
resided in or near the project area, but were familiar with the activities on the parcel, or the
methods of agricultural production (e.g. rice farming) that may have been used on it.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were designed
to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic, within the
defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the collection of data needed in
order to determine whether additional investigations would be required to evaluate the potential
eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for inclusion on the NRHP or as a state
designated landmark.
Archaeological methods employed during this survey consisted of pedestrian survey
augmented by systematic shovel testing. In areas where surface visibility allowed for an
examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a surface
inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at the location of each
planned shovel test.
Linear transects were utilized to facilitate survey activities within the limits of the entire
project area. These transects were spaced at 30 meter (98.43 foot) or closer intervals. Shovel
testing was performed on all transects situated within high and moderate probability areas. In
low probability areas, shovel testing was performed on alternating transects only; pedestrian
reconnaissance was conducted on those transects not sampled by shovel testing.
Shovel tests were placed at intervals that ranged between 30 to 120 meters (98.43 to
393.7 feet). Shovel testing intervals were decreased in areas deemed to possess a high
probability for cultural resources, and increased in areas of moderate to low probability, which

17

were sampled at a lower frequency. Areas showing terrestrial and remote sensing evidence of
recent rice cultivation were considered to have the lowest potential to preserve cultural resources
and were generally not subjected to subsurface testing. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas
containing standing water or wetlands.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and were
excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) into the underlying substratum or until
culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through ¼- inch
hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and
methods described elsewhere (see Munsell 1993; Schoeneberger et al. 2002; Vogel 2002).
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test
forms for each excavation.
There were no artifacts recovered therefore curation procedures are not discussed in this
report.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No previously recorded sites or National Register properties are located within the project
APE, and no new archaeological sites or cultural materials were recorded by this survey. The
results of the site file research are discussed in the following section, followed by a discussion of
the results of the cultural resources field investigation.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all recorded historic
structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the project’s APE.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
Site file research indicated that 13 previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area (Table 1). Of these sites, five
are prehistoric campsites (41HR634, 41HR829, 41GV103, 41GV104, 41GV134), three are
prehistoric terrace sites (41GV9, 41GV54), one is a prehistoric mound (41HR633), and one is a
historic house site (41GV830). Dated prehistoric sites in the group range in age from Late
Archaic through Late Ceramic. Historic sites range in age from early twentieth century to
Modern (see Figure 1 and Table 1).

Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas On-line maps indicate there are no architectural
resources within the study radius; however, a number of architectural resources are recorded
within the City of Friendswood a few miles to the northwest. Finds at each of the sites within the
study radius are summarized below.
Site 41GV9 is a highly eroded site situated on the surface of a high sandy bluff along the
south side of Clear Creek (Hester and Corbin 1968; Howard 1989). It is close to a boat basin on
the north edge of a partly artificial peninsula jutting into Clear Creek. The site was originally
recorded by Hester and Corbin (1968) as an accumulation of possible cultural materials
including flint flakes, sherds, and scattered rangia, thought to have possibly been derived from a
nearby road. Chaffin-Lohse (1979) attempted to relocate the site a decade later but couldn't find
it because of poor mapping and concluded it was destroyed. However, Howard (1989) was able
to relocate the site in 1989 and recovered 26 sandy paste and 4 grog-tempered potsherds, two
arrow points (a barb/base and a blank), and 27 pieces of chert debitage, along with evidence of
recent burning (wood charcoal fragments) and evidence that Oyster and Rangia shells on the site
were likely to have been introduced from a road and/or path near the site. Howard also provided
a better map of the site.
Site 41GV54 was originally reported as an eroded prehistoric site composed of flakes and
shell (see Hudson 1973). A more recent survey by Howard (1990) indicates these materials may
represent and accumulation of road fill incorrectly classified as an archaeological site.
Several other sites near the project area (41GV103, 41GV104, 41HR632, 41HR633,
41HR634) were recorded during a USACE, Galveston District sponsored survey associated with
the Clear Creek Flood Control Project, Second Reach 85011 in 1986 (Garvey and Howard
1989a-c; Howard and Garvey 1989a-b; Howard et al. 1990). Site 41GV103 was recorded by
Garvey and Howard (1989a) on the south bank of Clear Creek north of its confluence with
Magnolia Creek (see Figure 1). The site was dated to the Ceramic period on the basis of 12
sandy paste ceramic sherds and a piece of possibly worked laminated hematite found in 1 shovel
test. The site deposits are reportedly dense and deep because the basal clay was not reached
below a depth of 50 centimeters (19.7 inches). Further work was recommended if the site was to
be impacted by construction (Garvey and Howard 1989a).

20

Site 41GV104 was recorded by Garvey and Howard (1989b) on the south bank of Clear
Creek south of its confluence with Magnolia Creek. The cultural materials at this site included a
diffuse lithic scatter detected at a depth of less than 20 centimeters (8 inches) in 3 shovel tests.
Further work was recommended for this site (Garvey and Howard 1989b).
Fustes (1993) recorded Site 41GV134 as a shell midden eroding out of the bank of Clear
Creek (see Figure 1). The width of the cutbank exposure, which lies 33 centimeters (13 inches)
below surface and ranges from 5 to 13 centimeters in thickness, is reported as 4.25 meters (14
feet). This makes its maximum depth below surface approximately 46 centimeters (18.1 inches).
Site 41GV158 consists of the remains of a small historic to modern farmstead positioned
on both sides of a small first order tributary drainage of Chigger Creek along Friendswood Road
(FM 518) in Galveston County. The site measures approximately 35 meters by 50 meters (115
feet by 164 feet) in area or 0.29 hectares (0.73 acres). Artifacts and features identified at this site
indicated an occupation dating to the early to mid-twentieth century impacted by erosion,
possibly fire, landscaping associated with well drilling, and demolition. The original structures
have been removed or demolished, and all but one subsurface test were negative. Historic
features detected on the surface included cement piers associated with three or more structures,
and a shallow trash deposit containing bottles and pottery fragments that helped date the site.
The site may represent the remains of B.W. Camp Rice Farms facilities or the MacDonald
farmstead. Neither B.W. Camp Rice Farms nor the MacDonalds who were the owners of the
Slone Subdivision prior to 1922 are historically significant, and due to low integrity additional
investigations were not recommended (Foradas 2006).
Site 41GV159 consists of the fragmentary remains of a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century rice irrigation pumping facility along the right bank of Chigger Creek. The site measures
approximately 20 meters by 36 meters (67 feet by 122 feet) in area or 0.06 hectares (0.16 acres).
Features observed on the surface at 41GV159 included remains of two brick structures, a 16-inch
brass pipe elbow found in situ at the edge of an artificial drainage ditch, a cement pour
apparently left over from initial construction or a later repair, a possible driveway lined with
gravel, brick and slag, and a possible roadway leading south and uphill from Chigger Creek to
the upland rice field. Artifacts included a fragment of steel grating, and a light brick scatter
discovered on the surface around the structural remains. Since the site lacks integrity, resembles
similar facilities reported elsewhere across east Texas and western Louisiana, and betterpreserved examples of such facilities have been recorded and recommended eligible for the
NRHP (for example Site 41FB152) no additional investigations were recommended (Foradas
2006).
Site 41GV160 measures approximately 45 meters by 20 meters (145 feet by 63 feet) in
area or 0.07 hectares (0.18 acres), and was identified on the basis of 3 positive shovel tests. It
represents the fragmentary remains of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century historic refuse
deposit and consists of historic pottery, nail and metal fragments detected in the plowzone. No
additional investigations were recommended (Foradas 2006).
Site 41HR632 is the largest prehistoric site in the study radius and measures
approximately 2000 square meters (29,530 square feet) in area. The site appears to be a single

21

component Late Ceramic-age site situated on a terrace upstream of Site 41HR633 along the north
bank of Clear Creek. Artifacts were detected at depths of up to 0.5 meter (1.5 feet) in 3 shovel
test excavations, and on the surface. According to the site record artifacts recovered included:
“1 grog-tempered sandy paste body sherd, 1 sandy paste plain rim sherd, 10 sandy paste
body sherds, 1 arrow [point] stem frag[ment] (Scallorn?), 10 debitage, 1 unmodified
siliceous pebble, 21 burned clay lumps, 13 bone fragments, 8 caliche nodules, 1 possible
wood charcoal fragment, oyster and Rangia shell fragments, scattered across surface
probably are derived from road to the east (Howard and Garvey 1989a).”
Due to the density of cultural materials Howard and Garvey (1989a) recommended further work
at the site if it is to be impacted by construction.
Site 41HR633 measures approximately 250 square meters (2,691 square feet) in area. It
is located within 80 meters (262.5 feet) of Clear Creek near 41HR634 (see Figure 1). The site
appears to be a single component site dating to the Late Archaic. Artifacts recovered from 2
shovel tests excavated on two rises at the site include a dart point base resembling and Ensor
projectile point, a side scraper, 16 pieces of debitage, 4 utilized flakes, 3 burned clay fragments,
and a possible wood charcoal fragment. All of the artifacts were recovered between 30 and 60
centimeters (1 and 2 feet) depth in a similar soil type that appears to occur across the site
(Howard and Garvey 1989b).
Site 41HR634 (Garvey and Howard 1989c) consists of isolated find of a biface fragment
recovered from a shovel test 20m north of Clear Creek southeast of Whitcomb Cemetery (see
Figure 1). The artifact was found within 10 centimeters (4 inches) of the surface.
Sites 41HR829 and 41HR830 were identified by Mahoney (1998a-b) during an HCFCD
sponsored survey for the proposed Clear Creek Detention Basin, in Harris County, Texas
(Mahoney and Moore 1998). Site 41HR829 is located on a small sandy knoll surrounded by low
bottomlands on the left bank of Clear Creek just downstream of its confluence with Savel Gully.
A chert biface fragment and 1 piece of chert debitage were recovered from two separate shovel
tests placed 5 meters (16 feet) apart. Both artifacts were recovered in situ, at depths ranging
between 20 and 30 centimeters (8 and 12 inches), interpreted as probably representing a single
episode (Mahoney 1998a).
Site 41HR830 is a historic site containing concrete piers located along the left bank of
Clear Creek, approximately 0.25 kilometers (0.15 miles) downstream, and 60 meters (197 feet)
inland, of the confluence of Clear Creek with Chigger Creek. Twenty-four cut nails, a flat glass
shard, and a stoneware fragment were recovered from the site, which was delineated by surface
features and excavation of 15 shovel tests. The site has been disturbed by modern construction
including concrete pads, a limestone smoke pit, a wellhead with appurtenances, an artificial pond
with concrete and corrugated outfalls and an observation deck made from the crow's nest of a
marine vessel (Mahoney 1998b). In addition, a modern dock is located on the streambank
southwest of the site.

22

An SWCA Environmental Consultants survey revisited the site in 2003 (Barile et al.
2003; Skoglund and Barile 2003). The SWCA Environmental Consultants shovel tests found
modern clear window glass, clear and brown bottle glass, coal fragments, and two chert flakes.
In addition, the recorders noted that bricks across the site were embossed with "A. P.
GREEN/EMPIRE" and "COLEMAN". Since Empire bricks were manufactured by the A. P.
Green Fire Brick Company of Mexico, Missouri from 1919 to 1942, and Coleman bricks were
produced by the Athens, Texas branch of the Harbison-Walker Refractories Company after 1942
the historic component of site can be dated to the early to mid-twentieth century (Barile et al.
2003; Skoglund and Barile 2003).
Common trends in the data from these sites include: 1) shallow depth to cultural resources,
generally depths of much less than 1 meter (3 feet); 2) concentration of prehistoric sites on the edges
of higher terraces of major drainages such as Clear Creek; 3) the presence of historic habitations and
potentially NRHP eligible prehistoric sites nearby on higher terrace and upland landforms similar to
those found in the project (e.g. terraces, uplands); 4) extensive disturbances to the uplands by
agricultural practices, particularly rice farming.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
The chain of title to the project area was studied in order to determine when the first houses
might have been erected in the APE. Research in the Galveston County Appraisal District (GCAD)
and Galveston County, Office of the County Clerk (GCOCC) determined that the project area is a
portion of a large tract of land referred to as the Slone Subdivision out of the B.W. Camp Rice
Farms in the John Dickinson League (hereafter referred to as “the Slone Subdivision”) in early
Harris and Galveston County records (Boyles 1922; GCAD 1949, 2005a-b; GCOCC 1922, 1966,
1972, 1978a-b; Texas General Land Office [GLO] 1860, 1862, 1877). The John Dickinson League
tract was a 122-hectare (301-acre) tract platted by 1860 (see GLO 1860). Examination of later GLO
(1862, 1877) and other plat maps (Boyles 1922; City of Friendswood 1949) indicates the Slone
Subdivision did not exist prior to 1877.
North of FM 518, the Slone Subdivision is divided into 38 numbered lots (Lots 1 through
38), two lettered lots (Lots A and B) and an unplatted lot bordering Chigger Creek. Most of the lots
closest to FM 518 are rectangular in shape. However a number of triangular, square, and polygonal
lots are also present in the Slone Subdivision. The geometry of the lots in the Slone Subdivision in
relation to the project area boundary is shown in Figure 2. It should also be noted that the Slone
Subdivision extends south of FM 518 where portions of Lots B, 27 and 28 extend, and over a
hundred other lots are platted.
According to GCOCC and GCAD Records, Lots A, B, 1-11, and 17 through 34 were
apparently owned by R.D. MacDonald and L.A. MacDonald and sold to Thomas H. Slone on
October 28, 1922. It is not clear whether the McDonalds also owned the remaining lots in the
parcel (Lots 12 to 16, and 35 to 38) and if they decided to retain them. However, what is clear in
deeds dating from 1966 to 2005 (GCAD 2005b; GCOCC 1922, 1966, 1972, 1978a-b) is that much
of the Slone Subdivision was owned by members of apparently interrelated West, Stedman and
Teetens families from the late 1960s to the present. The relationship between the Slones and

23

MacDonalds to the other families was not clear from the records search.
It is clear from the tax
records was that B.W. Camp Rice Farm owned or likely leased (see Crenwelge 1988:3) the parcel
prior to 1922, and that the parcel had likely been used as part of the West family cattle ranching and
or mineral exploration operations since the 1960s. Recent Galveston County plat maps of the Slone
Subdivision also revealed a structure in Lot 15 (see Figure 2) which is the city owned storage
facility visible in recent aerial images (see USGS 2002). The combination of agricultural processes
and possible mineral exploration on the parcel was likely to be reflected on the landscape, so the
project turned to analysis of remote sensing data.

ANALYSIS OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS AND AERIAL IMAGES
Figure 3 provides an overview of investigations in relation to an aerial photograph of the
project area (USGS 2002). A review of topographic maps (USGS 1982) and aerial images (JAPE
1955a, 1955b; USGS 1995, 2002) of the project area was conducted in order to determine historic
and recent landuse, and to search for evidence of structures that may have been present on the parcel
in the early 1900s.
It was clear from early aerial photographs of the project area that rice farms and pasture
were common in the area around the project into the 1950s (JAPE 1955a, 1955b). Comparison of
rice farming features in JAPE (1955a, 1955b) with recent aerial images (USGS 1995, 2002)
revealed extensive evidence of recent rice farming. Many wide furrows and several channelized
drainage ditches were clearly visible in the aerial images on what are now open pastures in the
project area, but they were also visible in some areas covered with denser stands of vegetation
(see Figure 3). Evidence of other agricultural practices including possible tree grubbing to clear
land for pasture or to harvest timber was also detected in the pasture along the northwestern
portion of the parcel (see Figure 3).
A comparison of older aerial images with more recent ones indicated that the ethane
pipeline along the southern boundary of the project area was of moderately recent construction,
and that no structures were present in this portion of the Slone Subdivision (see Crenwelge et al.
1988:sheet 7; JAPE 1955a, 1955b; USGS 1995, 2002).

ORAL HISTORY AND INTERVIEWS
During a survey of the adjacent West Ranch Residential Development the lack of
archival information regarding landuse on the parcel in the early nineteenth century Foradas
(2006) contacted a series of informants familiar with rice farming in order to find out more about
rice agriculture in Friendswood, and about land use on the Slone Subdivision.
Robert Papanos (2005), the Vice President of the United States Rice Producers
Association (USRPA) in Houston, Texas, was consulted about the nature of features that might
be expected on a historic rice farm in Texas, and about any records of the B.W. Camp Rice
Farms. He noted the USRPA has no record of the B.W. Camp Rice Farm in Friendswood, and

24

that historic records of rice farming operations may occasionally be found in county archives and
historic societies.

Papanos (2005) also mentioned that there has never been a major treatise written on the
history of rice growing in Texas, which is a key rice producer in the U.S. (Kleiner 2002).
Papanos (2005) noted that commercial rice farming started in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area in
the 1870s by a German farmer from Iowa, and spread west and north into neighboring states in
the 1880s. Therefore it is likely that the B.W. Camp Rice Farms were one of many rice
production enterprises operating in Galveston County in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when
16,000 acres in Texas were planted in rice including a significant portion of Galveston County
(see Crenwelge et al. 1988).
Papanos (2005) also noted that there is only one active rice farm in Galveston County
today, the Garrett farm in Angleton, which is a rice seed production facility. Calls to the Garrett
farm were returned on Friday October 21, 2005. Mr. Garrett noted that many of the people
familiar with Galveston County’s rice industry in the late 1800s and early 1900s are long dead.
However, he referred the author to Mr. Jim Purcell, age 85, a retired rice farmer in the area.
Calls to Mr. Purcell were not returned. Papanos (2005) also put the author in touch with Mr.
David Lacompte, of Santa Fe, Texas, a former Galveston County rice farmer. Calls to Mr.
Lacompte were not returned.
Jocelyn Baker of the Friendswood Historical Society and the Frank J. Brown Heritage
Museum in Friendswood was also consulted on this project. Ms. Baker (2005) provided some
details concerning the West Ranch. She noted that while conducting research for her book on
Friendswood (no title provided) she interviewed a Mr. Cecil Brown who was the son of one of
Friendswood’s founders, Frank Brown. Mr. Brown informed her, that Slone (whom she
discusses as Sloan) subdivided the project property in order to sell the tracts to absentee tenants
for fig farms. Fig farming was big business in Galveston County beginning in 1890 and peaking
in 1928. Apparently, Slone bought the Slone Subdivision from MacDonald during the fig boom
and planted it in figs. He then sold the lots of the subdivision to buyers in northern states. Few
of the buyers ever visited their parcels and apparently Slone managed them for them. However,
Slone sold more lots than the subdivision actually had, and made out well enough managing fig
production on the Slone Subdivision to be driving a Pierce Arrow in the Depression. Eventually
his con game was exposed and he spent time in Leavenworth prison (Baker 2005).
Based on the information from Baker (2005), much of the project area appears to have
been planted in fig trees in the 1920s. Fig trees remained on the parcel until the West family
converted the Slone Subdivision into a cattle ranch and removed the fig trees. Some circular
anomalies visible in aerial images of the parcel (see JAPES 1955a-b; USGS 1995, 2005) may
represent the results of tree grubbing associated with the tree removal processes. Ms. Baker also
referred the author to Ms. Leola Hill Hancock, the daughter of a former tenant farmer on the
West Ranch. Attempts to reach Ms. Hancock, contacted as part of this investigation, were
unsuccessful.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Intensive pedestrian survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that
construction processes might have on cultural resources located within the proposed commercial
development construction area. The project area was divided into five survey areas (Segments
A, B, C, D, and E), and on previously surveyed area (Segment F) to facilitate data collection (see
Figure 3).
The entire West Ranch West parcel was subjected to walkover survey. Segments A, C,
D, and E were found to be largely disturbed by historic agricultural processes and or recent
construction. However, portions of Segment B lying at the edges of agricultural disturbances in
the wooded northern portion of Lot B in the Slone Subdivision (see Figure 2), along with
portions of Segment C located on level ground between the edge of the agricultural fields and the
sloping banks of the Main Drainage possessed a moderate potential to detect cultural resources.
As a result, a total of 46 subsurface tests were placed within the parcel. A total of 9 shovel tests
were excavated in Segment B. The remaining 37 tests were placed on both sides of the Main
Drainage in Segment C on narrow strips that appeared to have been undisturbed by agricultural
practices. Both approximately 155-meter (508-feet) long cutbanks of a freshly re-excavated
channelized drainage ditch in a previously surveyed portion of the Main Drainage nearest
Friendswood Road were also inspected for cultural materials (see Figure 3). Sample subsurface
test profiles are shown in Figure 4.

SEGMENT A
Segment A (see Figure 3) covered approximately 6.86 hectares (16.94 acres). It
encompassed a polygonal area north of Friendswood Road and west of Segment C and
previously surveyed portions of the APE where cutting and filling had recently taken place (see
Figure 3).
At the time of survey portions of Segment A had been stripped of soil by deep pans and
track hoes observed to be operating in this area (see Figure 3). Measurements of the depth of
cut, taken at the edges of the disturbance and along an artificial drainage ditch cut in the
previously surveyed area, and comparison of cuts and scraped surfaces with local soil
descriptions (see Crenwelge et al. 1988; SSS NRCS USDA 2006) indicated that cutting had
removed all of the A-horizon across the segment to a depth of approximately 30 centimeters (12
inches). In addition, portions of Segment A had been filled with dirt borrowed from an area
south of FM 518 to depths ranging from 0 to 2 meters (0 to 6 feet).
It should also be noted that scraping revealed remnants of rice furrows in places that had
not yet been filled (see Figure 3). Severe disturbances in this segment appear to have been
caused by historic agricultural practices long before construction. As a result, no shovel tests
were excavated along the 12 pedestrian survey transects that were walked on this segment (see
Figure 3).

SEGMENT B
Segment B covered approximately 0.93 hectares (2.30 acres) of the northern portion of
Lot B in the Slone Subdivision (see Figure 2). The parcel was surrounded by a barbed wire
fence and densely vegetated in new growth hardwoods and understory grasses and brush. Poison
ivy, an indicator species of recent disturbance was a very common understory plant and densest
in the southern half of the segment, nearest Friendswood Road. This parcel appeared similar in
many respects to the roadside parcels that produced cultural features such as the stone piers
detected at Site 4IGV158 further east on Friendswood Road by Foradas (2006:figure 3).
However, it should be noted that Friendswood Road originally passed south of the present route
for FM 518 and outside the APE.
The tree-covered segment appeared to have potential to produce cultural materials. As a
result a total of 7 east-west pedestrian survey transects spaced 15 meters apart were walked to
look for piers and other evidence of historic structures similar to those at 41GV158. In addition,
a total of 9 shovel tests were excavated in Segment B. These were placed along three northsouth transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart (see Figure 3).
Due to the dense vegetation, pedestrian survey was conducted at 10-meter intervals along
Transects D through L. No cultural resources were detected during the walkover. All that could
be found on the surface was trash consisting of modern car parts and plastic bottles, all of which
were within 25 meters of the roadway. Similarly, the shovel tests excavated along Transects A,
B, and C were all negative, and revealed a Lake Charles Clay soil profile, with a plow zone (Aphorizon) typical of the region (see Crenwelge et al. 1988; SSS NRCS USDA 2006).

SEGMENT C
Segment C was a large grass covered pasture covering approximately 14.60 hectares
(36.08 acres). In places, the irregularly shaped segment is cut by black mesh silt fences, orange
safety fences around wetlands, and areas of cutting and filling associated with Segments A, D,
and E and previously surveyed areas (see Figure 3). At the time of survey much of the pasture
appeared not to have been disturbed by recent construction. However, the results of background
research (see above) indicated it the segment had once been a rice field (see USGS 1995, 2002),
and more recently a fig tree farm (see Foradas 2006). This was confirmed during pedestrian
survey along 8 transects in the uplands (see Figure 3).
Intensive pedestrian survey along two survey transects (Transects A and B) placed on
either side of the drainage in the segment failed to detect any cultural materials. However it was
confirmed that the remainder of the pasture had been a previously disturbed agricultural field
used for rice cultivation. Levee and furrow microrelief features similar to those described in the
uplands of Segment A (above) and by Foradas (2006) in the property bounding the parcel to the
east, were observed in the uplands of Segment C. As a result shovel tests were only excavated

30

along Transects A and B in this segment, because both transects traversed narrow strips between
the former rice fields and the sloping banks of the drainage (see Figure 3).
All of the shovel tests placed at 30-meter (100 foot) intervals along Transects A and B in
Segment C were negative. Shovel test profiles revealed a uniform Ap-Bss horizonation typical
of Lake Charles clay (see Crenwelge et al. 1988; SSS NRCS USDA 2006). Bioturbation by
crawfish was common, and in many places a density of one crawfish stack per square meter was
observed.

SEGMENT D
Segment D covered approximately 1.48 hectares (3.65 acres). It encompassed a strip of
the project area west of the Main Drainage and north of Segment C (see Figure 3). At the time
of survey much of Segment D had been stripped of soil and much of it had been filled in a
manner similar to that in Segment A (see Figure 3). Due to the severity of disturbance in this
area caused by recent construction, and the results of background research (see above) that
indicated it had been a rice field, no shovel tests were excavated along the 4 survey transects
placed in the parcel. Pedestrian survey of Segment D failed to detect any cultural materials.

SEGMENT E
Segment E covered approximately 0.96 hectares (2.37 acres). It encompassed a strip of
the project area east of the Main Drainage, north of Segment C and west of the area previously
surveyed by Foradas (2006). It was bounded by a silt fence (see Figure 3). At the time of survey
much of Segment E had been stripped of soil and much of it had been filled in a manner similar
to that in Segments A and D (see Figure 3). A large puddle was located in its center and drained
into a recently channelized drainage along the segment’s east boundary. Due to the severity of
disturbance in this area caused by recent construction, and the results of background research
(see above) that indicated it had been a rice field, no shovel tests were excavated along the
circular survey transect placed along the dry periphery of the parcel. Pedestrian survey of
Segment E failed to detect any cultural materials.

SEGMENT F
Segment F (see Figures 1 and 3) covered approximately 6.48 hectares (16.02 acres) and
encompassed a strip of the project area east of the Main Drainage that was previously surveyed
by Foradas (2006). At the time of survey much of Segment F had been stripped of soil and filled
in a manner similar to that in Segments A, D, and E (see Figure 3). A pedestrian survey of this
segment and a cutbank inspection along the artificial drainage ditch leading into the Main
Drainage were conducted in order to confirm predictions made by Foradas (2006), which had
been used to develop the methodology for the current project.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on 34.4 hectares (85 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a residential
development in Galveston County, Texas. Property associated with this project has been heavily
impacted by activities associated with rice and fig agriculture and to a lesser extent by ethane
pipeline, sewerline, and more recent construction.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to identify
the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current project area. Previously recorded
archaeological sites were not identified within the project area. However, 13 previously
identified archaeological sites (41HR632, 41HR633, 41HR634, 41HR829, 41GV9, 41GV54,
41GV103, 41GV104, 41HR134, 4IGV158, 41GV159, 41GV160) were recorded within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. These resources are not located within the current
project’s APE, and will not be affected by construction.
Field investigation consisted of systematic pedestrian survey along 27 transects,
shovel/auger testing supplemented by Oakfield probing, and photo-documentation. Subsurface
investigation included: 1) the examination of 360 line meters (1181 line feet) of exposed 70 to
110-centimeter (27 to 43-inches) deep cutbank along a freshly re-excavated artificial drainage in
the parcel; and 2) the excavation of 46 shovel/auger tests in minimally disturbed areas to depths
ranging between 25 and 100 centimeters (10 and 39 inches). The number of tests exceeded the
minimum standards recommended by THC of 1 test every 2 acres for surveys in project areas
ranging in size between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11 to 100 acres). The tests also supported
evidence from other archaeological sites in the region, and from County soil reports (cf.
Crenwelge et al. 1988) that indicate that archaeological sites are not likely to occur in former rice
fields. The Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in the Lake Charles series soils in the project area
was also found to be close to the surface and accessible by conventional shovel testing methods.
Project Segments A, D, and E appear to have been severely impacted by recent cutting
and filling associated with construction in the project area. In addition, these segments, and most
of the level ground in Segment C lie entirely in areas known from remote sensing, archival
research, informant interviews, and surface and subsurface investigation to have been disturbed
to culturally sterile depths by rice and fig agriculture (see Foradas 2006). Remaining portions of
Project Segment C were also found to have been disturbed by channelization and improvements
to drainages for irrigation, and by historic and modern construction and land clearance associated
with agricultural practices, and rice and fig agriculture in the uplands. In addition, examination
of over 0.3 kilometers (.2 miles) of fresh cutbank in a drainage ditch tied to the Main Drainage in
Segment C failed to produced evidence of any cultural materials, but produced ample evidence
of bioturbation by crawfish (1 crawfish krotovina per square meter/yard density observed).
Segment B appears to have been disturbed by tree grubbing, plowing and other historic and
modern land clearance, though it may not have been cultivated in rice.

32

During this investigation, cultural remains were not located within the severely disturbed
flat upland project area, and in the less disturbed gently sloping banks of drainages. Since no
archaeological materials were encountered in the project area during survey, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends that no further archaeological work is required and that the project be cleared to
proceed as planned.
