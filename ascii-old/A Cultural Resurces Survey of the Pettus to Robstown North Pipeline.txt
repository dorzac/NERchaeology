Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources background review and
subsequently a linear survey of selected segments along the Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline
right-of-way in both Bee and San Patricio counties, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect is 51.0
miles long x 100 feet (33 m) wide, for a total of 618 acres. With the exception of 1,070 meters of
the right-of-way that will cross tracts of land owned by the City of Beeville, the remainder of the
51-mile right-of-way will cross publicly owned properties. The entire project was privately
funded, and thus no state Antiquities Permit was required for other than the City of Beeville tracts.
The cultural resources survey of those City of Beeville tracts has been reported separately under
the auspices of Antiquities Permit #6743, and is referenced in this report.
Based upon the latest re-alignment, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough
pedestrian survey of selected portions of the right-of-way, and dug 46 shovel tests over several
days during December 2013 through February 2014, resulting in the discovery of 41BE28, a
scatter of historic artifacts in the backyard of a neighborhood tract in Beeville. Tierras Antiguas
assessed the cultural material as in secondary context, with little, if any research potential.
Although a thorough surface survey with shovel testing was conducted in the plotted location of
previously recorded Site 41SP69, no evidence of cultural material was found. Finally, six possibly
historic structures along the periphery of the right-of-way were photographed and their locations
recorded.

Approximately 36 miles of the 51-mile the right-of-way (70.6%) was subjected to an
archaeological survey, before funding for the survey was cut off in February 2014. During our
assessment of the 36 miles, we observed that the pipeline had either already been installed in the
ground, trenching was in progress, or the right-of-way had been machine cleared. That
withstanding, we found no evidence that significant cultural resources had been disturbed during
construction, and thus should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program.
As for the remaining, segmented 15 miles of the right-of-way that has not been subjected to an
archaeological survey, Tierras Antiguas recommended a full survey of these segments also.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Introduction
TexStar Midstream
Services Limited
Partnership of San
Antonio, Texas is the lead
agency for the Pettus to
Robstown North Pipeline
that is
proposed for
construction in Bee and
San Patricio counties
(Figures 1-7).
TexStar Midstream in turn
contracted with Flatrock
Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. of
San Antonio to ensure the
requirements for
environmental and
cultural assessments
would be conducted in a
professional compliance
manner. At the request of
Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas
A r c h a e o l o g i c a l Figure 1. Location of the Project Area, and Bee and San Patricio
Investigations (TAAI) counties in Texas.
conducted a cultural
resources survey of 36 miles of the 51-mile Project Area (PA) during December 2013 through
February 2014 (Figures 1-7).
The project is privately funded, and all but 1,070 meters of the right-of-way will cross privately
owned properties; thus no antiquities permit was required for other than those 1,070 meters that
are owned by the City of Beeville. For that small portion of the right-of-way, TAAI obtained
Antiquities Permit #6743 from the Texas Historical Commission. No evidence of cultural material
was found along that 1,070-meter stretch (Nickels 2014).
The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In addition to a surface survey of 36 miles of the 51-mile
right-of-way, Tierras Antiguas excavated 46 shovel tests adjacent to stream crossings.

Project Setting
Geology
As shown in Figure 11, the Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline will cross over and through nine
geological formations. They are briefly described below (Barnes 1987).

Figure 11. Geological map of the Project Area.

11

The Fleming Formation (Mf) and Fleming Formation and Oakville Sandstone, undivided (Mfo)
consist of light yellowish gray to light gray, calcareous clay and medium-grained sandstone.
Within these are some quartz and chert pebbles, along with petrified wood fragments and
fossilized vertebrates. The Fleming Formations are early Miocene in age, roughly 20 million years
old (Judson and Kauffman 1990).
The Goliad Formation (Mg) was formed during the late Miocene, about 7-14 million years ago.
It is truly a conglomerate of clay, sandstone, marl, caliche, and limestone. The clay is commonly
a light shade of pink or green with local calcareous concretions. Within the clays are crossbedded
inclusions of sandstone, as well as quartz and black and red cherts, and fossilized invertebrates.
Quaternary-aged Alluvium (Qal) is made up of clay, silt, sand, and gravels with abundant organic
material. These recent alluvial deposits are commonly found on point bars, natural levees, stream
channels, backswamps, coastal marshes, mud flats, clay dunes, sand dunes, and oyster reefs, and
terraces along stream channels in Nueces and San Patricio counties (Fisher 1975).
Beaumont Formation clays (QbC) and sands (Qbs) are Middle Pleistocene in age, and are
commonly found on barrier islands and beach formations, as well as along inland stream channels
(Fisher 1975).
Deweyville Formation sand, silt, clay, and gravels (Qd) are possibly Late Pleistocene in age.
Deweyville deposits are commonly found on point bars, natural levees, and both active and relict
stream channels in the near coastal areas of Texas. Typically, these deposits are extant along the
Nueces River up to 55 feet above sea level (Fisher 1975).
The Lissie Formation undivided (Ql) was formed during the early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5 million
years ago (Judson and Kauffman 1990). It consists of sand, silt, clay, along with small quantities
of gravels. Iron oxides and iron-manganese nodules are common, along with some calcium
carbonate concretions.
Fluviatile terrace deposits, undivided (Qt) are the youngest deposits along the pipeline right-ofway, these being laid down during the late Pleistocene, perhaps as late as 30,000 years ago (Judson
and Kauffman 1990). As the name implies, they occur in old stream terraces along valley walls,
and they are made up of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and caliche.

Soils
There are 33 different soil types within the Project Area that offer varying depths, resulting from
in situ soil formation, as well as colluvial and alluvial processes. As such, these various soil
classifications likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist
(Guckian 1981; Guckian and Garcia 1979; Websoil Survey 2013). Table 1 provides a brief
description of these soils, as well as a prediction of their ability to contain deeply buried, intact,
and potentially significant cultural deposits. Soils maps of the PA are then presented in Figures
12-21.

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
The low elevations in Bee and San Patricio counties range from sea level along the Gulf of Mexico
shoreline in San Patricio County, up to 400 feet above sea level in the northwestern portions of
Bee County where the coastal plains give way to rolling caliche hills. Southeasterly flowing rivers
and creeks include the Aransas and Nueces rivers, along with Chiltipin and Medio creeks (Bauer
1996; Guthrie 1996a; Guckian 1981; Guckian and Garcia 1979). Hurricane storm surges have
frequently inundated the low coastal areas as well as areas further inland along the Nueces River.

Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies
within the Coastal Prairie
physiographic region of
Texas (Figure 22). The
region is made up of a
complex of marshes,
upland grassland, and
some forested habitat.
Along riverine environs
are primarily large elms
and oaks, along with
some relict sabal palms,
and thornscrub.
Otherwise, mesquite,
huisache, tall prairie
grasses, and prickly pear
cacti are common.
The regional flora area
has been classified as
being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic
province extending out
from northeast Mexico
(Figure 23). This is the
only part of Texas where
some vegetation exhibits
growth throughout the
year (Blair 1950). Thorny Figure 22. Physiographic regions of Texas (Map 2013).
brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence, with a mix of woody and grassland
species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric times (Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis
1964).
25

The original vegetation
was an open grassland
mixed with brushy
chaparral. Oaks, pecan,
and ash were common
along perennial streams.
Due in part to overgrazing
and the exclusion of fire,
the invasion of woody
species has changed the
vegetation into “Texas
brush country” dominated
by mesquite, acacia, spiny
h a c k b e r ry, braz il ,
whitebrush, lotebrush,
and others (Diamond et
al. 1987:203-221). On
sandy soils, the brush
includes mesquite with
m i x e d gr a s s e s . In
contrast, clay soils
support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora),
various species of Acacia, Figure 23. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
and mimosa, granjeno or
desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia, lindheeimeri), tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950). Modern vegetation in Bee
and San Patricio counties includes cordgrasses, salt grasses, marsh millet, tall grasses, oak,
acacias, mesquite, and prickly pear (Bauer 1996; Guthrie 1996a).
Modern wildlife includes deer, javelina, rabbits, raccoons, coyotes, bobcat, quail, muskrat, beaver,
mink, ring-tailed cat, badger, fox, turkey, duck, geese, jacksnipe, sandhill crane, and whooping
crane. The average annual rainfall in the two counties is just over 30 inches. The average low
temperature is just over 46 degrees in January, the average high temperature is 93 degrees in July,
and the average numer of growing season days is 306. Overall, the climate can be classified as
humid subtropical (Bauer 1996; Guthrie 1996a).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area lies within the Central Texas Coast archaeological region as refined by Ricklis
(2004). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

26

Paleoindian (11,000 - 7500 B.P.)
Although some Paleoindian artifacts have been found, no intact paleoindian components have
been found in the Central Texas Coast region, so that a chronology of the Paleoindian period or
stage cannot be adequately defined (Ricklis 2004). Exasperating the discovery of intact
components is due in part to the rising sea level along the coast since Paleoindian campsites were
occupied; those campsites are presumably under water, far east of today’s shoreline. Ricklis
surmises that if buried and intact Paleoindian components are discovered, they will be in today’s
riverine environments away from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
Early Archaic (7500 - 4200 B.P.)
Two sub-periods are recognized during the 3,300-year Early Archaic period along the Central
Texas Coast. The earlier sub-period ranges from about 7500 to 6800 B.P., and is based upon
radiocarbon dates from shoreline archaeological sites in the Nueces Bay area. Sites during this
period are predominantly oyster shell middens situated on upland margins overlooking the bay.
These middens are the result of exploitation of oysters as a food source, but more often than not
few artifacts have been found. Those chipped stone pieces that have been found resemble Central
and South Texas, Uvalde and Gower dart points. Worked shell pieces include flaked sunray venus
clamshell scrapers and knives. Faunal remains are mostly non-existant at these sites, but that could
be due to the relative rapid disintegration of bone in the silty soils. Otherwise, only a few of the
more resiliant fish otoloiths have been found, suggesting that the occupants of the shoreline at this
time relied heavily on shellfish as their primary food source.
A valid archaeological record for the next circa 1,000 years is largely unknown. However, the later
sub-period of Early Archaic shoreline occupation sites date to around 5800-4200 B.P. Ricklis sites
radiocarbon data from 15 site components dating to this period. Cultural manifestations during this
sub-period are primarily oyster shell lenses, with occasional fish otoloiths and chert flakes.
However, one site (41NU221 - McKinzie Site) yielded a relatively thick shell midden, along with
hundreds of chert flakes, two Bell points, a Tortugas point, and two modified shells. Triangular
dart points have also been found on the surface at the Maens Site (41NU184) in Nueces County.
Potential evidence of an Early Archaic structure in the form of post molds were also documented
at 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Although animal bones are not generally found at these
sites, the presence of chipped stone dart points and scrapers suggest that hunting must have been
very much a part of the subsistence base. Seasonally, data retrieved from oyster shells and fish
otoliths indicate that shellfish were most likely exploited in the winter through early spring, and
fish were trapped or caught in the fall and early spring. Although Ricklis (2004) surmises that
based upon the number of sites discovered, human populations may have increased during this
later sub-period, he cautions that the number of sites that could have existed during the earlier subperiod may well have been destroyed and removed by a dynamically eroding landscape.
Middle Archaic (4200 - 3100 B.P.)
This period is poorly dated, and may reflect a hiatus in Gulf shoreline occupation between 4200
and 3100 B.P. Ricklis (2004) opines that the numerous midden shell deposits that were present
during the Early Archaic and Late Archic, are either absent during the Middle Archaic, or are most
certainly few in number. Environmentally, the relative absence could be attributed to a rapid sea
level rise and highstand during the Middle Archaic. Much more effort needs to be exerted to find
27

and research Middle Archaic components before this period can begin to be more clearly
understood.
Late Archaic (3100 - 950 B.P.)
Roughly 3,000 years ago, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico stabilized to what we see it today.
Much like Central Texas, the archaeological sites along the Central Texas Gulf Coast are larger
than during the Early Archaic, the middens at these sites are thicker, and there are a relatively
wider variety of tools being were being produced and utilized. These data strongly suggest that
populations increased significantly, and sites were likely occupied for longer periods of time.
Concurrent with the stabilized shoreline, and in effect the biotic production offered in coastal
estuaries, gathering shellfish became a very important food source, but supplemented with fish and
white-tailed deer. Around the middle of the Late Archaic, ca. 2,000 years ago, fishing became very
much an important part of the subsistence base. One of the more important Late Archaic
archaeological sites investigated is the Kent-Crane site (41AS3). It is situated on a shoreline bluff
above Copano Bay, was likely occupied as early as about 2,700 years ago, and extends for roughly
1,000 meters along the bluff. The intensive occupation at Kent-Crane is manifested by a sea shell
midden as much as 1.8-meters thick.
A second significant archaeological site in the Central Texas Gulf Coastal area that represents a
Late Archaic occupation period is the Mustang Lake site (41CL3). Once again, this site was
occupied during a period of apparent sea level stabilization very similar to today’s level. The first
occupations at the Mustang Lake site appear to be temporally co-eval with those at the Kent-Crane
site. Once again, there are dense layers of oyster shells, along with bone, and chipped stone. In the
upper-most portion of these midden layers, archaeologists found sandy-paste pottery sherds. Other
significantly important Central Texas Gulf Coastal, Late Archaic sites investigated at Ingleside
Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay include 41SP43 and 41SP120.
Late Prehistoric (950 - 250 B.P. [A.D. 1000 - 1700])
Along the Central Texas Coast area, a marked change in stone tools, the transition from the
shoulder-thrown atlatl to the bow and arrow as a more accurate and deadly killing weapon, and
the production of clay vessels for storage and cooking occurred around 950 B.P. (A.D. 10001700). Ricklis (2004) divides the Central Texas Coast Late Prehistoric period into two subperiods, the Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric.
Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1250/1300)
A robust Initial Late Prehistoric occupation excavated at 41SP120 dates to between A.D. 1022 and
1209. Fish consumption was prolific, with human dietary needs supplemented by the hunting and
consumption of deer. Arrow points recovered at 41SP120 included triangular, Fresno-like
specimens. Further north within the coastal area, Scallorn arrow points have been found in
association with plain, sandy-paste pottery sherds. Although sandy-paste pottery appears to have
been manufactured during the earlier part of this sub-period, there is evidence to suggest that
decorated wares such as Rockport Black-on-Gray were a result of evolving pottery manufacturing
and design during the later centuries.

28

Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300 - 1700)
As with much of the rest of what we now know as Texas, the archaeological record in the Central
Texas Coast area reveals that the variety of chipped stone tools increased dramatically, and the
manufacturing of ceramic vessels in terms of quality, shape, and style changed significantly. These
changes demonstrated a marked advancement in tool production, and food storage and cooking
manufacturing technology, and further infer substantial changes in subsistence choices and
mobility patterns that occurred during this roughly 450-year period.
Chipped stone tools include smaller and presumably stream-lined arrow points such as the Perdiz
type, small unifacially flaked end scrapers, bifacially flaked knives, drills, and small prismatic
blades removed from blade cores. Pottery sherds found at period sites include those from bowls,
jars, and ollas which have been coated or decorated with asphaltum, and may have incised designs,
and even ceramic smoking pipes. Pottery types during the Final Late Prehistoric are named as
Rockport Incised, Rockport Crenelated, and Rockport Black-on-Gray; otherwise referred to as the
“Rockport Phase”. Remains found at Rockport Phase sites suggest the reliance of fish as a food
source probably reached its peak in prehistory, while the reliance on shellfish was largely
overshadowed.
There appears to be a non-discrete boundary between sites located close to the Gulf Coast
compared to those located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. At about that imaginary line,
Rockport pottery typical of shoreline occupations wanes, whereas bone-tempered pottery so
typical of Late Prehistoric Toyah occupations (e.g., Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Hester and Parker
1970; Black 1986) tends to be prevalent. It was during the latter part of this Final Late Prehistoric
sub-period when the bison became so much a predominate part of Toyah occupation, that the
reliance on bison herds also penetrated the imaginary 40-kilometer line west of the Gulf Coast,
along the riverine environs leading to the coast. For example, at the Mellon site (41RF21) in
Refugio County, bison and deer bones were found in association with Scallorn and Perdiz arrow
points, and Rockport pottery sherds.
Historic (ca. A.D. 1700-Present)
Although the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was charted by Spanish Captain Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda in 1520, perhaps the earliest white men to see this land area of Texas were Alvar Nuñez
Cabeza de Vaca, and two or three of his shipwrecked companions. De Vaca traversed parts of
southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). His stay with the Miriami in
1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other in
the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:13-37). In addition, his diary speaks extensively of the ways of the Karankawa
Indians, a nomadic tribe that favored the modern site of the community of Refugio as a campsite
and eventual permanent village (Leffler 1996).
In 1722, the faithful Catholic fathers, with support from the Spanish Crown, established Mission
Señora del Espiritu Santo de Zúñiga in Goliad in an attempt to Christianize and otherwise
29

domesticate the Karankawas. Later, in 1793, Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio was founded
at the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Leffler 1996). However, Indian
depredations caused the location of this mission to be moved twice; the final site to be on the
Mission River in what is now modern-day Refugio. In 1830, the mission was closed, but by that
time Mexican ranchos surrounded the area.
In the early 1830s, colonists from Ireland, New York, and New Orleans were enticed to settle in
the area under empressario land contracts. During the Texas Revolution in 1835, residents of the
area were forced to flee to the east during the “Runaway Scrape”, and the Mexican town of La
Bahia was nearly destroyed.
Following the Civil War, the area’s economy was bolstered by cattle ranching and corn farming.
However, by 1900 the cattle industry had declined significantly. With the coming of railways in
the early 1900s, and a renewed cotton demand, cotton became the most predominate cash crop.
In the 1920s, oil and gas were discovered in the area, and although somewhat diminished by the
Great Depression, production of oil and gas in the area has been a mainstay, and today is on a
springboard driving the economy of Bee and San Patricio counties.

Site Types to be Expected Along the Pipeline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Bee and San Patricio counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the late Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped
for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of
people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these
same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these
large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing
multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from
making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different
food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads
and tunas, and agave hearts.
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
30

occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are not a real common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline (most probably due to the paucity of chert or other knappable
lithics available). These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were
left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general
absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites suggest
that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However, small
camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes
removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality
of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’
the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the
cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor
quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from
these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the
thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters
in the Nueces and San Patricio County areas have been documented along upper stream terraces
abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times
they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet
freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are
very rare in the Central Texas Coast region for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
31

stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented of burned rock middens in either Nueces or San Patricio counties.
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes
unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and
the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a
full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas,
see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented on eight sites within San
Patricio County, and are occasionally found elsewhere in the Central Texas Coast region.
Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both upland
and coastal settings, as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Shell Middens
As discussed in the “Cultural Chronology” section above, within an approximate 40-kilometer
(25-mile) zone from the modern Gulf Coast shoreline, archaeologists should expect to discover
prehistoric campsites where shellfish were exploited in abundance as a food source. As a result,
the thousands, or hundreds-of-thousands of shells were discarded, and over repeated usage, these
sites can be identified by layers of shell refuse sometimes as much as 1 to 2 meters in accumulated
depth. Although these refuse middens are more often than not directly associated with relative
long-term open campsites with campfire remains, bone, pottery, and chipped stone, because of the
vast accumulation of shell debris, archaeologists have tended to describe the overall site as a “shell
midden site”.
Historic Sites
Early explorers ventured into the area beginning in the 1500s, both the French and Spanish
established permanent structures in the region in the 17th and 18th centuries, and Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in the area by the early 19th century. Historic sites are not abundant,
but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to ranching and
farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types most
commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation remains
from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial or
cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Bee County History
The earliest European contact with native Americans in what is now modern-day Bee County was
with Karankawa bands in the Southeastern portion of the county, closer to the Gulf of Mexico,
while Lipan Apaches, Borrados, and Skidi Pawnee groups were observed roaming the western and
Southwestern areas. The first land grant was availed to Carlos Martinez by the Spanish
government in 1789, and the first permanent settlers were Irishmen who settled along Papalote
Creek in 1828 as part of the Power and Hewetson Colony. The Beeville area was initially settled
in 1834 by Irish members of the McMullen-McGloin colony. During the Texas Revolution in
1836, early settlers fled to the east, but later returned to establish large ranches on the abundant
grasslands.
Following the establishment of Bee County in 1857, Beeville-on-the Poesta (nee Maryville) was
named the county seat in 1860. Although the Civil War negatively impacted most of Texas, Bee
County was essentially spared from economic devastation, so that by 1870 cattle and sheep raising
was flourishing. By the 1880s, corn, flax, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables were the predominant
economy crops. By 1887, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad was extended from San
Antonio through Pettus to Beeville, Skidmore, and Papalote. Agriculture and ranching activities
continued to dominate the economy in Bee County through the 1920s.
In 1929, the economic factor was spurred by oil and gas exploration and production when rich
field were discovered around Pettus. As with the some areas of the rest of Texas, Bee County’s
economy was bolstered by the construction of air fields and production facilities during World
War II. Following the war, agribusiness spurred the economy and population growth. In recent
years, oil and gas extraction have been the mainstay for development in Bee County (Bauer 1996).

San Patricio County History
Artifacts found in San Patricio County suggest that the area has been occupied for at least the past
6,000 years. Around A.D. 1400, the Karankawa Indians inhabited the area, and written historic
accounts reveal that the Karankawas, Coahuiltecans, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas were
encountered by Europeans explorers and settlers. The earliest known explorer was Alonso Álvarez
de Pineda, a Spaniard who in 1519 sailed into the bays behind Aransas Pass. In 1689 and again
in 1691, Spaniard Alonso de León sailed along the coast, exploring the bays. Frenchmen sailors
landed on St. Joseph Island in 1712, and again in 1718. The interior of San Patricio County was
later penetrated by Spaniard Ortiz Parrilla. In 1828, the Mexican government granted 80 leagues
of land in the area to empresarios John McMullen and James McGloin provided they would settle
200 Irish catholic families on the land. The first families arrived in 1829, and established the town
of San Patricio de Hibernia on the north side of the Nueces River (Guthrie 1996a).
The Texas Revolutionary War brought turmoil to San Patricio County, as it did with most of
Texas. In 1835, a company of volunteer militia from the McMullen and McGloin Colony captured
Fort Lipantitlán, a Mexican fort built in 1833 to restrict Anglo immigration into Texas (Guthrie
1996b).
33

Most colonists were forced to evacuate the area due to the war, and even following the war, the
Mexican army continued raids into the area as late as 1842. As a result the county was depopulated
except for the soldiers, a few traders, and a few adventurers who dared pass through. General
Zachary’s army stabilized the area in 1845, and by 1850 settlers began moving back into San
Patricio County. Cattle and sheep were the main livestock raised in the 1850s, and local farmers
raised corn, sweet potatoes, potatoes, beans, and peas. During the Civil War the “Cotton Road”
which ran through the county became a major smuggling route to Matamoras County. Both
Confederate and Union forces were present in the county. The Confederacy built a fort at Aransas
Pass, the Union sent ships to the area in an attempt to stem the smuggling, and Union sailors
landed near Ingleside, burning houses and confiscating livestock (Guthrie 1996a).
Following the considerable disruption during the Civil War, earlier settlers again began returning
to San Patricio County. The land was cheap, and new immigrants returning from the war found
the area a desirable place to live and raise crops. By 1870, there were 602 people living in the
county, roughly 52,000 acres were being farmed, and corn was the major cash crop. In 1896, the
St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway was routed through the county, and Rockport was
envisioned as a major deep-water port on the Gulf of Mexico. The discovery of oil and gas
deposits in the early 1900s further caused land prices to rise, as the local economy diversified from
a predominantly farming base. By the 1980s, large industries were fully operational along the
bayfront, and shrimp and other seafoods were exported in large quantities. Although, the oil and
gas boom experienced in the county waned significantly in the 1970s, the county is currently once
again experiencing a boom in these industries (Guthrie 1996a).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. That said, the data that
is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of the near coastal areas of Texas that
the surveys represent. Most of the near coastal areas of exas have never been subjected to formal
cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is
very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at
least some aspect of what the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Bee County
As of January 25, 2014 there were only 25 archaeological sites recorded within all of Bee County.
Despite the few numbers, a review of the projectile points that have been recovered from the 12
prehistoric open campsites indicates that Bee County has been occupied periodically through time
over the past 9,500 years. The most fully documented site in Bee County is 41BE2, the Berclair
Terrace Site, where deeply buried Paleoindian materials have been recovered in association with
Pleistocene fauna (Bousman et al. 2004; Nash 2001; Hester 1977; Sellards 1940). Six prehistoric
lithic scatters have been documented in Bee County, along with eight historic components; these
being a circa 1880s lime kiln, the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific Railway terminal in Beeville’s
Veterans Park, two early 1900s farmsteads, and a 1900s trash scatter. Finally, the Bee County
34

Courthouse in Beeville, and three prehistoric open campsites in Veterans Park are listed as State
Archaeological Landmarks (Atlas 2014).
San Patricio County
As of January 25, 2014 there were 261 archaeological sites recorded in San Patricio County. Of
those, 172 are described as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the late Paleoindian
through Late Prehistoric periods. A few of those Late Prehistoric sites also exhibit very early EuroAmerican artifacts, suggesting they span into a transitional period what Hester (2004) would term
as the Protohistoric. Notably, there are 67 archaeological sites where oyster shell middens make
up the bulk of the features, and these shell middens are the predominant feature on over 30% (52
of 172) of the open campsites. There are 32 archaeological sites classified as prehistoric lithic
scatters or procurement sites where broken stone tools, tested cobbles, cores, and debitage are
present.
Human burials have been found at eight sites in the county. Although seven of the eight are
prehistoric in age, skeletal remains of a single individual found at one site may have been a victim
of the hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast in 1919. Historic components have been
documented at 34 sites. These range in age from the very earliest presence of Anglo Americans
in the county, to established farmsteads and cemeteries through the 1950s. Among the many
examples of historic sites are the ghost town of Angelita, a Spanish Colonial and Republic of
Texas road, trash scatters with musket balls and bottle glass, early ranching and farmstead
buildings, and Civilian Conservation Corps structures. The only State Archeological Landmark
listed in San Patricio County is a wreck of the ship “Dayton” (Atlas 2014).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the
regions. The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area
as documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

35

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the linear rightof-way was conducted. Two or three archaeologists meandered back and forth across the 33-meter
wide right-of-way to ensure more complete coverage. Surface visibility varied widely along the
right-of-way.
Much of the Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline right-of-way parallels existing pipelines. As such
those segments of the right-of-way were previously disturbed. Approximately 18.6 miles (36
percent) of the 51mile right-of-way
located in the
southern portion
courses through
recently cultivated
fields where
surface visibility
was greater than
95 percent (see for
example, Figure
24). In these areas
a full pedestrian
survey was
conducted, but no
shovel tests were
excavated.

Beeville limits.
Otherwise, the pipeline right-of-way crosses rangeland pastures and previously cultivated, but now
fallow fields where surface visibility ranged from 30 percent to greater than 70 percent. In these
areas, shovel tests were excavated at the discretion of the Principal Investigator/Project
Archaeologist, dependent upon the terrain and the estimated potential for buried and intact cultural
resources to exist, with particular attention provided to stream crossings with potential terrace
deposits. A total of 46 shovel tests were placed in areas deemed to be of moderate and high
36

probability for buried and
intact archaeological
deposits to exist (Figure
25), as well as in the
plotted location of
a r c h a e o l o gi c a l s i t e
41SP69 (discussed further
below). In addition, all
cutbanks, and rodent and
mammal backdirt piles
along the right-of-way
were thoroughly
examined.

policy, cultural material

collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious
notes.
Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early ArchaicPaleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case
basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be
documented with photographs and included in this report of investigations.
All shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel
tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled shovel
test. The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and the results are
available upon request from Tierras Antiguas in Martindale, Texas; see also, Figure 26.
The lone archaeological site discovered (41BE28) was mapped using a pace-and-compass method,
as well as a GPS. Field notes were made about the site and a sketch map was drawn. Digital
photographs of the site and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs
representing the surveyed right-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.
In the case of previously recorded site 41SP69, a thorough pedestrian survey was conducted,
and six shovel tests were dug within the pipeline right-of-way. However, as discussed below,
we found no evidence of cultural material either on or below the surface.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
Typically, sandy clay and
clay soils with
fragmented limestone
caliche were encountered
in the upland, northern
portion of the ROW,
while expected deeper
clay loams were present
along the lower portion
(see for example, Figure
27). Most notably, not a
single chert or other type
of raw material suitable
for the manufacturing of
stone tools was observed
along the entire 36 miles

for example, Figure 28).
The only evidence of
historic materials
observed within the rightof-way was on the surface
of Site 41BE28, described
below, along with three

auspices of Antiquities Permit #6743, and has previously been reported (Nickels 2014). A
thorough surface survey with shovel testing was conducted in the plotted location of Site 41SP69,
resulting in the discovery of no cultural material; this site is also further discussed below. Finally,
we observed six possibly historic structures along the periphery of the right-of-way. Photographs
of these are included following the archaeological site discussions.

corner of a
privately owned tract that is in a cultivated hayfield. Because the right-of-way had recently been
machine bladed prior to our site visit on January 15, 2014, surface visibility was nearly 100percent (see Figure 30).

Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface both within the 33-meter (100-foot) right-of-way, as well as along
its periphery suggests that cultural material has been dispersed across an area of approximately
2,000 square meters; extending roughly 100 meters north-to-south x 20 meters east-to-west along
the right-of-way. The scatter was obviously surficial in nature only, with caliche fragments
prevalent across the surface, and no shovel tests were dug.

40

Artifacts observed within the
heavily disturbed right-of-way
included decorated and
undecorated whiteware, machine
made glass of various colors with
no hue, but obvious patina, and
unidentifiable metal fragments,
both ferrous and non-ferrous (see
Figures 31 and 32 for selected
examples).
Bottle and jar glass makers marks
observed included Hazel Atlas,
and Owens-Illinois. A light green
Coke bottle sherd exhibited
portions of a trademark bottling
company that is most probably
that of the Beeville Coca Cola
Bottling Plant, in production from
the 1930s.

Recommendations

dispersing ceramics, glass, and
metal from south to north. However, our assessment is that the trash dump possessed little if any
cultural significance before it was disturbed by pipeline construction. Other than its positioning
on the landscape, in its current heavily disturbed condition, we assess the research value of the
portion of the site that lies within the Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline right-of-way as minimal
at best. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Pettus to Robstown
North Pipeline as planned be allowed to proceed through the site, with no further investigations.

41SP69
Description
According to a site
recording form filled out
by D. R. Espy and C. K.
Chandler in January
1968, this site lies on the
north side of Chiltipin
Creek in a cultivated field
where artifacts were
found in a shallow wash
paralleling the creek for
about 300 yards (Atlas
2014). Additionally, the
site was reported to be
just east of County Road
25. Based upon the
Longitude and Latitude
coordinates provided by
Espy and Chandler, and
using a NAD27 datum,
the site should be located
20-30 meters east of
County Road 25. They
describe it as a prehistoric
open campsite likely
occupied during the
Archaic, with artifacts on
the surface of a shallow
wash, and a possible shell
midden about 100 feet in Figure 33. Shovel tests in area of 41SP69 as plotted.
diameter at the east end of the wash. The site as plotted on the Texas Atlas indicated that the Pettus
to Robstown North Pipeline would go though the middle of the site.
Levels of Effort and Results
In 1968, Espy and Chandler reported the presence of stone knives, dart points, choppers, gouges,
and fired clay balls. In December 2013, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists observed no cultural
material on the surface within the pipeline right-of-way. In addition, six shovel tests excavated to
60 cmbs in the plotted site location revealed no evidence of cultural material (Figure 33 and 34).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Based upon Espy and Chandler’s description in 1968, there seems to be no doubt that a potentially
significant Archaic archaeological site exists within the area. Most intriguing is their observation
of fired clay balls. Fired clay balls on Archaic sites have previously been reported on near coastal
43

sites, but have
more recently been
highlighted further
inland along the
San Antonio River
valley (e.g.,
Padilla and
Trierweiler 2012).
However, in sum,
based upon our
investigations in
2013, we can only
surmise that the
location of 41SP69
as plotted on the
Texas Atlas is
incorrect.

Potentially Historic
Structures along the
Periphery of the Rightof-Way
In accordance with the
latest guidance from the
Texas Historical
Commission and the
Council of Texas
Archeologist, structures
along the periphery of the
right-of-way that were
possibly 45 years and
older were photographed.
They are shown in
Figures 35-39, as they
appeared from the
pipeline right-of-way.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources background review and
subsequently a linear survey of selected segments along the Pettus to Robstown North Pipeline
right-of-way in both Bee and San Patricio counties, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect was 51.0
miles long x 100 feet (33 m) wide, for a total of 618 acres. With the exception of 1,070 meters of
the right-of-way that will cross tracts of land owned by the City of Beeville, the remainder of the
51-mile right-of-way will cross publicly owned properties. The entire project was privately
funded, and thus no state Antiquities Permit was required for other than the City of Beeville tracts.
The cultural resources survey of those City of Beeville tracts was previously reported separately
under the auspices of Antiquities Permit #6743, and is referenced in this report.
Based upon the latest re-alignment, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough
pedestrian survey of selected portions of the right-of-way, and dug 46 shovel tests over several
days during December 2013 through February 2014, resulting in the discovery of 41BE28, a
scatter of historic artifacts in the backyard of a neighborhood tract in Beeville. Tierras Antiguas
assessed the cultural material as in secondary context, with little, if any research potential.
Although a thorough surface survey with shovel testing was conducted in the plotted location of
previously recorded Site 41SP69, no evidence of cultural material was found. Finally, six possibly
historic structures along the periphery of the right-of-way were photographed and their locations
recorded.
Approximately 36 miles of the 51-mile the right-of-way (70.6%) was subjected to an
archaeological survey, before funding for the survey was cut off in February 2014. During our
assessment of the 36 miles, we observed that the pipeline had either already been installed in the
ground, trenching was in progress, or the right-of-way had been machine cleared. That
withstanding, we found no evidence that significant cultural resources had been disturbed during
construction, and thus should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program.
As for the remaining, segmented 15 miles of the right-of-way that has not been subjected to an
archaeological survey, Tierras Antiguas recommends a full survey of these segments also.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.
