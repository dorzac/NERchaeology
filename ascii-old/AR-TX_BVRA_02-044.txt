ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a pedestrian survey of a
33.88 acre tract of land south of the city limits of Oakwood, Texas in Leon County, Texas
on October 22 and 29, 1996. The area investigated is the site of a proposed wastewater
treatment plant designed by J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. of Palestine, Texas, the
project engineers for this project. No Federal agency was involved in this project which
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 1741.
One historic site (41LN421) with a minor prehistoric component was identified
within the project area. The historic site consists of a standing structure and hand-dug,
brick-lined well that was constructed in the 1950s to house employees of a local sawmill
that was adjacent to this structure. The prehistoric component consists of three pieces of
lithic debitage (flakes) and several pieces of burned rock found between 40 and 50
centimeters below the surface. The age and function of the prehistoric component is not
known; however, it is assumed to represent a low-density, short-term utilization of the
area sometime during the prehistoric past.
In addition, a recent trash dump was found in the southwest corner of the project
area. The artifacts in this area consisted primarily of modern trash dating to the middle of
the 20th century and later. It was not assigned a site number.
Site 41LN421 and the historic dump are not considered to contain significant
research potential. Therefore, additional work is not considered by BVRA to be
necessary, and it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned.
Most of the project area is in low-lying flood zone areas as determined by an
environmental study under subcontract to J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. and is
considered by BVRA to be low probability for the presence of archaeological sites. The
area where site 41LN421 is located has been disturbed through plowing, road and fence
construction, and a buried telephone cable. Copies of the report have been distributed to
the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission for distribution
and curation. The artifacts have not been retained for curation.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Oakwood, Texas proposes to construct a wastewater treatment plant
on a 33.88 acre tract of land outside the city limits of Oakwood in the extreme northeast
part of the county near the Freestone County line (Figure 1). The project area is bisected
by Toms Creek, a tributary of the Northwest Fork of Boon's Creek which joins the Trinity
River to the southeast. The project area is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S. topographic
quadrangle, Oakwood, dated 1964 (Figure 2). At the time of the survey the project area
was being used as a pasture for horses and cattle. Proposed construction consists of two
detention ponds, a lagoon, and a reroute of a portion of Tom's Creek. The boundaries of
the project area are F.M. Road 831 on the west, F.M. Road 542 on the east, a tract
containing an existing wastewater treatment plant to the north on property owned by the
City of Oakwood, and private land to the south (Figure 3, base map courtesy of J. F.
Fontaine & Associates, Inc.). The treatment plant as planned will be constructed on a
sandy ridge overlooking the floodplain of Toms Creek to the east. Subsurface impact will
be at least six feet deep, and the entire surface of this landform will be disturbed during
construction. The standing structure may be demolished, and the well will be capped and
filled. Prior to this study, an Environmental Impact Statement was prepared by J. F.
Fontaine & Associates, Inc. (1996). This investigation estimated that 60 percent of the
project area lies within the 100-year floodplain as depicted in Figure 4 (courtesy of J. F.
Fontaine & Associates, Inc.). The methods used to make this determination is taken from
their report. According to J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. (1996:Page 4, Item Number
7).
The Flood Hazard Boundary Map from the Federal Insurance
Administration was provided for the area within the city limits of the Town of
Oakwood. The 100-year floodplain was highlighted on this map. The
proposed plant property is located just south of the City of Oakwood. Flood
maps are not available for the location of the proposed plant site. The
floodplain within the location of the proposed facilities was estimated using
the existing flood maps for the City of Oakwood and past flood levels
observed by the residents in the Oakwood area.
Past observations indicate that the flood level is above the existing
wastewater treatment facilities. A recent flood has submerged the ponds
and damaged the existing levees. The floodplain map for the Tow of
Oakwood was used in determining the varying elevations of the 100-year
floodplain at areas north of the plant site. The floodplain at the plant site
was estimated by measuring the distance of the drop in elevation of the
flood zone within the city limits of Oakwood and by using the existing
contours of the plant site to estimate the floodplain boundaries at that point.
The observations of the residents in the Oakwood area were then used to
verify the approximate flood levels.

Leon County is an area that contains numerous significant archaeological sites,
both prehistoric and historic, and the area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations. Realizing the potential for sites within the proposed wastewater
treatment plant, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection,
requested the area be examined by a professional archaeologist in a letter to Ms. Laura
N. Fontaine dated June 28, 1996. In order to satisfy this requirement, J. F. Fontaine &
Associates, Inc. retained the services of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to
conduct the cultural resources survey. The project number assigned by BVRA is 96-07.
The project area was obtained by the City of Oakwood through the purchase of two
separate tracts. These are a tract of 22.56 acres in the B. Millspaugh Survey (A-589).
Reference to this tract is found in Volume 493, Page 280 of the Leon County Deed
Records. This is the south half of the project area. The second tract is 11.255 acres and
is in the B. Millspaugh Survey (A-589). Reference to this tract is found in Volume 493,
Page 280 of the Leon County Deed Records. This is the north half of the project area.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Leon County is taken from the soil survey
(Neitsch et al. 1989) and the 1984-1985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Leon County is situated in the eastern part of Central Texas and consists of 690,861
acres or 1079 square miles including areas under water. It has an irregular shape and is
about 28 miles long by 40 miles wide. Elevation in the county varies between 630 feet
above sea level in the west-central part of the county to about 140 feet in the southeast
area. Overall, the topography is characterized as undulating to gently rolling and
generally sloping to the southeast.
Leon County is located in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, Texas Claypan Area, and
Texas Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas. The soils in the county formed
under timber, post oak savannah, and prairie vegetation. Those formed under timber or
post oak savannah are light-colored fine sandy loam to fine sand while soils that formed
under grass consist of dark colored fine sandy loam to clay. The county is drained by
numerous creeks and streams that flow into the Trinity and Navasota rivers which form
the east and west boundaries of the county, respectively. Annual rainfall varies from 39 to
46 inches. The January minimum temperature is 38 degrees and the July maximum
temperature is 95 degrees. These climatic conditions create a growing season of 270
days.
There are four soil types in the project area (Neitsch et al. 1989:Sheet 1). These
are Axtell fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (AxB), Hatliff fine sandy loam, frequently
flooded (Ha), Wilson clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (WcA), and Lummus fine sandy
loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (LmB). The soil type that forms the landform on which site
41LN421 is located is Axtell fine sandy loam. This is a deep, gently sloping and
moderately well drained soil found on uplands and old terraces. The areas where this soil
occurs are mostly oblong to irregular in shape and vary in size from about 10 to 600 acres.
The surface layer usually consists of a strongly acid, dark grayish-brown fine sandy loam
about four inches thick, and the subsurface layer, to a depth of eight inches, is a strongly
acid, grayish-brown fine sandy loam. A strongly acid, yellowish-red clay to a depth of 18
inches forms the subsoil. Permeability is very slow, and the available water capacity is
moderate. Erosion due to erosion is severe due to medium to rapid runoff.
The remaining soils in the project area are found on bottom lands (Ha), concave
side slopes or near the head of drainageways on uplands (LmB), and on ancient terraces
and uplands (WcA). Of these three, Hatliff fine sandy loam and Wilson clay loam are
viewed as low probability areas in terms of prehistoric site locations. Because of the fact
that Wilson clay loam is found on ancient terraces and uplands, the possibility of
prehistoric sites in these locations is considered likely. Only a small portion of the current
project area, however, is located in this soil type.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Leon County is situated
within the Prairie-Savanna archeological study region. Although 420 sites have been
recorded at TARL prior to this survey, the site density in the county is low in terms of sites
per square mile. Figure 1.1.3 in the planning document indicates that in 1993 Leon
County had only 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. This makes Leon County one of the
counties with the lowest site density in the state. In 1985, according to a statistical
overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:83), Leon
County contained 115 recorded sites. It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in
detail the archaeological background of Leon County, especially when several recent
in-depth studies are available. Therefore, the following discussion is taken from the
planning document for the Eastern Planning Region and several of the more recent
contract reports.
The first major archaeological project to affect Leon County was the Lake
Limestone study (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir). The lake is located in Leon,
Limestone, and Robertson counties with the majority of the project area in Limestone
County. This work was conducted by the Texas Archeological Survey in 1974 under
contract with the Brazos River Authority (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974). Only
areas of high site probability such as floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota
River and its major tributaries were surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded
within the reservoir area. Of this number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or
slopes of eroded valley margins. Fifteen historical localities were noted but not recorded
as sites. National Register eligibility testing was conducted in 1975 (Prewitt 1975) and
1976 (Prewitt and Mallouf 1977). Mitigation was conducted at four of the Lake Limestone
sites in late 1977 under the direction of David S. Dibble and Elton R. Prewitt (Mallouf
1979). One site (41LN21) is in Leon County.
Following the Lake Limestone project, the next major study in Leon County was
conducted at Jewett Mine where work was performed from 1980 to 1991 and is still
ongoing. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property, and most of our
current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area has been obtained
from these studies. Archaeological firms who have worked at the mine include Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. (1980), Geo-Marine, Inc., Prewitt and Associates, Inc., and the
Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University.

8

One of the more significant studies in the county was a 1981 survey by Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. (Freeman and Voellinger 1982) of the first five-year Texas
Railroad Commission Permit area. The prehistoric sites found appear to represent a
hunting and gathering economy which spanned the Archaic through Neo-American
periods. A central based wandering exploitation system with base camps along the major
creeks and specialized activity areas along tributary streams is suggested. The historic
sites date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are related to the domestic,
commercial, and industrial development, and/or settlement of the area. Fifty-seven
prehistoric sites were found during this survey. Diagnostic artifacts recovered during this
survey indicate a prehistoric occupation which spanned the early, middle, and late
Archaic and the Neo-American stages. Additionally, they are viewed as an indication of
the area's culturally peripheral location providing evidence of culture contact with areas to
the north, east, and west.
A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted by this and previous surveys.
Soil probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of Mine Creek,
for example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 centimeters of soils over a clay base. In
these areas sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill upstream, however,
an abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-62). One
suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the possibility that certain plants that
prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by prehistoric populations. Prewitt
and Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites along the major tributaries. They
attribute this to the possibility that desirable or needed resources were more readily
available along the mainstem valley than along the tributaries.
Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher terraces
and upland margins are smaller in areal extent and contain less material cultural remains
than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent habitational sites with
artifact assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations. Features such as hearths,
storage pits, and structural remains might be found in sites along the major creeks while
the smaller sites at higher elevations should contain activity specific tool assemblages.
The authors (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-64) comment on the difficulty of
assessing site depth and size in the project area. Most sites were found by a single flake
in shovel tests. According to them, "the general lack of surface evidence indicating the
presence of cultural manifestations will require testing far beyond the scope of an
archaeological survey to adequately address real site dimensions." The intensive shovel
testing during this survey sometimes failed to disclose a site's integrity. Many sites, for
example, have no obvious stratigraphy beyond the gradual change from humic sand to
sand to clayey sand. In all, 46 historic sites were recorded. These sites include the
following types: mine, house sites, industrial features, commercial buildings, outbuildings,
and a cemetery.

In 1982, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Voellinger et al. 1983) tested sites
41LN138 and 41LN156 in Leon County. Site 41LN138 was determined to be ineligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Although burned rock features
were present at this site, these kinds of features have been extensively studied by other
researchers. Therefore, it was decided that additional excavation would not provide
significant or new information regarding this site. Site 41LN156, however, was
determined to be eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places as it
represents a major occupational site which does not conform to current theories of
settlement patterns during the Archaic and post-Archaic stages and is in a relatively
undisturbed condition.
The next contractor to work at Jewett Mine was Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
Beginning with National Register testing of sites 41LN134 and 41LN144 in 1984 (Fields
1984), seven different testing and mitigation projects were conducted through 1991.
These efforts include National Register testing of seven prehistoric sites (41LN29A,
41LN106, 41LN146, 41LN149A - 41LN149D) and two historic sites (41LN57 and
41LN149A) in 1985 (Fields et al. 1986); excavation at sites 41LN149B and 41LN30 in
1986 (Fields 1987); National Register assessment of six prehistoric sites (41LN102,
41LN103, 41LN107, 41LN220, 41LN227, and 41LN237) in 1988 (Fields et al. 1988);
excavation at two prehistoric sites (41LN29A and 41LN106) in 1987 and 1988 (Fields
1990); National Register assessment of five prehistoric sites (41LN247, 41LN253,
41LN255, 41LN256, and 41LN272) and three historic sites (41LN247B, 41LN248A, and
41LN256A) in 1988 and 1989 (Fields et al. 1990); excavations at prehistoric site 41LN247
and limited testing at prehistoric sites 41LN253 and 41LN270 in 1989 (Fields et al. 1991);
and National Register assessment of five prehistoric sites (41LN39, 41LN249 - 41LN251,
and 41LN260) in 1991 (Fields et al. 1992).
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. also conducted a large scale survey of 10,000 acres at
Jewett Mine in 1987 (Fields 1988). This investigation is the first cultural resources work to
be done in this portion of the mine. This study consisted of three major areas: the field
survey, an intensive geomorphological evaluation, and integrating the data with previous
surveys to create a management plan utilizing information from 180 prehistoric sites and
126 historic sites. In all, 51 prehistoric sites were recorded in Leon County as a result of
this project. Of the historic sites, 34 are in Leon County. A major part of this project was
the synthesis of data from the area which resulted in the resource management plan. The
authors present their data in a format that allows the reader to understand how they
arrived at decisions concerning eligibility of prehistoric and historic sites. Certain terms
are defined and recommendations are made for future work in the area.
Continuing work at Jewett Mine, the Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas
A&M University tested four historic sites (41LN108, 41LN114, 41LN157, and 41LN158)
for significance in 1987 (Panos et al. 1987). Not one of these sites was recommended for
additional work.

10

In 1988, the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University
conducted testing and excavation of Historic period sites (Jurney and Green 1993). One
of these sites (41LN227), the homestead of the Hardy Webb family from the 1880s to
circa 1910, is in Leon County. It was recommended for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places.
The Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University surveyed
205 acres in 1989 but found no sites in Leon County (Jurney 1992). Five previously
recorded sites in the county were evaluated for significance. Not one of these sites was
recommended for warrant additional work.
Geo-Marine's involvement at Jewett Mine consisted of a study and evaluation of
the Evansville mines that produced lignite in the early 20th century from 1907 to 1931
(Lebo and Austin 1992). This informative and detailed project provides, in the authors'
(Lebo and Austin 1992:115) words, "a general context for examining lignite mining
communities and their associated cultural, archeological, architectural, and oral-history
resources." They state that no such study concerning industrial complexes in Texas has
been previously performed.
In addition to the Lake Limestone and Jewett Mine projects, other work has been
conducted in various parts of Leon County. These include a transmission line survey by
Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Sundborg 1988), a reconnaissance of areas proposed
for sewer and water supply improvements by Daniel E. Fox (1985) of the Texas
Department of Water Resources, a survey of portions of the Keechi Creek Wildlife
Management Area by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Davis 1989), a survey of
the proposed Fort Boggy State Park by James E. Corbin (1992), and a survey of the
Concord Robbins WSC project (112 miles) by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(Moore 1994).
The vast amount of work in Leon County, particularly Jewett Mine and Lake
Limestone, has resulted in the recording of over 400 sites in the region when adjacent
counties are included. In Leon County alone, the total number of recorded sites prior to
this study was 420. In addition to the numerous surveys, testing has been conducted at
56 prehistoric sites with data recovery performed at 14 sites. Despite problems with the
archaeological record of the region, such as low site visibility and interpretation based on
survey data, poor preservation of organic remains, a scarcity of sites with clear
stratigraphy, and the prevalence of bioturbation and other disturbance factors, much has
been learned about the prehistory of the area. Fields et al. (1991) integrated data from
the eight excavated sites at Jewett Mine and three excavated sites at Lake Limestone to
compile the most recent synthetic effort for this area. This study resulted in the isolation
of 35 cultural components or analytical units. All but two of these units represent
occupations during the late Archaic, Woodland, or Late Prehistoric periods (Fields et al.
1992). The interested reader is referred to these documents for more information
regarding the prehistoric and historic development of Leon County and vicinity. The
report by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1994) contains a list of all previous
investigations in Leon County at the time of that study.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the 100% pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The 33.88 acre tract was examined with high
site probability areas receiving the most attention. Prior to entering the field, the site
records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of the existing
literature for Leon County was conducted. These tasks were completed by the Principal
Investigator who was also present at least 75% of the time during the field survey.
All areas that appeared suitable for the presence of prehistoric sites were shovel
tested. Each test was recorded on a shovel test log and discussed in the project notes.
The excavated matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth and all recovered
artifacts were collected and bagged. In all, 9 shovel tests, 20 shovel probes, and 4
backhoe trenches were excavated.
The project area consists primarily of floodplain soils with few upland areas and
sandy terraces. The one high probability area where a standing structure was present
received the most attention. Here, three shovel tests and one backhoe trench were
excavated, and the site was mapped using a compass and tape. The floodplain areas
were tested by shovel probing and backhoe trenching (Figure 3). Profiles of the four
backhoe trenches were drawn and are depicted in Appendix I. Shovel probes were
employed randomly across the project area to determine areas of shallow soils and clay
at the surface. These probes were used to determine the placement of the backhoe
trenches in the floodplain areas. No mechanical or hand dug test units were placed in the
lower drainage areas because of the shallow soils, often with clay at the surface. BVRA
believes that there is a very low probability of significant cultural resources in these areas,
especially in the southeast corner where Toms Creek and one of its tributaries are
present. This is a very low, wet area. It was not possible to get the backhoe into some of
these wetland areas or in some of the thickly vegetated areas in the southwest corner.
In addition to the field survey, available county histories were examined and, local
residents questioned about the area where the site was found. A major informant was
former Mayor of Oakwood, Ruby Johnson, who moved to the town in 1946. Her memory
of the area at that time provides the best documentation of the date and function of
historic site 41LN421.
The artifact return was minimal and consisted of only three prehistoric flakes and
recent historic specimens such as window glass, bottle glass, modern nails, and a broken
marble. Therefore, BVRA requested permission to discard the artifacts following
analysis. Permission was granted from the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas
State Historic Preservation Office in a letter dated November 8, 1996, and the artifacts
were discarded.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Records Check
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded sites in the project area.
Two previously recorded prehistoric sites (41LN217 and 41LN376) were found to be in
the general area. Unfortunately, however, very little information regarding these two sites
is present in their site files. A review of the literature revealed that several major projects
have been conducted in Leon County, and significant prehistoric and historic sites are
present.
Field Survey
This investigation examined 33.88 acres and resulted in the discovery of one
previously unrecorded archaeological site that was registered with TARL as 41LN421
(Figure 3) and a recent trash dump which was not recorded as a site (Figure 3).
According to local historian Ruby Johnson (personal communication, November 28,
1996), who moved to Oakwood in 1946, the historic component of site 41LN421 is a
sawmill house that was constructed of green sawmill lumber milled at the site in the late
1940s or early 1950s by B. D. Owens to house employees of his sawmill which was
located immediately to the south of this structure. The sawmill consisted of a piece of
machinery mounted on a wooden frame. The Parker family, Arthur and Imogene, lived in
the house and worked for Mr. Owens, and it was Mrs. Parker who actually constructed the
house. This information was given to Ms. Ruby Johnson from Imogene Parker who now
lives in Palestine.
The house is complete in that the roof, wooden floor, all walls, and framing for
windows and doors are still in place. Only one window, however, was still intact; a
double-hung wooden window with four-over-four lights. The roof is galvanized metal and
is believed to be original. The size of the house is 11 meters long, 4 meters and 30
centimeters wide, and 2 meters and 10 centimeters high from the sill to the top of the
ceiling. Two doors are present in the center of the house and are opposite each other.
The two windows are also opposite each other and are on each side of the doors. Two
features of the house are unusual. First, the house rests on the sill which is directly on the
ground instead of pier and beam, a more common method of construction in the area.
Second, the structure consists of only one room. At the west end of the house is a hole in
the gable where a wooden stove was present. No evidence of a chimney was observed.
The structure was constructed with machined nails.

13

The architectural style of this structure has not been identified, but the siding is
board and batten made from oak, and some of the exterior boards are rough. The flooring
consists of six-inch tongue-and-groove boards. Although today this site is located just
south of the corporate limits of Oakwood, in the 1950s it was still a rural setting. Overall,
the condition of the house is poor and is in danger of collapsing. Board and batten as a
form of house construction had largely disappeared by the middle of the 20th century;
however, Mayor Bell states that it was still being used in Leon County at that time, and
hand-dug wells were also still being constructed.
No outbuildings were observed; however, a brick-lined well is present at the east
end of the structure. The well is 32 inches in diameter and 7 to 8 feet deep at which point
it was filled with earth and debris. The bricks are modern (not handmade) and covered
with cement. According to Ms. Parker (personal communication to Ruby Johnson), the
well was there when the house was constructed, but it contains a metal culvert inside and
is not old. Shovel testing and backhoe trenching encountered additional historic artifacts
on the landform on which the house is situated. No artifacts dating to the 19th century
were observed. At the time of this study, however, it was empty except for the presence
of domestic artifacts, such as dishes, bottles, broken furniture, and some farm equipment.
According to Mayor Bell, it had been most recently used to store hay. The historic
component is not considered to possess significant research potential. It is the position of
BVRA that additional work at this site is not necessary.
The prehistoric component at 41LN421 is very minor and consists of three flakes
found between 30 and 50 centimeters below the surface and several pieces of burned
rock at 80 centimeters. The backhoe trench revealed a light colored sandy loam that was
homogeneous in texture and color. No evidence of more than ephemeral use of the area
in prehistoric times was observed. The extent of the prehistoric component within the
project area is probably restricted to the landform on which it is situated. Although
prehistoric cultural materials were only found in an area approximately 10 meters in
diameter, additional artifacts may be present on this landform, but probably not in
sufficient number to warrant additional work. This component is not considered to
possess significant research potential, and it is the position of BVRA that additional work
at this site is not necessary. This site appears to be similar to those found by Freeman
and Voellinger (1982) Jewett Mine containing few artifacts and no obvious stratigraphy
beyond the gradual change from humic sand to clayey sand.
The upland sandy ridge on the west side of the project area is the most likely area
for prehistoric and historic occupation, and it is in this area where the only site was found.
The soils between site 41LN421 and the south end of the project area appear to be fine
sandy loam formed by alluviation. This area has been clear cut as evidenced by briars
and other understory typical of this kind of activity. A large stand of plum trees was
observed between 41LN421 and the south end of the project area, and they may have
been introduced to the area by the early settlers.

Close to the south end of the project area is a low area that appears to be a seep
spring that may have been one of the sources of available water in prehistoric and historic
times. Only two shovel tests were dug in this area due to the disturbed condition of this
part of the project area. Overall, the southeast corner of the project area, that part closest
to the location of the Stroud cabin, is very hummocky, suggestive of tree removal. There
are two barbed wire fences that run east west across the project area and the recent
dump is located in a gully or ditch between the two. Directly across the fence, and out of
the project area, the land has been cleared and altered for the riding and roping arena.
The gully or ditch may be a result of the construction of this facility, as it does not appear
to be natural.
Evidence of early settlement in the vicinity of the project area was provided by
Mayor Dorothy Bell (personal communication, October 22, 1996), when she described a
log cabin just outside the project area to the south that was occupied in the 1850s.
According to the History of Leon County, Texas compiled by the Leon County Historical
Book Survey Committee (1986:808-809), the Stroud family was one of the first families in
the county. J. L. Orenbaun arrived in Texas in 1854 with his wife, Eliza Little and settled
on a tract of land on what was known locally as "The Prairie." Eliza Jane Orenbaun was
born in the cabin on January 9, 1856. She and her mother, along with some slaves, lived
there during the Civil War while her father was away in military service. The cabin stood
for well over 100 years until Bobby Stroud burned it down to make room for the Oakwood
Riding and Roping Arena. The location of this cabin is depicted on the topographic map
(Figure 2), and an early photograph of the cabin is still in the possession of the Stroud
family (Figure 5).
Based on artifacts observed on the ground surface, the historic trash dump
appears to date to the middle 20th century. Materials observed include cans, bottles,
metal buckets, and many unidentified objects. No evidence of 19th century use of this
area as a dump was seen, and it is believed that the occupants of the log cabin deposited
their trash elsewhere.

15

RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 41LN421 and the historic trash dump are not considered to possess
significant research potential. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned. However, should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in an
area not discussed in this report be discovered during construction, all work should cease
immediately. The Texas Historical Commission should be notified so that this find can be
evaluated before continuing with this project.
