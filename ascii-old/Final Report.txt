This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural resource inventory
conducted on 781 acres in four inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman and 428 acres in four parcels at Lake O’ the Pines.
Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels, and in compliance with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites
located on the parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by the manual excavation of 660 shovel tests.
Archival research was also conducted for historic sites. Eighteen archeological sites were documented. Sites 41CS304,
41CS305, 41CS307, 41CS309, 41CS312, 41MR48, 41MR62, 41MR107, 41MR191, and 41MR192 are assessed as not eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP and no further work is warranted. Site 41CS12 was not found in the location on record and is
probably located approximately 200 m north, off of USACE fee lands. The NRHP eligibility of sites 41CS303, 41CS306,
41CS308, 41CS310, 41CS311, 41MR103, and 41MR109 is unknown. These sites should be avoided and protected from
adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP
eligibility.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on eight separate tracts of land totaling 1,209 acres in Bowie, Cass,
Harrison, and Marion Counties in East Texas. The project area includes 781 acres in four
inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman and 428 acres in four parcels at Lake O’ the Pines.
Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting
within the parcels, and in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,
the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels
would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted in two sessions between September 20-23 and October
4-14, 2005. Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and
systematic shovel testing. 660 shovel tests were manually excavated. Recovered artifacts
included prehistoric flakes, ceramic sherds, and historic ceramics, metal, and glass. All
subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). Archival research was also conducted for historic sites.
Eighteen archeological sites were documented within the project areas including eight previously
recorded sites and ten newly discovered sites. Of these, 10 sites are considered not eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and seven sites could not be clearly assessed
using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics. One site is probably located off of USACE fee
lands.
Sites 41CS304, 41CS305, 41CS307, 41CS309, 41CS312, 41MR48, 41MR62, 41MR107, 41MR191,
and 41MR192 are assessed as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, and no further work is
warranted.
Site 41CS12 was not found in the location on record and is probably located approximately 200
m north, off of USACE fee lands.
The NRHP eligibility of sites 41CS303, 41CS306, 41CS308, 41CS310, 41CS311, 41MR103, and
41MR109 is unknown. These sites should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts. If
they cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP
eligibility.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

THE UNDERTAKING

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Lake Wright
Patman and 9,251 acres at Lake O’ the Pines (acreages are outside conservation pools). Much of
this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the
existing management plans for the reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture
methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for selective timber thinning.
Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through
single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive
subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account. Therefore, in compliance with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89665 et seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted, and all sites are located on
lands owned by the Federal Government and managed by the USACE.

LOCATION

The project area is comprised of eight separate parcels located at Lake Wright Patman in Bowie
and Cass Counties and Lake O’ the Pines in Harrison and Marion Counties, Texas (Figure 1-1).
Together, the seven parcels total 1,209 acres and range in size from 24 acres (Big Creek Island)
to 287 acres (Powell Creek). The eight parcels are listed in Table 1-1.

1.2.1

Lake Wright Patman

Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass
Counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and
Red River Counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late
1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding 2005). The dam was constructed
between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation and recreational purposes. Elevation of
the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal elevations are 220.6 ft above mean sea
level (AMSL) in winter and 227.5 ft. AMSL in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft.
AMSL. During the summer the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation

pool is 20,300 acres. Four parcels totaling 781 acres are currently planned for timber thinning
(Figure 1-2 and Figure 1-3).

The Powell Creek tract measures approximately 2 km (N-S) by 1 km (E-W) and is located on the
Bryans Mill and Douglassville USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangles. Elevation varies between
225 ft AMSL at the shoreline to 290 ft in the northern portion of the parcel.
The Whatley Creek area totals 238 acres and is located in Cass County on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman, about 9 km northwest of Douglassville and 10 km southwest of Maud (Figure 12). This parcel contains two sub-areas designated Inventory Areas North and South. The tract
measures about 3 km (E-W) by 250 m (N-S) along the southern terrace of Whatley Creek and is
located on the Bryans Mill USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle. Elevation varies between 235 ft
AMSL along the creek drainage to 300 ft AMSL on elevated terraces.
The Carlow Creek area totals 232 acres and is located in Cass County on the south side of Lake
Wright Patman, about 4 km northwest of Douglassville and 10 km south of Maud (Figure 1-2).
The tract measures about 2 km (E-W) by 1 km (N-S) and is located on the Bryans Mill and
Douglassville USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. Elevation varies between 225 ft AMSL at
the shoreline to 270 ft AMSL in the southern portion of the parcel.
Big Creek Island totals 24 acres and is located in Bowie County on the north side of Lake Wright
Patman, about 10 km east of Redwater and 15 km southwest of Texarkana (Figure 1-3). The
tract measures about 450 m (N-S) by 280 m (E-W). The parcel is located on the Wright Patman

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project is located in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest vegetation region of east Texas as defined
by Gould (1969). Forested areas in the project areas included secondary growth and mature pine
and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed during the field inventory were typically
comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris)
pines. Hardwood trees noted during the survey included southern red oak (Quercus falcate),
white oak (Quercus alba), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black walnut (Juglans
nigra L.), and osage orange (Maclura pomifera). Figures 1-5 and 1-6 illustrate typical landscape
views for the project.

The project is located within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950).
Wildlife common to the area includes whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox (Vulpes
vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), coyote (Canis latrans),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphus virginiana), wild hog (Sus scrofa), nutria
(Myocastor coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison). Lake habitats
support a variety of turtles, frogs and snakes, as well as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides
salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel (Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white
(Pomoxis annularis) and black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, white bass (Morone
chrysops), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and other sunfish. Bird species include the
endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), as well as bald eagles (Haliaetus
leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning doves
(Zenaida macroura), white pelicans (Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loons (Gavia immer),
herons, and egrets.

BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND SOILS

1.4.1

Lake Wright Patman

The bedrock geology encountered within all four project areas at Lake Wright Patman is
predominantly comprised of silt and sandy clay deposits of Wilcox Group undivided (Ewi)
sediments (Table 1-2) which formed approximately 40-45 million years ago during the Middle
Eocene (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004; Sellards et al. 1932:530).
During this time period, the project area would have been located within a shallow-water reef of

Page 8

the Kincaid Sea, which covered large areas of the North American Southeast. Wilcox Group
formations extend approximately 200 m in depth and rest upon an upper base of Midway Group
deposits which date to the Early Eocene (Sellards et al. 1932).
Deposits of recent Quaternary alluvium (Qal) are mapped along the creek drainages of the
Whatley, Carlow, and Powell Creek project areas. These deposits represent approximately
12,000 years of alluvial floodplain deposition and rest approximately 6-10 meters above a base
of Wilcox Group (Ewi) bedrock deposits (TCEQ 2004).
Within central Bowie County, a Miocene to Pliocene aged gravel formation called ‘Bowie
Gravels’ can sometimes be seen resting upon a base of Wilcox Group geologic deposits in
upland areas along the headwaters of Elliot Creek (Peter and Cliff 1990). The fact that Bowie
Gravels occur over Wilcox formations suggests the gravels are possibly contemporaneous to
Uvalde Gravels which were deposited during the Miocene and Pliocene epoch of the Tertiary
(ca. 23.8 – 1.8 million years ago). These gravels offered a readily available source of chert to the
Native American populations of the area.
The four inventory parcels at Wright Patman contain 15 soil types which formed over the Wilcox
Group (Ewi) geologic deposits (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2005), Fox
1980). These are the Eastwood, Metcalf, Cuthbert, Latex, Kirvin, Wrightsville, Bernaldo,
Briley, Lilbert, Socagee, Tenaha, Darco, Gladewater Clay, Ruston, and Mantachie soils (Table 12). Cultural deposits in these soils are generally fairly shallowly buried and are adequately
investigated by manual shovel testing.

1.4.2 Lake O’ the Pines
The bedrock geology encountered within all four parcels inventoried at Lake O' the Pines is
predominantly comprised of Queen City Formation (Eqc) deposits of quartz sand (with thin beds
of clay). The Queen City Formation (Eqc) is a continental fluviatile deposit that was laid down
during the Middle Eocene (ca. 45-50 million years ago) by meandering rivers on a flat coastal
plain. The Queen City Formation (Eqc) extends approximately 120 meters in depth and
conformably rests upon a base of Reklaw Formation (Er) clay deposits which also date to the
Middle Eocene (Sellards et al. 1932; TCEQ 2004).
Deposits of recent (Qal) are mapped along the Brushy Creek drainage within the Brushy Creek
South project area (TCEQ 2004). These Qal deposits represent approximately 12,000 years of
alluvial floodplain deposition along the Brushy Creek drainage (Table 1-3). Within the Brushy
Creek South project area, Qal deposits extend approximately 6-10 meters and rest upon a base of
Queen City Formation (Eqc) quartz sand (TCEQ 2004).
According to NRCS (2005), the four inventory parcels situated along Lake O’ the Pines
contained six documented soil types which formed over the Queen City Sand (Eqc) deposits,

located on former terraces of Cypress Creek that are currently underwater. Three of the sites
(41MR104, 105, and 106) were recorded by Nelson in 1993 on eroded terraces adjacent to Lake
O’ the Pines. 41MR104 and 41MR105 were surface lithic scatters while 41MR106 was a
campsite containing non diagnostic lithic and ceramic artifacts. 41MR136 is a large prehistoric
campsite located on an upland terrace within the northern valley axis of the Cypress Creek
drainage. The site was described as having a high artifact density with lithic diagnostics that
date from the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic (Table 2-3).

2.2

CULTURAL FRAMEWORK

The prehistoric cultural framework in the Northeast Texas region has been recorded by many
archeological investigations and includes the Paleo-Indian period, Archaic and Woodland
periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. This cultural framework, discussed
further below, has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b,
1995, 2004).
2.2.1

Paleo-Indian Period

Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) in
Northeast Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff,
and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds or found in
excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas.
Regardless of the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding settlement
mobility and subsistence patterns during the Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas. Evidence
suggests that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized toolkit, and that they were
more likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters
(Perttula 2004).
2.2.2

Archaic Period

The Archaic period (ca. 7000-200 B.C.) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000-4000 B.C.),
Middle (ca. 4000-2000 B.C.), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000-200 B.C.), although in the Northeast
region of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate these different
periods. During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more widely distributed,
suggesting high group mobility within large territories. Archeological data also suggests a
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy which is focused on the exploitation of a
wide variety of resources. Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt
to be concentrated in the larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in the
region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the
increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features.
Possible hearths, ovens and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and
cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites are relatively common along major
streams and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic
population density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of
sites and greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread
distribution of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined
territories, and regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.2.3

Woodland/Early Ceramic Period

The Woodland Period (ca. 200 B.C. – A.D. 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile points. At sites near
the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and diet
during this time period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers who
lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain locations than they had in
the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site, small settlements with structures and
middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those
seen at later Caddo period sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of the Sulphur
and Neches-Angelina River Basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of
Northeast Texas, but when they occur, are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains
or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland period
burial mounds have been documented in the region.
2.2.4

Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period

Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 800-1000) and Early Caddoan Period
(ca. A.D. 1000-1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan Period and
continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
2.2.5

Middle Caddoan Period

Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 12001400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan Period. One example of such a site is the
Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and
other crops until after A.D. 1300 (Perttula 2004).

2.2.6

Late Caddoan Period

Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan Period (ca. AD 1400-1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoan Period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily
used between A.D. 1400-1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound
shaft burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus Phase (ca. A.D. 1430-1680) refers to the archeological remains of
Caddoan peoples living in the northeastern Texas pineywoods between the Sulphur and Sabine
rivers. These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community
cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. A.D. 1540) is commonly referred to as
the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region from the
Mississippi river valley and a number of different Caddoan groups were probably encountered
by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada, the area occupied by the Titus
phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004). While the archeological evidence of
Caddoan-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast Texas, intermittent contact probably had
considerable effects on Caddoan groups, including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases
like smallpox to which they had no immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
2.2.7

Historic Period

Historic Caddoan Period
The Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680-1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddoan area by Europeans in the region. It is during this time period
that the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and
bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites
after ca. A.D. 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles,
hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and
Perttula, 1993).

European Exploration and Historic Periods
Area of Lake Wright Patman
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died. Looking for an overland route back to New
Spain, Moscoso crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2005b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2005). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by Thomas Jefferson, traveled up the Red River
to Spanish Bluff where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations in
addition to raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2005a; Harper 2005b). As was expected, the white population strongly
supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and they secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2005; Harper 2005c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from

Page 24

that point forward (Harper 2005a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade; however, populations grew slowly, if at all, and
the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.
Area of Lake O’ the Pines
Much of the area around Big Cypress Creek and what would become Lake O’ the Pines
remained uninhabited for most of the eighteenth century. The first Anglo-American settlements
were formed in the 1840s, and the town of Jefferson was founded at that time. The settlers were
primarily from Tennessee and Alabama; the areas of east Upshur County and Marion County
were inhabited by those from Alabama. They set up a way of life similar to what they had at
home, which included large cotton plantations using slave labor (Atkins 2005; Kirby 2005).
Jefferson quickly became a booming river port town, in fact the largest inland port in Texas.
North Texas agricultural produce was shipped to Shreveport and New Orleans, and as a result of
this connection with the Mississippi River system and factories to the east, new amenities such as
refrigeration, soda water, artificial gas for lighting, and ice production made their first
appearance as early as the 1870s (Atkins 2005). The white population supported the secession
movement and the Confederacy in the Civil War. Ordnance, rifles, and tinned food were
manufactured for the Confederate forces. Military occupation followed the Civil War, although
white suppression of the black majority continued to persist. Jefferson declined significantly in
1873 when the destruction of the “raft” – a massive log jam - on the Red River above Shreveport
reduced the water levels of Big Cypress Creek, as well as the establishment of rail transportation
in other parts of the state (Long 2005a).
Rich iron ore deposits in eastern Upshur County were mined on and off since the 1860s, but the
town of Ore City was not founded until 1911, anticipating the arrival of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore
Railroad. This railroad was chartered in December, 1910 to connect Longview with an area rich
in iron ore near Hughes Springs, a distance of about 50 miles. Construction began in 1912, but
World War I halted completion of the line and it was abandoned in 1927 (Young 2006). Ore
City operated as a mining and lumbering center, and managed to survive after these major
industries became non-operational (Long 2005b). Oil was discovered in the 1910s and gave a
boost to the manufacturing sector. The Depression dealt the area a hard blow, especially the
agricultural economy, but rising oil prices and federal assistance helped the area recover more
quickly than other areas of Texas. The economy and population of the area declined slightly
over the next 30 years, but the area moved more toward a tourist economy with the development
of urban heritage sites in Jefferson, obtaining NRHP status in 1971, as well as water recreation
from Caddo Lake State Park and Lake O’ the Pines, which were developed in the 1930s and
1950s, respectively.
2.3

HISTORIC CONTEXTS

The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located on

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 25

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

their land or controlled by them and further stipulates that such agencies must take into account
the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies are required
to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties owned or under
their control that appear to qualify for inclusion on the NRHP. Eligibility for inclusion on the
NRHP is specified at 36 CFR part 60 and is restricted to properties that possess “significance in
American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture…”; that possess
“integrity”; and that meet certain further criteria. Of four criteria, archeological properties are
nearly always assessed under criterion (d) which specifies properties “that have yielded, or may
be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history.”
In practice, the NRHP eligibility of an archeological site is generally determined by matching the
formal attributes of the site (its date, type, size, artifact content, etc.) to previously developed
“historic contexts”. These are broad research themes that identify key research questions,
together with the types of data that are necessary to satisfactorily address them. Sites that
possess data types that can address many of the research questions are determined to be
significant; sites that possess few or no such data types are considered to be not significant.
This discussion briefly summarizes several historic contexts which are commonly applied to
evaluate the significance of archeological sites in East Texas. The contexts are closely adapted
from those developed by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and the reader is directed to
that comprehensive planning document for the essential details for each of the following
contextual themes. For Northeast Texas, four broad research contexts are here identified: (1)
early hunter-gatherer mobility; (2) the emergence of sedentism; (3) the development of
agriculture; and (4) the effects of European contact. An overview of each of these themes is
summarized below, focusing on the data needs that can be used to infer the research value of a
given site.
2.3.1

Hunter Gatherer Mobility

Questions of hunter-gather mobility in Northeast Texas have been most fully developed by
Fields and Tomka (1993: 69-96) and focus on the Paleoindian Period from 9,500 to 7,000 B.C.
and the Archaic Period from about 7,000 to 200 B.C. This time range overlaps marginally with
that identified in the Emergence of Sedentism context. Archeological knowledge of this period
is still broadly sketched in many aspects and the research needs that are identified under this
context are fairly basic. Important new research under this context will focus on the following
topics:
Chronology and Typology
Additional well-controlled chronometric information associated with a variety of site types and
artifact types is needed to refine the fundamental space-time systematics for this broad time
range in Northeast Texas.

Page 26

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Settlement Systems
Research is necessary to better understand the variability between different non-sedentary
settlements. New information is needed about the relative permanence of settlements, their
intensity of occupation, and general land use strategies. Observations about the internal
configurations of residential sites and the degree of variability between these are critical.
Subsistence
Much more information is needed regarding the diversity of food resources which contributed to
human diet during this time period and to changes in the resource mix over time. Especially
interesting will be research examining the relative contributions of plant and animal taxa, and the
decision-making framework that determined which resources were economically exploited. In
addition, stable isotope analyses of human skeletal remains are called for to provide for indirect
reconstruction of diet.
Trade and Exchange
New research should seek to better understand the role of local and regional trade systems,
especially with regards to the acquisition of key non-food resources such as lithic raw materials
and status goods. Such research will inform on the nature and extent of territorial ranges, the
isolation and stability of populations and the development of inter-group exchange networks.
Technology and Change
More investigation is warranted into the complex interrelationships between food-getting
strategies, group mobility, and technology, especially with regards to changes over time in lithic
tools and alternative manufacturing processes.
2.3.2

The Emergence of Sedentism

The transition from mobile to sedentary populations in northeast Texas and the consequent
increase in overall cultural complexity is still poorly understood. This historic context focuses
on the period from about 500 B.C to A.D. 1000, including the Late Archaic Period from about
500 to 200 B.C., the Early Ceramic Period to A.D. 800 and the Formative Caddoan Period from
A.D. 800 to 1000. The synthesis of Perttula, et al. (1993: 97-120) develops a diverse suite of
research objectives including the following:
Settlement Systems
To understand the process and tempo of increasing sedentism during the Late Archaic and Early
Ceramic Periods, new data are needed about the population sizes and spatial distribution of
settlements, their successful duration, and their general land use strategies. As with the
comparable focus under the Hunter Gatherer Mobility context, observations about the internal
configuration of residential sites will be important, including the diversity and ubiquity of feature
types.

Subsistence
More research is warranted into changes in resource selection and procurement in response to
increasing sedentism. Key questions will focus on which resources were replaced by
horticulture, and to what degree, and the nature of the relationships between increasing
population size, reduced mobility, and resource procurement.
Social Systems
As sedentism increased in Northeast Texas, social organization and political structures changed.
An increased understanding of these changes will examine community hierarchies, ceremonial
activities, and political and social stratification through analyses of diversity in mound features
and status goods and their spatial distributions.
Demography and Health
Reliable data are needed that inform on changes and trends in regional and local population sizes
and densities and in the spatial distribution of populations across the landscape. In addition,
isotopic and forensic examinations of well-dated human skeletal assemblages will be key sources
of information about human health and demography.
Mortuary Practices
As human populations became increasingly sedentary during this time period, their treatment of
the dead changed. Important new research will examine the development of formal cemeteries
during this period, including the differences in mound and non-mound burials, and between
cremations and flexed interments through the acquisition of new basic burial data, including
grave goods.
Trade and Exchange
With increased sedentism and the related potential for increased complexity in material goods
came the development of new economic exchange networks. Valuable research in Northeast
Texas will address the relationships between politics and these economic networks, especially
the political controls over access to raw materials and the political relationships between
archeological sites that may be “central places”. Research should also examine changes over
time in these intra-regional and inter-regional interaction patterns.
Technological Change and Ceramics
Increased sedentism and the development of new subsistence strategies were accompanied by a
suite of new technologies. The timing and distribution of these are important keys to
understanding culture change in general during this period. Especially, the introduction of
ceramics suggests a decrease in mobility as well as increased storage capacity and changes in
horticultural production strategies. Early ceramic manufacturing strategies need research,

Page 28

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

including selection of raw materials. Other technological attributes of sedentism include storage
facilities and permanent architecture.
2.3.3

The Development of Agriculture

The adoption of agriculture in Northeast Texas during the Caddoan Period from about A.D. 800
to 1680 was arguably the most important cultural innovation to date, creating an increasingly
intense positive feedback loop between sedentism, population size, and technological change.
The research themes under this historic context have been most succinctly treated by Perttula
(1993a: 121-146) and include the following:
Subsistence Patterns
Key to understanding human adaptations during this period are changes in the economic resource
mix, especially timing and extent of the shift from the opportunistic horticulture of native
cultigens to intensive maize cultivation. Isotopic analyses of skeletal assemblages will provide
valuable inferences on human diet.
Settlement Systems
As agriculture became the dominant food-getting strategy, changes occurred in the preferred
places for habitation, in the relationships between populations within a region, and in the internal
complexity of habitations. These developments may be examined though examining changes in
architecture, settlement composition and arrangement, and diversity in overall settlement sizes.
Research should look at the composition and internal arrangement of farming communities and
their relationships to ceremonial centers. Additional knowledge of trail systems between
population centers and ceremonial centers are needed.
Social and Political Complexity
Significant changes in political organizations were facilitated by agriculture and sedentism. The
examination of the distribution of status goods and the development of public architecture will
provide insights into political structures, as will the analysis of the hierarchical complexity of
settlement types.
Demography
The adoption of agriculture fundamentally changed human societies in Northeast Texas. A
detailed understanding of the timing, intensity, and spatial distribution of changes in population
sizes, both positive and negative, will allow a deeper understanding of the adoption of
agriculture. A regional analysis of habitation sites will provide a broad perspective, while
forensic examination of skeletal assemblages will provide detailed inform on population
structures.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 29

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Mortuary Practices
Research into mortuary practices is potentially informative about developments in social
organization, and ritual and belief systems. During the Caddoan Period, the distribution and
complexity of community cemeteries is of special interest, including the use of shaft burials
within earthen mounds.
Trade and Exchange
As populations grew in size and complexity during this period, exchange networks broadened.
Exotic goods were introduced through long distance trade and local style became a recognizable
variable in the production of material goods. Examination of the temporal and spatial
distributions of these markers will assist the understanding of both intra-regional and interregional exchange networks.
Technology and Changes in Material Culture
This theme overlaps to some extent with similar ideas under the previous Emergence of
Sedentism context. Additional research is warranted into the emergence and spread of new
technologies including the bow and arrow, various agricultural implements, and pottery. These
developments occurred parallel with changes in architecture and building materials and as a
more diverse set of raw materials became available through the wider exchange networks.
2.3.4

The Effects of European Contacts

Contact with Europeans left unprecedented and indelible changes on the peoples of Northeast
Texas. Examination of these changes focuses on the Protohistoric Period from A.D. 1540 to
1680 as well as the Historic Indian Period from about A.D. 1680 to 1860. These changes are
explored in depth by Perttula (1992), and the relevant research themes have also been
summarized by Perttula (1993c). Unique to this time period is the availability of archival and
ethnohistoric sources to supplement archeological data.
Demography and Public Health
As a direct result of contact with Europeans, population sizes in Northeast Texas plummeted due
to the introduction of new epidemic diseases. The catastrophic population declines in turn
triggered significant changes in politics and social organization. Forensic examinations of
skeletal assemblages are fundamental sources of important information about human populations
and public health.
Language and Ideology
Significant research into the related issues of language and ideology is uniquely possible during
the Historic Period. Archival documents record place names and tribal names and meticulous
archival and ethnohistoric research can identify and infer a measure of the impact Europeans
brought on language and on traditional belief systems. Changes in ceremonialism following the

Page 30

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

catastrophic effects of new diseases can be traced through ceremonial architecture and the
introduction and spread of new exotic goods.
Status, Social Structure and Political Organization
As contact with Europeans precipitated decreases in population size, Caddo societies adapted by
evolving modified social hierarchies and complex social organizations. These changes can be
examined through the distribution and ubiquity of status markers, such as European trade goods,
symbology, and public architecture. Archival and ethnohistoric research can illuminate
migrations, alliances, and subjugation.
Subsistence and Economy
The introduction of new technologies, especially firearms and the horse, permitted and, to an
extent, forced significant changes in economic strategies. Archeological evidence for the
introduction and spread of these new technologies is vital, together with data informing on the
replacement of traditional cultigens and domesticates with introduced ones such as chickens and
cows. Other important research will investigate changes in food processing and food storage
strategies.
Technology
Contact with Europeans brought knowledge of new materials, new manufacturing techniques,
and whole new industries (such as animal husbandry). Firearms and the introduction of the horse
brought permanent changes to Caddoan societies. More research is needed into the spatial and
temporal distribution of introduced goods such as metal tools, implements and containers. The
historic time period affords an ideal opportunity to understand the general mechanisms and rates
by which various new artifact types are adopted into traditional systems and replace earlier
technologies.
Trade and Exchange
With Europeans came exposure to much wider economic networks. New types of goods and
new raw materials were introduced while at the same time European markets created increased
demand for traditional goods such as salt and furs. The distribution through time and space of
introduced artifact materials such as metal and glass are keys to understanding the effects that
European contacts had on traditional trade networks.
Acculturation
During the Historic Period, acculturating the native peoples was an explicit objective of the
Europeans. The formal relationships between the French and then the Spanish and the Caddo are
a key research objective. Overlapping greatly with the closely related themes of ideology,
economy, status, technology, and trade, more archeological research is needed of the villages
that were associated with missions and European settlements.

METHODS

The archeological field inventory was conducted in two field sessions from September 20-23 and
from October 4-14, 2005. Fifty-nine person-days were spent in the field. Methods and density
of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the USACE (2002:10-44).
3.1

SURVEY TACTICS

For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at 20 m
intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the aerial and was
assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated
with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that
shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each
crew member followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crew members.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two crew members would
“leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even
coverage was attempted, surveyors were also directed to deviate from transect alignments in
order to test likely locations such as topographic rises.
Special effort was made to relocate the numerous previously recorded sites in several of the
parcels. For each of these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the
location, or suspected location, of the site. The crew referred to the site’s plot on the USGS
topographic maps at TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the
UTM (or latitude/longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible
conversion errors in coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected
location(s), the crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of
the site was seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines
of evidence.
At selected shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations.
Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site
locations, such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not be
dug due to standing water, erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually
recorded on the shovel testing log.
All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests
were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness, and all
excavated material was screened through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.
All cultural material, within shovel tests, was collected with the exception of recent objects such
as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These items were assumed to indicate
recent disturbance and were not collected. At the remaining sites, only diagnostic material and

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 33

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

sample collections were recovered due to high artifact quantities of the surface artifacts. All
shovel tests were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than one of these
tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location
was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but were not further
recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated using
multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron
re-bar fixed with an aluminum survey cap. Caps were stamped with “ECOM 2005” and with a
temporary site number for newly recorded sites and existing trinomials for prerecorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries were defined on
the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by topography, soil exposures, and
other relevant criteria. Additionally, sites along the shoreline were visually inspected for artifact
distribution, and site size was determined by the extent of the surface artifacts. Based on the
distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface artifacts, site boundaries were
prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape. Sites were photographed, sketched and
mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State of Texas site data forms. All recovered
artifacts were processed and analyzed by the authors of this report in EComm’s Austin
laboratory, and the artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL upon completion of
analysis.
Appendix A presents aerial photographs of each survey parcel showing the locations of all
transects and shovel tests. Appendix B is a database of all shovel test information. Data are
given for each excavated level, including survey parcel, transect, and shovel test identifiers,
depth in centimeters below surface, Munsell color, sediment texture, and cultural material if any.
3.2

DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (0.33 tests per acre) at Lake Wright Patman and one
shovel test per two acres at Lake O’ the Pines (0.50 tests per acre). Using this rate of coverage, a
total of 472 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 1,209 acres (Table 3-1).
Intensity of shovel testing varied from parcel to parcel depending on ground visibility, vegetation
and topography. Shovel testing density varied from a minimum of 0.42 tests per acre at the
Whatley Creek parcel at Lake Wright Patman to a maximum of 1.45 tests per acre at the
Lakeview Island parcel at Lake O’ the Pines. For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged
about 0.6 tests per acre.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research was conducted on all sites whose archeological evidence dated to the historic
period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify historically notable persons possibly
associated with each site.
Initial archival research was carried out by examining the primary sources in the deed, land title,
and probate records. This research was conducted in Linden, Texas for Cass County and in
Jefferson, Texas for Marion County. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees were
identified and their presence in the area during the period of interest was verified through United
States Census data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals of
historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in The
Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and the General
Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance was in any
way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled and the nature
of the person’s relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched to determine the
level of the person’s involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property and/or actively
participating in its development were determined to be significantly associated with the property.
Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor actively participating in its
development (eg., absentee owners) were determined to be not significantly associated with the
property.
3.4

EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE

Historic properties may be nominated to the NRHP, or may be determined eligible for such
nomination, under evaluation criteria that are expressed at 36 CFR § 60.4.
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 35

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association
(36 CFR § 60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
(a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose component may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or
history (36 CFR § 60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance and with respect to NHPA
criterion (d). The demonstrated data content of each site was compared to the important research
contexts as outlined above in Section 2.3. Sites in good condition and state of preservation and
having several data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were evaluated as
significant under criterion (d). Those sites that were observed to be in poor condition or state of
preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were
evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose expression could not be satisfactorily
investigated using the survey level tactics employed by this study were classified as being of
unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under criterion (d) as described above, were also
evaluated for NRHP eligibility with respect to criterion (b). Because none of the historic sites
retained any architectural elements, criterion (c) was not applicable. Similarly, none of the sites
are associated with important historical events and so criterion (a) was not applicable.

RESULTS

The archeological inventory of the 1,209 acres documented 18 cultural resource sites, including
eight previously recorded and 10 new archeological sites. Locations of transects and shovel tests
are depicted in Appendix A, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix B. Photographs of
each site appear in Appendix C. Site locations are depicted on USGS topographic quadrangles in
Appendix D (CD-ROM), and completed State of Texas site forms are presented in Appendix E
(CD-ROM).

4.1.1

Whatley Creek

The Whatley Creek area
totaled 238 acres and was
completely inventoried using
100 shovel tests for a density
of 0.42 shovel tests per acre.
Three cultural resource sites
were present. An aerial
photograph showing the
location of the two inventory
sub-areas within the project
area and excavated shovel test
locations is provided in
Appendix A.
41CS303
Site 41CS303 is a prehistoric
site of undetermined age
measuring 240 by 70 m in
size within the north Whatley
Creek sub-area. The site is
topographically situated on an
upland hill (260 ft. AMSL)
approximately 100 m west of
Whatley Creek and west of
and adjacent to County Road
2472 (Figure 4-1).
Soils
within the site fell within the
Cuthbert series; the typical
pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1. The
soils have probably been

impacted to an unknown degree by erosion during periods of extended rainfall. Typical
vegetation within the site included mixed hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was
approximately 10 percent.
Six shovel tests were excavated on 41CS303. Five tests were positive (83% ubiquity) and 11
lithic flakes were recovered between the ground surface and 60 centimeters below the surface
(cmbs) (Table 4-1). The flakes included nine exterior flakes (core flakes; primary flakes) and
two interior flakes (secondary or tertiary flakes). No historic material was present. Cultural
material was recovered in each of the three 20 cm levels down to 60 cmbs, with more than 50
percent of items between 40 and 60 cmbs. The vertical distribution of cultural material appears
to indicate a single prehistoric occupation. Sterile Pleistocene clay (5YR 4/6) was encountered
during shovel testing at depths ranging between 50 cmbs and 60 cmbs.

41CS304
Site 41CS304 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age measuring 90 by 63 m in size and located
within the south Whatley Creek sub-area. The site is topographically situated on an elevated
terrace (270 ft AMSL) located south of and adjacent to Whatley Creek. Soils within the site fell
within the Cuthbert series; the typical pedon for this soil type is presented in Chapter 1. In
addition to erosion, the site has probably been impacted to an unknown degree by land clearing
activities to the south where a grass field is located. Typical vegetation within the site included
mixed hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was approximately 10 percent.
This general location was indicated on
the 1910 USGS topographic map by a
structure symbol (see Figure 2-2), but no
historic materials were observed on the
surface. The site was initially indicated
on the basis of two positive tests in
adjacent transects (Figure 4-2). Four
additional shovel tests were dug radially
from these two positive tests, but no
additional artifacts were recovered. Six
shovel tests were excavated on this site

and artifacts were recovered from
two tests (33% ubiquity).
The
assemblage consists of three exterior
flakes recovered between the
surface and 40 cmbs (Table 4-2).
No historic materials were present,
despite the indication of an historic
structure on the 1910 USGS
topographic map.
Sterile Pleistocene clay (5YR 4/6) was
encountered during shovel testing at
depths between 20 and 60 cmbs.
41CS305
Site 41CS305 is the 65 by 113 m
location of a late nineteenth to mid
twentieth century homestead. The
site is situated on a grass covered
terrace (270 ft AMSL) located
adjacent to and west of County
Road 2472.
This location is
indicated on the 1910 USGS
topographic map by a structure
symbol (see Figure 2-2).
A small drainage containing a
spring is located on the western
portion of the site. In all likelihood,
Figure 4-2. Site Map, 41CS304.
the spring arose at this location
sometime during the mid-twentieth century after the Sulphur River was dammed and the lake
formed. The resulting increase in subsurface hydrostatic pressure has forced numerous springs
once located by the river to surface at new locations around the lake (Stephen P. Austin, personal
communication 2005).
Vegetation noted within the site included pine, osage, black walnut, and oak. Surface visibility
was approximately 20 percent. Soils fell within the Kirvin series; the typical pedon for this soil
type is presented in Chapter 1. The structures were razed by the USACE after it acquired the
land in the mid twentieth century.
Archival Results
The property on which this site is located first shows up in Cass County records in 1899 as being
sold from L.A. Whatley to a partnership of E.W. King and W.O. Bryan. There are no records of
the tract being given to Whatley, and we assume that L.A. Whatley or a relative has an

eponymous relation to nearby Whatley Creek in Cass County. Whatley Creek is also known as
Caney Creek (Harper 2006).
Bryan bought out King’s interest
in the tract in 1905 and his heirs
conveyed the property to a J.C.
Frost in 1934. In December of
1951, Dudley H. Snider III, a
lawyer from Marshall, purchased
the tract from Frost a year before
the United States of America took
the tract for the new lake in
December of 1952. None of these
persons are listed in The
Handbook of Texas Online.
Archeology Results
Although this general location
was indicated on the 1910 USGS
topographic map by a structure
symbol, no historic materials were
observed on the surface. The site
was initially indicated on the basis
of two positive shovel tests in
adjacent transects (Figure 4-3).
Additional shovel tests were dug
in this area, for a total of seven
tests. Six of the seven shovel tests
were positive (86% ubiquity) and
98 artifacts were recovered
between the surface and 60 cmbs
for an average of more than 16

artifacts per positive test. No
features were observed on the
surface. The artifact assemblage includes historic ceramics, window glass, bottle glass, wire and
cut nails, and other structural artifacts (Table 4-3). Due to the fact that the site was razed, many
of the artifacts were observed in mixed contexts (eg., modern glass below ca. 1890 window glass
in ST2). The manufacture dates acquired from the analysis of window glass indicate that the site
occupants were using window glass manufactured during the late nineteenth to early twentieth
century (Moir 1987) (Table 4-4).
Structures on the 1910 Map
Examination of the Whatley Creek inventory area on the 1910 USGS topographic map revealed
three structure symbols. These symbols are all clustered near the southwestern corner of the
parcel (see Figure 2-1). The locations of all three of these structure symbols were ground truthed

Page 40

and two of the symbols match the locations of sites 41CS304 and 42CS305. At the location of
the third symbol, no cultural evidence was observed on the ground surface or in any of the five

Powell Creek

The Powell Creek area totaled 287 acres and was completely inventoried using 146 shovel tests
for a density of 0.51 shovel tests per acre. Six cultural resource sites were found and recorded
within the project area. An aerial photograph showing the locations of all shovel tests excavated
within the Powell Creek project area is provided in Appendix A.
41CS12
Prehistoric site 41CS12 (Figure 4-4) was originally recorded by R. L. Stephenson in 1949 while
conducting a river basin survey for the National Park Service (Texas Archeological Data Site
Form on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin
[TADSF-TARL]). Stephenson described the site as a being an open village about 10 to 20 acres

in size and located within a
pasture that was topographically
situated along a low sandy ridge
roughly 1.25 miles east of
Highway 8.
Stephenson
collected
an
undetermined
number of non-specific ceramic
sherds, projectile points, and
pitted stones from the surface of
the site within a context he
described as “midden refuse”.
According
to
the
maps
maintained at TARL, 41CS12 is
a 320 by 260 m prehistoric
campsite located in an upland
setting (280 ft AMSL) within the
northern portion of the Powell
Creek
inventory
parcel,
approximately 200 m west of
Lake Wright Patman. Typical
vegetation encountered within
the
site
included
mixed
hardwood and pine. Soils within
the site fall within the Kirvin
series; the typical pedon for this
soil type is presented in Chapter
1. Surface visibility was
approximately 10 percent.
The field crew inspected the
surface at the location shown on
Figure 4-4. Tested Location, 41CS12.
the TARL maps, but no artifacts
were observed on the ground
surface. Eight shovel tests were excavated in the mapped location, but no artifacts were
recovered from any of the shovel tests. Because the site is described as containing “midden
refuse” including ceramics and lithic tools, it is likely that the location plotted on the TARL
maps and here tested is not the same location as the one investigated by Stephenson in 1949.
Because the terrain south of this location was completely surveyed with no indication of the site,
it is likely that the true location of Stephenson’s village site is north by a distance of 200 m or
more.
41CS306
41CS306 is a 122 by 97 m prehistoric site of undetermined age located on an elevated terrace
(270 ft AMSL) approximately 200 m west of Lake Wright Patman. Vegetation within the site

Page 42

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

consisted of mixed hardwood
and pine. Soils within the site
fell within the Eastwood series.
The typical pedon for this soil
type is presented in Chapter 1.
The site was initially discovered
by a positive test along transect
#7 (Figure 4-5). Surrounding
this positive test, an additional
14 tests were excavated for a
total of 15 shovel tests.
Artifacts were recovered from
seven of these tests (53%
ubiquity), and 20 lithic flakes
were recovered between the
surface and 60 cmbs.
The
assemblage included 11 exterior
flakes (core flakes; primary
flakes) and nine interior flakes
(secondary fakes). Roughly
equal numbers of artifacts were
recovered from each of the three
levels, suggesting a single
subsurface component.
No
features were observed and no
ceramics
were
recovered.
Pleistocene clay (2.5YR 4/6)
was encountered at depths
ranging between 40 cmbs and 80
cmbs (Table 4-5). No artifacts
were observed on the surface
during the pedestrian survey.

41CS307
41CS307 is a 58 by 64 m
prehistoric
site
of
undetermined age located on
an elevated terrace (280ft
AMSL) approximately 220 m
west of Lake Wright Patman
and 60 m southeast of
41CS306. Vegetation within
the site consisted of mixed

The site was discovered by a
positive shovel test on transect
(Figure 4-6). No artifacts were
observed on the surface. Six
more tests were excavated
around this initial positive test
for a total of seven shovel tests.
Of these, cultural material was

Caddo ceramics, one lithic
core, and one piece of fire
cracked rock. Artifacts were
recovered a deep as 100 cmbs,
but the single mode of artifact
frequency at 20 cmbs to 40
cmbs suggests a single
prehistoric occupation. Clay
was encountered at variable
depths ranging from 40 cmbs to
100 cmbs (Table 4-7). No

surface.
41CS309
Site 41CS309 is the location of
an early to mid twentieth
century homestead situated on
an upland terrace (260 ft
AMSL) west of Lake Wright
Patman. Site dimensions are 57
m by 60 m.
The site is bisected by the
USACE property line (Figure
4-8) and about half of the site is
on private property. However,
no property line is marked in
the field nor are blazed trees
present to indicate the USACE
Figure 4-8. Site Map, 41CS309.
property limits. Consequently,
it was unclear during site
recordation what portions of the site, if any, were on private property and as a result, three of the
seven shovel tests placed on this site are actually on private land. This fact was not determined
until after field work was completed and GPS readings were downloaded and compared to
USACE property maps.
An abandoned and overgrown segment of County Road (CR) 2464 is located immediately north
of the site. No structure is marked in this location on the 1910 USGS topographic map (see
Figure 2-1), although a road is nearby (presumably CR 2464). The homestead was razed by the
USACE after it acquired the land in mid twentieth century.

Vegetation noted within the site
included pine, black walnut, and
oak. Surface visibility was
approximately 10 percent. Soils
fell within the Eastwood series.
The typical pedon for this soil
type is presented in Chapter 1.
Archeology Results
Three features are present on the
site. The remains of a sandstone
lined well and a 1.5 m by 1.5 m
chimney were identified in the
central portion of the site (Figure
4-9). The chimney was 1.2 m
high and was built of large,
Figure 4-9. Sandstone Chimney on 41CS309.
tabular pieces of local sandstone
that were held together with a
white sandy paste mortar. The sandstone lined well was approximately 1.5 m diameter and
extended at least 5 m below the ground surface. In addition, portions of a 3-rail fence were
present, forming a U-shaped enclosure, presumably a corral. All three features are on the private
property portion of the site.
No artifacts were observed on the surface. Seven shovel tests were excavated and cultural
material was recovered from four of the seven shovel tests (57% ubiquity). A total of 55 artifacts
dating from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century were recovered between the surface
and 50 cmbs (Ketchum 2000; Monsey 1970; Polok 1997) (Table 4-8). Due to the fact that the
site was razed, many of the artifacts were recorded in mixed contexts (modern glass below ca.
1898 window glass in ST1). The manufacture dates acquired from the analysis of window glass
indicate that the site occupants were utilizing window glass manufactured during the late
nineteenth to early twentieth century (Moir 1987) (Table 4-9).

Archival Results
The tract on which this site is located first shows up in Cass County records when Ward Matt
and Ury Amos convey that parcel to James H. Purdue in 1853. His heirs conveyed the tract to
Henry Judkins in 1901 who in turn sold the tract to M.N. Heard in 1914. In 1933, M.N. Heard
sold the tract to Mina Buford et al., although the alii remain anonymous as Ms. Buford conveyed
the land to the United States of America in 1951. None of these persons are listed in The

41CS310
41CS310 is a 200 m by 200 m multi-component site. A prehistoric campsite of undetermined
age is present, as are the remains of a historic homestead in the southwest portion of the site
(Figure 4-10). The site is located on an elevated terrace (250 ft AMSL) approximately 25 m
west of Lake Wright Patman. An abandoned and overgrown segment of CR 2464 runs through
the southern portion of the site in a roughly west to east direction. Vegetation noted within the
site included: pine, black walnut, osage, and oak. Surface visibility was approximately 10
percent. Soils fell within the Metcalf series. The typical pedon for this soil type is presented in
Chapter 1. The historic component of the site was 100 percent razed by the USACE after it
acquired the land in mid twentieth century.
Archival Results
The property on which this site is located first appears in 1919 when Silas Granberry and his
wife Lucy convey it to B.B. Webster, Jr.; however, the records concerning the Granberry family
(variously spelled as Grandberry and Granbery) are difficult to unravel because of the similar
names from generation to generation and their tendency to die intestate. A records search back
to 1835 failed to turn up a source of the property into the Granberry family. Webster
consolidated his title from the 1919 transaction by getting a quit claim deed from J.W. Granberry
and his wife in 1937, and the property was taken by the United States of America in 1952,
though there was some dispute as to its ownership that year as witnessed by an Affidavit of
Possession filed after the taking by H.O. Oliver and H.W. McCall. None of these persons are
listed in The Handbook of Texas Online.

Archeology Results
Two features were observed
on the surface. A 3 m
diameter stone pile and 3 m
diameter shallow depression
were encountered within the
historic component in the
southwest portion of the site
(Figure 4-10). The stone
pile was comprised of
approximately
100
sandstone cobbles and
boulders and probably
represent the razed remains
of a collapsed structure. The
depression
is
located
approximately 7 m south of
the rock pile. It may
represent the remains of a
root cellar or possibly a
collapsed well that was
subsequently filled in with
surrounding matrix, thus
forming
a
shallow
depression on the site

artifacts were recovered
between the surface and 100 cmbs (Table 4-10). With the exception of a few nails and glass
shards, most of the historic artifacts are restricted to the upper 20 cmbs. Prehistoric artifacts
were recovered as deep as 80-100 cmbs with no clear mode of vertical distribution. However,
due to the fact that the site was razed, many of the artifacts were recorded in mixed contexts: for
example, in ST6, historic window glass was recovered below prehistoric lithic flakes.
Prehistoric artifacts included 24 lithic exterior (core) flakes, 15 lithic interior flakes, two
hammerstones, and one non-diagnostic grog tempered Caddo ceramic. The 22 historic artifacts
date from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century and include window glass bottle glass,
wire nails, a tack, a button, a brick fragment, and unidentified pieces of metal (Ketchum 2000;
Monsey 1970; Polok 1997).

Carlow Creek

The Carlow Creek area totaled 232 acres and was completely inventoried using 121 shovel tests
for a density of 0.52 shovel tests per acre. Two cultural resource sites were inventoried within
the parcel. An aerial photograph showing the locations of all shovel tests excavated within the
Carlow Creek is provided in Appendix A.
41CS311
41CS311 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age located on a slightly elevated terrace (230 ft
AMSL) 30 m south of Powell Creek (Figure 4-11). Site dimensions are 265 m by 77 m.
Vegetation within the site included thick stands of hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was
approximately 10 percent. Soils fell within the Bernaldo series. The typical pedon for this soil
type is presented in Chapter 1. Erosion has probably impacted the site by transporting topsoil
down slope to lower elevations to the east.
No artifacts were observed on the surface. Twelve shovel tests were excavated to define site
boundaries and cultural material was recovered from seven of the tests (58% ubiquity). A total
of 30 lithic flakes were recorded between the surface and 100 cmbs with a mode between 60 cm
and 80 cmbs (Table 4-11). Artifacts included 18 exterior (core) flakes and 12 interior flakes. No
ceramics were observed.

Archival Results
The first legal recognition of this tract was in 1889 when J.A. Holland of Ft. Worth conveyed a
portion of this tract to Sam Evans, Sr., who in 1899 sold the tract to J.W. Granberry. Shortly
thereafter in 1900, Fannie Severn conveyed the other half of the tract to J.W. Granberry who
consolidated the ownership of the 111.5 acres. In 1909, J.W. Granberry and his wife then
conveyed half the tract to Silas Granberry and Mrs. Winifred Granberry. Winifred died intestate
in 1915 and her heirs settled a portion of the property on Silas Granberry the same year. In 1917,
Silas received the other half from a partnership called Morriss & King (A.D. Morriss and J.G.
King) who probably bought it from the estate but there is no record of that.
In 1923, Silas Granberry and his wife sold the whole tract to another partnership, Rutland &
King (R.P. Rutland and J.G. King), probably for timbering. The following year, Rutland bought
out King’s share of the partnership including this tract. In 1925, King conveyed a parcel of 3.5
acres out of the property back to W.G. Granberry and then 22 years later in 1947, W.G.
Granberry bought from King and his wife the rest of tract.
The third portion of the tract was originally sold in 1857 from a William J. Finley to Micajah
Long whose heirs in 1917 sold the property to adjoining owner W.G. Granberry. All the
adjoining tracts were taken by the United
States of America on April 7, 1953. None
of these persons are listed in The
Handbook of Texas Online.

Big Creek Island

The Big Creek Island parcel totaled
twenty-four acres and was completely
inventoried using eleven shovel tests for a
density of 0.46 shovel tests per acre
(Figure 4-13). No cultural resources were
recorded on the surface during the
pedestrian survey or below the surface

Lakeside Park

The Lakeside Park inventory area totaled 242 acres and was completely inventoried using 126
shovel tests for a density of 0.52 shovel tests per acre. Approximately thirty percent (72 acres)
of the inventory parcel had been severely impacted by activities associated with the construction
of the nearby dam in late 1950s in addition to areas converted into a recreational park. After
subtracting the heavily disturbed areas from the total acreage, the actual shovel test density for
the parcel came out to 0.75 shovel tests per acre. One cultural resource site was present within
the parcel.

the
locations of all shovel tests

areas within the Lakeside Park
area is provided in Appendix A.
41MR62
Prehistoric site 41MR62 (Figure
4-14) was initially discovered in
the early 1960s by Forrest
Murphy and was later recorded
in 1981 by Environmental
Consultants,
Inc.,
while
conducting a survey along the
Black Cypress and Marshall
Reservoirs
(TADSF-TARL).
The site is reported to have been
exposed
during
dam
construction activities but is
presently destroyed. According
to Murphy (TADSF-TARL),
reported artifacts collected from
the site include Clovis and later
style points, a mastodon tooth
fragment and other unidentified
bones.
According to site maps at
TARL, 41MR62 is a 140 m by
100 m prehistoric site of

undetermined age located on a slightly elevated terrace (240 ft AMSL) approximately 270 m
south of Lake O’ the Pines. Since its original recording, the site has been severely impacted by
the construction of two nearby roads and by a drainage ditch through the central portion of the
site. The ditch was constructed at the time the dam was built in the 1950s and the general area
was extensively used for borrow during dam construction. (S. Austin, personal communication).
Vegetation within the site included mixed hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was
approximately 10 percent. Soils fell within the Gallime series; the typical pedon for this soil type
is presented in Chapter 1.
41MR62 is actually plotted in two locations on the TARL maps. Because of this uncertainty,
EComm shovel tested both locations. At neither location were any cultural remains identified.
However, upon consultation with the USACE cultural resource manager, the true location was
identified on the basis of topography and the false site location was deleted (Stephen P. Austin,
personal communication 2005). Six shovel tests were dug in the site location on record but no
artifacts were present in any test or on the surface of the site.
4.2.2

Brushy Creek South

The Brushy Creek South area totaled 69 acres and was completely inventoried using 38 shovel
tests for a density of 0.55 shovel tests per acre (Figure 4-15). No cultural resources were
recorded on the surface during the pedestrian survey or below the surface during shovel test
excavations. An aerial photograph showing the locations of all shovel tests excavated within the
Brushy Creek South area is provided in Appendix A.
4.2.3

Tejas Village

The Tejas Village area totaled 64 acres and was completely inventoried using 46 shovel tests for
a density of 0.72 shovel tests per acre (Figure 4-16). No cultural resources were recorded on the
surface during the pedestrian survey or below the surface during shovel test excavations. An
aerial photograph showing the locations of all shovel tests excavated within the Tejas Village
area is provided in Appendix A.

Lakeview Island

The Lakeview Island area totaled
53 acres and was completely
inventoried using 77 shovel tests
for a density of 1.45 shovel tests
per acre. Six cultural resource
sites were present. An aerial
photograph showing the locations
of all shovel tests excavated
within the Lakeview Island area
is provided in Appendix A.
41MR48
Prehistoric site 41MR48 (Figure
4-17) was initially recorded by
GSRC in 1974 along the western
shoreline of the northern tip of
the island. During the survey,
numerous lithics and fire-cracked
rock were collected along the
shoreline of the site in an area
that was commonly utilized as a
campsite (TADSF-TARL).
In
1994, the site was revisited by Bo
Nelson, who recorded numerous
lithic flakes, one dart point, and
one biface along the shoreline of
the island. According to Nelson,
the site had been impacted by
erosion and extensively looted by
local collectors (TADSF-TARL).
Figure 4-17. Site Map, 41MR48.
41MR48 is recorded as a 57 m by
60 m prehistoric site of
undetermined age located on the northern tip of Lakeview Island. Vegetation within the site
included thick stands of hardwood and pine. Surface visibility was approximately 10 percent.
Soils fell within the Cuthbert series. The typical pedon for this soil type is presented in Chapter
1. Erosion has heavily impacted the western portion of the site in proximity to lake waters. Six
shovel tests were excavated. Cultural material was not encountered on the surface during the
pedestrian survey or below the surface during shovel test excavations.

41MR103
Prehistoric site 41MR103 was initially recorded by Bo Nelson during a survey in 1993 along the
shoreline of Lakeview Island (TADSF-TARL). During the survey, Nelson collected numerous
lithic flakes and one Friley point on the beach surface in proximity to Lake O’ the Pines. Based
on the presence of one Friley point, Nelson speculated the site contained possibly archaic and
Early Caddo cultural components (TADSF-TARL).
While conducting the survey it was discovered that the location of 41MR103 plotted on maps
maintained at TARL did not match the description in Nelson’s original 1993 site form. Nelson
described the site as being located along the shoreline while TARL maps had the site plotted
inland on the island approximately 150 meters away from the shoreline. It appears that the
original site UTM coordinates were taken by Nelson using the NAD1983 datum and were then
misplotted on TARL maps using the NAD1927 datum without conversion, thus causing a
northerly displacement of ca. 200
m north. The true location of
41MR103 is probably about 200 m
south of the position currently
shown on TARL maps; the true site
location is probably inundated.
In order to make a recommendation
that the site location be changed on
TARL maps, EComm investigated
the location on record. Thus, the
following results in this report are
for the erroneous site location and
should not be considered a true
revisit of the correct site location
described by Nelson on the original
site form. As stated, the location
of 41MR103 on TARL maps
indicates an inland location
approximately 150 m east of Lake
O’ the Pines (Figure 4-18). Five
shovel tests were excavated at this
location. Cultural material was not
encountered on the surface during
the pedestrian survey or below the
surface
during
shovel
test
excavations.

41MR107
Historic site 41MR107 (Figure
4-19) was initially recorded by
Bo Nelson in 1993 along the
shoreline of Lake O’ the Pines
on the southeast corner of
Lakeview Island. During the
survey,
Nelson
recorded
numerous late nineteenth to
early twentieth century artifacts
and prehistoric lithics along the
shoreline (TADSF-TARL).
Archeology Results
41MR107 is the location of a
late nineteenth to mid twentieth
century homestead situated on
the
southeast
corner
of
Lakeview
Island.
Site
dimensions are 90 m by 45 m.
Vegetation noted within the site
included mixed stands of
hardwood and pine. Surface
visibility was approximately 10
percent on elevated terrace and
100 percent along the beach.
Soils fall within the Cuthbert
series; the typical pedon for this
soil type is presented in Chapter
1. The site was 100 percent
razed by the USACE after it
acquired the land in mid
twentieth century.

Figure 4-19. Site Map, 41MR107.

No artifacts were observed on the surface during the pedestrian survey. Six shovel tests were
excavated on the intact terrace deposits; three tests were positive (50% ubiquity). Seven artifacts
dating from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century were recovered between the surface
and 20 cmbs (Ketchum 2000; Monsey 1970; Polok 1997) (Table 4-14).
Archival Results
The earliest records for this tract record a transfer from John Ferguson to John Clayton dated
November 27, 1877. There appear to be no earlier records. Upon Mr. Clayton’s death in 1882,

his estate sold the land to a local businessman, E.W. Taylor, who held the land for six years
before selling it to a partnership of J.M. Wright and W.T. Armistead in 1888. E.W. Taylor is
listed in 1885 as one of the Directors of the Texarkana and Northern Railway, which was being
constructed over ten miles to provide rail access to timber holdings on the Red River in Bowie
County.
Nothing further has been uncovered about J.M. Wright and he sold his interest in the property to
Armistead in 1889. Armistead held the property for twenty years, presumably as a timber
investment, until he sold it to the Glen Lumber Company in March of 1909.
William Thomas Armistead was born in Georgia in 1848 and at the outbreak of the Civil War he
enlisted as a private in the Confederate Army. Armistead eventually rose to the rank of captain
and was wounded and taken prisoner. After the war he attended the University of Georgia to
study law and graduated in 1871. He moved to Cass County, Texas, where he taught school for
one year and then moved to Jefferson to start a law practice with a fellow Georgian, David B.
Culberson. Culberson (1830-1900) was also a Confederate veteran but he had come to Texas
before the War in 1856 and been active in Texas politics. Culberson served as a U.S.
Congressman from Texas from 1875 to 1897. His son, Charles A. Culberson (1855-1925) was
Governor of Texas (1892-1899) and U.S. Senator (1899-1923) (Hooker 2006). Armistead
served along with Culberson and Culberson’s son Charles, as one of Abe Rothschild’s defense
attorneys in the famous “Diamond Bessie” Murder Trial in Jefferson. The murder of Bessie
Moore in 1877 was a sensational scandal at the time resulting in two of the most widely
publicized murder trials in 19th Century Texas and is still re-enacted through a play presented
every year during Jefferson’s Heritage Week Festival.1

1

On January 19, 1877, Abe Rothschild, a Cincinnati jeweler and traveling salesman, and his mistress, Bessie
Moore, got off the train in Jefferson and registered at the Brooks House hotel. After several days, Abe and Bessie
were last seen Sunday afternoon walking over the footbridge across Big Cypress Creek and into the winter fog with
picnic lunches from Henrique’s Restaurant. Abe returned by another route later that afternoon and stated to various
people that his “wife” was visiting friends in the country and would join him Tuesday to leave town. Abe left
Tuesday morning on the train without Bessie during a snowstorm. Bessie’s body was found a week later stripped of
her jewelry and lying under a tree with the remains of the picnic lunches. Several celebrated trials ensued with
Rothschild’s wealthy family funding a formidable defense. Abe Rothschild was found guilty, appealed, was retried
and eventually acquitted, all to great fanfare in the press (Pilcher 2006).

Armistead was a staunch Democratic politician and served in the Texas Legislature in the House
of Representatives in the 18th (1883), 19th (1885), and 24th (1895) Legislatures and in the Senate
in the 20th (1887) and 21st (1889). After he retired from office he still served in various
capacities at the Democratic State Convention and continued to practice law in Jefferson until his
death in 1920.
Because he lived in town in Jefferson from his arrival in 1873 on, Armistead did not live on or
occupy the tract in question and, therefore, did not have a direct association with it. Armistead
never married and had no children (Hyman 2006). He is listed in the 1880 Census for Jefferson
Ward #3 as a boarder at M.E.T. Murphy’s establishment (1880 U.S. Census, Marion County,
Texas- Jefferson Ward 3, SD2, ED 92, p.7), and in the 1910 U.S. Census as a homeowner in
Jefferson’s Precinct #3 (1910 U.S. Census, Marion County, Texas-Jefferson Ward #3, SD 10,
ED 104, p. 11A.).
41MR109
Prehistoric site 41MR109
(Figure 4-20) was initially
recorded by Bo Nelson in 1994
while conducting a survey
along the shore of Lakeview
Island. According to Nelson
(TASDF-TARL),
the
site
contained numerous lithic
artifacts along the shoreline,
including seventeen lithic
flakes and two unidentified
darts. Surface dimensions are
recorded as a 95 m by 70 m.
During the current survey,
surface visibility along the
shoreline was 100 percent.
Soils within the site fall within
the Cuthbert series; the typical
pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1. With
the exception of the extreme
northern portion of the site
(located on a heavily disturbed
beach), the majority of the site
is currently underwater. As
expected, erosion from waves
has significantly impacted
exposed portions of the site.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

While conducting the pedestrian survey two projectile points and one 10 cm diameter ground
stone item were recovered on the beach surface in the extreme northern portion of the site. The
points resemble Yarbrough and Morrill points (Figures 4-21 and 4-22) and compare favorably to
those illustrated by Turner and Hester (1993:160, 197). Both points were comprised of reddish
brown (2.5YR 4/4) chert. The groundstone item was red sandstone, fire blackened, and had a
distinctive 3 cm circular depression on one face; other faces were unmodified.
Six shovel tests were excavated north of the site along an elevated terrace where wave erosion
had not impacted the integrity of soils. None of the six shovel tests contained cultural material.
Shovel tests were not excavated on the beach due to the heavily eroded context of the beach
matrix and the shallow water table (ca. 5 cmbs). In addition, during the pedestrian survey
EComm thoroughly inspected the terrace cut-bank and found no cultural material eroding from
the exposed northern profile.

Point collected on 41MR109.

Figure 4-22. Possible Morrill
Point collected on 41MR109.

41MR191
41MR191 (Figure 4-23) was initially recorded in 1998 by Bo Nelson while conducting a survey
along the eastern shoreline of Lakeview Island (TADSF-TARL). During the survey, an
unknown number of non-diagnostic prehistoric lithic flakes were recorded on the beach surface.
According to maps maintained at TARL, 41MR191 is a 95 m by 30 m prehistoric site located
along the western shoreline of Lakeview Island. Surface visibility on the beach was 100 percent.
Soils within the site fall within the Cuthbert series; the typical pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1. Soils within the site have been significantly impacted by erosion and it is
highly unlikely that intact cultural deposits still exist within the site.
No cultural material was observed on the surface of the site. A total of three shovel tests were
excavated south of the site along an elevated terrace where wave erosion had not impacted the
integrity of soils. None of the three shovel tests contained cultural material. Shovel tests were
not excavated on the beach due to the disturbed/eroded context of the beach matrix and the high

water table (ca. 5 cmbs). In
addition, the terrace cut-bank was
thoroughly inspected but no
cultural material was observed
eroding from the exposed southern
profile.
41MR192
41MR192 (Figure 4-24) was
initially recorded in 1998 by Bo
Nelson while conducting a survey
along the southern shoreline of
Lakeview Island (TADSF-TARL).
During the survey, an unknown
number
of
non-diagnostic
prehistoric lithic flakes were
recorded on the beach surface.
According to maps maintained at
TARL, 41MR192 is an 80 by 65
m prehistoric site located along
the southwestern shoreline of
Lakeview
Island.
Surface
visibility on the beach was 100
percent. Soils within the site fall
within the Cuthbert series. The
typical pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1. Like
41MR191, the soils within the site
have been significantly impacted
by erosion and it is highly
unlikely that intact cultural
deposits still exist.

Figure 4-23. Site Map, 41MR191.

No cultural material was recorded on the surface of the site while conducting the pedestrian
survey. Eight shovel tests were excavated within the highly disturbed soils found on the site.
None of the eight shovel tests contained cultural material. It appears the cultural resources
within the site have been 100 percent impacted by erosion.
4.3

ISOLATED OCCURRENCES

Recent debris, such as beer bottles and plastic detritus, was commonly observed, especially along
shorelines at both lakes. Excluding these items, four artifacts were recovered from isolated
contexts (i.e., not within a site) in the Powell Creek, Carlow Creek, Lakeside Park, and Lakeview
Page 62

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Island inventory areas (Table 4-15).
Three of these were flakes recovered
from shovel tests along survey
transects and the fourth was a highly
retouched biface collected from an
eroded beach surface. Additional
shovel tests placed in the areas of
each of the three positive tests did not
recover any additional artifacts and
these loci were not designated as sites.
The biface is a light brown (7.5YR
6/4) chert and appears to have been
the medial section and base of an
unknown projectile point that has
been highly retouched and fashioned
into a bifacial scraper tool (Figure 426). Due to their isolated contexts,
these artifacts cannot contribute to the
further understanding of the project
area and are not further considered.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

INVENTORY SUMMARY

This cultural resources inventory investigated eight separate locations in four counties of
northeast Texas. Four parcels were inventoried at Lake Wright Patman in Bowie and Cass
Counties, and four parcels were inventoried at Lake O’ the Pines in Harrison and Marion
Counties. The parcels ranged in size from 24 to 287 acres and the total area inventoried was
1,209 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory accompanied by excavation of 665
shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay
horizon or to 80 cm below the surface. Overall testing density for the project was 0.55 tests per
acre (or, 1.1 acres per test).
The inventory documented 18 archeological sites, including eight previously known sites and ten
newly discovered sites. No intact historic building or structure greater than 50 years old was
present in any of the inventory areas. Excluding the three parcels within which no sites were
present, the density of sites ranged from a minimum at Lakeside Park (Lake O’ the Pines) of one
site per 170 acres to a high at Lakeview Island of one site per 9 acres (Table 5-1). For the project
as a whole, site density is calculated as one site per 67 acres. This compares favorably to four
previous inventories totaling 2,783 acres at Lake Wright Patman averaging one site per 71 acres
and three previous inventories at Lake O’ the Pines totaling 1,039 acres with an average of one
site per 69 acres (Trierweiler et al 2002, Trierweiler and Bonine 2004, Bonine et al 2004,
Trierweiler and Jones 2005) (Table 5-2).

Of the 665 shovel tests dug within all inventory areas, 65 were positive for an overall yield of
9.8% (Table 5-1). Sixty-one of these positive tests were on the 18 sites and four were isolated
tests not clearly associated with any site. The remaining 600 shovel tests were negative.

SITE SUMMARY AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

None of the 18 sites are clearly eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. However, a clear evaluation
could not be reached for seven sites using the limited shovel testing tactics. It is not known
whether or not any of these seven sites are eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. As a
consequence, they should be protected from adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected, these
sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP eligibility. Ten sites are
considered not eligible for the NRHP, and no further work is warranted. The final site was not
located at the position on record and is probably located off USACE fee lands. Each of the 18
recorded sites, presented in site number order, is discussed briefly below. A tabular summary is
presented in Table 5-3.
41CS12
Eight shovel tests were excavated at the recorded location of site 41CS12. Cultural resources
were not observed on the surface or in any of the shovel tests. Because the site was described as
containing “midden refuse” including ceramics and lithic tools, it is likely that the location
plotted on the TARL maps and here tested is not the same location as that which was originally
recorded in 1949. The terrain south of this location was completely surveyed with no indication
of the site; it is likely that the true location of 41CS12 may be found north by a distance of 200 m
or more. This probable location would be off of USACE fee lands.
41CS303
Site 41CS303 is a newly recorded prehistoric site of undetermined age that contains a small
amount of artifacts within one intact component. Six shovel tests were excavated and a total of
11 lithic flakes were recovered between 0-60 cmbs. No artifacts were observed on the surface.

Page 66

Ecological Communications Corporation

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown
and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical then further investigations may
be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,209 Acres at Lake Wright Patman and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

41CS304
Site 41CS304 is a prehistoric site that contained a small amount of non-diagnostic lithic debitage
between 0-40 cmbs in two of the six shovel tests excavated. Cultural resources were not
observed on the surface. Based on the overall lack of features, diagnostics, and low artifact
yield, it is unlikely that the site contains any potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archeology. As a result, site 41CS304 is evaluated as not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41CS305
The razed remnants of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead define 41CS305.
Seven shovel tests were excavated, and 98 artifacts were recovered between 0-60 cmbs in six of
the seven shovel tests. No artifacts or features were encountered on the surface during the
pedestrian survey. The presence of modern bottle glass below an 1890 era widow glass fragment
in one of the shovel tests suggests that the site was heavily impacted when it was demolished in
the mid twentieth century. On the basis of the severely disturbed context, the site is assessed as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41CS306
Site 41CS306 is a newly recorded prehistoric site of undetermined age that contains a moderate
amount of artifacts within one intact component. Fifteen shovel tests were excavated and a total
of twenty lithic flakes were recovered in intact matrix between 0-60 cmbs. No artifacts were
observed on the surface. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility
status is considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical
then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the
sites NRHP eligibility.
41CS307
Of seven shovel tests placed on site 41CS307, two tests recovered a small amount of nondiagnostic lithic debitage between 40-60 cmbs, indicating that this site is a prehistoric site of
undetermined age. Cultural resources were not observed on the surface. Based on the overall
lack of features, diagnostics, and low artifact yield, it is unlikely that the site contains any
potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, site
41CS307 is evaluated as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and no further work is
warranted.
41CS308
Site 41CS308 is a newly discovered prehistoric campsite of undetermined age that contained a
total of 41 lithic flakes, five non-diagnostic grog tempered Caddo ceramics, one core and one
FCR within an intact component between 0-100 cmbs in eight of the ten shovel tests excavated.
A large quantity of non-diagnostic artifacts was recovered between 0-100 cmbs. The FCR could
indicate the presence of buried burned rock hearths or oven features within the site. However,

Page 68

based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown
and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical then further investigations
may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the sites NRHP eligibility.
41CS309
The razed remnants of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead delineate site
41CS309. Seven shovel tests were excavated, and 55 artifacts were recovered between 0-50
cmbs in four of the seven shovel tests. The razed remains of a chimney and sandstone lined well
were identified in the central portion of the site. No artifacts were encountered on the surface
during the pedestrian survey. The presence of modern bottle glass below an 1898 era widow
glass fragment in one of the shovel tests suggests that the site was heavily impacted when it was
demolished by the USACE in the mid twentieth century. On the basis of the severely disturbed
context, the site is assessed as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
warranted.
41CS310
Site 41CS310 is a large prehistoric campsite of undetermined age that contains the 100 percent
razed remains of a homestead in the southwest portion of the site. Sixteen shovel tests were
excavated in order to assess cultural resource deposition and site size. A total of 45 prehistoric
and 22 historic artifacts were recovered between 0-100 cmbs in 11 of the 16 shovel tests
excavated. Prehistoric artifacts included 42 non-diagnostic lithics, two hammerstones, and one
non-diagnostic grog tempered Caddo ceramic. The twenty-two historic artifacts date from the
late nineteenth to early twentieth century. Due to the fact that the historic homestead was razed
in the mid twentieth century, many of the historic artifacts were within mixed contexts (ca. 1898
window glass below lithic flakes in one of the shovel tests). On the basis of the severely
disturbed context of the historic component of the site, this component is assessed as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted. However, based on the limited
data collected on the prehistoric component of the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered
unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical then further
investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the sites NRHP
eligibility.
41CS311
Site 41CS311 is a newly recorded prehistoric site of undetermined age that contains a moderate
amount of artifacts within one intact component. Twelve shovel tests were excavated and a total
of 30 lithic flakes were recovered in intact matrix between 0-100 cmbs. No artifacts were
observed on the surface. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility
status is considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical
then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the
sites NRHP eligibility.

41CS312
The razed remnants of an early to mid twentieth century homestead define site 41CS312. Six
shovel tests were excavated, and 21 artifacts were recovered between 0-60 cmbs in five of the six
shovel tests. The razed remains of a chimney and well were identified in the central portion of
the site. No artifacts were encountered on the surface during the pedestrian survey. Based on
the fact that the historic component was 100 percent razed in the mid twentieth century, the site
is access as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41MR48
Six shovel tests were excavated on previously recorded site 41MR48 in order to assess cultural
resource deposition and site size. Cultural resources were not observed on the surface or below
the surface in any of the shovel tests. Based on the overall lack of cultural resources encountered
during the survey, the site appears to offer little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, site 41MR48 is assessed as a non-significant
site that is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. No further research is recommended.
41MR62
Site 41MR62 is a previously recorded prehistoric site that was reported as being largely
destroyed when the site was initially recorded in 1981. Cultural resources were not observed on
the surface or below the surface in any of the shovel tests. During the survey, the site appeared
to be heavily impacted by a storm drainage and two nearby roads. Based on the overall lack of
cultural resources and heavy subsurface disturbances, the site is assessed as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is warranted.
41MR103
Misplotted on maps at TARL, site 41MR103 is currently underwater. A total of five shovel tests
were excavated within the previously recorded (erroneous) site location. Cultural resources were
not encountered on the surface of this location during the pedestrian survey or below the surface
during shovel test excavations. The NRHP eligibility status of the correct site location (currently
underwater) is unknown.
41MR107
The razed remnants of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead constitute site
41MR107. Six shovel tests were excavated, and seven artifacts were recovered between 0-20
cmbs in three of the six shovel tests. No artifacts or features were encountered on the surface
during the pedestrian survey. Archival research revealed that the property was owned by
William Thomas Armistead, a noted attorney and local personality during the late 19th century.
However, Mr. Armistead did not reside on the property or actively develop it. Because he was
not closely connected with the property, it is not eligible under NRHP criterion (b). Because the
historic component was 100 percent razed in the mid twentieth century, the site has no remaining

Page 70

archeological integrity and it is not eligible under NRHP criterion (d). No further work is
warranted.
41MR109
With the exception of the extreme northern portion of site 41MR109 (located on a heavily
disturbed beach), the majority of the site is currently underwater. Six shovel tests were
excavated north of the site along an elevated terrace where wave erosion had not impacted the
integrity of soils. None of the six shovel tests contained cultural material. Two Archaic
projectile points (one possible Yarborough and one possible Morrill) were recovered on the
beach surface in the extreme northern portion of the site. Due to the remote chance that
underwater portions of the site could contain intact buried deposits, the NRHP the eligibility
status of the site should be considered unknown.
41MR191
Site 41MR191 is a previously recorded prehistoric site located along the heavily eroded eastern
shoreline of Lakeview Island. No cultural material was recorded on the surface of the site during
the pedestrian survey. Three shovel tests were excavated south of the site along an elevated
terrace where wave erosion had not impacted the integrity of soils. None of the three shovel tests
contained cultural material. Based on the fact that 41MR191 has been 100 percent impacted by
erosion, the site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or
local archeology. As a result, 41MR191 is assessed as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
No further work is recommended.
41MR192
Site 41MR192 is a previously recorded prehistoric site located along the heavily eroded
southeastern shoreline of Lakeview Island. No cultural material was recorded on the surface of
the site during the pedestrian survey. Eight shovel tests were excavated within the sites highly
disturbed beach matrix. None of the shovel tests contained cultural material. Based on the fact
that 41MR192 has been 100 percent impacted by erosion, the site offers little or no potential to
answer significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. The site has no remaining
archeological integrity and it is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. No further work is
warranted.
