The 1987 Parida Cave Conservation Project,
Val Verde County, Texas
Joseph H. Labadie

ABSTRACT
Parida Cave (41VV187) is an extensive rockshelter in an isolated part of
the Amistad International Reservoir near Del Rio, Texas. The site long has
been a popular place to visit for the local population and, more recently, by
boaters on the reservoir and long has been the target of illegal digging and
vandalism. During the summer of 1987 the National Park Service spearheaded
a major conservation project to clean up and revitalize the site. The Parida Cave
Conservation Project, with a volunteer work force, picked up trash, back-filled
potholes, and built a rock pathway for visitors. The project dramatically illustrates the kind of success that is possible through cooperative undertakings involving the National Park Service, private landowners, and a responsive regional archeological community.
INTRODUCTION

Parida Cave is a large rockshelter on the Rio Grande at Amistad Reservoir
near Del Rio, Texas (Figure 1). The site has historic and prehistoric pictographs
together with significant archeological deposits. In the recent past this site has
been a popular destination for the boating public, campers, and local fishermen,
since it is readily accessible from the lake (see Figure 2). This popularity has led
to great damage to the site; campers inadvertently harmed the archeological
deposits by digging fire pits and latrines and burying garbage. Other visitors to
the site have vandalized the pictographs and dug for artifacts.
The site is unusual in that it is owned jointly by the federal government and
two private owners. The shelter floor and lower half of the site are the property
of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), and this part of
the property is administered by the National Park Service. The upper half of the
site (the part above 1144.3 feet above mean sea level (amsl)) and the cave walls
that have the pictographs are coowned by Amos Humphrey and Clifton Lowry,
of Del Rio. Vandalism of the lower, publicly owned, half of the site is a
prosecutable offense under the Archeological Protection Act of i979, but vandalism above 1144.3 feet amsl, on private property, can be prosecuted only
under the Texas Antiquities Code.
The degree of vandalism, the legal situation, and the sheer proportions of
Parida Cave all combine to create a complex and formidable preservation
problem. During the summer and fall of 1987, the Parida Cave Conservation
Project was formed to find solutions to these problems. The project, begun under
the joint sponsorship of the National Park Service and the Texas Historical
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 59 (1988)

Commission, relied on volunteers for the bulk of the labor and included personnel from the Texas Archeological Society, the Southern Texas Archaeological
Association, the Coastal Bend Archeological Society, the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio, and anthropology
students from The University of Texas at Austin and at San Antonio. National
Park Service employees, Youth Conservation Corps members, and several high
school students from Del Rio also participated in the project. On December 10,
1987 a completely rejuvenated Parida Cave, complete with a public boat dock,
rock-lined trails, and interpretive signs that explain the key aspects of the site,
was reopened to the public.
BACKGROUND
A 1944 Water Treaty between the United States and Mexico created the
International Boundary and Water Commission (National Park Service 1987).
The original intent was to plan, construct, operate, and maintain three international hydroelectric dams along the Rio Grande. Two---Falcon and Amistad
dams--have been built, and before they were closed, preinundation surveys and
inventories of the reservoir basins were mandated by the National Archeological
Salvage Program.
The IBWC controls all land adjacent to the reservoir on the American side
up to 1117.0 feet (335 meters) amsl and owns or has a permanent flowage
easement on all land up to 1144.3 feet amsl. Under a 1965 agreement with the
IBWC, the National Park Service became responsible for administering all
recreational activities on the reservoir, including the conservation and protection
of all historic and prehistoric sites on IBWC property adjacent to the reservoir
(National Park Service 1987:Appendix A).
Construction of the Amistad Dam was completed in 1969, and the storing of
water began with the closing of the floodgates on May 31, 1969. The dam was
dedicated by Presidents Richard Nixon and Diaz Ordaz on September 8, 1969.
The Amistad Reservoir stores about 67,000 surface acres of water at a pool level
of 1117.0 feet (335 meters) amsl. Impounded waters are used primarily for flood
control and irrigation downriver. At the normal pool level (1117.0 feet [335
meters] amsl), impounded water extends in the United States about 40 km (25
miles) up the Devils River, 22 km (14 miles) up the Pecos River, and 118 km (74
miles) up the Rio Grande. The reservoir has an estimated shoreline of about
1,360 km (850 miles), about 864 km (540 miles) of which are in Texas (National
Park Service n.d.).
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Overview
The Amistad Reservoir basin is probably the most extensively and intensively studied geographic region in Texas. The region, known as the Lower

Labadie-- Parida Cave

87

Pecos River Archeological Region, has become one of the most well defined
culture areas in Texas (cf. Shafer 1986). The limited geographic distribution of
regionally distinctive artifact types and unique pictograph styles has long suggested a culture core area at the mouth of the Pecos River at the Rio Grande
(Suhm et al. 1954).
The Lower Pecos River Region has some of the oldest and best-preserved
archeological deposits in North America. Dry rockshelter deposits often contain
deeply stratified cultural remains consisting of textiles, bone and wooden artifacts, stone tools, and food remains. Many walls of the rockshelters are adorned
with pictograph panels. Radiocarbon dates have determined that there has been
about 10,000 years of near-continuous human habitation in the region. The first
archeological survey for the proposed Amistad Reservoir in 1958 described the
significance of the area.
In several respects the Diablo [Amistad] Reservoir area is one of
the unique archeological regions in North America. Probably no
area of comparable size can boast of so rich a series of archeological and pictographic sites, and in the stratified terrace sites are preserved an unusually complete array of materials. For this reason
alone the archeology of the area is of exceptional scientific significance. But in addition to this rich inventory of archeologic materials, here exists one of the truly unique pictograph regions of the
world. The magnificent galleries of superb cave murals, executed
in polychromatic and monochromatic styles, in stylized and naturalistic forms, are perhaps comparable only to the famous cave
paintings of Europe [Graham and Davis 1958:84, 85].
Four archeological districts and a single site are listed in this region on the
National Register of Historic Places. All are in or adjacent to the Amistad
Recreation Area. In the four districts are 183 sites that are listed at the national
level of significance. Historic sites are associated with the building of the second
transcontinental railroad from 1881 to 1882. Almost as many recorded sites
have yet to be nominated to the Register but are, in the opinion of Curtis
Tunnell, State Historic Preservation Officer, also clearly eligible for listing
(personal communication, December 1987). A complete inventory of resources
on federal lands adjacent to the reservoir has never been completed. Twentyseven new archeological sites were documented by the National Park Service in
1987; twenty-nine more were documented in 1988. It is clear that hundreds more
sites remain to be identified and recorded.
There have been three major historical periods of archeological research in
the Amistad Reservoir basin. They are Early Research, Preinundation Research,
and Current Research.

Early Research (1930-1958)

Several nineteenth century explorers and travelers noted the presence of
pictographs in caves of the Devils and Pecos rivers (see Turpin 1984a). However, Gutzeit and Carson (1931) are generally recognized as the first to document accurately some of the sites in the region. Sponsored by the Witte Museum
in San Antonio, they produced watercolor paintings of 18 pictograph panels
from about half a dozen sites ~oberta McGregor, personal communication,
January 1988). Gutzeit and Carsonâs original works and field notes are part of
the Witte Museumâs permanent collection.
A. T. Jackson (1938) included extensive research on pictographs and petroglyphs of the Lower Pecos River Region in his monumental work Picture
Writing of Texas Indians. He did not limit his book to just the lower Pecos but
included his research for the entire State of Texas. In 1932, Jackson visited
Parida Cave (Jacksonâs site 71), and his drawings (Jackson 1938:185) were the
first to record accurately the pictographs at Parida Cave (Figure 3). Jacksonâs
original field notes and glass negatives with proofs are cataloged and are on file
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin.

Figures 164 and 165).

The best-known early pictograph researcher is Forrest Kirkland. Kirkland
(1937a, 1937b, 1938, 1939), with the assistance of his wife Lula, produced
detailed watercolors for many of the regionâs better-known sites. However, it
was not until the publication of The Rock Art of Texas Indians (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967) that many of his original works were first seen by the public.

Kirkland visited Parida Cave in July 1937 and completed watercolors of all of
the pictograph panels ~igures 4 and 5) (Jackson had copied only one of the four
panels). Kirklandâs original artwork and field notes are cataloged and maintained in acid-free archival folders and boxes at the Texas Memorial Museum at
The University of Texas at Austin (Causey 1985:16).
The first archeological excavations in the reservoir basin were made by
Pearce and Jackson (1933, Thomas 1933) who dug at Fate Bell Shelter (41VV74).
In 1965, this site was briefly reinvestigated (Parsons 1965) by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project of The University of Texas as part of their l~ger
preinundation study. Fate Bell Shelter is now part of Seminole Canyon State
Historical Park, which is operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
Public tours of the site are offered twice a day all year round.
The Witte Museum conducted several private projects at Shumla Caves and
Eagle Cave. These expeditions investigated nine rockshelter sites that are collectively named the Shumla Caves. Shumla Cave No. 5 (41VV115) was completely
excavated by Martin (1933, 1935). The archeological assemblages have since
been analyzed by Schuetz (1956, 1961, 1963). The first radiocarbon dates from
the Lower Pecos River Region came from the Shumla Caves (Schuetz 1957).
The unusual hafted knife illustrated on the cover of Turner and Hesterâs Field
Guide to Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians (1985) was excavated by Martin
(1953) at Shumla Cave No. 5. Another site, Eagle Cave (41VV167), also was
first dug by the Witte Museum (Davenport 1933). It was later reinvestigated by
the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (Ross 1965) during preinundation
studies.
The Smithsonian Institution sponsored several early expeditions to the
Lower Pecos River Region. In 1933, Frank Setzler dug at Moorehead shelter
(41VV55) and Goat Cave (41VV67) on the Pecos River, but these excavations
were only briefly reported (Setzler 1933, 1934), and none have been made at
either site since the 1930s. Prewitt (1970) reported on some Moorehead shelter
materials he examined at the Smithsonian Institution, and Masolowski (1978)
analyzed the Smithsonian collection from Moorehead for his dissertation at the
University of Pittsburgh.
In 1937 the West Texas Museum excavated Murrah Cave (41VV351),
located about 40 km (25 miles) up the Pecos River from its mouth at the Rio
Grande, and a brief report was published by Holden (1937). The lithic assemblage from Murrah Cave has since been analyzed by Holiday (n.d.); Horseshoe
Cave (41VV 171) was later excavated by Woolsey and The University of Texas.
These excavations were not published (Woolsey 1936) but were later the topic
of Butlerâs (1948) M.A. thesis at The University of Texas. Other early reports on
sites or artifacts from what is now the Amistad Reservoir basin include Davenport, Walker, and Chelf (1941), Gardner, Fletcher, and Martin (n.d.), Harris and
Lewis (1941), Martin and Woolford (1932), Sayles (1935, 1941), and H. C.
Taylor (1948, 1949a, 1949b).

Texas Archeological Society
Preinundation Research Period (1959-1969)

Early research in the Amistad Reservoir basin firmly established the scientific value of the region. However, early research was tremendously biased,
since it concentrated almost exclusively on rockshelter sites and the collection
of museum specimens. In contrast, preinundation research was holistic in approach and was the first systematic survey of the entire Lower Pecos River
Region. The definition of a regional chronology, reconstruction of past lifeways,
and the study of the larger cultural processes involved, were the hallmarks of the
Preinundation Research Period. The period began in the late 1950s and lasted
until about mid- 1969.
The Austin Field Office of the Archeological Salvage Program of the
National Park Service conducted the initial survey for the proposed Diablo (later
changed to Amistad) Reservoir. The survey (Graham and Davis 1958) located
188 sites on the United States side of the reservoir. The initial National Park
Service study recommended that implementation of the recommendations of the
Graham and Davis survey be contracted to the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project, The University of Texas at Austin.
Surveys on the Mexican side of the reservoir basin have located 78 sites.
Herbert Taylor (1948) had found 10 sites along the Rio Grande in northern
Coahuila before the reservoir was planned. Sixty-eight sites on the Mexican
side, all prehistoric, were inventoried during preinundation research by W. W.
Taylor, Direccion de Prehistoria, Mexican National Institute of Anthropology
and History (Taylor 1958, Taylor and Ruhl 1961). No other surveys, excavations, or mitigating actions were undertaken on the Mexican side of the reservoir
during preinundation studies, andnone have been taken since.
Graham and Davis (1958:2) surveyed about 70 percent of the area to be
affected by the reservoir. Later surveys (parsons 1962, Dibble and Prewitt 1967)
would eventually reduce the unsurveyed area to about 10 percent. Dibble and
Prewitt (1967) located an additional 68 sites. Parsonâs research (1962) is the
only historic sites survey made in the reservoir area. He surveyed and documented 11 historic sites associated with the construction from 1881 to 1882 of
the southern transcontinental railroad along the Rio Grande. By the end of 1967,
about 300 archeological sites had been located, and 24 had been tested or
extensively excavated (Story and Bryant 1966:8).
Several major pictograph surveys and studies were completed as part of the
preinundation studies. These include Gebhard (1960, 1961, 1965) and Grieder
(1965, 1966a; see also 1966b).
Site survey and excavation reports and other articles have been published on
many of the sites investigated by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project at
Amistad Reservoir. Reports completed for and submitted to the National Park
Service, Denver Service Center, include Damp and Centipede caves (Epstein
1960, also 1963), the Devils Mouth site (Johnson 1961, 1964, Sorrow 1968a),
Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967), the Javelina Bluff site (McClurkan 1968), Fate
Bell shelter (Parsons 1965), Bonfire shelter (Dibble 1965, 1970, Dibble and

Labadie-- ParMa Cave

93

Lorrain 1968), Eagle Cave (Ross 1965), the Nopal Terrace site (Sorrow 1968b),
Parida Cave (Alexander 1970), the Perry Calk site, Conejo shelter, and 41VV162A, Cueva Ponderosa, sites 41VV160, 41VV161, 41VV163, 41VV176, 41VV186,
and 41VV422 (Collins 1969), and Coontail Spin, Zopolite Cave, Mosquito
Cave, and the Doss site (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965).
Extensive excavations were conducted at Parida Cave (Alexander 1970) in
1967. The site was then coowned by Perry Calk, of Comstock, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. There are no photographs of the 1967
excavations because a mechanical failure of the field camera went unnoticed
until the film was developed after the field season was over (Alexander 1970:17).
The Texas Archeological Salvage Project excavated five major test units at
Parida Cave (41VV 187), the deepest of which extended more than three meters
from the ground surface. Postexcavation studies indicated that the principal
occupations of the site were from about 4000 to about 200 B.C. A later component at the site was dated to A.D. 1000 to 1600. More than 100 dart points were
recovered (notably absent were Ensor and Frio dart points), nine painted pebbles,
mostly decorated with thin black lines, and a fragmentary valve of a freshwater
mussel that had traces of red ochre, apparently in a liquid state when deposited,
adhering to the inner surface (Alexander 1970:45). Among other artifacts recovered were bone awls, pieces of abraded dark red hematite, bone beads, matting,
basketry, cordage, sandals, netting, and a variety of knotted vegetable fibres.
Only a small part of the total faunal assemblage has been analyzed, but
identified taxa (Alexander 1970:64) include cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.), jackrabbit
(Bepus californicus), coyote (Canis latrans), fox (Urocyon sp.), deer (Odocoileus
sp.), squirrel (Citellus sp.), catfish (Ictalutus sp.), flathead catfish (Pylodictris
olivaris), and gar (Lepisosteus sp.). All of the materials from Texas Archeological Salvage Project excavations at Amistad are in long-term curation at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

Current Research (1970-present)
National Park Service research in the Amistad Reservoir basin has been
sporadic since the completion of the preinundation studies in 1969. Most research since then has been outside the basin. Regional research projects have
been sponsored by non-National Park Service agencies, many of which have
concentrated on pictograph research (Turpin 1979, 1984b, 1985a), and significant archeological research projects have been undertaken at Baker Cave (Chadderden 1983) and Hinds Cave (Shafer 1977). The Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department established Seminole Canyon State Historical Park in 1980, and
since then, Seminole Canyon Park has been the focus for most regional research.
Several significant reports on the rock art (Turpin 1986a, Silver 1986) and
archeology (Turpin 1982, 1985b, Patterson 1980) of Seminole Canyon Park
have been completed. The Pecos River style (Turpin 1986b), the Red Monochrome style (Turpin 1986c), the Bold Line Geometric style (Turpin 1986d),
and the Red Linear style (Turpin 1984c) have been defined as the primary

94

Texas Archeological Society

prehistoric rock art styles. Several historic period pictographs (Turpin 1988a,
1988b) also have been reported recently.
A detailed analysis of a Lower Pecos child bundle burial from a private
collection was funded and published by the Texas Archeological Foundation
(Banks and Rutenburg 1982), and the Texas Historical Foundation funded the
construction of the protective fence at Panther Cave (41VV83) and the interpretive shelter at the National Park Service boat dock on the Pecos River. Regional
Late Archaic mortuary practices have been described by Turpin, Henneberg, and
Riskind (1986).
Ethnohistoric observations on bison in the Lower Pecos Region have been
reported by Turpin (1987). The Dorso end scraper (Bement and Turpin 1987)
has been suggested as a regional Late Prehistoric bison-processing tool. A reexamination of the deepest materials at Bonfire shelter (Bement 1986) has provided additional information on the Western Hemisphereâs oldest known bison
jump site.
Salvage excavations were conducted by the National Park Service at three
sites in the Amistad Recreation Area. At Skeleton Cave (41VV671) on the Rio
Grande, a back-country camper discovered a burial while digging a pit for
garbage disposal at the rear of the shelter (Anderson 1978). Anderson (ibid.)
reported that a bison-horn core and an arrowpoint of unspecified type were
found in association with the human remains. A second burial was salvaged
from this site in 1988. The author (Labadie 1988) noted that an Ensor dart point
was found in situ in matrix between the left scapula and clavicle. At Techo Bajo
(41VV621), also on the Rio Grande, a fisherman reported a skeleton (Lehnert
1983) washing out at the waterline of a partly inundated rockshelter, and a
partial skeleton of an adult male was excavated there by Lehnert (1983). In May
1987, Texas Historical Commission archeologist Wayne Bartholomew found a
skeleton eroding out of the deposits at the dripline of a shelter (41VV129) on the
Pecos River. Dental patterns suggested that the skeleton was probably prehistoric (Bartholomew, personal communication 1987), but before a salvage operation was organized, the skeleton was stolen from the site.
Since 1970, several major reports have been published by the National Park
Service that involve the cultural resources at Amistad Recreation Area. A
review of previous research and delineation of future resource management
needs at the park were completed in 1974 by NPS archeologist Bruce Anderson.
A new General Management Plan/General Development Concept (National
Park Service 1987) for the park was issued recently by the National Park
Service. Issued every 10 years, this document establishes short- and long-term
resource management priorities for the park. The addition of two archeologists
to park staff was recommended (National Park Service 1987:99); one permanent
archeologist has been hired, and a seasonal archeologist was added during the
summer of 1988. Also in 1988, the Park Service began a major project to catalog
materials from the Amistad Reservoir at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Artifacts, field notes, photographs, maps, and drawings will be

Labadiem Parida Cave

95

inspected, reinventoried, and cataloged. The project is part of a nationwide
effort by the Park Service t~, account for, and upgrade the curation of, federally
owned archeological collections.
Historic Archeology in the Region
The first historic sites survey in the Lower Pecos River Region was part of
the Park Service preinundation studies (Parsons 1962); several identified sites
were later resurveyed by Briggs (1974:5) in 1969. Briggs (1974) has reported on
the artifacts from two Southern Pacific Railroad 1881 to 1882 construction
camps, one near Langtry and the other just east of the mouth of the Pecos along
the Rio Grande. The only other research in historic sites has been Pattersonâs
(1980) at Seminole Canyon State Historical Park and at the Jersey Lilly site
(Patterson 1987) near Langtry. A compilation of State Historical Markers inVal
Verde County has been published by the Val Verde County Historical Commission (Val Verde County Historical Commission 1986).
The Historic Era for the Lower Pecos River Region technically begins from
1590 to 1591, with Gaspar Castanoâs expedition from Monclova, Mexico to the
Pecos Pueblo in New Mexico (Turpin 1984a:32). DeSosaâs expedition probably
crossed the Rio Grande near modem Del Rio and may have camped near
Seminole Canyon (Turpin 1984a:32). During the next two centuries, at least six
more Spanish incursions took place. Cabeza deVaca did not travel through the
Amistad Reservoir basin (Campbell 1988:Fig. 1). In 1674, Brother Manual de
La Cruz crossed the Rio Grande near the Devils River in pursuit of Indians who
had left Mission Santa Rosa de Maria on the Rio de Las Sabinas (Turpin 1989).
In the following year (1675), Femando del Bosque led an expedition that
crossed the Rio Grande near Del Rio in search of the "Sierra Dacate y Yascole,"
mountains Bolton identifies as those southeast of modem Bracketville, Texas
(Bolton 1908:297). Jose de Barroteran traveled through the modem reservoir
basin in 1729 (Castafieda 1936:336), crossing the Rio Grande near present-day
Langtry and from there proceeding northward to near Dryden, Texas (Turpin
1984a:37). Garza Falcon passed through the area in 1735 (Patterson 1987:7). In
1773, Vincete Rodriguez attacked a Mescalero camp near the mouth of the
Pecos, killing many, capturing 16 women and children and 200 horses, and
freeing three Spanish captives (Turpin 1984a:37). In 1775, Ugarte and Loyola
are reported (Turpin 1984a:37) to have lost three Spanish soldiers in a battle
with Indians on the San Pedro (Devils) River.
Texas statehood and the arrival of the U.S. Army signaled the beginning of
the end of the long succession of Native Americans who inhabited the reservoir
basin. By the nineteenth century, the Comanche and, later, the Apache dominated the region. In 1853, the U.S. Army skirmished with Indians at the mouth
of the Pecos (Turpin 1984a:37). Later, in 1873, the army engaged a group of
Lipan Apache at the mouth of the Pecos; their chief and 40 women and children
were captured (Turpin 1984a:37).

Texas Archeological Society

The eradication or removal of the Indians from the area by the U.S. Army
and the Texas Rangers was essentially completed by 1881, when the first
Southern Pacific Railroad surveys were made in the reservoir basin. By 1882,
construction of the second transcontinental railroad was in full swing, with more
than 10,000 laborers comprising Germans, Italians, Mexicans, Afro-Americans,
and Chinese building grades and laying track between Shumla and Del Rio. On
January 12, 1883 east and west sections of the first southern transcontinental
railroad were joined with a silver spike about 1-1/5 km (1 mile) north of the
mouth of the Pecos (Patterson 1980:12).
The Southern Pacific Railroad built a station between Tunnel No. 1 (the
first railroad tunnel in Texas) and the bridge across the mouth of the Pecos. It
was named Painted Cave--a reference to Parida and two other nearby rockshelters with pictographs. For nine years, passenger trains pulled by American
Standard 4-4-0s and freight trains pulled by 4-6-0s (the numbers describe wheel
alignment of the locomotives) passed the Painted Cave Station (Seminole Canyon State Historical Park display, n.d.).
Parida Cave provided a welcome water stop for weary train travelers, who
sometimes left painted messages on the shelterâs walls (Figure 6). Painted Cave
Station consisted of at least two wooden buildings, one of which housed a
section gang whose job it was to maintain the dangerous stretch of track between
Comstock and Shumla. This stretch of track had two 450-meter (1,500 foot)
rock tunnels, 900 meters (3,000 feet) of wooden trestle, and 14 metal spans
between 36 and 90 meters (120 and 300 feet) long (Briggs 1974). In 1892,
Painted Cave Station and a 39-km (24.5-mile) section of track were closed in
favor of a newer, shorter, and less treacherous 18-km (ll.l-mile) route that
crossed the Pecos River about 8 km (5 miles) upstream from the mouth of the
Rio Grande (Briggs 1974).
The buildings were gone before the area was flooded in 1969; foundation
remnants that might have survived into the twentieth century were most probably swept away in the flood of 1954. An International Boundary and Water
Commission marker on the Pecos River near the railroad bridge tells of rains
spawned by a tropical depression that raised the prereservoir level in a 24-hour
period from about 321 meters (1,070 feet) amsl to 347 meters (1,156.78 feet)
amsl. The highest recorded level for the Amistad Reservoir is 341 meters
(1,138.0 feet) amsl in 1975; the level in Figure 2 is 335 meters (1,117.0 feet) amsl.
All that remains today of the Painted Cave Station is old photographs
(Figure 7). Much of the old railroad grade is now inundated by the waters of the
reservoir, and the physical evidence of the railroad grade below Parida Cave is
about 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 feet) under water.
The 1987 Parida Cave Conservation Project
The 1987 Parida Cave project is part of a much larger conservation project
at the Amistad Recreation Area. In 1985, the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) initiated a public response campaign to focus the regional archeological

communityâs attention on the area. In 1986, the Historical Commission issued
an invitation to concerned archeologists to attend a public hearing in Austin that
was jointly sponsored by the Commission and the National Park Service. As a
result of this meeting, the Park Service agreed to a joint cultural resources
evaluation whose goals were to update the archeological data base and evaluate
current and projected site management needs. Fieldwork on the project began in
November 1986.
The work focused on the Lower Pecos River Region, which probably has
the highest concentration of sites in the park. To solicit support, staff archeologists of the Texas Historical Commission and National Park Service personnel
met with owners of adjacent land, for archeological resources on their lands also
were being adversely impacted as a result of increased public access occasioned
by the reservoir construction. Texas Historical Commission archeologists met
with representatives of the news media and local historical associations with the
result that 40 volunteers representing eight organizations and private landowners donated more than 1,750 hours to the project. More than 30 previously
recorded sites were visited and evaluated; many were rerecorded on new site
forms, mapped, photographed, and cleaned up. Modern human organic and
inorganic waste was removed.
In spring, 1987 a seasonal archeologist was hired by the Park Service at
Amistad Recreation Area in Del Rio, and, by the fall, the Park Service upgraded
the archeologistâs position to a full-time staff position.
The Parida Cave Conservation Project became the first priority for the
seasonal archeologist. Before this project was initiated, the Park Service had
made no attempt to restrict access or to set up onsite interpretive displays.
The first phase of the restorative work began with making the site off-limits
to all overnight camping and day-use activities. Modern accumulations of trash,
including latrine-related waste, were removed. Thirty-one potholes (one meter
in diameter or larger) were mapped, photographed, and backfilled (two potholes
that remain open are incorporated into the interpretive display). In all, 91
artifacts were found during the backfilling, among them 13 dart points, 2 painted
pebbles, a sandal fragment, cordage, manos, and trimmed and utilized flakes.
After the backfilling was completed, the topography of the ground surface
before the potholing was estimated and reconstructed.
The second phase of development consisted of designing and placement of
a trail system of more than 120 meters (400 feet) of rock-bordered trails leading
from about 335 meters (1,117 feet) amsl to an estimated level of about 352
(1,175 feet) amsl--the top of the midden at the rear of the shelter. The trails
were designed to maximize the effect of a trip to Parida Cave while minimizing
the impact of increased traffic. All rocks on the floor of the cave, except the
largest roof spalls, were incorporated into the rock trail. Nearly 800 man hours
were spent just in collecting and placing the rocks after the path had been laid
out and graded.

The third phase of the project was the development of texts for five interpretive signs that explain the key aspects of the site. Texts were so designed that
they could be understood by the average park visitor with no background in
history or archeology. DesCriptive signs explain Parida Caveâs geological history, its colorful rock art panels, the composition of the archeological deposits,
and the damage done by vandalism at the site. The signs were typeset and silkscreened by the Institute of Texas Cultures of The University of Texas at San
Antonio.
The final phase of development was the placement of the interpretive signs
and the construction of a National Park Service courtesy boat dock, since the site
is accessible only from the water. The dock, similar to the one at Panther Cave,
accomodates as many as four boatloads of visitors at a time.
The Parida Cave project was the labor of many unsung heros who worked
behind the scene picking up trash, backfilling potholes, and carrying bucketfulls
of rocks. The project dramatically illustrates the kind of successes that result
from cooperative undertakings among the National Park Service, private landowners, and a responsive regional archeological community (Figure 8). For their
part in this project, Edward C. Rodriguez, Jr., Superintendent of Amistad Recreation Area, and Amos Humphreys and Clifton Lowery, coowners, received
1987 Texas Historic Preservation Awards from the Texas Historical Commission. Preservation awards were also presented to Jack and Missy Harrington and
the Val Verde County Historical Commission for their roles in the overall efforts
of the Amistad cultural resources evaluation.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Parida Cave Conservation Project was successful due solely to the
determined efforts of many dedicated individuals. Deserving of special recognition are Don Goldman, Wayne Bartholomew, Jim Rancier, Ray Smith, Jennifer
Zeyen, and Kathy Labadie. Several organizations provided volunteer labor for
the project--the Val Verde County Historical Commission, the Southern Texas
Archaeological Association, the Texas Archeological Society, the Coastal Bend
Archeological Society, students from The University of Texas at Austin, and
students and staff from the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The 1987 Youth Conservation Corps employees
from Amistad Recreation Area devoted hundreds of hours to the construction of
the rock trail. National Park Service employees from Amistad who participated
actively in the project were Don Goldman, Eldon Kohlman, Dennis Schmidt,
Bob Gamer, Greg Garetz, Emory (Smokey) Lehnert, Charlie Lawson, Robert
Trevifio, and James Dillon. Ron Ice, Jim Rancier, Thomas R. Hester, Jimmy L.
Mitchell, and Wayne Bartholomew graciously reviewed and commented on
early drafts of the manuscript. Lastly, I thank my wife Kathy, who patiently
typed several drafts, each with many revisions, without the aid of a wordprocessor.
