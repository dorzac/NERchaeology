ABSTRACT
ONE Gas, Inc./Texas Gas Service (One Gas) is proposing to construct and operate the
approximately 2.0-mile of natural gas pipeline along the west/southwest side of Farm-To-Market
(FM) 620 South in Travis County, Texas, hereafter referred to as the proposed Project. The
proposed Project occurs in the city of Lakeway, in west central Travis County, Texas. The
southern terminus of the proposed Project occurs approximately 1000 feet south of the
intersection of Falcon Head Boulevard and FM 620 and the northern terminus approximately 300
feet north of the intersection of Glen Heather Drive and FM 620. This proposed Project may
require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (Section 404). The proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) right-of-way (ROW) and will be regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The
Texas Historical Commission (THC) reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No.
8636 to locations proposed for open trench and bore pit locations (when not previously developed)
and in the area of two known cultural resource sites (41TV1904 and 41TV1905); hereafter referred
to as the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the cultural resources investigation (Apex Project No.
453445-001). The proposed Project has not been surveyed since 1987 and could have warranted
an updated survey following the current THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
However, large areas of the APE have been heavily developed in recent years. Locational data of
the proposed Project is presented in Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2 on aerial and topographic
maps, respectively.
On November 7, 2018, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex), at the request of Texas Gas Service (TGS,
a subsidiary of ONE Gas, Inc.), conducted an intensive non-collection cultural resources survey
of the APE. The southern terminus of the proposed Project occurs approximately 1000 feet
south of the intersection of Falcon Head Boulevard and FM 620 and the northern terminus
approximately 300 feet north of the intersection of Glen Heather Drive and FM 620. The length
of the corridor measures 2 miles and the corridor width is approximately 100 feet for a total of
24.24 acres.
The 100% pedestrian survey of the APE, augmented with strategically placed shovel tests, was
negative for prehistoric cultural resources with the exception of three Isolated Finds (IF) in one
disturbed area of the APE. Isolated Finds do not require assessment for listing as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) or inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The IFs include
a natural chert cobble core, a fractured cobble edge, and a tertiary flake in a disturbed context. Due
to the limestone bedrock at or near the surface, a limited number of shovel tests were excavated,
and all were negative for cultural resources. The previous locations of sites 41TV1904 and
41TV1905 were fully or partially developed and lacked any evidence of cultural resources.
Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further cultural resources
investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural resources with the potential
for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.

INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of the general assessment of the proposed Project along with
intensive cultural resources survey, augmented with shovel tests of the APE located along the
west/southwest side of FM 620 located in Lakeay, Travis County, Texas (Project No: 453445001). The southern terminus of the proposed Project occurs approximately 1000 feet south of the
intersection of Falcon Head Boulevard and FM 620 and the northern terminus approximately 300
feet north of the intersection of Glen Heather Drive and FM 620. Locational maps of the proposed
Project are presented in Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2 on aerial and topographic maps,
respectively. See Attachment A, Figure 3 for the locations of the shovel tests and previously
recorded sites 41TV1904 and 41TV1905, which make up the APE.
This work was completed in support of TGS’s proposed new natural gas pipeline located within
the TxDOT ROW on the west/southwest side of southbound FM 620. Because the proposed
Project will occur on public TxDOT ROW, the project is subject to the Texas Antiquities Code.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) requires federal agencies,
agencies, including the USACE, to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic
properties. The USACE’s implementation of this rule is acknowledged in General Condition 20 of
NWP 12. Projects utilizing federal funds, located on federal land, and/or requiring permits, license,
or permission from a federal agency must comply with Section 106. This proposed Project may
require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (Section 404).
On behalf of TGS, Apex conducted an intensive non-collection cultural resource survey of the
proposed Project. The cultural resources investigation was conducted to identify archeological
and historical resources within the proposed APE. The survey methodology followed the Survey
Standards of Texas developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) (1987) and THC
(n.d.).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is located in the Central Texas archeological region in west central Travis
County. Lakeway lies mostly within the Blackland Prairie division of the Gulf Coastal
physiographic zone and the Plains Grassland vegetation habitat (Perttula 2004). Topography,
hydrology, vegetation, and soils within the proposed Project are briefly summarized below.
Topography
Elevation of the proposed Project ranges from 877 feet above mean sea level (msl) near the
northern terminus to 1085 feet above msl near the intersection with Spillman Ranch Loop. The
topography of the proposed Project gradually increases in elevation moving from the south to the
highpoint and then generally decreases toward the northern terminus (Attachment A, Figure 2).
Hydrology
The proposed Project is located in three HUC 12 watersheds: Hurst Creek-Lake Travis
(120902050206), Headwaters Lake Austin (120902050301) and Little Barton Creek-Barton Creek
(120902050304). The three watersheds are located within the Austin-Travis Lake (12090205)
HUC 8 watershed (EPA 2017). Aerial imagery, United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps, USGS National Hydrography Data (NHD), and the National Wetlands
Inventory (NWI) database (2017a) indicate that the proposed Project intersects one stream
marked on USGS map as an unnamed blue-line. There are no NWI freshwater emergent,
freshwater forested/shrub wetlands, or ponds intersected by the proposed Project.
Vegetation
The proposed Project is located within the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods (27) and Live Oak-Ashe
Juniper Parks (26a) vegetation type according to McMahan et al. (1984). Woods are defined as
areas with woody plants mostly 9 to 30 feet tall with closed crowns or nearly so and a midstory
that is usually lacking. Parks have woody plants of comparable heights which growing in clusters
or as scattered individuals within a continuous grassy understory.
Typical vegetation of the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods and Parks consists of Texas oak
(Quercus texana), shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
evergreen sumac (Rhus virens), escarpment cherry (Prunus serotina var. eximia), saw greenbrier
(Smilax bona-nox), mescal bean (Sophora secundiflora), poison oak (Toxicodendron radicans),
twistleaf yucca (Yucca rupicola), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens var. pubescens), cedar sedge
(Carex planostachys), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), oneflower grama (Bouteloua
uniflora), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var.
drummondii), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), curly mesquite (Hilaria belangeri),
pellitory (Parietaria pensylvanica), noseburn (Tragia ramosa), spreading sida (Sida abutifolia),
woodsorrel (Oxalis spp.), and mat euphorbia (Chamaesyce serpens).
Review of aerial imagery indicates the vegetation intersected by the proposed Project is not
consistent with this designation due to clearing and regular maintenance of the FM 620 ROW.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The traditional cultural sequence of central Texas includes the Paleoindian period (11,500 to 8800
BP) followed by the Early (8800 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 4000 BP), and Late (4000 to 1300
or 1200 BP) Archaic periods; the latter Late Prehistoric period (approximately 1200 to around 250
BP) is followed by the Historic period (250 BP into the mid-to late 19th century) (Collins 2004).
These temporal divisions are reflected in changes in technologies and subsistence adaptations.
Archeological site types range from lithic scatters and isolated heaths to open camps, burned rock
middens, hearth fields, lithic procurement/quarries, rockshelters and cemeteries. Within the
general area of the proposed Project, most of the prehistoric sites are open camps situated on
alluvial terraces near streams or rivers. The cultural assemblages may include fire cracked rock
(FCR), lithic debitage, lithic tools (hammerstones, unifaces, bifaces, diagnostic projectile points),
ground stones, and ceramic sherds. Historic site types range from Mexican period ranchos, early
Anglo farmsteads and settlements to the Camino Real de los Tejas, a network of roads linking
outposts and supply towns. Most of the historic sites, within the general area of the proposed
Project, are homesteads and tenant farms dating to the late 19th century.
A search of the restricted use online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (ATLAS), maintained by the
THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), was conducted to identify any
known cultural resource sites (including cemeteries) and previous investigations conducted within
1.0-mile study area of the proposed Project (0.5 mile in each direction from the proposed Project).
Eleven archaeological sites and two cemeteries have been recorded and 12 previous cultural
resource surveys are located within the study area (ATLAS 2018).
From north to south, the previous surveys and recorded sites, are presented below:
Two previous linear surveys along FM 620 took place in 1987 and later in 1995 (Texas Antiquities
Code (TAC) permit 1468). The surveys include and extend beyond the currently proposed Project.
The 1995 survey follows FM 620 in the area of Lohman’s Spur Road, then traverses to the west
away from FM 620; it was conducted for the Cedar Valley to Marshall Ford Transmission Line
13948 to 152 for the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) (ATLAS 2018). Site 41TV1756 was
recorded west of Spillman Ranch Loop during this survey; it is discussed below. The 1987 survey
follows FM 620 to US 71; other than the location of this survey, no further data is available on the
ATLAS (2018). Due to the age of these surveys, they would not meet the current THC’s
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
Site 41TV1756, a prehistoric structure and prehistoric lithic procurement area, is located on
exposed bedrock and rocky shallow soil on a hilltop and upper slopes near an unnamed tributary
of Yaupon Creek (ATLAS 2018). It was recorded in 1995 and revisited in 2005. One historic
rectangular 3-walled structure was built into the hillside; prehistoric lithic debitage and historic
metal can, metal siding, and wood planks with nails were found downslope of the structure. Dense
scatters of prehistoric retouched flakes, bifaces, and lithic debitage were observed in a chert

outcrop on both sides of the structure (ATLAS 2018). The site was determined to be NRHP
ineligible within the APE; however, the area has not been developed. It is located approximately
0.33 mile west of the proposed Project and would not be impacted.
In 1999, a linear survey that roughly followed Lohmans Crossing Road was conducted by Hicks
and Company for Travis County under TAC permit 2172 (ATLAS 2018). Site 41TV1878 was
recorded and is discussed below. The southern terminus of the survey is located approximately
195 feet west of the proposed Project.
The survey for the City of Lakeway’s Justice Center was conducted in 2017 by Hicks and
Company under TAC permit 8067 (ATLAS 2018). It is located on Lohmans Crossing Road
approximately 0.31 mile west of the proposed Project. No new sites were recorded and one
previously recorded site, 41TV1878, was mapped within the area of potential effect (APE).
Site 41TV1878, a prehistoric open camp and historic scatter, is located on an upland terrace on
Yaupon Creek. The prehistoric component consists of widely scattered lithic debitage (50 to 75
pieces), modified flakes, 6 bifaces, cores, 1 Late Archaic dart point (Ensor-like), and 1 untyped
Archaic dart point fragment (ATLAS 2018). The historic component consists of a dense scatter of
early 20th century kitchen debris and does not appear to be associated with a home site; it is
possible it was dumped there (ATLAS 2018). The soil consists of 10 to 20 centimeters of
disposition atop bedrock. The site was deflated without features and the thin soil negates the
possibility of intact buried cultural deposits (ATLAS 2018). The site boundary expands across the
proposed Project area; however, it was determined NRHP ineligible within the surveyed corridor
along Lohman’s Crossing and no further work was recommended within the project (ATLAS
2018).
In 1991, a survey for the Lakeway MUD on Lohmans Crossing Road was conducted by the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB) (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 0.3 mile west of
the proposed Project. Site 41TV1585 was recorded and is discussed below.
Site 41TV1585, a prehistoric open camp, is located on a badly overgrazed and eroded rocky
limestone upland divide between Yaupon and Hurst Creeks; the site had been disturbed by
earthmoving equipment associated with farm and ranching and recent residential development
(ATLAS 2018). This expansive site measures approximately 80 acres in size. The thinly scattered
cultural assemblage included lithic debitage, burned rock, and 2 thin biface fragments (ATLAS
2018). The site is located approximately 0.41 miles west of the proposed Project and has been
partially developed.
Maul Cemetery (TV-C175) is located south of Lohmans Crossing Road and approximately 0.27
mile west of the proposed Project. It is managed by the Yaupon Creek Development and consists
of an adobe wall and wrought iron fencing (ATLAS 2018). It will not be impacted by the proposed
Project.
In 1996, the TWDB conducted an area survey located approximately 0.23 mile west of the

Texas Gas Service
FM 620 2.0-Mile Pipeline

proposed Project. Site 41TV1781, was recorded at the time of the survey; however, other than
locational data, no further information is available on the ATLAS (2018). Based on Google Map
and the ATLAS (2018), the area has been developed into a water storage feature.
In 2003, a small area reconnaissance survey was conducted by the TWDB under TAC permit
3042 (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 129 feet west of the proposed Project. This small
area was negative for cultural resources and no further investigations were warranted (ATLAS
2018).
In 2013, a linear survey of Flint Rock Road (2 miles) was conducted by AmaTerra Environmental
for the City of Lakeway under TAC permit 6582 (ATLAS 2018). The survey was negative for
cultural resources and no further investigations were recommended. Its eastern terminus overlaps
the proposed Project.
The Joseph Beck Cemetery (TV-C0189), also known as the Spillman Ranch Cemetery, is
misplotted on the ATLAS (2018) adjacent to FM 620 immediately south of Falcon Head Blvd.
However, the description of the cemetery location and its plotting on Google Maps provide its
correct location which is located 1.2 miles west of the intersection of SH 71 & FM 620. It is located
approximately 1.73 mile southwest of the proposed Project and would not be impacted
In 2001, a linear survey was conducted for the LCRA under TAC permit 2308; no additional data
regarding the survey is available on the ATLAS (2018). The survey corridor roughly parallels FM
620 to the west to US 71. From north to south, sites 41TV1904, 41TV1905, 41TV1906, 41TV1908,
41TV883, TV-C021 (Freitag Cemetery), and 41TV1907 were recorded during this survey. Of
these, only 3 sites are located within the study area. Sites 41TV1904, 41TV1905, and 41TV1906
are located adjacent to FM 620 and the proposed Project. These 3 sites are described below.
Site 41TV1904 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of debitage, 2 dart points (Ensor and Fairland-like),
several broken biface fragments, and fire cracked rock from disturbed hearths (ATLAS 2018). The
site is located on the lower slopes of an upland ridge that forms the divide between Honey Creek
and Little Barton Creek (ATLAS 2018). This site has likely been disturbed by the construction of
FM 620. A revisit to the site area prior to any excavation near the known site boundary is
recommended.
Site 41TV1905, a historic limestone rock wall, is located on the first terrace above a minor creek
channel; the adjacent area containing a greater depth of topsoil was excavated with negative
results (ATLAS 2018). No cultural associations could be determined; it is possible that the
construction of FM 620 may have destroyed an associated farmstead or ranch (ATLAS 2018).
Site 41TV1906, a prehistoric lithic scatter of debitage and cores, is located on a heavily eroded
slope which descends from the southwest edge of the FM 620 to the terrace edge of an unnamed
creek (ATLAS 2018). The eroded surface has significant exposed bedrock. The site likely
extended into the FM 620 ROW where it would have been totally destroyed by construction
(ATLAS 2018). It may also extend to the northeast side of the US 290 ROW, but this area was

not investigated. (ATLAS 2018). A revisit to the site area prior to any excavation near the known
site boundary is recommended.
In 2000, a linear survey was conducted for the LCRA under TAC permit 2537; it traverses the
above 2001 linear survey, beginning at a water storage feature extending to US 71; no sites were
recorded (ATLAS 2018).
In 2002, an area survey of a proposed 27-acre Target Store was conducted by Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The western
terminus of the survey is located approximately 0.37 mile south of the proposed Project. One
prehistoric site, 41TV1996, was recorded on a hillside terrace bordering a small tributary of Little
Barton Creek; it consists of a sparse lithic scatter (1 bifacial core, 1 edge-modified flake) and a
scatter of historic trash (metal fragments, whiteware and crockery fragments, and bottle glass)
resting on exposed limestone bedrock (ATLAS 2018). The site is located approximately 0.41 mile
south of the proposed Project. Due to the lack of temporally stratified deposits and the sparseness
of materials at this site, the site was determined NRHP ineligible and has been developed (ATLAS
2018).
Site 41TV1301, a prehistoric open camp, was recorded in 1987 by the Texas Department of
Transportation (ATLAS 2018). The site is located on an eroded hillside and floodplain of an
unnamed creek and the cultural assemblage included lithic tools (scraper, bifaces, and modified
flakes), debitage, dart points, and arrow point fragments; a small limestone quarry bordered the
site (ATLAS 2018). Because of the deflated nature of the site within the FM 620 right of way, no
further investigation was recommended (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 0.61 mile
southeast of the proposed Project, on the opposite side of FM 620 and would not be impacted by
the proposed Project.
The northern terminus of a 70-acre survey is located approximately 0.44 mile south of the
proposed Project. The 2008 survey was conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. under TAC
permit 4744 for the Bee Cave Parkway Extension and Central Park (ATLAS 2018). The landscape
consist of minor tributary tributaries, hill slopes, and uplands with shallow and deflated stony soils.
Two prehistoric lithic procurement sites, 41TV2292 and 41TV2293, were recorded were recorded;
both sites are located well outside of the study area and would not be impacted by the proposed
Project.
The area is considered to have a low to moderate probability of containing cultural resources;
historic resources, including cemeteries, have been recorded along FM 620 and prehistoric
resources have been associated with abundant natural chert outcrops, springs, and the numerous
creeks and tributaries in the proposed Project area.

METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field investigation, the THC’s ATLAS database (ATLAS) and the Texas State
Library and Archives Commission’s (TSL) historical county maps (TSHD 1940 and 1961)
were reviewed to identify significant cultural resources.
The proposed Project has not been surveyed since 1987 and could have warranted an updated
survey following the current THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. However, large
areas of the APE have been heavily developed in recent years. Apex recommended a cultural
resources investigation of the areas of the proposed Project associated with known sites
41TV1904 and 41TV1905 and locations proposed for open trench and bore pit locations when
not previously developed/destroyed. Areas that have been significantly modified and developed
would be noted and would not require further assessment. The proposed Project was walked to
identify undeveloped settings for intensive pedestrian survey and shovel testing.
The current field investigation was designed to comply with appropriate archeological field
methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the CTA (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC (n.d.) in
conjunction with the CTA. The primary intent of the survey is to identify and describe all
archeological and historical resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP and listing as SALs. If eligible cultural resources were located,
recommendations for future management options, such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations, would have be presented. However, the survey was negative for cultural resources
with the exception of three IFs; no cultural materials were collected.
The draft technical report mets the standards for cultural resource reports adopted by the THC
and the CTA. The report briefly describes the natural and cultural history of the project area,
discusses the methodology and results of the survey, and concludes with recommendations.
The draft report will be submitted to the THC for review. Any concerns will be addressed, and final
reports will be provided to the THC and Texas State Library, as required. Project records will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

RESULTS

The entire proposed Project was walked while areas located in natural settings or in the area of
the previously recorded cultural sites were identified for an intensive pedestrian survey
supplemented with shovel tests, as needed. See Appendix A, Figure 3 for the locations of the
shovel tests and previously recorded archeological sites and Table 2 See Appendix A, Figure 3
for shovel tests descriptions.
The APE was surveyed using the proposed Project alignment provided by TGS; the width of the
survey corridor measured between 80 and 100 feet. Due to limestone bedrock at or near the
surface and construction and development impacts, a limited number of shovel tests were
excavated, and all were negative for cultural resources. Shovel Test 1 was attempted in an area
north of Site 41TV1904, as the site area has been developed into a shopping center (Photo B1). We inspected the site area and moved north into a wooded landform between the shopping
center and apartment complex, measuring approximately 750 feet in length and
approximately 100 feet in width (Photos B-2 and B-3). The soil was shallow hitting bedrock at
approximately 3 inches below surface (bs). The location of Shovel Test 1 was recorded with
sub-meter GPS; six additional shovel tests were attempted in the surrounding are. All six were
terminated between 2 and 3 inches bs; their locations were not documented with GPS. See
Appendix A, Figure 3 and Table 2.
Located approximately 1,000 feet south of site 41TV1904 is a slightly modified natural surface
with some evidence of upper disturbances. Site 41TV1905 was located in this area; it was
subjected to an intensive survey with shovel testing. The area has been lightly modified by
landscaping. A drainage borrow is located immediately west of FM 620 and a narrow clear creek
parallels FM 620 between 75 and 158 feet west of FM 620 (Photo B-4). A borrow mound is
located west of the drainage feature and numerous trees have been planted between the highway
and creek (Figure B-5). Shovel Tests 2 through 4 were excavated in this area (Photo B-6). The
upper 2 to 8 inches appear to be disturbed consisting of brown sandy loam over pale brown
dissolved caliche; very dark grayish brown clay rest below the disturbed soil reaching hard pan
between 12 and 21 inches bs. All were negative for cultural resources. See Appendix A, Figure
3 and Table 2.
One intact ridgetop was pedestrian surveyed; this is a remnant of a hilltop that was removed when
FM 620 was constructed (Photo B-7). A drainage ditch is located next to FM 620 adjacent to an
approximately 30-foot cliff face to the west (Photo B-8). The ridgetop is narrow measuring
approximately 25 feet wide with modern development and current construction immediately to the
west. This narrow ridgetop appears intact with evidence of limestone bedrock observed on the
surface and eroding downslope. Three IFs were observed on the downslope of the ridge, sloping
downward toward the west away from FM 620. These were likely associated with a site located
on the hilltop prior to its demolition during construction of FM 620. The IFs include a natural chert
cobble core (measuring approximately 3 by 2.5 inches with cortex on three sides with hinge
fractures and battered edges) (Photo B-9), a fractured small-sized half cobble (measuring 1.25 by

nibbling, and hinge fractures) (Photo B-11). See Appendix A, Figure 3 for IF locations.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The proposed Project consists of an approximately 2.0-mile of natural gas pipeline along the
west/southwest side of Farm-To-Market (FM) 620 South in Travis County, Texas. The entire line
was walked while areas located in natural settings or in the area of the previously recorded cultural
sites were subjected to intensive pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel tests, as needed.
The majority of the proposed Project was developed with extensive land modification (see general
area landscapes in Photos B-12 through B-13).
The southern terminus of the proposed Project occurs approximately 1000 feet south of the
intersection of Falcon Head Boulevard and FM 620 and the northern terminus approximately
300 feet north of the intersection of Glen Heather Drive and FM 620. The length of the corridor
measures 2 miles and the corridor width is approximately 100 feet for a total of 24.24 acres.
Three areas were subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, supplemented with shovel
testing as needed; four shovel tests (Shovel Tests 1 – 4) were excavated by the archeologists
in the areas of previously recorded sites 41TV1904 and 41TV1905. The survey was negative
for cultural resources with the exception of three IFs which do not require assessment for NRHP
eligibility or SAL listing. The IFs were observed on an eroding downslope on the backside of a
modified ridgetop. A few additional lithic chunks and cobbles were observed eroding downslope
beyond the proposed Project to the west.
Mixed loamy sand, decomposed limestone and caliche, and very dark grayish brown clay was
encountered up to 21” bs; however, most of the proposed project has less than 2“ of humic soil
above solid limestone bedrock. See Table 2 and Attachment A, Figure 3 for shovel test
descriptions and locations.
Apex recommends that the Project proceed without further cultural resource investigation as the
proposed construction would have no effect on cultural resources eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or listing as SALs. The work reported here represents a reasonable and good faith effort
to ensure that the proposed Project will not affect historic properties; and no further work is
recommended.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
currently proposed infrastructure, then further archeological investigations may be necessary in
those areas prior to any construction.
