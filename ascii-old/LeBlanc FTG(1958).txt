FOREWORD
The northern Gulf of Mexico and its adjacent low-lying Recent coastal
plain, which extends for a distance of over 1500 miles in Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. provide geologists with a very fine natural
laboratory for the study of modern depositional environments, sedimentary processes, and the related sediments and faunas. The conditions which prevail in
the marine environments of the continental shelf and slope and in the alluvial
and deltaic environments of the coastal plain, including t
numerous brackishwater lakes and bays, are similar to those which characterized much of the Tertiary period of this region. Principles of sedimentation and environmental
criteria can be derived from study of the Recent geology of this region and can
be applied directly to the subsurface of the same area, which is one of our most
prolific petroleum provinces.
The Recent geology of the Gulf region received comparatively little
attention prior to World War II. The few studies made by university groups in
the early 30's were concerned primarily with the extensive Mississippi deltaic
plain of southeastern Louisiana, the chenier and marsh plain of southwestern
Louisiana, and some of the barrier islands and lagoons of Texas. During the
early 40's the study of Recent sediments was extended over the Mississippi allu~
vial valley as far north as Cairo, Illinois, while other local investigations
were being conducted along other parts of the coastal region lying both to the
east and west of the Mississippi delta. Since World War II considerably more
attention has been given to the Recent sediments of the Gulf Coastal plain and
the Gulf of Mexico itself. Numerous papers summarizing the results of these
investigations have appeared in various geological journals, particularly during
the past five years.
This sudden increase in interest in Recent sediments has been reflected
in the technical programs of the GCAGS annual meetings. According to the Transactions of the GCAGS. twenty-three papers dealing with Recent sediments, Foraminifera, sedimentation problems, and related studies. have been presented since
1951. It is interesting to note that over half these papers were given at the
last annual meeting held in New Orleans in 1957. In view of the current interest
in this phase of geology shown by numerous groups associated with universities,
federal and state agencies, and petroleum companies, it is quite likely that
future technical programs of GCAGS annual meetings will contain many more contributions from students of Recent geology.
In spite of the large amount of published information on Recent ~eposi­
tional environments, sediments. and faunas of the coastal region, geologists do
not generally fully appreciate the importance of Recent sedimentation until they
have had an opportunity to visit some of the environments, observe the processes
which are active within them, and study the sediments and faunas which characterize
them. Organized field trips for this purpose have not previously been sponsored by
GCAGS. The site of this year's meeting is only a few yards from the shores of
Corpus Christi Bay and comparatively close to Laguna Madre, Padre Island, and the
Rio Grande delta. It is therefore altogether proper and timely that a Recent field
trip be conducted_in order to provide members of our ass
ations with the opportunity to observe ~odern sedimentation conditions and related sediment of this
part of the Gulf Coast.

INTRODUCTION
The Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies Field Trip will
this year lead the membership into an area of geological study long neglec~ed
by a large percentage of the geologists working in the petroleum industry,
We have traveled far and wide to examine Cenozoic, Mesozoic and even Paleozoic sediments outcropping on the coastal plain and hinterlands of the Gulf
of Mexico. Yet, the Recent sediments, at our doorstep, have been regarded
as an undesirable admixture to mustard and pickle relish at our beach picnics.
Published literature and presentations at geological society meetings
are now directed primarily to various aspects of sediments and their distributiono The Field Trip Committee, in preparing the spring trip for the Corpus
Christi Geological Society, felt that it would be desirable to examine the
Recent sediments in this portion of the Texas Coast. The trip was so well
received it is presented again at this time for geologists from the entire
Gulf Coasto
S.

W. Lowman has explained our feelings when he wrote, "There is a
correlation between the present sediments of the northern Gulf of
the sedimentary tectonic history of the late Tertiary. So much
is hard to see how we could interpret one without the other."

"To begin with the Recent and Tertiary sediments have strikingly
similar patterns of distribution in the Northern Gulf of Mexico"region.
Both are predominantly sandstone and shale in the west, and limestone in the
east. In both of them the major facies divisions are distributed in broad
bands roughly parallel to the present coast. Facies criteria can be developed in the Recent and applied to the Tertiary. This is the contribution of
the Recent to the over-all picture."
Plate 2 shows the general distribution of environments of deposition
available for study along our coast, truly a gamut of sedimentary environments. We shall walk along beaches of the open gulf and the enclosed bays
and lagoonso Sediments and faunas of mudflats and oyster reefs can be
examined with easeo Eolian and deltaic plains with their bold dune tracts
and sinuous distributary ridges will also be visited Bnd discussed. As an
aid to the application of what we see in the Recent, we are fortunate in being
able to visit Pleistocene outcrops which clearly demonstrate that modern geological processes are not unique but have existed in the past and can be
preserved in the geologic column. Only the fluviatile sediments are missing
from this excursion. In this semi-arid climate we have few rivers which carry

appreciable sediment loadso River deposits are better studied farther east
along the northern Gulf Coast.
The type of sedimentary deposit which could be a reservoir rock,
a seal and porosity barrier and a source bed are all here for you to study.
We can show you only the thin skin which is the Recent. It is for you to
imagine the effect that time may have on the picture you see today. What
of shifting environments? What follows a sealevel adjustment? What, if any,
are the effects of faulting? These questions are before you every time you
look at an electric log, sketch a map or cross section, determine the
biologocal components in a sample. Yet how often do we recognize them and
seek their solution?
Perish the thought, but we shall no doubt again drill an unfaulted
section where objective sands are missing. If there is any truth to what
Lowman had to say then we hope you will recall observations on this trip
which will not only explain the absence of reservoir rocks but suggest
methods of subsurface exploration which will prevent similar misses. It
may not be what you see today that really counts but how you use it tomorrow. If such is the case we will have had a successful trip.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
An effort such as this is necessarily a cooperative one and many
persons have joined the Field Trip Committee in preparing this trip.
Drs. Armstrong Price, Alan Lohse, Howard Odum and his staff have
been extremely helpful in preparing the trip and selecting localities to
visit. Drs. Francis Shepard. H. N. Fisk, Mark Hanna and Gene Rusnak were
helpful in early planning. We are grateful for all of their assistance.
These persons and several others have written material for the
guidebook. Several local geologists have helped by reviewing published
data and providing abstracts helpful in rounding out our investigation of
South Texas Sedimentology. Credit is noted where their material appears
in the text.
This same trip, less some slight changes, was conducted in May
1958 by the Corpus Christi Geological Society and we are grateful to that
group for permission to use all of their material. Some data on the Rio
Grande delta was also previously published by the South Texas Geological
Society.
Aerial photographs appearing in the guidebook were generously
supplied by Edgar Tobin Aerial Surveys, Inc., San Antonio, Texas. The
aerial mosaics of the South Texas coast displayed during the trip were
loaned to us for the occasion also by Tobin Surveys.
Shell Development Company in Houston, Texas has allowed us to
print from their plates and negatives the large colored map, the photographs of algal sediments, and Plates 5 and 8. They also provided the
data on grain size distribution for various stops.
Sun Oil Company has provided the isopach map of the "D-l" sand at
North Rincon Field, Starr County, Texas.
Gulf Oil Corporation has granted permission to publish the papers
written by Mr. Charles Aves of their Houston laboratory.
Several companies have released data and maps and provided time of
draftsmen and typists for preparation of maps, cross sections and manuscript.
Lane-We lIs has once agai n generous ly provided the sound equipment
for use on the field trip.
Caroline Duffield and her able staff have been most patient and
cooperative in the publication of this guidebook.

INTEGRATION IN SEDIMENTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHy

l

by
Marcus A. Hanna 2
The Corpus Christi Geological Society should be highly commended for the field trip October 30 through November I, 1958, and for
the preparation of the accompanying guide book on "Sedimentology of
South Texas." A field trip on Recent and near Recent sediments is,
not only timely, but long overdue. Such field trips can lead only to
better understanding of Recent sedimentology, and in turn, to stratigraphy in general.
All the processes of sedimentology which took place in the past
are probably not taking place today. or, at least, on the same scale.
However, to deny that the laws govening the hydraulic, wind, and other
interrelated systems of transportation and deposition in the past were
not the same as in the present, is unfounded~ There is no question of
applying information gleaned from the Recent to the past. It is unfortunate that possibly all the information may not be so attained in
the present. However, we are far short of the vast amount that can be
unravelled from the Recent.
On this field trip you are seeing the interrelationship of a
few processes. You are hearing about soil profiles, clay dunes, stratigraphic overlaps, ecology. facies changes, wave energy and truncation,
etc. You are acquainted with the well documented history of the Mississippi River delta. By contrast, you are being given a bird's eye view
of the history of the Rio Grande delta. All these are a part of sedimentology and stratigraphy. They are a part of our needed tools tools with which we must find hidden reservoirs which might contain
petroleum and natural gas reserves. We are all aware that new potential
reservoirs are increasingly more difficult to find, but that is our job.
In the past we have all been inclined to live with our special
branch of geOlogy, often almost to intolerance of other branches. By
necessity we are becoming more aware of the desirability of the integrating of data from the several branches of geology.
Whether our interest lies in geophysics, ecology, electric logs,
general stratigraphy. paleontology. etc., we need the collateral information from other interests if we are to make the best possible interpretations.
This field trip is an attempt on the part of T. D. Cook and his
hard working associates to start the field trip ball rolling for interdiciplinary cooperation in sedimentology and stratigraphy, both Recent and
ancient. May this be only the first of a series of such Recent and near
Recent cooperative projects.

coastal counties and the government to fill the portion of
Corpus Christi bayfront from Water Street to the present
Shoreline Boulevard and the bayfront of Rockport. The
fill that was dredged from the bottom of the bays contained
a large number of Pleistocene mammal bones. The shoreline
deltaic sediments are Montgomery (Oberlin) in age and these
fossils are believed to be of this same age. Thick-shelled
clams found in Corpus Christi fill could have been Pleistocene or from the recent bay surface.

feet deep one-half mile from the south end of the Indian
Point Peninsula and winds southeast to near Flour Bluff.
At this point the valley may have a depth of from 80' to
100'. The valley is about one mile wide. South of Portland and in the northern part of the bay is a broad
terrace. This probably represenis a valley cut by a previous entrenchment. Very little information is available
about this terrace.

STOP I

Oyster reef

Leave cars and walk to end of road where we will examine
an oyster reef and observe the various organisms which make
up the reef association. Wade out into the water a short
distance where you can feel the oysters in growth position
(standing upright on attached edge of shell). If you like
seafood at 9:30 a.m. open a shell and try one of Corpus
Christi's oysters - they are small but good; many an oyster
stew had it's start at this locality.
Commentator here will be Dr. Howard T. Odum. A written
discussion of this stop will be found on page 27.

Fulton Beach. We have been driving along the northwest
shore of Aransas Bay on sediments deposited along the mud
flats and wave terrace. The Pleistocene barrier island has
been on our right. The modern barrier island (St. Joseph
Island) is approximately 6 miles southeast.
A bathymetric chart of the bays in this vicinity will be
found on Plate SA. This is the area where a great deal of
work was conducted for API project 51 by scientists at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Those interested in
additional data on the Recent of this area are referred to
the Bibliography which lists some of the important works
from that project.
Sediments in Aransas Bay are predominantly silty clay with
minor amounts of slightly coarser clastics near shore.
Oyster reefs are common, especially near the eastern end
where Aransas Bay and Copano Bav meet. See Plate 8A for
map of sediment distribution in this area.

of Texas related to the departments ~f Bacteriology, Botany,
,Chemistry, Geology, Physics, Zoology and Meteorology Division of Aeronautical Engineering at the Main University at
Austin. The permanent staff are primarily concerned with
basic research, with a general. emphasis on functional processes in marine environments. During the summer, courses
are given at the Institute for a few selected seniors and
graduate students with serious interest in the sea.
During the visit to the Institute the members of the field·
trip will be shown the offices and laboratories and observe
exhibits and demonstrations specially prepared to illustrate
the geological aspects of the work in progress at the Institute. A large net suspended in the Pass will be periodically
withdrawn to show the group the kinds of animals migrating
between the Gulf of Mexico and the inner baysa.

Interdistributary Basin.

The small scarp borders the dry basin of Tule Lake which
was artifically drained. This flat represents the floor
of an interdistributary basin, and the low scarp is the
result of wind and wave erosion along the inland margin.
Road has been built up slightly across the basin floor.
The interdistributary basin, which is pe-rhaps the most
widespread of the deltaic plain environments, is the lowland between distributaries. Sediments are normally clay
and silt and are deposited primarily during flood stages.
Often the lower limits of these basins are covered by
shallOW marine waters.

Oeltaic Sedimentation

We are standing on a point bar deposit:developed when
the large loop of Town Resaca which nearly surrounds this
park was migrating northward. The sediments deposited
within this meander loop and others like it over the
entire delta are predominantly sando
Speaker at this stop will be Dr. Marcus Ao Hanna.
Written material on the Rio Grande delta can be found on
pages 52 and 55. The aerial photograph (Plate 19) shows
many of the physiographic features characteristic of a
deltaic plain. Mineralogy of sands from the Rio Grande
province is shown in Plate 20 along with a comparison of
grain size variations of point bar and barrier island
sands.

Historical Monument; inscription reads, "These Palmito
pilings are the remains of the Boca Chica crossing of
the railroad from Boca Chica Inlet to White's Ranch on
the Rio Grande. Begun by General Frances H Herron,
U. S. A., in 1864 and completed in 1865 by General
Phillip H. Sheridan for the transportation of military
supplies 0"
"The Cypress piling 1,000 feet north are what remain
of a floating bridge constructed across Boca ChicH
Inlet by General Zachary Taylor in 1846 as a part of
the road from Brazos Santiago to the White Ranch landing
at Clarksville on the Rio Grande for transportation of
military supplies."
Clarksville was a small settlement near the mouth of
the Rio Grande destroyed by the hurricane of October 8,
1867.

Boca Chica Island and Mouth of Rio Grande.

Because busses cannot drive on the sand we shall be
unable to take the group to the mouth of the river
which empties into the Gulf of Mexico 1.8 miles south
of this point.
Dr. Alan Lohse wi 11 discuss the Rio Grande Delta at
this stop. A written discussion can be found on page 55.
Examine beach and dune sands for the very distinctive
heavy mineral suite. Dunes often show crossbedding very
well, especially when wet, due to heavy mineral streaks.
Plate 20A shows the mineralogy of the sands of the Rio
Grande province and Plate 21 shows the distribution of
heavy mineral suites along the Texas Coast as well as
grain size analysis of beach samples. Plate
shows
a grain size analysis from this locality.
Main pass from Laguna Madre to Gulf is now maintained by
engineers at Brazos Santiago for the Brownsville ship
channel, four miles north of here. The barrier island
beach continues uninterrupted except by works of mand
north for 130 miles and south from the mouth of the Rio
Grande for 140 miles.

Buena Vista Mudflats.

Commentator here will be Dr. Alan Lohse.
This mudflat is typical of hundred of square miles of
similar environment along the western side of the
lagoonal basin. This is predominantly a subaerial
environment, but it is subjected to innundation by
lagoonal waters at irregular intervals and under
special meteorological conditions. This mudflat includes approximately 4,000 acres of land, most of which
is less than 1.0 foot elevation. All of the land
except a small fringe along the toe of the mainland
bluff has come into existence since about 1856. Its
growth has been reconstructed in detail from survey
data, geological cores, and the geochronologic record
of varved sediments. A unique characteristic of the
mudflat environment is the algal mat, which often extends
unb~oken over thousands of acres.
See also Geochronology, etc., page 61 and Buena Vista
Mudflat, page 58.

LIVE OYSTER REEF ASSOCIATION
STOP I - FIRST DAY
Howard T. Odum l
What to look for:
Wade out several feet and pick up some of the oyster rilumps (near
shore the clumps are mainly small since there has been a lot of oyster
picking). You will find living associations including the following:
Principle reef formers which are fi ltering the bay water for food:
Dominant oy&ter, CrassQstrea virginica
Dominant ba,rnacle, Balanaus ehurneus
Bryozoa coating all other animals

(purple muscle scar)
(chunky, calcareous base)

Associatf,,9, organisms
Polychaete worms, carnivores (red segmented, short parapodia);
Xanthid mud crabs, carnivores (black tipped fingers); Stone crab, carnivore
(large pinchers, purple color).
Reef Structure and Function:
-The oyster association and similar molluscan reef depositions are
worldwide and occur in many geological ages. The species composition varies
from place to place and time to time but the overall structure and way of
life have been similar.
The oyster reef is a calcareous structure of loose and consolidated
shells of live animals living upon a structure of previous dead ones. The
position of the reef permits the animals to filter strong currents for food.
The reef shape helps to funnel the current (Hedgepeth, 1957). Unli~e some
coral reefs of the tropics, the oyster reef is not .elf supporting and requires large volumes of water containing plankton ind detritus derived from
plant growth. A reef requires a larger area of bay environment for its support.
It ,re:quires a current to carry off the feces (Lund, 1957), to prevent the great
respiration from using up the oxygen, and to bring adequate food. Although
algae are present in the shallow zones, the algal growth in deeper reefs is
minor compared to the animal growth. Many associated organisms live with
the oysters because of the abhndant food that is doncentrated by the oysters.
The rich organic matter in the fecal pellets, the hidipg places, and the
opportunity for parasitism or symbiosis provide many ecological niches.

lInstitute of M.arine Science, Port Aransas, Texas

- 27 -

It is a mistake, however, to think of particular species as associated
organisms of a reef. Puffer and Emerson, (1953) for example, present a particular list of organisms for a reef association at one time in Texas bays. The
reef which is located below the Nueces bay causeway is different taxonomically.
Ladd et al (1957) describes other variations.
The Role of Salinity:
Reefs of the East coast low salinity type with Crassostrea virglnica
occur only from 5 to 25 parts per thousand. The oyster can sometimes live at
higher salinities of the open sea (35 parts per thousand) but IS rapidly consumed by oyster drills and by parasites including the micro-organism
Dermacystidium. In the low salinity waters, the Crassostrea can grow with
less in(effe~ence. The reefM in Nueces Bay came alive suddenly last year when
the rains came to Texas and the bay salinity dropped from 45 to 15 parts per
thousand. There is nothing more dramatic in the recent fossil record than
the difference between the buried Crassostrea beds of the low salinity bays
and the shell of the Mulinia and Anomaiocaridum of the high salinity "bays
(Laguna Madre and Baffin Bay). Caution must, however, be used in extending
such interpretat\ons to the past beyond the recent times. Closely related
species of oysters are adapted to making reefs in high salinity waters.
The high salinity oyster of the Texas coast Ostrea eguestris was found
alive in place of Crassostrea virginica (Parker, 1955) during the high salinity
period. Some of these are alive in the area under the bridges, but they are
minor (clear colored muscle scar, tooth-like ridges along one margin).
Q. eguestris apparently is better adapted to survive in the high salinity
conditions, but it does not reach the quantitative dominance of~. virginlca.

MONTGOMERY - INGLESIDE SCARP
STOP II - FIRST DAY
Theodore D. Cook

l

What to Look for:
Notice that at about this point the highway begins a gradual descent
from the Montgomery (Pleistocene-Obelin) deltaic surface over which we have
been traveling to the lower surface of the Ingleside lagoonal facieso The
land ahead becomes damp with numerous ponds and is covered by a thick grass
mat (bunch grass - salt grass - sachuiestal) and mesquite growth. Geologist
mapping the young sediments of the Gulf Coastal Plain make use of these scarps
and vegetation changes in determining contracts.
Geological Significance:
Following the deposition of Montgomery deposits on the Gulf Coast
sea level was lowered due to the glacial advances of the Early Wisconsin or
Iowan stage and a period of erosion followed during which some Montgomery
sediments were removed. During the Bradyan interglacial stage which followed
sea level once again rose but probably not quite to its former level. At this
time (Pleistocene - Eunice) the Ingleside sediments were deposited under conditions very similar to what we have at the present. A barrier island separated
the marine environments from the bays and lagoons in this area while deltaic
deposition was progressing at the heads of bays in drowned river valleys.
The Live Oak Barrier, which we shall visit later in the day is the
product of strandline sedimentation at this time. The clays which comprise
the lowland soils just ahead were deposited in bays and lagoons behind the
barrier island. Wave action along the inland shore of these bays eroded
additional Monigomery sediment and helped to form the scarp visible here.
This scarp, therefore, .marks the surface trace of the Eunice unconformity
which separates the Ob~rlin and Eunice.
MONTGOMERY - EUNICE CONTACT, SCARP
AND INGLESIDE SHORELINE TERRACE
W. Armstrong Price 2
There was a marked erosional retreat of the Eunice shoreline at the
time of the beginning of the Ingleside Barrier. The late Eunice sea destroyed
early Eunice deltas, forming erosional bluffs in places, with the subsequent
formation of the Ingleside Barrier at varying distances offshore. This may be
explained by normal local revisions of the shoreline that occur along deltaic
coasts. Barrier islands normally occur between flanks of adjacent deltas and
the irregular growth rates of these deltas affect the growth or erosion of the

associated barriers. Also, oscillations of sea level with concurrent differential regional warping and differential degrees of local sinking may
result in a new high-level deltaic shoreline that is not alway~ parallel to
the last preceding high-level shoreline or to older formation contacts.
MONTGOMERY DELTAIC AND LAGOONAL DEPOSITS
STOP III - FIRST DAY
What to look for:
The outcrop southwest of Bayside shows sediments from two different
environments of deposition and their gradational contact.
The upper 4 to 5 feet are dark brown sandy clay with occasional
thin silt laminae, abundant calcareous nodules, rootlets, thin shelled land
snails. This unit grades downward into 5 to 6 feet of light tan-amber clay,
slightly sandy, waxy, with abundant gypsum.
Along the strike to the west the beds equivalent to this lower horizon
contain fossil oyster beds with specimens often preserved in growth position.
In the bluffs along Copano Bay at Bayside this horizon contains oysters,
small clams and common to abundant foraminifers (Rotalia biccari and
Elphidium gunteri).
Geologic significance:
The lower, fossiliferous. gypsiferrous unit clearly represents
deposition in a bay or lagoon. Similar sediments can be observed in cores
and cuttings throughout the Tertiary section.
The upper, brown sandy clay seems to be the product of deposition
on a deltaic plain, probably in a marsh or swamp environment.
The sequence involved is very similar to that which has taken place
during the last one or two hundred years at the new mouth of the Colorado
River which has built its deltaic plain out over the lagoonal sediments of
Matagorda Bay.
Our ability to determine environmental changes in the subsurface such
as we see here is often a definite aid in problems of correlation and geologic
history.

What to look for:
Along the small drainage ditch on the west side of the road are
exposed one or two feet of sediments deposited in the lagoon behind the
Live Oak Barrier. These sediments are brown clay, soft, noncalcareous,
bentonitic, and non-fossiliferous. They contain B large number of fairly
large calcareous nodules which can be observed along the ditch weathered
from the outcrop.
Southward is Port Bay, an arm of Copano Bay, where Recent brackish
water sediments lie unconformably on the Pleistocene. The contact is rather
difficult to pick on the surface but is quite evident in shallow cores.
Geological significance:
This surface is on what Price called the Ingleside Terrace, the
bay, lagoon and lake deposits laid down behind the Ingleside Barrier (Live
Oak Bar). These sediments were deposited during the Bradybn interglacial
stage when sea level was at approximately the same height (possibly slightly
higher) as at present. The Ingleside Terrace is preserved at many places
along the South Texas Coast between Baffin Bay and the Colorado River.
Eastward it was covered by penecontemporaneous deltaic masses which prograded southward, filling the old lagoons.
Because of the lack of any brackish water forams this clay is
interpreted as having been deposited well back in the bay or lagoon possibly
on a shoreline mud flat.

PLEISTOCENE BARRIER ISLAND
(LIVE OAK BARRIER)
STOP V - FIRST DAY

I
I
I

What to look for:
The lithology here is a very clean quartz sand, nearly white in
color, with maximum grain size .220 mm (fine), medium grain size .130 mm
(fine), and sorting coefficient of 1.15 (very well sorted); grains are
sub-angular and no fauna is noted in the upper part of the section but
shell fragments and a few littoral foraminifers are noted several feet
below the surface. Notice the linear nature of this sand body and its
marked elevation over the surrounding country.
Geological significance:
The section at this locality is the product of deposition on a
barrier island during the late Pleistocene (Bradyan interglacial) and the
feature plus its extensions from Baffin Bay to Matagorda Bay has been called
the "Live Oak Bar" by Price l (1930) who first recognized iti genesis.
Barriers of the same age can be traced south as far as Baffin Bay and northeastward into Louisiana. Eastward from the Brazos-Colorado ·aelta the barrier
became stranded on the deltaic plain when late Bradyan bay-head deltas prograded seaward, filling the bays and lagoons and built their delta surfaces
out into the marine waters in front of the barriers. None of the deltas
south of the Colorado. except, perhaps, the Nueces, appear to have prograded
to the barrier since it is everywhere flanked on its updip edge by unburied
lagoonal sediments of the same age.
Large breaks in the linear continuity of the Live Oak barrier occupied
by drowned valleys such as Corpus Christi and Copano Bays resulted from erosion associated with the lowering of sea level during late Wisconsin glaciation.
Plate 6 shows two cross sections thru this barrier based on boring
data. Maximum thickness of the sand appears to be 60'± and the data presented
indicate a gradation into brackish clay and marl updip and to clay downdip.
Sea level during deposition of these sediments must have been close to that of
the modern since the top of this barrier (including the dunes) reaches to about
30 feet, the same height as dunes on Matagorda and Padre islands and the
associated lagoonal bottoms stand very close to the present day sea level.

The vegetation is typical of most of the small islands in the area.
Notice the difference in the slope of the beach at different points of the
island and the types of sediments. Dig down into the sediments at several
points. Notice the layering of sand and shell. See the different layers
and areas of black materials, reddish brown materials and the grey colored
sand. Notice the different types of animal burrows and note the type of
sediment. Dig around the burrows to see the difference between a burrow
in a black reduced sediment and the grey oxidized sediment. Inspect the

Stop~

The station is a small island about 200 meters wide and 300 meters
long. The area near bridge 5 on the east side consists of shell and sand.
The beach here dips fairly sharply toward the channel running under the
bridge. Many of the shells are intact and represent the mollusks living
in Aransas Bay. The reticulate shelled clam Chione cancellata is particularly abundant in the area. Shells collected here can be identified by
comparison with the collection at the Institute of Marine Science which is
the following station. The shell and sand blends into fine sand as one
walks away from the bridge towards the south. A unicellular algal mat of
diatoms, flagellates and blue green algae coats parts of the beacho Digging
in the sediment reveals layers of silt and Clay. Organic debris is also
common in the form of wrack, windrows, and surface coatingso Burrows of the
fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, the ghost crab. Ocipoda albicans, and the hermit crab, Agurus floridanus. are common. Many snail shells, especially
Polynices duplicatum are inhabited by the hermit crab.
Plants grow on the higher parts of the island. The fleshy branched
plant is Salicornia. The reed-like grass is Sporobolus. The flat bladed
grass which also is found in water is Spartinao Spartina growing in water
around the periphery of the island traps water-born particulate matter and
fine sediment and in this way increases the size of the island by accretion.
These plants are typical of the vegetation on most of the iSlands located
in the shallow bays of this area.
During the summer months a constant southeast wind prevails with an
average velocity of 15 mph. During the winter, at approximately two week
intervals, n~rth winds which occasionally have velocities appro~ching 70
~ph, and last several days, produce high tides which alter the size and
shape of the islands.

The sediment on western shores of the island usually consist of
sand and shell. The sediment on the eastward facing beaches is finer and
the seaward slope more gradual. Lamination of the sediment i& more pronounced on the eastern beaches and the sand softer or less resistant underfoot because of the larger content of organic matter. Wind derived currents
float organic debris (usually marine plants) to the eastern side of the islands during summer. During the late summer when the largest amount of
organic matter is present the sand is extremely soft and has a thixotrophic
effect whereby the sand becomes fluid when agitated and then solidifies when
the agitation ceases. Sand fluidity caused by gentle up and down movement
of the foot in some foreshore areas demonstrates this principle. During
winter the supply of organic matter to the beaches is low and the bacteria
alter existing organic matter thus producing a firmer sand.
Small irregular areas of reddish-brown and black sediment are common
in the sediments on these beaches. The black color is usually caused by the
acti vi ties of sulfate reducing bacteria. These organisms gr-ow in anaerobic
conditions usually caused during the decomposition of organic matter trapped
in the sediment and reduce sulfate to sulfide. The sulfide produced reacts
with iron in the sediment to form black iron sulfide. Iron sulfide is
thought to be a step in the formation of pyrite. The reddish-brown material
is iron hydroxide and considered to be an oxidation product of iron sulfide.
Oxidation of the iron sulfide commences after the organic matter has been
decomposed and bacteria 1 action slowed. Iron hydroxide often lines burrows
of animals penetrating anaerobic sediment. Evidently the animal is able to
alter the sediment adjacent to the hole.
Oyster reefs may be observed on the mud flats during low tide on
either side of the causew~y. They are especially evident on the right side
ofhridge nwnber 6. Lack of parking facilities makes this area inaccessible
during this trip •. The predominant oyster is Crassostrea 'virginica which is
eatable and sold commercially. Barnacles, bryozoa. clams. snails are part
of an oyster community.
Grass flats 6f Turtle grass (Thalassia) and Eel grass (Diplanthra)
form thick beds on either side of the causeway but are inaccessible without
a boat or waders because of distance from land and softness of sediment.
This vegetation is a major source of food for the invertebrates and fish
of the ~rea and also serves as a sediment trap.

Fish Scales, Teeth, and Hardparts
Demonstrator: Thomas Hellier l
The hardparts of fish are finding more and more use as environmental indicators and occasionally as stratigraphic markers. An
Icthiologist studying Recent fishes also finds their hardparts useful.
For example, scales and fish spines are u~eful in estimating age for some
species. The number of vertebra in the back-bone of a fish have been
found to vary with water temperature. Teeth are usually the part of a
fish most easily preserved. Use of heavy liquid separation techniques
have revealed the presence of small microscopic fish teeth and teeth
fragments in many geologic strata.

In this exhibit the method of determining the age of a fish using
scales and otoliths will be demonstrated. An exhibit of fish teeth is
designed to show the difference in the structure of teeth from several
fish groups and also variation encountered in teeth from a single fish.
Tooth morphology and arrangement may be used to interpret the type food
the fish eats and its place in the food chain as either a herbivore,
carnivore, or omnivore. Certain teeth arrangements are adapted for
grubbing in soft bottoms or scrapping algae off rocks. Finding such
teeth as fossils would give insight as to the nature of the substratum.

Maintenance of life is dependent upon a source of energy. The
machines of civilization are likewise dependent on an energy source. In
both instances the ultimate source of this energy is the sun. An important
task for the modern ecologist is the study of the paths by which this solar
energy arrives at its ultimate destination. The sea grasses and plant
plankton store solar energy as carbohydrates and proteins. Part of this
energy is transferred to man as seafoods vital to the economy of the area
bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Of vast importance to man is that portion
of the plant crop buried millions of years ago now available in the form
of petroleum.

A component of all plants capable of photosynthesis is chlorophyll.
Fairly accurate estimates of the amount of solar energy used by plants can
be made by determining the amount of chlorophyll in the plant. This is done
by extracting chlorophyll from the sample and then measuring the color intensity of the green extract. Accumulation of data concerning the amount of
energy used by various marine plant communities is a vital first step in
understanding the mechanism by Which the sun's energy is tranferred and made
available to man.
In this exhibit various steps in the method of extracting chlorophyll
from plants and sediments will be shown. The processes of degradation of
chlorophyll in sediment and the spectra of plant pigments as marine plants
die and become fossils will be demonstrated.

Geological Aspects of Marine Algae
Demonstrator:

J. T. Conover

1. Fossil Reef Rock from Atlantic Sea Peaks: The fossil coralline
reef-building algae as seen in thin sections are composed of algae, forams.
sponge spicules and mollusk shells in a ground matrix. The presence of the
algal organisms provides some evidence that the tops of these sea peaks
were at or near the surface of the sea where sufficient light was available
to support plant life. The data are insufficient to provide a probable age
for the sea peak communities but both algae and forams are believed to be
late Cretaceous to very early Tertiary. One significant fact about this
reef complex is that calcareous algae make up 75% of the reef rock. Algae
are known to contribute 60 to 80% of the materials in living reefs in the
Atlantic and Pacific basins. Before the Permian, massive reefs were not
~nown in the geologic record.
The presence of red coralline algae, so
important as reef binders and builders in living reefs today, are only
known from the Mesozoic to the present time. Hence the existence of massive
reefs is generally associated with the presence of coralline algae. Some of
the most important oil bearing bioherms in the world belong to the massive
reef type. The sea peaks of the Atlantic are apparently the products of
volcanism according to the assays of the reef rock base. Further studies
may show arcs of volcanism are a Iso

North America, similar to those on the eastern seaboard of Asia.

point which gains emphasis when closely allied forms in the fossil and
living record are found associated with rather specific estuarine habitats.
Through such parallels some additional knowledge of past environments may
be gained.
3.

Display of Living Marine Algae and Marine Grasses:

A display of dried mounts provides some understanding of the diversity
of form complexity, and habit of the dominant marine plants on the Gul£_ Coast.
This display is purposely grouped to show which forms are found in the inter~
tidal and subtidal zones on the open coast, zones and estuarine embayments.
Most of these plants have ephemeral parts and do not fossilize well. The
organisms may be preserved in the fossil record as casts, i~pri~ts; and
peat deposits and these have stratigraphic significance. Some algae especially the blue-greens are believed to be a most important contributing
source of petroleum.
4.

Blue-Green algae:'

Calothrix confervoides is the species common on ~he tops of rocks in
the spray zone and on the top of the Port Aransas jetty. These organisms are
believed to be responsible for many so-called algal limestone deposits in the
geologic record ~ • • • including lenticular masses in pre-Cambrian rocks.
The very considerable accumulations of these plants as sheets of living matter
in the bottoms of Texas bays suggests a possible source of petroleum. Knowledge concerning the presence of blue-green alga~ in the fossil record remains
controversial because cellular matter is not known to be preserved; only
precipitated calcium carbonate accumulations are algal, bacterial or purely
physical-chemical in origin.

Marine Bacteria
Demonstrator:

Carl H. Oppenheimer

Marine bacteria, although seldom found as fossils. are perhaps the
most abundant inhabitant of the sea and the sediments. The manner in which
they affect sediments in various environments may be used to infer the
presence of similar bacteria in like environments in the geological past.
The determination of their role in decomposition of organic matter and in
the formation of oil has been the object of co~siderable research.
In the present exhibit living marine bacteria will be shown under a
high power phase microscope. The diversity and abundance of the bacteria
should be of interest to geologists who have not seen them before. The phase
microscope through which the bacteria will be viewed is the most modern means
of studying these forms and will interest the connoisseur of fine instruments.

LIVING LITHOPHILIC INTERTIDAL PLANT AND ANIMAL COMMUNITIES
RELATED TO THE PALEOECOLOGICAL RECORD
STOP VII-B - FIRST DAY
.1 oh n T. Conover 1
What to Look for:
Along the rock riprap one notices a distinct stratification of
living organisms. The zones occupied by plants and animals differ in
coloration largely due to the pigments of the attached plants. In the
uppermost of salt-spray zone rock surfaces are discolored by black and
The black ones are blue-green 81g8e such as C810thrix
brownish patches
and Lyngbia. The brown patches are populations of the primitive red alga,
Bangia fuscopurpureB. These algal patches increase in size and density
toward the Gulf end of the jetty where wave action and spray become more
intense. Below this zone is an upper intertidal belt dominated by barnacles, a few scattered limpets and littorine snails. An occasional plant
of Ulva or Porphyra may be present but are much more abundant in lower
horizons. Next, in the mid-littoral zone, below the barnacles, one sees
a community composed of the red alga, Porphyra 1eucosticta, a thin winecolored leafy form, and two grass-green hair-like forms, Enteromorpha
lingulata and Cladophora fasicularis. In the warm months these species are
mostly replaced by the rust-colored red alga, Centrocerus clavulatum. Two
common hermit crab species, bryozoans and some sponges are present here.
Limpets and Littorines may be observed in large numbers feeding on algae.
The large gastropod, Thais, is very conspicuous in this ~zone. Below this
community is the lower intertidal belt, which has a distinctive deep-winered coloration imparted by the algae Bryocladium and Gelidium. These forms
develop a luxurious moss-like carpet within which a host of animals may be
found. Caprellids, isopods, several species of Crabs, bryozoans, and a few
sponges are commonly associated with the algal mat. On the protected surfaces and undersides of rocks, sponges and sea anemonies are usually seen.
Near the end of the jetty these communities are much more extensive due to
the greater surge of the sea swells and uniform salinities. Beneath the
intertidal belt one may reach down and bring up a number of red algae including Hypnea, Agardhiella and Gracilaria, three cartilagenous, branched
forms. Here also the brown algae Padina and Dictyota become prominent in
late spring and summer. To the seaward, other red algae appear below low
water such as Corallina, Jania and Lithothamnion. These species are related
to calcareous algae which are important reef builders. In the zone dwell
several species of crabs, brittle stars and increasing numbers of hydroids
and sponges. Sea urchins are found on the undersides of rocks near the end
of the jetty. On the southern side of the jetty one will notice all zones
are wider and the number of intertidal animals less than inside the pass.
A much more extensive incrusting community of coralline algae occurs on the
south side where salinities are more uniform.

Lithophilic Communities in the Fossil Record
Lithophilic communities or assemblages of plants and"animals have
been reported from time to time in the fossil record especially with regard to bioherms. The ecotones or environmental aspect of the original
community are often obliterated or rendered difficult to interpret in the
fossil record due to alteration processes. By studying only the fossil
record attempts to reconstruct or visualize life in marine littoral communities of the past is not only an arduous task but may be impossible to
resolve intelligently. One approach to this problem in recent years has
been to compare both the fossil and living assemblages of plants and animals.
A study of a living reef or rockbottom community has considerable value in
this respect. Already such parallel studies and comparisons have revealed
a good many facts heretofore unrecognized in paleoecological investigations.
The Port Aransas Jetty as an

Environment~

The Gulf coast from Freeport, Louisiana, to the mouth of the Rio
Grande consists almost exclusively of a series of barrier islands fronting
a series of shallow coastal bays. The seaward reach of these barrier islands
is a nearly unbroken sandy beach area with almost no solid substrate at the
water's edge for the attachment of lithophilic plants and animals. The only
solid substrate that does exist in the littoral zone along this coast line
are stone jetties extending into the Gulf in the vicinity of controlled passes
located at the eastern end of most of the bays. Exceptions are the pass at
Port Isabel and the sea walls such as the one at Galveston Island. Communities on the stone jetties at the mouth of passes provide environments of
considerable variability. The seasonal changes in salinity and temperature
fluctuate much more in the passes than in the open Gulf water. For this
reason the plants and animals occupying the slopes of the jetties inside
the passes are living under conditions quite different from those communities living on the opposite sides of the riprap exposed to the open Gulf
water. Not only do species populations exhibit different preferences of
habitat between these two sides of the riprap but the physiological behavior
of the organisms. e.g. growth rate of plants. differ markedly_
SAlinities have been shown to vary as much as 8 to 35 parts per
thousand (0/00) in the passes. The water outside the passes by contrast var
ies between 28 and 35 0/00. Cold spells have been known to seriously affect
li~e in the shalloW bays where temperatures have been recorded below freezing
(0 C). In the beach and offshore water rarely have water temperatures been
measured below 4°C. The tidal range at Port Aransas is small, from 1.5 to 2
feet. The change in water level and the time of occurrence are also irregular.
It is believed that the water level in the bays is largely controlled by winds
stress while that of the open Gulf is more strongly influenced by the solar
and lunar forces. In the passes the daily change in water level appears to
be intermediate between the bay and Gulf tidal and wind-controlled complex.
Since the tidal amplitude is low along the jetties organisms which normally
occur in regions with larger tidal amplitudes and tolerate much longer daily
exposure periods may not flourish in this region. The zones or spaces

occupied by various organisms are greatly compressed due to the small daily
change in water level. Since under these conditions the requirements for
a given species population are optimum in very narrow belts in the intertidal region the communities as a whole are not extensive.
Another factor peculiar to the Gulf coast is the occurence of very
high turbidities especially in the summer months when the wind is' from the
southwest. The turbidity is due to the presence of C
Hnd silts in suspension which have been brought out of the bays and deposited in and near
the mouths of the passes. Due to the prevailing southwesterly wind during
the warm months clay and silty particles are kept largely in suspension by
the rolling affect of the wind-waves.
Below 8 or 10 feet plant life on the stone jetty is poorly developed
and animal communities are reduced in number. Light is greatly reduced in
the turbid water. It seems probabl~ that plants which would normally live
at greater depth in clear water are unable to maintain themselves in such an
environment. Beyond the breaker line the Gulf water is much clearer and beds
of the brown alga, Sargassum filipendula are present at greater depths than
10 feet. During the winter months the water is much clearer because winds
blow from the north and east or northeast. Associated with the lower turbidity is a greater abundance of winter plant communities at greater depths than
in summer.
The animal and plant communities of Port Aransas jetties are conspicuously stratified presumably due to the complex of physical factors just
reviewed above. The chief factors are believed to be light, exposure L and
wave action. The individual requirements of each species population which
have adapted to certain zones or spaces along the jetty typifies the type of
selection which causes zonation. Some organisms wander, become established
over large areas in the intertidal belt while others are very narrowly
restricted to certain horizons. As one progresses from the inshore to the
offshore end of the jetty there is also a marked change in the composition of
the plant and animal communities. Certain forms remain, others drop out and
still others appear for the first time. The most important changes in the
environment from land to seaward end of the jetty are higher and more uniform
salinity. lower more uniform temperatures, and wave action.
The Jetty Communities and Their Structure:
At the inshore station, chosen for demonstration, the uppermost zone
in the intertidal belt inoludes very little l~fe other than the scampering
scavengers such as the common isopod, Ligyda exotica, horse flies, and a
few patches of blue-green algae including Calothrix and Lyngbia. The next
lower zone, washed for a brief period by the daily tide is colonized by
Balanus eburneus, a barnacle with a wide salinity tolerance, Littorina
ziczac, which ftppears like ~o much buck shot on algae and in cracks and
crevices, Siphonaria vaufragum, the common limpet, which increases in number
in the lower zones. A few plants of the winter species of alga,
leucosticta and a few patches of the moss-like Bangia fuscopurpurea appear

and masses of
filmy Porphyra cover the rocks as a
of the
early spring period on the Gulf coast. By summer, much of these plant communities will have gone and been replaced by a dominating red alga, CentIQ~ clavulatum and other forms characteristic of the warm months.
Pugurus
floridans and Clibinaris vittatus. both hermit crabs, will commonly be found
in this zone. Littorina irrorata. a lagoon form is frequently present in
the upper zones of the jetty. Thais floridana, a large, ribbed, gastropod
will be found feeding on algae in this and lower zones. Where the rocks are
exposed with little attached large algae, patches of brown scum way be observed. These are usually diatom ooze with myriads of both pennate and
circinate diatoms. Below this zone just described is an area which is only
exposed at low water. The community is dominated by Bryocladia cuspidata, a
moss-like, deep wine colored alga. Gelidium corneum, largely used for agar agar
extraction, is very abundant here. VIva fasciata reaches its optimum in this
zone as a green leafy form. Littorina ziczac, Thais floridana. the sea anemone,
Bunodosoma cavernata and various crabs including Petrolishes arma~us, Menippe
mercenaria and the hermit crabs are common scavengers in this belt. The lowermost zone is sublittoral being exposed only during unusually low tides. Among
the more conspicuous plants are Padina vickersii and Dictyota dichotoma,
Gracilaria verrucosa. in the warm months and Petalonia fascia in the winter
months. Hypnea and Agardhiella tenera also appears during the summer period
but are only present as diSC-like hold fasts during the winter period.
Crassostrea virginica is common. A few brittle stars may be found which are
more numerous on the seaward end of the jetty. A few blue crabs, Callinectes
sapidus can be found here. Tossed among the rocks and in the pass one may
observe numerous jelly fish such as Stomolophus (the cabbage head), Aurelia
and in the warm months Velella and Physalia. Bryozoa and sponges may be seen
in the lower zones, but these forms are more abundant near the seaward end
of the jetty.
As one moves toward the Gulf along the jetty, various forms drop out
or diminish and others take their place in the various zones. The distribution is apparently related to the temperature and salinity tolerance to which
~ach species population is capable of adjusting.

GULF OF MEXICO BEACH
At Port Aransas Jetties - Mustang Island
STOP VII-C - FIRST DAY

L. S. Kornicker l
What tn look for:

The beach visited at this stop is representative of present day
beaches bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Note the sand dunes at the landward edge of the beach; the backshore which dips gently landward separated
from the foreshore which dips seaward; the high tide drift line distinctly
marked by accumUlation of shells and debris; the numerous burrows perforating the upper beach; the sorting action of waves evident along the water's
edge.
Description of the Stop
The Gulf of Mexico sand beaches have a characteristic gentle slope.
The beach may usually be divided into a backshore and foreshore. The backshore gently dips landward whereas the foreshore dips seaward. A berm crest
which often consists of a ridge of shells. usually separates the backshore
from the foreshore. Another ridge forms at the high tide drift line. This
line is well marked by algal detritus, stranded jellyfish, and mollusk shells.
At the low tide level the beach usually dips almost imperceptibly more steeply seaward. T~e area between the low tide level and the berm crest and
sometimes as far back as the sand dunes which border the landward edge of
the beach is inhabited by the ghost crab, Ocypoda. This crab is nocturnal
and although abundant at night is rarely seen during the day. Most beach
burrows about an inch in diameter bordered by a small pile of sand on only
one side, usually seaward, are formed by this ghostly looking animal.
The area between low and high tide is considered in its narrowest
sense, the intertidal zone. The intertidal zone along the Gulf coast is
often thickly populated with the small and variably colored clam aptly
named Donax variabilis. These small animals have been observed emerging
from the sand in front of waves of an incoming tide to be swept shoreward,
where they dig into the sand when the wave recedes. The animals move back
with the receding tide.
Offshore the keyhole urchin, Mellita guinguesperforata, many clams
including several species belonging to the genus Arca, the scallop Pecten
amplicostata. and the large Dinocardium robustum, live in abundance. Their
shells usually accumulate on the beach. Pieces of the coral Astrangia
astraeformis and colorfUl snails such as Oliva sayana are oftenwashed:up
on the beach.

Compare the diversity of shells found on the gulf beach with the
paucity of species which occur on beaches bordering the hypersaline Laguna
Madre and Baffin Bay.
Sediments on the barrier beach are entirely sand with median
diameter falling at about .139 mm (see Plate 43). Sub-angular grains
usually greatly predominate and sorting is generally very good. Sands
extend downdip from the strand to 15 or 20 fathoms but with increasingly
larger amounts of finer clastics.

UPPER LAGUNA MADRE

an environment commonplace in the geologic past but extremely rare during

Description of the Stop:
The Upper Laguna Madre is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by
Padre Island, and from Copus Christi Bay by a land fill causeway. A semidry bar which extends across the Laguna Madre about 35 miles south of the
causeway forms the southern boundary of the Upper Laguna Madre and the
northern boundary of the Lower Laguna Madre. The Intracoastal W1lterway,
which is about 125 feet wide and 12 feet deep extends the full length of
the Laguna Madre. Red's Fish Camp is ~ituated on a small bay on the
western shore of the Upper Laguna Madre about four and one-half miles south
of the causeway.
The waters of the Laguna Madre have an extremely variable salinity
which has ranged from 27~2 to 76.4 parts per thousand during the past few
years in the Red's Fish Camp area. The vaTiable salinity is considered to
be the principle reason why so few species of invertebrates live in the
Laguna Madre. Those invertebrates which are able to survive the high and
variable salinity occur in great abundance. The only clams which have been
found living in the Laguna Madre are Mulinia lateralis Say, Anomalocardia
cuneimeris Conrad, Pseudocyrena floridana Conrad, Tellina tampaensis Conrad,
and Macoma brevi frons Say. Only the first two are abundant in the sediment.
The small Bittium varium is found living in vegetated areaso
The Laguna Madre is a major source of fish in Texas. Although
considerable speculation has been incited as to why this is so, scientific
investigation has not yet obtained an unequivocable answer.

Quartz sand probably transported from Padre Island by wind Bnd
water currents forms the major component of the bottom sediment of the
eastern side of the Laguna Madre. Fine sand, silt, and clay, containing
a large portion of shell debris and Foraminifera, underlies the western
side in the Red's Fish Camp area. Clay and silt is being deposited in
sedimentary structures which vary with season, wind velocity and direction,
and amount of rain. Mud-cracks, ripple marks, and rill marks are common.
Shell armored mud balls, seaballs of rolled marine plant, and hugh piles
of seaweed wrack are occasionally encountered. -Sediment dredged from the
Laguna Madre form large dykes along the beach in the Red 9 s Fish Camp area.
These contain a large variety of shells typical of the larger bays along
the Texas coast ,and not represented in the fauna now living in the Laguna
Madre.
The Laguna Madre has been found to contain ~elatively high concentrations of Hydrocarbons by Smith (See page 104). The overall photosynthesis is not greater than the world average but the total biotic
activity is restricted to a small thickness. The average size of the
fishes is larger than those in other bays.

PLEISTOCENE DELTAIC SEDIMENTS
STOP I - SECOND DAY
What to look for:
This expos~re on highway 70 at Petronilla Creek is made up entirely
of sediments laid down on the Montgomery deltaic plain.
Sediments are clays, brown to light tan, soft, very calcareous,
very sandy at top to slightly sandy below. The lighter colored clays contain a large amount of gypsum; one bed, just below the dark brown layer, is
very noticeable. The entire section has a large number of calcareous nodules,
some carbonaceous matter Bnd a few rootlets. Broken land snail shells and
reworked foraminifers Bre the only fauna.
Geological significance:
The Tertiary section in South Texas has many hundreds of feet of
material which look very much like the rocks exposed here. This is interpreted as having been deposited on the upper deltaic plain (away from the
coast) in lowlands away from any major distributaryo
This stream valley has been entrenched during the last one or two
lowerings of sea level.

also found southeast of Kingsville and continues southwest to the bank of

BAFFIN BAY

(Loyola Beach at County pier)
STOP III - SECOND. DAY
L. S. Kornicker l
What to look for:
Baffin Bay contains probably the highest salinity water in a marine
environment in North America. Only two clams live in this bay and their
shells are usually abundant along the beach. Note the abundance of barnacle and fish fragments. Land sna~l shells from the low cliffs bordering
the bay are found associated along with marine shells carried to shore by
waves and currents. A Pleistocene clay borders part of the bay in the
Loyola Beach area. The high salinity of the water may be ascertained by
taste.
Description of the Stop
Baffin Bay is the largest bay opening into the Laguna Madre. It
is about 18 miles long. 5 miles wide, and has an average depth of about
8 feet (See Plate 12). A reef formed by serpulid worms which are not living
in the area at the present time lies across the mouth of the bay and restricts interchange of water between the bay and the Laguna Madre. This
restriction of flow combined with a usually small inflow of meteoric water
has made the waters of Baffin Bay extremely saline. Baffin Bay is normally
more saline than the Laguna Madre. In Baffin Bay the salinity sometimes
reaches 80 parts per thousand which is lethal for many animals.
Loyola Beach is situated on the southern edge of the western end
of Baffin Bay. Large quantities of MuLinea lateralis Say and Anomalocardia
cuneimeris Conrad, which are the only two clams living in Baffin Bay,
accumulate along the shore of Loyola Beach. Mixed in with the clams are
land snails washed in from grass areas which parallel the shore. Barnacle
fragments are unusually abundant.
The sediments in the Loyola Beach area consist of a mixture of fine
quartz sand, shell fragments. and clay which is being eroded from bluffs
which crop out along the shore. Laminated leathery algal crust may be
observed along the beach and in shallow water.
Baffin Bay is of special interest because it has a restricted number
of species. The clams are dwarfed. The salinities of twice sea water are
responsible for restriction of types of organisms. The environment is high
in phosphorus and measurements show high rates of photosynthesis correlated
with high organic content of the sediments. High salinity does not cut down
total fertility.

THE SAND SHEET OF SOUTH TEXAS
STOP IV - SECOND DAY
Theodore Do Cookl
The sand sheet of South Texas has been mapped over approximately
2,800 square miles (parts of Willacy. Kenedy, Brooks, Hidalgo, and J1m Hogg

Counties - see Plate 1) and possibly should be mapped over a much larger
area (W. Armstrong Price, personal communication). This unusual sediment
accumulation is the result of eolian deposition during the Recent and probably also the late Pleistocene. Large areas of the surface are now stabilized by brush, grass, and live oak
ation but many active dune tracts
are observable. The air photo (Plate 15) shows the trend of these dunes to
parallel the direction of prevailing winds which blow from the southeast.
Bullard (1942), Lohse (1952 and 1955) and others have shown that
longshore drift is responsible for sediment transport in a southerly direction along the north Texas coast and in a northerly direction off of south
Texas. Wind energy is now generally considered to be primarily responsible
for these current directions. The opposing sediment-laden currents meet at
approximately 27° north latitude. Here they deposit large volumes of sand
and shell detritus which build up an extremely soft, almost impassable beacho
Winds then drive the sand from this source westward as barchan dunes. This
has resulted in the nearly complete filling of a 25-mile stretch of Laguna Madre
in recent years
Lohse ( 1955, po 101) states that "the present combination
of climatology, coastline configuration, coastal-drifting processes and
abundance of clastic sediments is of great importance in the formation of the
sand sheet," and further points out that this combination forms a "geologic
mechanism" which works continually to feed eolian sediments into the areao
0

Price has recognized an ear lier and much more w.idespread deve lopment
of the sand sheet than Lohse suggests, although he states (Price, 1933),
"This 'desert' area was formed by the drifting inland of the sand of the
Live Oak bar in the Recent period with the return of modern climate conditions after the last glacial (low sea-level) stageo" He also considers
"mainland sandy soils" as part of the source of the eolian sediment. In
another paper Price (1935) indicates "late Pleistocene" as the time of
formation of the sand plaine
Unfortunately much of the data accumulated by field work in the
sand sheet area is unpublished at this time.
Sands are white to pale tan, fine and very fine grained, very well
sorted, ~round to sub-angUlar, and essentia lly unconso lidated. Little data
are known regarding the thickness of the sand sheet. Lagoonal clays underlie the sands southeast of Sarita at a depth of 6 to 8 feeto In central

PLEISTOCENE RIO GRANDE
DELTAIC SEDIMENTS
STOP VI - SECOND DAY
What to look for:
Exposed along the south bank of the Arroyo Colorado are about
35 feet of Pleistocene sediments, mostly thin bedded silts and clays,
buff to pale tan and pink in color, containing a few broken megafossil
shells, rare ostracods, rare fish teeth, bone fragments. and a small
foraminiferal fauna including Rotalia beccari, Elphidium Spa and reworked forms. These sediments are best seen about where the trial
descends to the river and farther down stream.
Also notice the outcrop directly ahead as you go down the trial.
Here are river sediments deposited by the Arroyo Colorado probably in
late Recent. These are cross-bedded sands, silts and clays. This same
type of material is present along the trail almost up to the railroad
bridge up stream but the best exposures are at the bottom of the trial.
A small amount of Recent deltaic sediment is present at the'top
of the bluff. This is darker brown clay and silt, generally poorly
bedded and non-fossiliferous except for land snails.
Geological significance:
The Arroyo Colorado is a consequent stream on the Pleistocene
deltaic plain of the Rio Grande (see Plate 1). At one time during the
Recent it carried much of the slack water flow of the main stre~m and
due to its steeper gradient it has cut this deep channel. The river has
constructed low natural levees along its lower course and a small delta
along the shores of ~guna Madre. The course from here down stream has
been altered and deepened for navigational purposes. Headward erosion
of the Arroyo Colorado has been checked by a concrete dam near Mercedes.
The Recent deltaic material here was deposited in back swamps
and marshes on the upper deltaic plain.
Pleistocene sediments are probably the product of deposition in
interdistributarybasins on the lower portion of the deltaic plain in
areas covered by shallow marine waters such as the area which today lies
just north of the Rio Grande near its mouth (see Plate 19).
The sandy cross-bedded sediments in the middle of the valley were
laid down by the stream itself probably during the development of a small
meander loop. The deposit has been breached now by the stream and much
of it has been removed along the south bank.

RIO GRANDE DELTA
SECOND AND THIRD DAY STOPS
Theodore D. Cook l
Unfortunately very little detailed published information is avail
able regarding the Rio Grande Delta. The most extensive mater 1 available
(Lohse 1952) deals almost entirely with the shallow marine-prodelta-sediments.
Trowbridge (1932), Weeks (1945) and Price (l947) have made brief mention ~f
the delta features and sediments. Price has assembled additional data which
he is preparing for publication.
Exposed on the surface of parts of Willacy and Cameron Counties are
the deltaic plains of both the late Pleistocene and Recent deltas. On the
Recent plain in Texas parts of two (possibly also a third-earlier one) subdeltas are distinguishable. These two surfaces represent an early Recent
sub-delta to the north (Resaeas Fresnos and de los Cuates) and the modern
sub-delta farther south. A large sub-delta intermediate in age was formed
on the southern edge of the deltaic plain in Mexico. These sub-deltas
represent different periods of delta growth as the river shifted its course
and the deltaic plain prograded seaward. All of the Recent sub~deltas
appear to have formed since sea-level reached its present position about
5,000 years ago (LaBlanc and Bernard 1954).
There is little doubt that the northern-most of the Recent subdeltas extended much farther seaward than its present limits, the shores of
Laguna Madre. Well developed distributary ridges now built up by clay dune
growth extend into the lagoon in a general northeast direction. The 10
fathom contour in the Gulf of Mexico outlines features which may well be
extensions of similar features although Price (personal communication)
favors a sand .bar interpretation for these northeast-treading ridges. No
borings are available to determine the sedimentary history of these gulfbottom features. At sha llow depths below the floor of Laguna Madre and
beneath Padre Island, stiff, brown, oxidized clays which may well be from
the Recent delta are encountered (see Rusnakus report, p. ~l). Radiocarbon dating of these sediments ~Te lacking at this time.
Once a sub-delta is abandoned by the major stream and no longer
receives a large amount of new sediments, wind and waves begin to alter its
surface. Compaction of the large volume of clays, along with the erosion,
causes subsidence, and the sea transgresses the former delta surface. On
this northern-most sub-delta these conditions, along with the growth of the
barrier island and the rigorous action of the northers blowing down Laguna
Madre. have a llowed the lagoona 1 waters to occupy a large .port ion of the
former deltaic plain.
Fisk (1952) and many others have thoroughly described the sediments and physiography of the Mississippi delta and from these data have
constructed the history of delta building. The vast number of surface
observations, bore holes, and age determinations necessary for such an

understanding are not available to Os at this time for the Rio

nde de Ita.

The fact that what we see on the s
ce, however, is similar in
many ways to the Mississippi delta leads us to believe that the Rio Grande
has undergone similar development, altered only by the volume of water
carried, the sediment load, and the local oceanographic conditions of the
Gulf of Mexico at the riverQs mouth,
Deltaic surfaces are composed mainly of distributary channels which
carry the sediment-laden waters, the natur~l levees whith are built along
the banks during successive flood stages, and the large interdistributary lowlands which are covered with marsh vegetation. Sediments in the channels are
predominantly sand; on the levees, finer sand and silt; in the marshes, predominantly silt and clay. This is exactly what we see on the delta of the
Rio Grande.
Once sediments reach the Gulf, the principal distributive agents are
long-shore currents, Lohse (op, cit.) has described this aspect of Rio Grande
sedimentation.
To examine ~ll the physiographic features on this vast surface
would require a longer trip than we are prepared to make. During our excursion this year, however, we shall observe the narrow distributaries, the
levees, the more expansive interdistributary basins, and the pro-delta
deposits {as far out as you wish to wade). It is not, then, too difficult
to visualize the stratigraphic section this type of seBimentation would develop in the geologic record.

STOP VIII - SECOND DAY

What to look for:
We are on a point bar deposit of Town Resaca deposited when the
meander loop was migrating northward. The upper portion of the point
bar deposit is fine sand and silt which is exposed in the park. Some
crossbedding can be seen locally, especially near the swimming pool on
the west side. Here the channel of the resaca is about 150 feet wide
although it may have been altered somewhat during landscaping of this
area.
GAO] ogi ca I Si gntfica nee:
Through the works of Russell & Russell, Fisk, Friedkin and others
(see Bibliography) we can become fairly familiar with the type of sedimentation found -in a meander b~lt. There are three main envirnnments of
deposition, the channel, natural levee, and backswamp. Coarsest material
is found in the channel and finest in the backswamp which receives sediment only during flood stages. Grain size varies from gravel to clay
within the channel deposits, increases in maximum size upstream. Within
individual point bars the sands are fine at the top and coarsest at the
base, varying from well sorted to virtually unsorted. Nanz (Plate 20)
has shown a comparison of grain size in strandline and alluvial sands.
Preserved in the subsurface the sandy deposits of the channel
will occupy an area equal to that of the meander belt during its period
of active flow. Thickness of the sand and aereal ~istribution will of
course depend upon the size of the depositing stream.
Each of the abandoned courses of the Rio Grande which we see on
the trip h&s left its sedimentary record of sandy meander belt deposits
separated by extensive areas of finer marsh and backswamp sediment.
Rapid subsidence common in the deltaic provinces of the Gulf Coast allows
preservation of this sedimentary record. An understanding of this
pattern is a necessity if we are to explore for oil and gas in areas of
deltaic deposits.

MOUTH OF RIO GRANDE
STOP III - THIRD DAY
E, Alan Lohse l
What to look for:
One of the most characteristic things about the beach sediments
at the mouth of the Rio Grande is the heavy mineral assemblage. Basaltic
hornblende and pyroxene are the most abundant minerals. Green hornblende,
zircon, garnet, staurolite, tourmaline and rutile occur in lesser amounts.
Often the heavy minerals can be seen, concentrated by the winds, to almost
cover the beach with black sando
Presence of the abundant heavy minerals offers an opportunity to
study crossbedding in the dune sands especially when the sands are weto
Heavy mineral and shell banding is noticeable in the beach deposits.
Primary dip of the b~ach is normally about 5 degrees.
To the north of the highway notice Boca Chica, the former outlet of
southern Laguna Madre. This pass has been closed by the rapid accumulation
of sands along the beach. Trending southwest from Boca Chica are a series
of beach ridges clearly visable on the photograph (Plate 19). These were
formed along the shore of a bay which once occupied the area south and west
of this stop.
Discussion of the Stop:
The present mouth of the Rio Grande is located on the north flank
of the Boca Chica subdelta. This subdelta is Late Recent or Modern in age.
It begins westward about 15 miles near Stop I and extends southward about
15 miles to coalesce with the earlier Del Tigre subdelta. In Modern times
the Boca Chica subdelta has expanded northward as river waters discharged
into the former Cameron Bay.
The Recent history of the Rio Grande deltaic plain is shown on
Plate 26. In Early Recent times, the distributary system was located north
of Port Isabel. This built the Los Cuates subdelta, which extended far seaward of the present coastline, and which was characterized on the north Rnd
south by typical delta-flank depressions or bays. These depressions were
analagous to Lake Pontchartrain in the Modern Mississippi delta. Stops IV
and V will examine remnants of this subdelta and observe the processes which
are continuing to modify or destroy it.

After the Los Cuates deltaic plain was built up to a sufficient
elevation, the distributary system shifted southward in a new course to
the sea. This shift occurred about 15 miles northwest of Brownsville,
and began building the Del Tigre subdelta of Midd1e Recent age. The Del
Tigre subdelta now extends southward approximately 50 miles into Mexico.
During this time, the Los Cuates deltaic plain was subsiding and
undergoing rapid erosion from marine transgression. Much of the reworked sediment was transported northward into the Kenedy County embayment.
As the Del Tigre subdelta prograded southward and eastward and the
older Los Cuates subdelta receded westward, the shoreline began to assume
its modern configuration. Dstween the two subdeltas, however, was D delta
flank depression common to hot.h the Los 0ul'1tes and the Del Tigre subdeltaso
The remains of this depression formed Cameron Bay.
After the growth of the Del Tigre subdelta, the distributary system
shifted northward into Cameron Bay and began building the Boca ChiCH subdelta. This shift occurred about ten miles southeast of Brownsville. Concurrently with the growth of the Boca Chica subdelta, the older subdeltas
were continuing to undergo subsidence and marine transgression. These processes, together with the formation of the Modern barriers, have now
straightened the shoreline into a smooth seaward bulge that extends with
marked symmetry almost 200 miles along the South Texas and Northeast Mexican coasts.
Today the Rio Grande deltaic plain is undergoing regional transgression. The processes and rate of this transgression are observed at
the mouth of the river (Stop III) and west of Port Isabel (Stop IV). The
river system no longer carries sufficient sediment either to advance the
delta seaward or to maintain it against the erosive energy of the sea on
the east or Laguna Madre on the north.
The delta front is a high-energy coastline. It receives this
energy in the form of surface waves, which derive it from the westward
expenditure of wind energy in the northwest Gulf region (Plate 25). As
these waves approach the delta coast they undergo transition from surface
waves of the open sea to shallow-water waves, then pass through the plunge
point to create surf and swash (Plate 27B). Since more than 90 percent of
the wave energy is expended landward from the plunge point, the surf and
swash are capable of great amounts of geologic work. This work is accomplished in the form of erosion and transportation of sediments. The
present narrow beach and wave-eroded sand dunes are evidences of the
competency of this work.
As the beach is eroded, the material is transported by coastaldrifting processes (Plate 27A & 27C) almost uniformly northward and southward from the apex of the delta front. Through heavy mineral analyses.
the reworked sediments have been traced northward into the westernmost bend
of the Texas coast in central Kenedy County and southward for 70 miles
along the Mexican coast.

Basaltic hornblende is a diagnostic heavy mineral in the Rio
Grande suite. Plate 21 shows how this mineral occurs in distinctive
abundance northward from the mouth of the Rio Grande (Sample 1) to
central Padre Island (Sample 9), Similar data show its distribution
seaward and southward.

STOP IV - THIRD DAY
Theodore D. Cook l
What to look for:
At this locality the waters of Laguna Madre are actively eroding a
portion of the early Recent deltaic plain of the Rio Grande. The deltaic
surface here is predominantly clay and fine silt. dull brown to red brown
with common gypsum and anhydrite crystals, carbonaceous matter, rare shells
and calcareous nodules.
Lagoonal sediments in this vicinity are very fine sand and clay
reworked derived principally from the deltaic surface. Notice the very
abundant fauna characterized mainly by Crassostrea virginica and Chione
cancellata. The ~icrofnuna is dominated by Rotalia beccari and Elphidium
gunteri. Locally, in the vicinity of abandoned distributaries, the lagoonal
sediments are much sandier due to erosion from the old channels.
Observe along the edge of the deltaic plain a thin bed composed
primarily of fish bones, some skeletons nearly complete. This is thought
to be a fossilized "fish kill" a biological phenomenon which occurs at
intervals in the modern Texas bays due to sudden and extreme environmental
changes.
Deltaic plaination:
We are approximately at the southern end of the Los Cuates subdelta of the Rio Grande (See Plate 26). This deltaic lobe was deposited
in early Recent times when Resacas de los Cuates and Los Fresnos carried
most of the river water and caused the deltiac plain to prograde seaward
beyond the present position of Padre Island. After the river had extended
its delta in this area it sought a new, shorter, steeper course to the sea
and gradually abandoned these northern distributaries to build a younger
lobe farther south in Mexico.
The cessation of active flow to the north and the associated sediment starvation allowed long shore curr~nts, wind, and waves to begin their
destruction of the old deltaic plain causing a local transgression of the
sea. Clay compaction and subsidence in an abandoned subdelta hastened this
process. Gradually the barrier island which was present north of the
deltaic plain was extended southward defining the present southern Laguna
Madre.
The violent action of northers driving lagoonal waters southward
against the deltaic plain at this locality is continuing the destruction
of this abandoned subdelta.

BUENA VISTA MUDFLAT
STOP V

THIRD DAY

Eo fUa n Lohse 1

The mudflat environment is a low-lying portion of the coastal
plain that is predominantly in subaerial exposure but is subjected to
innundation by saline waters, under special conditions, at irregular intervals. This irregular flooding under special conditions, as by a "wind
tide", distinguishes the mudflat from the tidal flat, which is innundated
at regular intervals, as by the astronomical tide. In the soil profile,
mudflat facies usually are distinguishable from tidal flat facies, and
always are distinguishable from lagoonal facies,
The Buena Vista mudflat consists of 4,086 acres of land, whose
elevation is between 0.25 and 100 feet above sea-level. During most of the
year the surface is firm and accessible to ordinary vehicles. The area is
shaped like a triangle whose base extends four miles along the mainland
bluff from Townsite Point peninsula on the south to Horse Island peninsula
on the north, and whose perpendicular extends 2-3/4 miles from the mainland
on the west to North Three Islands on the east. Except for a small fringe
along the toe of the mainland bluff, the entire physiographic unit has come
into existence since about 1850. The history of growth has been reconstructed from data of the Mexican Grant survey in 1829; United States Government surveys in 1879, 1929, and 1951; from the study of geological cores; and
from the geochronologic record of algal varves, first identified in this
region in 1953 (Plate 30).
Prior to about 1856, the area was occupied by waters of Laguna
Madre. The Resaca de los Cuates, a distributary of the ancestral subdelta
that extended northeastward through this region; had flowed farther northward
behind the mainland bluff to discharge into the lagoonal basin behind Horse
Island. This resaca carried flood waters from the Rio Grande and waters from
its own small watershed, as it does today. By 1856 a meander in the resaca
had just broken through the mainland bluff 2-1/2 miles south of Horse Island.
This established the new mouth of the resaca at its present location.
Once the resaca began discharging into this immediate area, its new
delta extended the shoreline ever eastward. Prodeltaic sediments accelerated
the filling of the lagoonal basin between the islands and the mainland. Concurrently, mudflat fringes were also forming around,each of the islands. All
these mudflats were new lands forming by accretion to older lands.
By 1920, the shoreline had moved eastward more than halfway to North
Three Islands. During the late 1920 9 s a channel about 2200 feet wide and
three to six inches deep existed west of North Three Islands. This channel
reportedly was used by bootleggers who sailed flat-bottomed boats close along
shore behind the islands. It became increasingly shallow and choked with
mud bars, uniil, by 1930, the mainland and the island were permanently joined
by a mudflat tombolo.

Deltaic - reddish-brown silts and clays from ancestral subdelta that

Topographically. the area is saucer-shaped. The interior lies between 0.25 and 0.80 feet elevation. A beach ridge, with elevations between
0.80 and 1.0 feet, is built up by wave action around the outer edge of the
mudflat. This beach ridge consists of lagoonal grasses and silty clays,
with scattered patches of permanent green vegetation (Plate 23). Within
the interior of the mudflat, two separate basins often hold surface waters
for prolonged periods of time, especially in winter months. As a result,
these lower areas receive more clay=mineral deposition than the higher areas.
In the summer months these basins undergo deflation as the southeast winds
remove the clay in the form of clay chips, and clay pellets. This material
eventually is deposited downwind against the mainland bluff.
Several times each year the area is innundated by salt water from
the lagoon. These floodings are caused by "wind tides". which are seiches
in the long, narrow lagoonal basin. They are set up by the impact of winter
"northers" upon the lagoonal waters. Onr-e these waters get onto the mudflat
interior, they usually blow back and forth across the flats until evaporated;

sometimes, however, they are blown southward off the mudflat with such
velocity that they erode gullies through the beach ridge along the
southern rim. This serrated southern edge is a distinctive feature of
the mudflat geomorphology.
There is no astronomical tide of any significance in the Laguna
Madre basin. The only fluctuation in water level is that caused by the
wind, and this fluctuation is not "tide" in the legalsense. l Mean high
tide at Red Fish Landing. 20 miles north, is 0.128 feet above MSL; at
Port Isabel, 17 miles south, is 0.56 feet above MSL.
An outstanding characteristic of the mudflat surface is the gray
to brown algal mat (Plate 29). This mat often extends unbroken over the
entire surface, but does not grow in the lagoon. The mat is an assemblage of blue-green algae, which, next to bacteria, is the simplest
plant in existence.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF MUDFLATS THROUG.H VARVE ANALYSIS
Eo Alan Lohse l

Geochronology is the dating of land growth. The earliest precise
technique was developed about 1878 by G. de Geer who counteq annual layers
of sediments in modern and ancient glacial lakes of Sweden.
By definition, any sedimentary bed deposited within one yearis time is a varve.
Varves are recognizable annual cycles of deposition. Although the classic
example of varved sediments is the pair of light and dark clay laminae
characteristically deposited each year where glacial meltwater discharges
into quiet lakes and bays, nonglacial varves also are recognized. A well
known example is laminae in the Green River oil shales, Wyoming, formed by
seasonal variations in plankton production. 2
The recognition of varved sediments in Laguna Madre was mAde by
the writer in 1953 (see Plate 30). Here, the interbedded algal mats and
clay laminae form a geochronologic record usable to date land growth, to
compute rates of deposition, and to identify certain climatic events. In
normal sequence, each dark lamination represents the wet, winter seasonis
growth of algal mat over hundreds to thousands of acres of mudflat environment (Plate 29). The overlying lighter-colored lamination represent the
drier seasons accumUlation of clay material and/or microscopic gypsu~ crystals,
This lamination often is enmeshed in algal filaments that grow upward to renew the surface mat during the succeeding winter season.
The mat consists of an assemblage of blue-areen algae, primarily
of the family Oscillatoriaceae, genera Lyngbya and Microcoleus, Filamentous
forms predominate over unicellular. The assemblage first appears on soils
that are predominantly in subaerial exposure. It thrives on occasional s~lt­
water innundations and brackish rainwater, but does not grow in the lagoon
proper.
The varves are best correlated with climatic conditions that
affected stream runoff from adjacent lands. One exception, however, is the
1933 stratum deposited from standing flood waters, which is recognizable over
many square miles.
In any locality, the varve record can extend from the beginning of
the subaerial mud flat environment upward to the present surface. The record
usually becomes less distinct as the elevation of the mudflat increases and
the surface is exposed to more wind erosion.

FORAMINIFERAL FIXATIVES AND PRESERVATIVES
Charles Aves l
ABSTRACT
Experiments were conducted on living Foraminifera to determine
the effectivensss of preservatives and anesthetics in the study of living
faunal assemblages. Results indicated that (1) alcohol is an adequate
preservative, whereas neutralized formalin is unstable; and (2) that the
use of an anesthetic is advantageous when stained soft parts are to be
examined.
INTRODUCTION
The author began studies on foraminiferal ecology to understand
more clearly portions of dynamic submarine bottoms.
Preliminary observing and collecting were done to determine proper
localities for study. Areas were selected on bases of water depth, faunal
expectancy, accessibility and lack of pollution.
First, tabulation was made listing what information each locality
should yield. This was checked against the comprehensive listings of Allee
et al (1949) and Michael and Allen (1921) to be certain that pertinent
ecolOgical factors would be included. Any suggestions in literature of
techniques for studying ecologic factors and obtaining data in the field
were noted. Second, a flow sheet for station procedure and sample processing was made in detail to cover field and laboratory work. It was
evident that some new equipment and techniques would have to be devised.
In this paper, only two techniques are discussed. Intermittent
work periods through the months, caused a preservative other than formalin
to be required. And as more and more supposedly living Foraminifera were
observed, the question arose whether it would be advantageous to anesthetize or to kill the animals at the time of collection so that they would
be seen later with protoplasm partially extended.
Consideration has been given some equipment ann other techniques.
Specialized bottom-samplers have been considered. More designing needs to
be done, so these will be discussed at another time. A stain, selective
directly or indirectly to live or dead protoplasm, which might be mordanted
or made permanent was thought to be a necessity. A satisfactory mounting
medium would be desirable so that restudy would be possible after sample
storage of prolonged periods. A supplementary or more precise stain has
been sought because the Foraminifera obviously living and growing at the
time they were killed, would not accept rose bengal (Walton, 1952) and some
shell-interiors indicating a "live" animal occurred remotely in time and
distance from living forms. Then the use of a selective stain, old or new,
implied that an exact determination should be made on the rate of decay of
foraminiferal protoplasm.

To find answers for all the questions above, living Foraminifera
had to be obtained. Clear Lake, Galveston County, Texas, seemed the obv~ous
place to go for specimens. The exact geographic location for procuring
experimental specimens was irrelevant. Samples were merely a means to an
end and could have been obtained anywhere a fauna existed.
After the efforts of many showed us how simple it was to culture
the various Foraminifera for experimenting and grow assorted diatoms and
algae for their food, work on stains, mordants and mounting media progressed without having to run back and forth to the field for live material.
Foraminifera from Clear Lake samples were of the following genera
and species (Ellis and Messina, 1940-1956):
Ammoastuta ineptus (Cushman and McCulloch)
Ammobaculites spp.
Elphidium gunteri Cole var. galvestonense Kornfeld
E. poeyanum (d-Orbigny)
Eponidella cushmani Stephenson
E. gardenislandensis Akers
Miliammina fusca (H. B. Brady)
Nonion Spa
Rotalia beccarii (Linneaus) vars.
R. beccarii (Linneaus) var. tepida Cushman
Species listed are mentioned here merely to precede any question as to the
forms worked with in the experiments. Others occurred in numbers considered negligible in this study. In a population count they would certainly
be included in the statistics.
Foraminifera contain one or a combination of lime, silica, chiton (?),
detrital grains and protoplasm. These have to be kept in mind in any work
involving Foraminifera. A Foraminifera with its sarcode absent -- fossil
or recently dead -- must be identified by its testa The sarcode must be
present to ascertain if a Foraminifera is living. To keep census work
om
being too time consuming, samples must, if at all possible, be worked in
mass. These problems carry through any work involving a statistical analysis of samples" The mixed fauna can be handled in mass, by separating the
species with tedious picking or all individuals can be done one at a time.
Authors in the past have recognized this in most respects (Phleger, 1956;
Ph1eger and Lankford, 1957; Walton, 1952; Myers, 1941).

ACKN OWLEDGMENTS
Mrs. Evelyn Hake of the Department of Biology, The Rice Institute,
Houston, Texas, gave this writer much knowledge of stains. fixatives and
methods, for which he is grateful.
The writer thanks Dr. M. A. Hanna, of Gulf Oil Corporation, for his
help, suggestions and unending enthusiasm throughout the procedure and writing.
Appreciation goes to Gulf Oil Corporation
the time Hnd facilities
to do this project and for permission to publish the information.
FIELD EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES
tr

Two samplers were used to obtain bottom samples for experimental
Is and culturing stock"

One, designed by Dr. M. A. Hanna and the author, is a quantative
bottom-dredge adjustable to sample a desired quantity_ It is set to skim a
thin sample from the submarine bottom. When lowered on a single line,
triggered and closed on the bottom, it will be brought to the surface with
a sample from 215 square centimeters. This sampler has been used for some
of this project and has had very restricted use in the Gulf of Mexico. Its
use to the present time is not sufficient to determine its full capabilities.
Used on a soft arenaceous clay bottom, it will take about 150 cubic centimeters of sample.
An abbreviated Hanna coring tube was used through most of the work.
The ball valve originally described (Hanna, 1954), was used in 1 to 3 feet
lengths of 2-3/4 inch diameter plastic liner. The sediment-water contact
was the zone of interest, consequently the short tubes were adequate.
With the ball valve in place, the plastic was tied to a pine 1" x 2"
with the open end of the tube extending 6 to 8 inches over the end of the
board. Two constrictor knots (Ashley, 1944) tied 5 or 6 inches apart secure
the tube and board together. Ashley (1944, p. 225) states, "So long as the
constrictor is tied over a convex surface it will not slip. It draws up
easily, has a ratchlike grip and is the most secure of all binding knots
The constrictor may be slipped, which greatly simplifies untying
"
Plain, white 1/8 inch cod-lrne is excellent for the knotting.
Usually the plastic tube was permitted to free-fall through the 6 to
30 inches of water depth, while the 1" x 2" slipped through guiding fingers.
A short thrust, after the tube was on the bottom, yielded a core 4 to 12
inches long when removed. In every case, the bottom appeared undisturbed in
the tube with the expected thickness of brown scum in place. Thickness was
checked while working by stabbing an empty 3 feet long tube into the bottom
with the upper end remaining above water, then inserting and tightening the
ball valve in place and pushing it under water. This wet the ball valve,
filled the pLastic tube with core Bnd wBter and made a better seal for pulling it out.

- 64 -

Cores were pushed to the tops of the plastic tubes after removal
of the ball valve. This was done with a #13 black rubber stopper for a
plunger on a vertical pine
x
standing in a small wash tub in the bottom
of the boat.
With a spoon, 1/3 to 1/2 centimeter of sediment, together with the
supradjacent scum, was scraped from the top of the core into a glass jar.
The remainder of the core wa~ not used as it had no direct bearing on the
present project. Only the brown scum and oxidized layer were of interest.
Water within three inches of the top of the core was considered
adequate for determining bottom parts per million chloride. Silver nitrate
titration was used for the determination (Scott, 1948. p. 2054).
Acidity ranges were determined witp Hydrion papers and checked on a
Beckman pH meter in the laboratory.
In using boiling formalin, the following relatively simple arrangement was ,used. A stainless steel beaker containing the formalin was held
on two crossed 10 gauge wires pu~ched through a tin can that is without
either end. With the crossed wires through the middle, a #2-1/2 can,is ~
usable with a small can of Sterno. Larger size cans, of course, will permit
uSe of larger beakers of boiling formalin. This set-up will give good
service, varying with use, and is very cheap and expendable. The writer
finally made a self-contained combination stove and carrier of a gallon
syrup bucket with bail. With the wire inside to hold the beaker, a side
door flap cut near the bottom for ventilation and maneuvering cans of
Sterno and their lids, the large can could contain the stainless steel
beaker and at least five small cans of fuel in transport. Formalin would
boil in less than a minute, then the fuel can was covered after the sample
was boiled.
Scrap Monel tubing of a diameter that would fit into the stainless
steel beaker was fitted with 8 circle of stainless steel sieve wire of
0.0041 inch (150 mesh) openings and soldered. This served as a wire bottom
receptable into which the core surface could be scraped, then washed with a
light stream of salt water to remove much of the clay and fixed in the
formalin,
The same Monel-rimmed sieve was used in the stain and rinsing with
good results in use and re-use. They were used as was suggested by Walton
(1952, p. 50),
PRESERVATIVES
Trials were done under conditions similar to those normally encountered in sample collecting. The work was carried on in Clear Lake in
a skiff or on the spoil dump of the dredged channel crossing the lake.

The eventual loss of stored samples when the pH lowered because of
oxidation of the formalin, made a preservative other than formalin imperative. Authors have referred to neutralized formalin in the past and evidently took it for granted that neutralization kept the sample in good shape
(Walton, 1952; Phleger and Lankford, 1957; Ludwick and Walton, 1957), Lime
is commonly suggested as a temporary neutralizer and borax is sometimes used.
A sample neutralized with chalk should be checked peri6dically for pH (Wagstaffe and Fidler, 1955, po 171). This writer knows of no way the lowered
pH liquid CBn distinguish between limy tests or hells, and the neutralizing
chalk or any other neutralizer.
Walton (1952, p. 58) mentioned the lise of "neutralized formalin or
alcohOl", without being specific as to neutralizer or alcohol percentage.
Wagstaffe and Fidler (1955, p. 171) quote Jo L. B. Smith's writing from the
TrBnsactions of the Royal Society of South Africa (VoL 31, 1947. pp. 279282) that recommends hexamine (hexamethylentetramine) for neutralizing strong
formalin (40%). It is stated that the hexamine maintains a constant pH of
7.8 but this writ~r has found that even it will turn acid. Judging from
experience with samples taken from the Florida Keys to Port Aransas, Texas,
it seems that the time needed for the change in pH is inversely proportional
to the amount of organic matter in the sampleo There are possibly other
factors involved, but samples containing abundant live faunae went acid first
and those with scant faunae lasted much better. Formalin freshly neutralized
with hexamine and having 8.5 pH was down to 5.0 pH in six months, whether on
a sample or noto That was discovered when formalin bottles were checked to
find one with neutralized solution for field use.

In searching for a preservative that would hold a sample positively
about 7 pH, yet not destroy any portion of the animals and permit later
staining, Mrs. Evelyn Hake suggested (Personal communication, May, 1956)
alcohol and stated that biologists commonly preserve specimens permanently
in 70% (ethyl) alcohol. Wagstaffe and Fidler (1955, po 170) give the same
percentage with complete procedure, beginning with 30%, stepping to 50%,
then 70% and lastly a fresh change of 70% in which the specimens are storedo
The same authors (QQ. cit., pp. 172-173) list five other preservatives, but
they either contain acids or are recommended for larger invertebrates. They
list isopropyl alcohol (loc. cit.) and as a dehydrating agent stating that it
is cheaper and less hardening to tissues than ethyl alcohol. This writer has
not used isopropyl alcohol for preserving Foraminifera. Its ability is not
known to him; nor its compatability with rose bengal stain.
.
Within a range of 25% to 35%, the alcohol content does not have to be
exact for preserving Foraminifera for a few months if tightly capped. It
does not pay, however, to be too conserving. Percentages below the minimum
25% permit putrefcation and formation of hydrogen sulphide in samples containing abundant fauna. Concentrations higher than the 35% are quite all
right, but bring up a difficulty when staining is considered. Conn (1940,
p. 156) states that at 26 0 C rose bengal has a solubility of 36025% in water
and 7.53% in alcohoL 70% alcohol on Clear Lake samples was found by this
writer to be to; high a concentration for good rose bengal staining later.
Sam~les stored in 70% ethyl alcohol worked quite well if drained and put in
30% solution for 12 to 24 hours before staining. Trials were made on different percentages of ethyl alcohol and denatured anhydrous ethyl alcohol (Solox).

FIXATIVES OR ANESTHETICS
In their manual, Wagstaffe and Fidler (1

obtained items.

, pp. 168-170) Jist
Some are common, easily

Table I shows the trials for various amounts of anesthetics and preservatives with respective grading -- poor, no protoplasm outside the test;
fair, protoplasm covering approximately 1/8 of the test; or good, a quantity
of protoplasm covering up to 1/3 of the test's surface -- based on a usual
in 100 to about 500 individuals per sample. The basis was how well specimens
were anesthetized and not on eventual staining.
QUantities of anesthetics were measured either with bulb pipet or in
100 mI. graduate to amounts needed for the predetermined trials. Sample
quantities were estimated by means of a graduated sample bottle. The bottle
containing a sample stuod side by side with it for the estimation of amount
of preservative needed. Thus, limits of error were within variation of the
wall thickness of the sample bottles and variation in judging volume in an
unstable boat.
For most of the testing. reagnets or narcotics close at hand were
used. Chloral hydrate was obtained in 10% aqueous solution because it has
been recommended for some of the lower forms (loc. cito). The first time
this author tried it (Trial #8), 5 drops were put into an unwashed sample
and shaken immediately. About three minutes later, anhydrous denatured
alcohol was mixed in to make 25%. Results were rated as goodo
Another trial with chloral hydrate was also rated good. The core
#9 was pushed to within an inch of the top of the plastic tube. Chloral
hydrate was dropped in one drop every five minutes while the core remained
upright in the bow of the skiff. There was no mixing other than the light
rocking of the boat in use. At the end of 25 minutes. the core was pushed
to the top of the plastic, the water drained off, the top 1/2 centimeter
scraped off with a spoon into the preserving jar and 30% ethyl alcohol solutiorl added. This procedure worked too well, in that it fixed the protoplasm
of the Foraminifera apparently as in life, enclosing all the silt and debris
that each individual normally holds around itself, leading to difficulty in
identification of the individuals.
Trial #16 was done with 20 drops of chloral hydrate to see if an
additional amount would do better. The unwashed sample was put into the jar
and 1 drop of chloral hydrate added every five minutes with no stirring.
From 3/4 to I hour later, ethyl alcohol was added to make 20%. Observation
under the microscope showed protoplasm mostly retracted. thus fairo The
stimUlation of being buried for a while after scraping the sample into the
bottle could cause retraction before the chloral hydrate was able to take
effect. Trial #8 was shaken immediately upon administering the narcotic.
Chloroform is only slightly soluble in water (1.0% @ 15 0 C: Hodgman,
1948, p. 738) so very few drops were required. Two concentrations were used.
The preservative that fallowed was different in each case. Three drops put
into an unwashed sample (Trial #1) and shaken immediately gave only fair

distention when followed 10 minutes later by 50% anhydrous denatured alcohol
(Solox). The methyl alcohol denaturant gives a white precipitate when the
alcohol is mixed with water. Foraminifera were graded good when narcotized

with Trial #1, it appears that the small amDunt of ethyl alcohol did the
better job of fixingo The ethyl alcohol rated good another time when mixed

#2 worked good with 11 drops and #5 was good with 30% ethyl alcohol
on unwashed samples. The only thing common with the three samples that #2
and #5 do not have, is a lower percentage of alcohol. Can the percentage
have effect beyond the initial ability to kill, i.e., a small amount incapacitates the animals, a large amount overwhelms them. but an intermediate
amount poured into the sample is too much for them to become used to and not
enough to stop them in their tracks? Or is some other factor responsible?
Trials #23. #24 and #25 were each collected, poured unwashed into
respective jars and immediately mixed with 30% ethyl alcohol. These three
were graded fair. Again there is a discrepancy with Trial #5. The samples
were handled the same in the jar, but #5 was the core sample and the others
were taken with the dredgeo Again, the stimulation of being buried could
cause retraction before the alcohol was able to take effect.
Anhydrous denatured alcohol 'was used in three trials in diffeT'ent
amounts. Each was an unwashed sample with the preservative mixed in immidiately when taken. #4 was 30% solution and graded fair. #6 was 70%

Since rose bengal stain itself is toxic to living Foraminifera, 10cco
of the staining mixture (Walton, 1952) was stirred into an unwashed sample
and 30% denatured alcohol added immediately. After 3 days from the time of
collecting, it was graded poor. The animals had stained, some wholly, some
partially, but no protoplasm could be found outside of a testo
Formalin is used in so many fixing solutions (Wagstaffe and Fidler,
1955, pp. 162-165), that Trial #11 was done by adding one drop of 40%
formalin an~ immediately mixing it into the unwashed sample. This amount
-would be only a trace in the final sample dilution. It was thought it would
not be too detrimental in dissolving the test. It was followed by ethyl
alcohol to make 30%. Upon later examination it was rated poor.

Foranli n i fera •
CONCLUSIONS
As a substitute for neutralized formalin, 30% ethyl alcohOl is
suggested here for use in preserving samples of living Foraminifera. Alcohol
is safer over a period of six months to two years than the formalin. If
samples are to be stored for much more than a year they shOUld be progressively stepped to 70% alcohol for better keeping. When their use is
anticipated, they may be drained and put in 30% alcohol for better staining.
If the sample is to be stored again, it shOUld be returned through progressive changes of alcohol as done initially.
Narcotizing or fixing a fauna prior to staining is definitely beneficial. The ability of a stain to differentiate living and dead Foraminifera
is enhanced by mixing in 5 to 10 drops of chloroform, chloral hydrate (10%
aq.) or ethyl alcohol (95%) per 100 cubic centimeters of sample immediately
when taken before the preservative is addedo The preservative should be
added from 3 to 10 minutes latero Although even an hour lapse would be all
right. It is most helpful to have a portion
stained protoplasm outside
of the tests of Foramini

General background material concerned with tbe Recent sediments,
flora, and fauna of the Laguna Madre area can be found in three papers
published in Volume IV, Noo 2, July, 1957, Institute of Marine Scienceo
paper by Shepard and Rusnak, "Texas Bay Sediments", deals specifically
with the sediment distribution; while, the ecological aspects are dealt
with by Jo Po Breuer "An Ecological Survey of Baffin and Alazan Bays,
Texas" and Eo Go Simmons "An Ecological Survey of the Upper Laguna Madre
of Texas 0" Detailed reports of the ecological aspects of the southern
Laguna are not yet available, but preliminary work indicates that it is
not too different from the northern Laguna Madre near Corpus Christi Bay.
On the basis of macro invertebrates, the southern Laguna is distingUished
from the area around Corpus Christi Bay by the occurrence of the gastropods
Anachis avara semiplicata and Anachis abesa and the pelecypods Chione
cancellate, Amygdalum papyracB]!!!" and Laevicardium martoni in' the southern
Laguna
0

The lithology of the Late Pleistocene surface deposits along the
mainland is remarkably uniformo The sediments are predominantly buff to
light gray clayey sands (See Plate 31). The greatest lithologic variation
occurs along the Rio Grande delta proper, from the Arroyo Colorado south to
the Rio Grandeo These deltaic deposits vary from relatively clean sands to
stiff clays such as the Beaumont. In the central portion of the Laguna,
large dune fields of the eolian plain overlie the Late Pleistocene brackish
water deposits. These dunes differ from the clay dunes described by Price
in that they are very clean sands similar to those of the present day
barrier island. The clay dunes on the nther hand, are mostly silty clays.
Fossils in the clay dunes consist predominantly of the land or fresh water
gastropods Polygyra texasiana and Bulimulus alternatus mariae. These fossil
forms are also quite common in the Late Pleistocene bay d~posits. Themost
common pelcypods found with these gastropods are Macrocallista nimbosa.
Aeguipecten irradians concentricus, and the oyster Crassostrea virginica.
Identifiable Foraminifera from the Late Pleistocene deposits consist of
Elphidium galvestonense, Streblus beccarii ~., Elphidium gunteri,
~. incertum mexicanum, Quingueloculina poeyana, Qo wiesneri, Q. seminulum 9
Triloculina sidebottomi, 10 fiterrei meningoi, Trochammina inflata, and the
Cretaceous Foram Globotruncana sp.
Recent studies of the Laguna Madre area suggests extremely slow
deposition in the lagoon with the major part of the sediment supplied by
the reworking of older deposits. The contribution of material from the older
deposits to the Recent sediments is easily recognized as weathered and broken
shell, concretion gravels, and weathered coliteso The amount of other
materials, such as sand, silt, and clays, which have contributed to the
Recent deposit~ is 8 good deal more difficult to evaluate since such material
is.not directly recognizable as reworked. However, from t

Sediment distribution in Laguna Madre based on sand-silt-clay content. (After Shepard & Rusnak,

1957) .

of sediment color types and general lithology, it would appear that most
of the material within the Laguna Madre, with the exception of barrier
island sands, was contributed by the redistribution of eroded material
from the shoreline outcrops. There is very little runoff into the Laguna
Madre and consequently very little sediment is brought into the area from
outside sources. Hydrographic data indicates that the water masses,
especially in the northern Laguna, are more or less stagnant with little
fresh water entering into it. Barrier island sands, however, are contributed in considerable amounts by wind action and washover storm waves
generated in the Gulf.
The mainland side of the Laguna is the only side which shows
typical beach development. The barrier island side of the Laguna shows
no beach development, but rather a very gently sloping barrier flat.
Since the prevailing and predominant winds are from the southeast, this
development of shoreline profiles is exactly what one would expect. Also,
since the wave height is restricted by very shallow depths (see Bretschneider, C. L., 1954, Generation of Wind Waves over a Shallow Bottom~
Beach Erosion Board, Corps of Engineers, Tech. Memo. No. 51; p. 1-24),
only miniature beaches can develop_
Information from shallow borings made by the V. S. Corps of
Engineers indicates weathered deposits or partially indurated deposits at
very shallow depths within the sediments. The borings give very good
control since they were made at intervals of 1000 feet along the line of
the present navigation channels. Sediment cross sections (Plate 32)
prepared from the boring data indicate deposits older than Recent at
depths of 5 to 10 feet below the Recent surface in the southern Laguna.
The older deposits consist of hard, compact, and weathered clays. The
deposits in the northern Laguna are somewhat more difficult ·to interpret
as there is no distinct difference in the lithology between the Recent
and the Pleistocene (?). However, if one considers the hard packed and
partially indurated sands as representative of old deposits, then the
thickness of the Recent in the northern Laguna varies from 15 to 20
feet.
The stratigraphic relations and general lithology of the Central
barrier flats is not considered here, since this area underwent intensive
study by the Humble Oil Company under the supervision of Dr. H. No Fisk.

A BEACH OUTCROP OF MARINE PLEISTOCENE BEAUMONT CLAyl
Charles Aves 2

ABSTRACT
Sargent Beach is approximately 29,2 miles southeast of Bay City,
Texas, in Matagorda County. The exposed Beaumont clay of Pleistocene
age is being eroded. The beach has been eroded landward by wave action
and shore currents resulting from a lack of excess supply of sediments
for deposition. The Beaumont varies from gray and black to red brown.
By sampling, it has been found to contain a brackish water and marine
fauna of Foraminifera and Ostracoda with accompanying few snails and
crabs.
INTRODUCTION
Problem
A third of the way down the Texas coast, near Sargent, Matagorda
County, brackish water deposits of Beaumont age are being eroded in the
littoral and shallow neritic zones of the Gulf. Crab parts and freshwater snails are plainly visible scattered in the clay on its freshly
eroding surface on the beach. Microscopic examination of the material
discloses an assortment of Ostracoda and bracki~h water and marine Foraminifera.
The occurrence of the outcrop on Sargent beach initiates such
questions as: 1) reasons for its erosion, 2) rate of erosion, 3) where
the outcrops fit into the Beaumont section of the area and 4) how the
fauna varies vertically with respect to changes from marine to nonmarine.
Location
Sargent beach is approxima~ely 29.2 miles southeast of the center
of Bay City, Texas, in Matagorda County. Going east on Texas Highway
F. M. 457 out of Bay City, one t~rns south after 18 miles and goes to
the beach where the highway terminates. The brackish water Beaumont is
between the Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Plate 33A, modified after Lohse,
1955).
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Sincere thanks are due Dr. M. A. Hanna for his suggestion of the
project, his help in the field work and assistance in the preparation of

Hanna, to whom the writer is indebted, for identifications.
The efforts of the following Gulf employees are appreciated: Mr.
F. F. Gregg for help in field work; Mr. J. Z. Harris for help in field
work, in the task of cutting the cores and paleontological work; Mr.
D. J. Smith for assistance with the Ostracoda; and to other members of
the paleontological staff for suggestions in the preparation of the
manuscript.
The writer thanks Gulf Oil Corporation for the facilities to do
the work and for permission to publish the paper.
PREVIOUS WORK ON THE BEAUMONT OF THE GULF COASTAL PLAIN
Stratigraphy. --- In 1903, Hayes and Kennedy named "Beaumont" the
clays along the Gulf Coast which were formerly referred to as Port Hudson
in Louisiana and the vague "Coast clays" (Plummer, 1932, p. 787)
The
type locality is regarded as the shallow well sections near Beaumont,
Jefferson County, Texas
These sect ions cons ist of Pleistocene clays,
marls, silts and sands reaching as much as 400 feet in thickness (.QQ.
cit., pp. 530, 788 and Price, 1934, p. 950).

Trowbridge (1923; 1932) did extensive work near the Rio
where he found the Beaumont to include gravel beds that are not
at the surface. The majority of the formation is blue and red,
careous clay, which weathers yellow, a few thin sand lenses and
limestone concretions (.QQ. cit., p. 100; pp. 209-218).

Deussen (1924) studied the region north of that of Trowbridge to
the Brazos River. He described the Beaumont as "blue yellow-weathering
calcareous clay containing small lime nodules; yellow and blue sand,
which is in places calcareous; blue and red mottled sandy clay; and
oyster beds" (.2J2.0 ciL, p. 110).
Geologists in the past have not fully agreed on the orIgln of the
deposits called Beaumont. Their ideas have changed as additional observations have been made. Prior to 1929, the consensus was that the Beaumont
was part of an uplifted marine plain with its seaward edge slightly submerged to drown the erosional valleys. Barton (1930a, pp. 360-382)
first stressed the derivation of the Beaumont as being non-marine deltaic
sediments with intercalated marine deposits near the present coast.
In a similar paper, Barton (l930b, p. 1313) states, "The seaward edge of
the Beaumont formation at the surface is marine or brackish-water, although in general the Beaumont beds at the surface are deltaic sediments
laid down above sealevel", He observed that the physiography of the
Gulf Coastal Plain was unlike a marine plain and described its depositional history (Barton 1930a, pp. 360-382). The deltaic plain was built

by the coalescening deltas as stream mouths along the late Pleistocene
coast migrated back and forth leaving interdistributary and interdeltaic lagoons and bays, In these shallOWS, affected by both fresh
and marine waters, sediments of a transitional ecology accumulated.
Findings on surface formations of southeast Texas and southern
Louisiana were published by Doering (1935), He considered coastal
formations younger than Mio-Pliocene and touched only lightly on the
late Pleistocene Beaumont. As to the rate of slope of the Beaumont,
,po 671),
he gives it at "about 2 feet per mil€" (2l2"
Fauna, -~- Trowbridge (.Q£. GiL, po 101 and 1932. po 209) wrote
that no fossils were found in the Beaumont (at the surface) in the area
near the Rio Graude, and cites well sections that penetrated through the
Beaumont into beds containing marine Foraminifera.
Deussen (2£. cito, po Ill) mentions Rangia cuneata Gray and
Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) as marine fossils found in the formation
west of the Brazos River. He states that remains of Elephas and Eguus
are also found, but that possibly they are reworked from the underlying
Lissie formation, of lower Pleistocene age.
Oyster-shell reefs are referred to "in the praIrIe east of Lake
Charles (Louisiana) at an elevation of 15-20 (estimated) feet above sealevel" in the Beaumont by Barton (l930b, p. 1313),
Richards (1936, 1939a, 1939b) has done considerable work on occurrences of marine molluscs in Pleistocene formations along the Atlantic
and Gulf Coasts. There is much similarity in the faunae of the two
coasts. In his discussion of the indications of Texas Marine Pleistocene,
Richards (l939b) states, "The majority of the fossils referable to the
Beaumont in southeastern Texas indicate brackish conditions not unlike
a modern delta". He lists 89 genera and species of molluscs. assignable
to Pleistocene age. from dredgings, wells and outcrops along the Texas
Gulf Coast.
In a discussion of Plummer's CENOZOIC section of the University
of Texas Bulletin 3232 with supplementary remarsk. Price (1934, p.955957) states,
" ••• The following list is of species of Foraminifera
taken from augur cuttings obtained by the writer from
localities within the tidewater section of the Beaumont in Nueces and San Patricio Counties. The determinations were made by several paleontologists. including Alva C. Ellisor, who recently corrected the

Published well data are insufficient on the Gulf Coast to give
much evidence through the Pleistocene Beaumont section (Colle and others,
1952), In July. 1954, the Gulf Oil Corporation, Texas State Lease No. I
was drilled about eight miles off of Mustang Island, Nueces County, in
Gulf of Mexico Tract 774. Cuttings were taken by Gulf paleontologists
at intervals of 15 feet. L<lter the washed samples were hand picked for
Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) fragments and the material was turned
over to the Humble Oil and Refining Company for carbon isotope dating.
Picked shells frOm the interval of 100 to 115 feet below the bottom of
the Gulf of Mexico had a C14 determination of 10,700 plus or minus 160
years B.P. Immediately below the shell zone, "basal gravels" of the
Recent occurred. Another oyster horizon at 205-220 feet below the Gulf
bottom proved to be "dead". This latter material was of Beaumont age.

PHYSIOGRAPHY
Beaumont Clay. --- The Beaumont clay extends along the Gulf
Coast in an approximate 50 mile wide belt from the Mississippi delta
to northeastern Mexico. It produces black, waxy soils and slopes gently
Gulfward to extend beneath windblown snnds, beach and shallow neritic
sediments as far as the continental shelf (Plummer, 1932, p. 788)
The
fairly flat surface is broken by valleys of entrenched streams and the
remains of low-relief natural levees of ancient rivers.
0

Erosion on Sargent beach has removed part of the soil and beach
covering from the Beaumont.
Post-Beaumont History. --- Following the formation of the deltaic
plain, sealevel was lowered, allowing major coastal streams to erode
their valleys across the continental shelf Lo the slope. An undissocted,
residual portion of the Beaumont plain was left between the Colorado and
Brazos Rivers. This area is within the stippled "deltaic environment"
of Lohse (1955) on the map (Plate 33A).
Under the Recent transgressing sea, the channels of the Colorado
and Brazos Rivers gradually filled; with the help of the waves and currents, their retreating deltas coalesced near the edge of the continental
shelf to form a submarine sandsheet which is the ~Basal Conglomerate" of
the Recent (U.S.C. & G.S. Chart 1126).
The sea eventually returned to about its present-day position.
The undissected area was left as a low relief residual projecting seaward.
Oceanography. --- The Sargent area is receiving the assault of the
waves resulting from predominant east-quadrant winds stressed by Lohse
(955) .
Price (1954) cites Bretschneider's unpublished "Dissipation of
Wave Energy on the Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico". A wave
moving shoreward loses only 36% of its energy between the slope and the
shoreface with 64% to be expended on the shoreo
A source of material with which to form an excess beach cover is
lacking nearby. The Colorado and Brazos Rivers in the vicinity (Plate 33A)
have insufficient drainage basins.
SARGENT BEACH AREA
Rate of erosion.
When one approaches the surf at the end of
the pavement, it is apparent that the road extended farther when it was
hardsurfaced. The dead-end appears as a scarp above the beach slope.
No rate of erosion has been determined by the writer to this date.
Beaumont Outcrop. --- Beaumont sediments have been uncovered and
eroded to a depth of 1-]/2 meter on the Jaw tide terrace (terminology

of Shepard, 1948, p. 82). The surface of the terrace is mottled light
graY-lvhite and red-brown, sandy. silty clayo Details of this material
will be given in the analysis later. This gentle slope is smooth and
sculptured to a slight concave surface. It is under the swash at the
left of photo (Plate 33B). Seaward, into the trough, the mottled clay
has been potholed so that there is no even surface. Fishermen in the
area complain about the "slippery and uneven footing" they have when
wading in the surf to fish. The potholes are partially filled with the
fine to CQarse sand that aids the erosion done by wave action. Some of
the holes are as much as 10 cm. deep below adjacent wall peaks. Other
than the little sand in the potholes, the low tide terrace is swept
clean.
At the base of the sand beach scarp, there is another scarp.
The latter is the upper outcrop of dark gray Beaumont clay with a
sparse mottling of dark, red-brown patches (center of photo, Plate 33B).
The sample from this part of the outcrop will be considered later,also.
The dark gray clay stands as much as 30 cm. above the surface of the
upper foreshore slope. It, likewise, is potholed so that there are no
flat surfaces. At low tide, the holes stand partially filled with fine
to coarse sand and water. The over-all scarp surface is irregular and
rounded. Crab and mollusc fragments protrude from the surface. Prolonged subaerial exposure causes the gray clay to mud-crack into 5 to 35
mm. polygons. The returning tide washes into these cracks whatever sandgrains that will pass the opening. The clay is seldom out of water long
enough to allow three dimensional jointing.
Recent Beach Covering. --- In and around the irregularities of
the gray clay scarp and composing the beach scarp and berm, are Recent
deposits lying unconformably on the eroded gray Beaumont Clay. The Recent
sediments which have a maximum thickness of 1/2 meter are composed of
laminated gray clayey to clean (all showing graded bedding) fine to coarse
sand with a meager foraminiferal assembledge; natural concentrates of
"heavy minerals"; numerous whole and broken mollusc shells, including
Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), Area, Pecten, Pholas, and Cardium; up to
25 cm. long slabs of calcite cemented sands, coquinas and siIts, bored
by molluscs and sponges and most encrusted with a few Crassostrea virginica
(Gmelin). The slabs may have washed inshore and some large, loose oysters
may have been reworked out of the Beaumont. The shells can be seen in
place in the side of the intracoastal canal near the swing bridge on Texas
Highway F. M. 457.

PROCEDURE
FieJd Methods
An outcrop sample, uncontaminated with beach sand, was taken from

Later, on May 31. 1958, the writer returned to the site with
Dr. Hanna, Mr. Harris and Mr. Gregg. Collections included a grab
sample from the mottled, white and red-brown clay exposed on the low
tide terrace and a 2-7/8 inch 0.0. core taken above the beach scarp
about 3 meters upshore from low tide Jevel. A general study of the
area was made
0

The core was taken after the Recent sand was scraped back to
be free of loose sand and expose the dark gray clay. A 2-7/8 inch 1.0.
brass tube was pushed downward until it could be pushed no further,
stoppered and filled with watero The core barrel was lifted out and
the extruded parts of the core were wrapped in paper and labeled. The
empty tube was then set down the original hole and again pushed as far
as it would go, then filled with water, stoppered and removed. This
procedure was repeated until a depth of 2046 meters was reached.
Laboratory Methods
Core Sections. --- To facilitate microscopic examination. the
cores were laid in plastic half-tubes, then cut lengthwise 1/2 em. deep
so as to have a flat surface and cross sectional view, and marked at 1
em. intervals. Descriptions were made from the cut surfaces while the
cores were wet.
Each core section was sliced at centimeter intervals along its
length. At points determined by lithology and apparent changes, pieces
were selected for analyses and put iri beakers. After oven drying at
220 0 F, each part was weighed and soaked in Gulf BT Solvent for eight hours.
The excess solvent was poured off and the samples covered with hot tap
water. Twelve hours or more soaking permitted the samples to swell,
then each was washed on an 8-inch U. S. Standard 230 mesh (,062 mm.)
sieve to divide the sample fractions at the 1/16 mm, sand-silt line
according to Wentworth scale (Twenhofel and Tyler, 1941, p, 46).
After a second oven drying, the fractions greater than 1/16 mm.
were weighed. Percentages were calculated from the original dry weight
and plotted on the basis of residue abundance (See core log). Some of
the coarse fractions were examined microscopically, picked of their
fauna, and notations made on the chart.
Outcrop Samples. --- The two bulk samples of red and gray Clays
were examined by unit volume after washing by the solvent routine. A
unit was examined under the microscope and the fauna picked from it.
Units from which the fauna were not picked were examined hastily for any
object or species not seen in the first unit of each,

Paleontology. --- The mottled, red clay was about a liter in
volume f so there was a possibility it could have more fauna than the core.
There were a few species not recorded in the core sections examined.
Nonion grateloupi (d'Orbigny), Nonionella opima Cushman, Esponidella
cushlnani Stephenson, RotaUa rOlshauseni Cushman and. Bermudez and the
diatom, Cocinodiscus were found with a few crab parts and reworked
Cretaceous Foraminifera. The majority of crab fragments resemble Uca.
Gray Clay Scarp Grab Sample
Description. --- The dark gray clay of the scarp with a dark,
red-brown mottling has abundant silt, rare very fine sand and a trace of
fine sand. Yellow iron oxide patches and hematite oolites are rare.
The few calcareous oolites would be considered a trace and the lime
nodules rare.
Paleontology. --- The gray scarp clay sample was also about a
liter in volume, but it showed less faunal diversity than the terrace
sample. Varied crab fragments. many of which could probably be referred
to Uca, are all that have not been found in the equivalent part of core.
CONCLUSIONS
Reasons for erosion. --- The beach at Sargent is eroding because
the lack of excess sediment leaves the beach open to the effect of the
waves and currents. T~e wave and current action from the energy exerted
eight months of the year by the predominant winds are analyzed by Lohse
(1955) •
Rate of erosion. --- No rate of erosion at the beach outcrop has
been determined.
Outcrops. --- The terrace exposure of red-brown clay and mottling
of gray-white matches the cored section between centimeters 106 and 120.
The part of the section at centimeter 45 has too much dark gray.
The dark gray clay of the scarp, except for the more abundant lime
nodules and crab parts, matches at centimeter 45 in the cored section.
Faunal variation. ~-- The environment demonstrated in the outcrops and cored section is transi tiona 1. The effects of the changes in
deposition are clearly reflected in faunal and sediment changes. The
area was closely related to sources of fauna-laden fresh and marine
water. Variations occur from one extreme of no fauna through freshwater, marsh, brackish and marine faunae.

AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF A TEXAS COASTAL BAY GRASS FLAT
Charles M. Hoskin, William R. Pickens, and Travis Votaw l
Aquatic grass flats in the Texas coastal bays represent, on an
areal basis, a major environmental type. These flats cover large areas
in Laguna Madre and in the clear shallow waters in Corpus Christi,Copano,
Redfish, a~d Aransas Bays. This paper presents the results of an exploratory ecologic study of a small grass flat in north-central Redfish Bay
(Plate 35). The distribution of the living fauna and flora was estimated
on a basis of both number of individuals and weight of individuals per
square meter. The distribution of "fossils li in the sediment was determined
on a basis of weight of a given species per 10 pounds of sediment sample.
The study was made on July 28, 1958 and was suggested by Dr. L. S. Kornicker.
The grass flat investigated is located in a small sheltered part
of Redfish Bay near the town of Aransas Pass, Texas where shallow clear
marine water about 0.2 meters deep extends several hundred meters out into
the bay. The sediment is a medium to dark gray color indicating a reducing
environment but does not reek of hydrogen sulfide. It is composed of 30
percent sub-angular to sub-round quartz grains (0.25 to 0.125 mm.), 17 percent Foraminifera tests, 10 percent shell fragments, and a 53 percent silt
size fraction. The dominant grass is Diplanthera wrightii. Tidal amplitude is very small, and the water currents are mostly wind generatedo The
water current velocity waS estimated by the dispersal of fluorescein dye
as 0.3 meters per second in the grass and 106 meters per second over the
bare sand. The water temperature was 37 degrees centigrade in mid-afternoon
and the salinity (titrated) 36.53 parts per thousand.
The locality map (Plate 35) which includes 79,130 square meters, is
somewhat diagrammatic because the grass does not grow in a continuous mat
as shown, but grows in patches separated by bare sand areaso The relative
distribution of grass and open sand was estimated as 60 percent grass and
40 percent sando In this study the grass flat is considered to include the
open sand areas. The living biota of the grass flat was found to be composed of several species of aquatic marine grass, shrimp. fish, a single
species of polychaete worm, and a single species of portunid crabo The
pyramid of numbers (Table 1) indicates that, on an area basis. there are
many more individuals of primaty producers than herbivores, and more herbivores than carnivores. This is typical of stable biotic communities (Odum,
1953).

The pyramid of biomass (Table 1) is not what is usually encountered
in ~table communities. It is customary to find that the pyramid of biomass
bears an inverse relationship to the pyramid of numbers; that is. on a weight
per unit area basis, the carnivores would rank first, herbivores second, and
primary producers third. The herbiverous gastropods, Cerithidea and
Cerithium, (Vilas and Vilas. 1952, and Rogers, 1908), were numerous as
··fossils", but were absent in the -living biota. This suggests that the two
genera of herbiverous gastropods were present in the community in the past.
The authors have not determined the reason for the present absence of the
herbivores. If these herbivores were reinstated in the community a more
normal composition of trophic levels would result.
Earlier in the summer a project similar to the grass flat study was
conducted in Aransas Bay, north of the Lydia Ann Channel (Marine Geology
Class, Institute of Marine Science, unpublished). The Aransas Bay station
is located 6.035 kilometers southeast of the Redfish Bay grass flat. The
water depth in Aransas Bay was 2.44 Deters and the sediment was hard,
shelly, muddy sand. Dredge and clamshell samples did not bring up any
grass in the sediment, The sediment in the graliless Aransas Bay area had
much more shell material than the grass flat of Redfish Bay (Plate 36),
The composition of the "fossil" fauna was quite different in the two areas
on both specific and higher levels (Tables 2 and 3). Although 5 sp~cies of
fish, 3 species of shrimp. and one species of portunid crab were in the
living biota of the grass flat no remains of these organisms were found in
the sediment

ENT SAMPLE

Considering the grass flat as a natural system affected by
physical, chemical, and biological processes enables one to understand
grass flats as a functional entity. The grass blades exert a major
influence in the community by producing organic matter through photosynthesis. holding the sediment together with interlocking root systems,
acting as a sediment trap by reduction of water current velocity and
thus permitting particles to settle out, and providing a plact of attachment for Foraminifera, hydroids, and many other epiphytes (Ginsburg and
Lowenstam, 1958).
The "fossil" faunal composition of the Redfish Bay grass flat
was 46 percent herbiverous gastropods which indicates the heavy dependence
of the biota on the grass. A large percentage of herbiverous gastropods
in fossil faunas may indicate that the sedimentary environment was a
grass flat.

GEOLOGY OF THE GULF OF MEXICO]

most of the early Tertiaryo During late Tertiary the basin of the Gulf
further subsided, possibly both by downwarping and
ulting along the basin

outer edge of the Campeche Banks. Other BreBS along the continental slope
suggest fault scarps.
basin of t
Gulf may well have been deeper than
the present 12,425 feet, with post-mid~Tertiary sediments filling the basin
to its present depth.
Stratigraphic and geophysical evidence can be shown for the existence
of a geosyncline in the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Geophysical calculations indicate a horizontal increase in the density of the basement rocks
from the Sabine uplift to near the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. From this,
it can be concluded that a geosyncline must occur in the basement surface
with its trough axes slightly landward from the present coast lineo Further
evidence is the great thickening of the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary beds
as they dip Gulfward, with the Tertiary beds reaching a stratigraphic thickness of more than 25,000 feet near the coast. Knowing that the deepest part
of the Gulf of Mexico is 12,500 feet and assuming that the thickness of the
Upper Cretac~ous-Tertiary sedimentary deposits in the great depths of the
Gulf are 10 per cent or less of their thickness in the Gulf Coast, it can
~e concluded that "the basement of the Upper Cretaceous-Tertiary beds must
be downwarped'6,OOO to 16,000 feet in reference to the depth of that basement under the Sigsbee Deep."
The geosynclinal trough is a well-marked feature indicating considerable subsidence. Its westward limit is not definitely known, but some thinning
of formations is noted in the longitude of Matagorda County, Texas. It is
further complicated by transverse structures, such as the Rio Grande syncline,
the San Marcos arch, the Houston syncline, the Sabine uplift, and the Mississippi River synclineo

slope, in general, constitutes one of the great relief features of the
earth. The edge of the continental shelf is only very roughly parallel
to the shore line as is shown by the varying width of " the shelf. The
continental shelves of the Gulf of Mexico seem to have a close geologic
and physiographic relationship with the adjacent land. Broad shelves
lie in front of broad coastal plains, and narrow shelves lie between
steep continental slopes and xugged near-shore terrain. An examination
of the maps of the topography of the outer shelf and slope of the
northern Gulf of Mexico shows many features which suggest an origin
due to den$ity currents and the deposition of the mass of mud. Also,
continental shelf fauna dredged from the Mexican Basin may have been
transported from the shelf by turbidity currents. Furthermore, these
currents may have carried sediment to the central Gulf and, therefore,
aided in developing the rather flat floor of the Mexican Basin.
The near-shore sediments, at least, should be expected to be
closely related to the sediments of the adjacent coastal plain except
near the mouths of major rivers. Studies have shown that each formation varies widely in its composition as it curves around the Gulf from
Florida to Mexico. In general, the Gulf coastal area may be divided
into intergrading depositional areas as follows: Rio Grande Embayment,
East Texas Basin, Mississippi Embayment, the Gulf coastal region of
Alabama, Georgia, and North Florida, and South Florida. The Rio Grande
may have been the major source of sediments from the late Cretaceous
through early Miocene time with the Mississippi River contributing
little sediment during that time. The sediments brought to the Gulf
of Mexico are probably not carried far from shore (See Plate 37).
Interest in the gulf has been greatly accelerated in the past
decade, and there is much evidence that this interest will continue,
which should result in the eventual solution of many of the present
riddles of the Gulf of Mexico.

RECENT MARINE SEDIMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTS
OF NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO I
Norman N. Greenman

and

Rufus J. LeBlanc

Abstract by
Erwin K. Krause
Shell Oil Company
This report is based on the megascopic study of 85 cores taken by
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the northwest Gulf of Mexico
in 1947. The cores varied from three to ten feet in length and averaged
seven feet. Fourteen cores (16-1/2%) are from the continental shelf; 48
(56-1/2%) are from the slope; and 23 (27%) are from the SigsbeeDeep.
Recent sediments arc accumulating in five major marine environments:
shelf, iise, upper slope, lower slope, and Sigsbee Deep. Shelf sediments
show a two-fold zonation, and sediments from the other environments show a
three-fOld zonation. The depth r~nges and sediment types of each are
summarized in Table 1. Rises are isolated topographic highs at the outer
edge of the shelf and upper part of the slope. They are thought to be
either salt domes or volcanic necks, but their origin is still doubtful.
Rise sediments are similar to those of shelf but contain less Clay. Shelf
sediments show the widest variation in type.
A brief summary of characteristics of late Pleistocene-Recent history
will help clarify sediment distribution and location of Pleistocene-Recent
contact:
1.

Pleistocene epoch, latest (Wisconsin) glacial stage.
Growth of ice caps; lowering of sea level at least 450 feet;
most of shelf exposed; shoreline between present 350-400
foot contours; weathering intensified; rivers rejuvenated;
valleys entrenched; coarser sediments carried; co~tinuous
deposition on slope and in deep which were still ~nder water.

2.

Recent epoch, rising sea level.
Ice caps started recession about 20,000 years ago; rivers
filled their entrenched valleys; progressively finer sediments were carried; streams were braided.

3.

Recent epoch, standing sea level.
Sea reached present level about 5,000 years ago; meandering
streams migrate over flood plains; the Mississippi River' began
building its complex delta with various lobes built and abandoned as the river changed courses; Recent surface deposits
o( coastal plain formed.

The top sediments of the Recent Bre zoned in the five environments
by water depth and, to less degree. by lateral distribution. The sediments
of the eastern Sigsbee Deep are calcareous; the balance of northwest Gulf of
Mexico sediments are clastico Absence of clastics, rather than greater
Foraminifera production, accounts for the calcareous foraminiferal ooze of
the eastern deep Bnd the thinner Recent interval. Distribution of clastic
sediments is a result of the several
or nd many mjnor rivers contributing a huge volume of clastics and of a
iling surface current moving
from east to west. Because of this current the non-clastic ooze facies
terminates southwest of the Mississippi River delta instead of immed tcly
south. The east~to-west current, together with a general seaward movement
of sediments, causes a seaward bulge in the distribution of upper slope
homogeneou~ clay southwest of the Mississippi delta.
The sediment load of
the rivers and the surface current also control the thickness of the Recent,
which decreases from shelf to deep and from west to east within the deep. A
tongue of lower slope-western Sigsbee Deep mottled clay facies extends into
the eastern deep and may be due to a west-to~eBst return current or to the
effect of the sediment load contributed by the Rio Grande.
Distribution of the red and reddish~brown clay facies of the intermediate zones of the deep Bnd slope is a function of geographic ioc~tion
rather than depth of wat~ro The clay has a low calcium carbonate contento
Three theories have been advanced to explain the red clay~ (1) the water
was colder and undersaturated in calcium carbonate; therefore calcareous
tests were dissolved, and the sediments were low in calcium carbonate and
colored red by residual iron. This theory is not supported by faunal
evidence a~d fails to explain why such sediments are not being deposited
in cold deep water today. (2) The reddish-brown clays are from the Brazos,
Colorado, and Rio Grande rivers and the red clay from the Red River as at
present. This fails to explain why such clays are not being deposited now.
(3) Waves eroded the exposed and oxidized shelf deposits; as sea-level rose
the rivers filled their channels instead of dumping lar~e sediment loads in
the GUlf; the rising sea overrode and reworked the oxidized depositso The
low calcium carbonate content is a result of increased sediment loads and
relatively decreased Foraminifera.
The Recent-Pleistocene contact was not penetrated by shelf cores; the
fauna is of the warm-water type as at present; core-to-core correlation is
poor on the shelf. Presence of the Recent-Pleistocene contact in rise cores
is uncertain; evidence is contradictory or inconclusive; faunal information
is also inconclusive, although inane rise core the warm-water fauna was in
upper light-colored sediments and the colij''''water in lower dark sediments ~
core::"to-core correlation is poor. On boVh the upper and lower slopes coreto-core correlation is fair to good; the Recent-Pleistocene contact is placed
at the base of the intermediate zone or at the top of the dark olive-gray
clay in the intermediate zoneo A general statement with regard to fauna of
the upper slope, Ibwer slope, western Sigsbee Deep, and eastern Sigsbee Deep
is that the warm-water type is found in the upper zones, transitional faunas
in the intermedi"ate zones, llInd cold~>water
in the lower zones. Both part
of the Sigsbee Deep exhibit excellent core-to-core correlation. The Recent

There is no indication of turbidity current action or depositso The
coarse sediments of the lower zone of the Sigsbee Deep are not graded; correlation is good; the deposits are Pleistocene and therefore may be shallow
water sediments; there are no coarse Pleistocene deposits on the slope which
could have initiated turbidity currents. Pleistocene and Recent sediments
are the same lithologic type on the slope but different in the deep. The
Pleistocene of the deep and the Recent of the shelf are similar. Therefore
,it is likely that the deep did not exist in Pleistocene time. It is postulated that the coarse deposits of the deep accumulated in a shelf environment and were downfaulted to the present position during late Pleistocene
or early Recent. The bottom topography shows scarps off the west coast of
Florida and off the north and west coasts of Yucatano Relief off Florida is
about 6,000 feet, off Yucatan from 5,000 to 10,000 feet. These figures agree
fairly well with the 9,000 to 11,000 feet necessary if the faulted shelf
hypothesis is correct. Ple~stocene deposition would have taken place 500 ±
feet below Pleistoce'ne sea-level or 1,000 feet below present sea-level; the
cores are from 10,000 to 12, 000 feet. 'Faunal evidence suggests a displacement of 9,000 to 10,000 feet. An alternative hypothesis is that the coarse
sediments of the deep were deposited at the edge of the present shelf during
the last glacial stage when rejuvenated streams were vigorously eroding the
land and present shelf areas and contributing larger and coarser sediment
loads to the Gulf. This hypothesis limits faulting to less than 3,500 feet
and fails to explain why there are no coarse Pleistocene deposits on the
slope, which was closer to shore than the deep.

CENTRAL TEXAS COAST SEDIMENTATION: CHARACTERISTICS
OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENT, RECENT HISTORY,
AND DIAGENESIS
Abstract by
Francis P. Shepard and David Go Moore
LaJolla, California
The central Texas coast in the Rockport area has been used as a
test area for investigating the characteristics of sediments of protected
bays, barrier islands, and of the open Gulf continental shelfo By using
a team of sedimentationists, biologists, and chemists, a considerable number
of differences have been determined in these three major environments and
in subdivisions of each. Influences such as salinity, waves and currents,
depth of water, and source material are indicated as the primary controls
of the sediment types. In addition to the assemblages of organisms,
statistical studies of the ~onstituents of the coarse fraction have been
particularly helpful in characterizing the environments.
Among the characteristics which differentiate the sediments of the
depositional environments in this area are the following.
10 Bays-near-river mouths can be identified by their relatively
high content of plant fibers, ferruginous aggregates, and ostracods which
may predominate over Foraminifera (a relation unique to this environment).
Stratification is better preserved than in the other environments in the
area. Montmorillonite is the dominant clay mineral and is much more common
than in other environments. The CaC03 content is especially high, being
derived as partIculate matter from the river.

20 The central and deeper parts of bays are characterized by their
lack of stratification, their high clay content, and especially by the
abundance of Foraminifera in the coarse fraction (greater than 1/16 mm).
Parts of these central bay areas are also characterized by the presence of
oyster reefs or by the abundance of oyster shells. Montmorillonite and
CaC03 are less abundant than in the upper bays.
3. The lower bays near inlets have sediments with high sand contents
(commonly more than 50 per cent) along with a higher content of clay than
silt. The faunas show varying admixtures of open Gulf forms with those
typical of the bayso

~

40 The barrier island flats and inlets are characterized bysediments with high sand content but they differ from the lower bays in having
more plant fiberr. The sediments from the flats have calcareous aggregates
and the inlets commonly contain an appreciable proportion of echinoid plates
-and spine~ whereas these are rare in bay sediments.

I

50 The Gulf beaches and dunes consist predominantly of sand, rarely
having more than 3 or 4 per cent of silt and clay. This sapd is well sorted
but almost equally divided between the 1/4-1/8 mm. and 1/8-1/16 mmo sizes.
The two environments are distinguished from each other by the consistently
greater roundness of the dune sands and by the greater content of shells and
Foraminifera in the beach sands,

6. The nearshore Gulf sediments extending from the barrier island
beaches down to depths of about 30 feet are also characterized by a predominance of sand but they differ from the barrier island sands in being
concentrated in the 1/8 to 1/16 mm. grain size. Glauconite is found in these
sediments, whereas it is rare on the barrier islands and very rare in the bays.
Shells are rather scarce in this turbulent area.
7. The inner shelf, extending from depths of about 30 feet out to 120
feet, is characterized by sediments
th rather considerable amounts of glauconite and echinoids in the coarse fraction. In general shells are scarcer
than in the bay sediments. Silt is the dominant size grade, unlike the bay
sediments. where clay ordinarily is far more abundant. Lenses of sandy
sediment of variable thickness and continuity are common. CaC03 is distinctly lower than in the bay environments.
8. The outer shelf sediments differ from those of the inner shelf in
having a considerable abundance of the easily recognized pelagic Foraminifera,
and a higher content of CaC03. In the area off St. Joseph and Matagorda
islands the outer shelf has a high clay content and very little sand but sand
is more abundant on the northeast.
By using these environment indicators and assemblages of fossils, it
has been possible to differentiate the depositional environments of deposits
found in a series of borings made to maximum depths of 85 feet in the bays,
65 feet on the barrier islands, and 60 feet on the delta of the Guadalupe
River. It was found that bay deposits extend to as much as 80 feet under
the axis of lower San Antonio Bay before encountering sediments deposited
during the time of a late glacially lowered sea-level. Barrier island
deposits of the Recent cycle continue to depths of 60 feet under the islands.
In contrast, bay deposits comparable with those of the present bays are found
under the Guadalupe Delta below depths of 5-8 feet and under the lagoon side
of Matagorda Is land- bay depos its are found below about 30 feet. Sediments
from an offshore boring in 42 feet of water furnished by the Humble Oil &
Refining Company show about 12 feet of shelf deposits underlain by about
60 feet of barrier island sediments. Carbon-14 determinations by the
Magnolia Petroleum Company Field Research Laboratories show that the deeper
deposits under the bays are contemporaneous in part with the rise of sea-level
following the glacial period and that the sands of the barrier islands began
to grow upward at least 6,500 years ago as islands or shoals. Carbon-14
dates also indicated that the protected bay sediments were first deposited
about 9,500 years before the present.
Studies of early diagenesis of these central Texas coast sediments
have shown that the clays have lost far less water by compaction than have
sediments in the deep basins off California, probably because of more rapid
deposition in the Texas area. The stiffening of the clays found at depths
of 20 feet or more under San Antonio Bay is attrib~ted more to the relative
increase of effective porosity than to loss of water. At the greater depths
in the borings the clays show some shaly partings. Chemically there is an increase in the chloride ion content between the overlying water and the surface
sediment but only an irregular increase with depth. Sulphate ion shows no net
decrease to depths of at least 7 or B feet, which is in contrast to the conditions in the California basins.

PRIMARY STRUCTURES IN SOME RECENT SEDIMENTS I
Edwin D. McKee
Abstract by
John To Twining
Shell Oil Company
Data obtained from studies on the origin and
sis of stratification and cross-strati cation in Recent sediments of selected environments
are useful for comparison with similar structures in ancient sedimentary
strata. Information from such comparisons is of value both (I) in ascertaining the type of environment of a past period and (2) in the practical
work of correlating rock units. especially non-fossiliferous types, on
the basis of comparable structures. that is. the record of comparable
environmentSn
Beach environment, - The beach (or shore) can be divided into a
foreshore or part lying between the crest and the ordinary low-water mark,
and a backshore or a part covered by water during exceptional storms only.
The sheet-like form and distinctive lamination are primary features of beach
deposits. Stratification in each part is distinctive because of the unique
combinations of factors that control its development. Deposits of the lower
foreshore have not been examined in detail but are different from those of
the upper foreshore and are notably irregular because of the formation of
ridges and troughs (with axes parallel with the coast line), basins, small
sand bars, tidal pools. and other irregularities.
The beach on Mustang Island near Corpus Christi, Texas, represents
a typical example of deposits developed on a low, flat coastal plain, bordered by a shallow sea tS~e Plate 38). At low tide the foreshore beach is
approximately 100-140 feet wide and its surface slopes seaward with a dip
of 20 _5 0 • Upper limits of the foreshore beach are concealed in. most places
by small mounds of wind-drifted sand and these cover parts and locally, all
of the backshore beach. Where not covered by drift sand, the backshore
slopes inland, with a dip as great as 2 0 , and merges imperceptibly into
lagoon deposits.
. Sand on the beach of Mustang Island is very uniform, dominantly finegrained quartz sand with good sorting. Upper foreshore deposits consist of
strata that are regular, even, and have gentle slopes. Most sets of strata
dip seaward up to 50, but others dip similar amounts in divergent directions
- - the effect of large beach cusps that form ridges transverse to the
strand at intervals of about 125 feet. The low angles and long, even surfaces of these beach structures seem to be characteristic of upper foreshore
deposits in other areas and to be distinctive of this physiographic environment.
Backshore deposits of Mustang Iiland are characterized in most places
by irregular~ties in stratification and, locally, by beds with steeper dips
(6°-12 0 ). Debris, such as pieces of charcoal and layers of carbon, tends to
destroy any semblance to evenness of bedding; local channeling and irregular
erosion surfaces and typical features.

Beach deposits in other areas similar structures to thos of
the Texas Gulf Coast. Along the coast of Ca lifornia beaches are gen8I;alIy
sented only by
hare sediments deposited at the
e of wave-cut
cliffs. The dips of stratification of these foreshore deposits commonly is
7 0 _8 0 but ranges up to 100 and the sand, locally derived from wave-cut cliffs,
contains a mixture of mineral types which are commonly sorted by the waves
into alternating light and dark laminae.
Beaches along the ~oast of Sonora, Mexico show abnormal structures.
In Cholla Bay, restricted wave action results in a lack of distinctive lamination. Instead, only crude layers, one to several inches thick, composed
of poorly sorted detritus and shell material of irregular shapes, are
developed. These layers have abnormally high angles of dip (10 0 -20 0 ).
Sand dune stratification. - The sediments that form dunes are dominantly of fine-grained quartz sand with good sorting. Rounded shape and
frosted grains are common. Saltation up the gentle windward slope causes
the sand to become ripple-marked and firmly packed, while on the lee side
where avalanching prevails, the sand is loosely packed but well sorted and
forms much steeper slopes. Laminae in most dune deposits average 2-3 millimeters thick. Variations in lamination pattern result from (1) irregular
slumping, (2) changes in wind strength and direction, (3) alternations of
removal and deposition and (4) influences of vegetation. Despite many
local changes. constancy of direction and type of stratification appears
to be the distinctive feature of sand dunes.
Transverse dunes on Mustang Island, Texas. - Well developed transverse dunes cover a large area parallel with and bordering on the beach
(see Plate 38). They are formed with crest ridges that are nearly straight
for distances of 200-400 feet and are oriented approximately at right angles
to the shoreline. Vegetation along the borders of some active dunes has
anchored them,cBusing them to lose form and turn into blowouts. Dips on
the windward sides of the dunes vary from 7 0 to 15° on the lee sides from
30 0 to 34°. The windward sides are covered with ripple marks, mostly oriented
with.crests normal to the wind direction and parallel with the dune ridges.
Lee sides are marked by slumping in many places ,/
Alluvial fans. - Alluvial fans are formed only in areas of bold

ENVIRONMENTS AND FACIES OF EXISTING BAYS
.
ON THE CENTRAL TEXAS COAST(l)
Harry S. Ladd, at al
Abstract by
Go Herblin
Tidewater Oil Company

A well
ser s of barrier islands extend along the
s
coast
om t
mouth of the Colorado River to the Rio Grande. In the
central
on of these islands the land and bays are all but s
ted
from the Gulf
co
for a
If dozen passes and bayous.
These bays, passes, and the Gulf provide various environmental conditions
whieh are adaptable to temperate organisms in the winter and tropical
organisms in the summer. A distinct faunal environment is primarily
controlled by the salinity of the waters within the bays. The environmental conditions in the bays Bnd the open Gulf are divided into a number
of facies; c~osed bays, polyhaline bays, B highly saline lagoon, passes,
beaches and shallow waters in the open Gulf (See Plate 39). The varying
conditions within the closed bay divides it into three facies, the bay
head, inter-reef, Bnd reef. In a survs, made from Hynes Bay (a bay head)
in a closed bay to the Gulf the saline content of , the waters steadily incr.eases from 40~oo in Hynes Bay to 32 0100 in the Gulf. The environmental
conditions undergo continued temporary changes due to seasonal changes,
such as freezes, northers blowing water out of the shallow bays, tidal
variations, storms such as hurricanes at sea which force Gulf waters into
the bays inc~easing the salinity, and inland rains which dump fresh run-off
water in the bays -lowering the salinity, and long droughts. The drought
which started in the South Texas coastal area in 1950, increased the
salinity to an extreme 40 0100 parts of Aransas and Copano Bays.
The sediments in these bays consists mainly of sand and finer
due to the flat coastal lands causing sluggish stream ru~~off.
The bay bottoms in general are composed of mud containing plates of
selenite, although coarse material in the form of shells is abundant in
all coastal water from the bays to the beaches of the open Gulf. The
well-known oyster reefs cover only a small portion of the bay bottoms.
d~posits

Some of the more characteristic fauna recognized in the bay head
facies are the heavy shelled Rangia, ostracodes, and three genera of
foraminifers Rotalia, Elphiditim and Noniono Some living species examples
are Rangia cuneata, Mulinia lateralis, and the razor clam Ensis minor •.
These fauna are found in Mission Lake, Hynes Bay, Upper San Antonio Bay,
and Opper St. Charles Bay.
The characteristic fauna for the inter-reef facies is similar to
that of the bay head facies. The motile fauna in this area are present
according to the season; the less motile fauna flourish depending on the
season which satisfies that requirement. Examples of inter-reef facies
are: Lower S10 Char les BRY, Copa no Bay, Lower
n Antonio Bay, Mesquite
Bay and Upper
nsas Bayo
(l)GeolOqical Society of America, Memoir 67, 1957, Volo 2, Chapter 2,
pp. 599-6390

The reef facies has few faunal species but the ones
sent
are abundant in number, such as oysters (Crassostrea virginicB) and
mussels (Brachidontes). Some reefs have an abundance of small gastropods such as Odostomia and Anachis. The reefs have the appearance of
a mound, with live oysters located on the flanks. In general there
are two types of reefs, those that form parallel to the current and
ones which form at right angles to the current. Characteristic reef
facies in this area are Lower S10 Charles Bay, Copano Bay, and Upper
Aransas Bay.
The Polyhaline bay facies contains far more fauna than the
three sub-facies of the closed bay facies aboveo Much of the fauna
within this facies is typically marine. Lower Aransas Bay and Redfish

The open Gulf facies are indirectly related to those of the bays,
as they are the source of the invading species. The open Gulf facies
is divided into two facies, near-shore and offshore.

A highly saline lagoon is referred to as a hypersaline facies;
it is developed in an area of arid and semi-arid conditions and has a
saline content similar to that of the Gulf. Fauna of the facies are few,
consisting mostly of euryhaline organisms derived from less saline b~ys
nearby or from the open Gulf. Laguna Madre is a hypersaline facies.

CLAY DUNE FORMATION NEAR CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS}

Abstract by
Fred M. Thompson, Jr.
Sinclair Oil & Gas Company
Clay dunes are reported in saline basins of central New Mexico,
southeastern Australia and the arid Bonneville Flats of Utah and the
Lechuguilla Desert of Arizona. In coastal Texas, they range from
central St. Charles Bay to the Rio Grande. They are scattered across
the semi~arid and arid zones of the Southwest. Near Corpus Christi they
are numerous along the west and north banks of Oso Creek.
Clay dunes are elongate ridges of windblown clay lying along the
lee sides of saline mud flats of lagoons, estuaries and intermittent
saline lakes on the sides away from the directions of the stronger drying
winds of the hot season, being transverse to these wind directions by
nngles less than 90 0 • The dunes are upwards of 30 feet high, 1500 feet
wide and several miles in length (See Plate 16).
Clay dunes form in climates where evaporation on the average
exceeds precipitation. Mud flats are there alternately exposed to
wetting and drying. The drying flats crust over and crack. Mud crack
polygons curl up and are blown to sbore, breaking down to sand~sized
pellets with dust. Evaporate crystals may granulate the crust and an
algal mat may form on it.
The clay pellets and some dust accumulate above tide levels
along the shoreline and slowly form dune ridges. The rate of growth is
controlled by the climate and its variations. The dunes of the Texas
coast seem to grow about 1 foot per 100 years on the average.

DIMENSIONAL GRAIN ORIENTATION rT9DIES
OF RECENT COASTAL SANDS
Joseph R. Curray
Abstract by
Thomas J. Wintermute
Sand-grain orientation studIes were made on
undisturbed
samples taken from Recent coastal sands along the
st,
lifornia
and North Carolina. This study was undertaken to
ne if individual sand grains exhibited a preferred orientatIon with respect to the
directions of movement of the agents ~f deposition (water and wind).
The results of the study indicate that sand grains tend to have their
long dimensions or axes oriented parallel with the prevailing direction
of movement of the water or wind currents. Sand grains from oriented
samples of beach sands align their long axes parallel to both the incoming and out-going (back wash) movements of w~ter on the beach, and
approximately perpendicular to the beach trend, although some deviation may result from the influence of long shore currentso Wind deposited sand grains also show a preferred orientation in that their
long axes becomes aligned with the prevailing direction of wind.
Nearly 2500 grains were measured from several wind deposited
samples taken on Mustang and Padre ~sland on the South Texas Gulf Coast.
Samples from Mustang Island east of Corpus ,Christi Bay indicated a long
axis grain orientation average direction of S 58 0 E, prevailing winds
coming from S 29 0 E. On Padre Island immediately east of Baffin Bay
and about 40 miles south southeast of Corpus Christi samples indicated
a grain orientation of S 36 0 E. where prevailing winds come from
S 31 E. Samples were collected from the dry, back parts of the
beaches and from the dunes behind the beaches.
Possible applications of grain orientation resulting from
this study are:
1. Grain orientation should allow prediction of the direction
of transport and hence impli~ate the direction of the source area •.

2. When the origin of the environment of a shoestring sand
is known along with the preferred grain orientation the trend or long
axis of the sand body may be predicted. Preferred grain orientation
in strand line type stratigraphic traps should be aligned perpendicular to the producing trendo Grain orientation in channel sand type
of stratigraphic traps should be aligned in a direction parallel to
the producing trend.
3. An apparent correlation between preferred grain orientation
and other mass properties of sediments indicates that grain orientation is related to the electric, magnetic, sound velocity and directional permeability properties ot sands.

OCCURRENCE OF HYDROCARBONS IN RECENT SEDIMENTS

The Texas Company
Many theories concerning the orIgIn of petroleum have emerged sim~

held premise embraces the deposition of organic material in a marine or
brackish water environment. Recently a school of thought has developed
which says that oil formation m*y begin soon after the deposition of organic matter in sediments. This study proved that fatty and aromatic

Samples of Recent sediments from the Grand Isle and Pelican Island
areas of Loqisiana 9 the Gulf of Mexico off Corpus Christi and from Laguna

extracted from all of these samples. In examining cores from the Grand
Isle and Pelican Island areas it was determined that the sandy part of
the cores contained eight times as much hydrocarbon as did the silty clay
part in contact with it. ,This indicates some of the original hydrocarbon
content of the silty clay'may have been lost to the sand layer underlying
it. The organic matter in the sands was also more petroleum like than
that in the clays. By carbon 14 measurement apparent ages of 11,800 to
14,600 years were obtained for hydrocarbons extracted from the Grand Isle
core.
In general the amount of free hydrocarbons in the samples increased with increasing depth ~f buri~l while the amount or organic

RESUME OF LATE RECENT GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE GULF COAST

I

Rufus J. LeBlanc and Hugh AD Bernard
Abstract by
Theodore D. Cook
Shell Oil Company
The writers point out differences of opinion held, on the one hand
by Gulf Coast geologists and on the other by Dutch geologists regarding
the Recent history of sea-level changes. This paper admirably summarizes
the evidence gathered by the Gulf Coast workers and offers conclusive evidence that sea-level reached its present stand approximately 5000 years ago
Bnd since that time there have been no relative changes such as the drop of
6 meters (19.7 feet) which the Dutch postulate.
Fisk, after extensive studies on the Gulf Coast has recognized two
stages in the Recent geologic history. The rising-sea-level stage began
about 25,000 ycars ago with melting of the last Pleistocene glaciers.
Gradual rise in the sea-level continued until approximately 5,000 years ago
when the second, or standing-sea level change began.
Stuqies conducted by Dutch geologists, especially Umbgrove. present
the following sequence of events: With the melting of the last Pleistocene
glaciers 25,000 years ago, sea-level rose to a maximum about 5,000 years ago
but fell again between 3,000 BC' and 850 AD by about 6 meters. Following
850 AD there has been a slight rise in sea-level. The present level is
considered to stand about 6 meters lower than it did 5,000 years ago. These
.
two theories are graphically presented on Plate 40.
Extensive field evidence has shown that the late Qu~ternary coastal
plain can be divided into two principal physiographic units, the Recent
coastal plain and inland from it the late Pleistocene (last interglacial)
plain, which have very similar sedimentary nistories.
The large Mississippi deltaic plain of southeastern Louisiana with
its several sub-deltas, their distributary ridges and interdistributary
lowlands has been deposited during the last 5,000 years with sea-level at
its present position. Radio-carbon dating and physiographic data support
this conclusion. The updip alluvial valley yields a substratum of poorly
sorted sands and gravels (rising sea-level deposits) and a finer top stratum
deposited by meandering courses contemporaneous with the formation of the
several sub~deltas. Similar features occur in all valleys of the Gulf
Coast from western Florida to Mexico.
West of the delta an extensive area nf mud flat, marsh, and abandoned beach ridges has formed contemporaneously with the deltaic plain. This
chenier plain is approximately 12 miles wide and all beach ridges, the oldest
inland and the youngest at the coast, vary in elevation from 0 to 12 feet.

Major rivers of the Texas coast
zos-Colorado and Rio Grande)
have constructed huge deltaic plains with features similar to those of
the Mississippi delta. Small streams are building deltas .at the heads
of the bays but at a slower rate.
Interdeltaic sediments on the Texas Coast form a narrow band
characterized by barrier islands, lagoons and marshes. and sand dunes.
Data suggest that barriers accrete seaward by development of beach
ridges up to 12 feet in height at a very slow rate.
Excellent physiographic data on the late Pleistocene surface
indicate that it was developed similarly to that of the Recent at
standing sea-level during the last Pleistocene interglacial stageo
Subsequent to deposition the Pleistocene surface has tilted seaward to
plunge under the Recent near the coast and rise above it inland. Had
sea-level been up to 19 feet higher during the last 5,000 years, much
of the well pteserved coastal-plain surface would have been eroded and
marine sediments would cover large areas which are of doubtless both
deltaic in origin and Pleistocene and Recen; in age.
The contact between Recent and late Pleistocene as used by Fisk
and the authors of this paper is rather easily recognized. Soft sediments with high water content unconformably overlie Pleistocene clays
which were subjected to considerable weathering, oxidation and water
loss during a lower stand of sea-level during the last glacial stage.
Evidence presented by the Dutch to explain the Recent sea-level
changes can be related to shifting sites of active deltaic sedimentation
simultaneously with gradual subsidence and wave erosion of abandoned delta fringes. Physiographic features of the Dutch coast have Recent
counterparts on the Gulf Coast which are known to have developed without
enstatic sea-level changes.

GENESIS OF OLIGOCENE SANDSTONE RESERVOIR
SEELIGSON FIELD" JIM WELLS AND KLEBERG C]!]NTIESg TEXASl
Ro Ho Nanz, Jro
Abstract by
Rogge Marsh
Humble Oil & Refining Co.
The express purpose of this study was to
ne the
eter
and probable genesis
a stri
- or lens sand representative of those found in oil
elds along the Gulf CoasL
od 19--B was
used for this study because: (1) it is geologically young and prnbably
still ~etains some indication of its environmental origin; (2) its
depositional environment is probably represented in present day Gulf
Coast environments; (3) it has experienced only mild structural deformation, and (4) there is a great deal of easily - accessible information on
the reservoiro
Sand 19-8 is a part of the Oligocene - Frio strata of Seeligson
field in the central part of the Rio Grande embayment in the Frio Vidksburg trend of oil fields. The accumulation in this lenticular sand
arises from normal faulting and gentle doming. By August, 1949, after 6
years of production, Zone 19-B had produced about 8 million barrels of
oil, approximately one-eighth of the total production of the field.
The stratigraphic frame work was specified by cross sections,
fence diagrams. isopach maps and facies mapso The sediments were characterized by size, shape, thin section, X-ray, differential thermai and
chemical analysis.
The major results of the study are as follows~ (1) the trend
(Plate 4"1) of sand 19-B is essentially at right angles to the regional
depositional strike; (2) the sand body has three textural zones, with
the coarsest zone forming the lower part and the finest zone at the top;
(3) the mineralogy of the sand is complex and reflects abr~sional immaturity (Plate 20); (4) muo fragments are common constituents of the
deposit. In all these characteristics, and in the absence of fossils,
sand 19-8 is similar to Recent deltaic-plain deposits of its own geologic
province, and is dissimilar to any Recent beach, dune, or marine sands of
the area examined. Since it is reasonable to assume that any sedimentation
in the Rio Grande embayment in Oligocene time was similar to Recent deposition in that area, the data in this paper point overwhelmingly to the conclusion that sand 19-8 represents the normal deltaic-plain depositional
product of an Oligocene river, probably an ancestral Rio Grande or a
tributary thereofo
The often stated opInIon that oil-field trends of the Gulf Coast
are "shore-line" trends has led many geologists to infer that the reservoir
sands of these oil fields are strand~line depositso The conclusions of the
present study emphasize the risk of such deductionso The trends may be indirectly related to shore lines
reason of marine ouree beds, but many.
or ~ossibly most, of the reservoir sands aTe probably of continental origin.

MICROFOSSILS AS ENVIRONMENT INDI~ORS IN MA~E SHALES I
Samuel Po Ellison, Jr.
Abstract by
Riehard W. Holt
Shell Oil
ny
Interpretations of
ition81 environments
microfossils
are based primarily on a comparison of
ssil ssemblages with microorganic remains of recent sediments.
An inventory of environmental factors, realms of environments, Bnd
kinds of microfossils is needed to make environmental i
tations. Of
many environmental
ctors,
hand t
ture
water, light conditions,
character of bottom sediments, water movement, distance from s .
phy
of
acent land, salini
of WD
,amounts
di olved
bon dioxide and
oxygen, organic content, food supply, and associated organisms are among the
most important
0

Realms of environment ra
from tidal flats, nd shallow lagoons to
littoral, and neritic, downward to the
thyl and abyssal depths (See Plate
42A). It is known that organisms living in water to depths of 50 meters
sustain wide temperature variations while organisms living in water from 50
to 200 meters withstand moderate temperature variationso Below 200 meters
the temperature range is restricted to about 4 degrees centigrade. Estimates indicate that water of 50 meters depth is almost a maximum at which
photosynthesis can take place. Thus a break between the inner and outer
neritic is arbitrarily based upon a change from light to dark and a change
from wide temperature variations to a restricted temperature zone.

A large variety of microfossils and micro-organisms are often available to the micropaleontologist for interpretive purposes. Although there
are many plants and animals and their embryos, parts, and fragments which
offer valuable data, foraminifers have been employed to a greater extent
because of their widespread geologic and geographic range. They have been
found to be very responsive to their environments. Relatively little is
completely known about the environmental habits of many other micro-organisms
th"ereby opening a number of fields to research.
The distribution of micro-organisms and their remains must be understood to accurately interpret environments
Generally they live and die
within community boundaries. In Plate 42 B the theoretical distributions
of living organism& (capital letters) is given relative to a distribution of
dead organisms (small letters)o After death the remains are incorporated in
the sedimento A large percentage ~f skeletons is deposited immediately below
the corresponding living community. In shallow water where wave and current
action is most active much transportation may take place before deposition.
Below the normal level of wave action, skeletons are usually deposited either
below the living community or down sl
as 8 result of gravity, mud slides,
and turbid!
currents. Sessile communiti

planktonic, nektonic, and pelagic organisms may supply skeletons to any
environment. Benthonic organisms are the best indicators of temperature,
amount of light and other bottom conditions. It may also be noted t t
the upper limits of temperature and depth are more important for interpretation of environments than the lower limits because of the scatt~ring
of skeletons by various transporting agents.
Quantitative studies promise to be the best tools for interpreting
depositional environments. Essentially the methods are similar to those
of sedimentary analysis. Actual population 60unts or estim1tions are often
made to help reconstruct environmental patterns. Israelsky illustrates
the importance of actual population counts in his classical quantitative
study.
Since microfossils are integral parts of sediments, f~unal assemblages and lithology of sedimentary units should be considered together.
As the fauna and lithology are considered together so should each microfossil suite be coordinated with a paleogeographic setting.

Through a consideration of .environmental factors, types of environments, kinds of microfossils, the effects of gravity and transportation
agencies, faunal assemblages, and lithology, the reconstruction and interpretation of depositional environments is made possible.
