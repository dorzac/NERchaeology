Abstract
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources survey
of 40 acres of land owned by the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas (KTTP), southeast of
Eagle Pass in Maverick County, Texas that is to be transferred to federal Trust Lands under the
control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and the Texas
State Historical Preservation Office (SHPO) provided overall review of the project.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey during the period 20-22 September 2010. A thorough
pedestrian survey of the surface area was conducted, and 5 shovel tests, and 25 backhoe trenches
were excavated. No evidence of cultural material was observed either on or below the surface,
and therefore no artifacts were collected or curated.
In addition, although a concrete pad for a mobile home, an abandoned circa 1970s - 1980s house,
and a pole barn are currently on the northern portion of the project area, no historic structures 45
years or older, either extant or razed, were present either within or adjacent to the project area.
As such, TAAI recommended that the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas be allowed to
transfer ownership of the 40 acres as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were subsequently encountered during any
future development, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.

Introduction
During the period 20-22 September 2010, Tierras
Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian
survey of approximately 40 acres owned by the
Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas (KTTP). The
archaeological survey was funded by the KTTT as
well. The 40 acres is a portion of 85 acres that is
currently owned by the Tribe, but a review of the Texas
Atlas of Archeological Sites and the Principal
Investigator’s personal knowledge of the area
indicated that approximately 45 of the 85 acres had
previously been subjected to formal archaeological
surveys.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area is located on recent Holocene
fluviatile Rio Grande terrace deposits (Qt)
consisting of gravel, sand, silt, and clay (Barnes
1976). Soils over 95 percent of the project area
consist of the Lagloria series (LgA, LgB).
These are deep loamy soils of calcareous
alluvium on stream terraces. Due to their
position on generally gently sloping landscapes,
their rate of erosion is slight. A typical pedon
of Lagloria series soils is comprised of light
brownish-gray very fine sandy loam from the
surface to about 37 cm, followed by pale
brown, very friable, and very fine sandy loam.
Below that, to about 2 m, is very fine sandy
loam with slightly differing strata of loam, silt
loam, and silty clay loam.

Figure 3. Geologic map of the project area.
The remaining five percent, in the northern
portion of the project area, is Mavco loam
(MaB). The upper 15 cm is pale brown and
friable. Underlying that is 45 cm of light
yellowish brown and friable clay loam. Beneath
this is very pale brown clay loam with lime
masses about 25 percent by volume (Stevens
and Arriaga 1977:13-16; Sheet 44).
Although less than one percent of the land in
Maverick County is considered to be prime
farmland (Ochoa 1996), the lower portion of the
project area is a pecan grove (Figure 5).
Numerous irrigation canals in the area attest to
Figure 4. Soils in the project area.
the productivity that the land possesses if given
sufficient water. The project area north of the
canal has recently been cleared of trees and brush with heavy machinery, and root plowed. In the
2

process, approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters) of soil across the entire project area has been
disturbed, and as much as 36 inches (90 cm) where trees have been uprooted (Figure 6).

Climate
Maverick County is located in the South Texas archaeological region, and more specifically
within the lower Rio Grande Plain (Arbingast et al. 1973; Norwine 1995). The county is
generally frost-free from mid-February through early December, allowing for a 285-day growing
season. The average annual rainfall at Eagle Pass is just under 21 inches, with most rainfall
occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result of thunderstorms bearing moist air
from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean much farther to the west. However,
the rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration affects
in the Maverick County area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is
another reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout
the area. Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F,
although humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall,
the county’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe (Ochoa 1996; Vierra 1998).

Hydrology
The Rio Grande is the major southeasterly trending river draining the South Texas region. On
the eastern edge of the KTTT project area is one of many drainages that intermittently flow into
the Rio Grande during infrequent seasonal periods of abundant rainfall. Although there are many

3

springs in Maverick County, very few
are active due primarily to the dip of
the substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. As a result, some of these active
seeps/springs can be found on the
Mexican side of the national border.
Ancient springs that may have existed
in Maverick County at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981).
During our investigation of the project
area in September 2010, the Figure 7. The Rio Grande flows 300 meters south,
intermittent drainage that is a first order and 500 west of the project area on a rainy and
tributary of the Rio Grande was dry, but cloudy day following Hurricane Hermine remnants;

meters south of the project area was
flowing wide and strong (Figure 7); likely due in part from storms created by the westward
movement and remnants of Hurricane Hermine that recently made landfall on the coast of
northern Mexico.

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas
Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined
by Gould (1975), and the regional flora of
South Texas has been classified as being part
of the Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 8 and 9).
This is the only part of Texas where some
vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year
(Blair 1950). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent
occurrence, with a mix of woody and
grassland species providing a savanna
environment during prehistoric times (Archer
1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964).
The original vegetation was an open grassland
mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and Figure 8. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of
ash were common along perennial streams. Texas.
4

Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has changed
the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny hackberry,
brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221).
On sandy soils, the brush includes mesquite
with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils
support mesquite (Proposis juliflora), various
species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or
desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae
(Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum
texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly
pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and
Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits
some of the greatest mammalian species
diversity in the state. Sixty-one species of
mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several
species of turtles, salamanders, and frogs are
present in the region (Blair 1950).
Approximately 50 species of fish have been
identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al.
1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of South Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytolyths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago. Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago
was much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
around Maverick County that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater
changes have been induced by human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along
5

the river and streams for construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has
lowered water tables, and overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs,
and streams in the area, they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter
intervals than exist at the present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The KTTT project area lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester
(1980). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the compressed
nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within the region.
Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as
such offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region. All dates
are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995:433–436).
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the
early Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
6

period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological
sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a
movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating
to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between
ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989a:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
7

more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
8

is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
9

Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, and approximately 20 miles south of the current project area,
the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700 ([now modern-day Guerrero] [
Weddle 2003]). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real in southern
Maverick County enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas
throughout the 1700s and 1800s. The Canary Islanders who were brought in to settle early San
Antonio came through Maverick County in 1730. Ranching activity in the area began as early
as 1765. The county’s namesake, Samuel A. Maverick ventured through the county in the early
1800s. Although a generally desolate area inhabited by roaming bands of Native Americans, a
Dr. John Charles Beales established roots in the area in 1834.
With the advent of the Mexican War with the United States in 1846, Camp Eagle Pass, and later
named Fort Duncan was established in 1849. In 1850, the community of Eagle Pass was platted,
and Piedras Negras across the Rio Grande was founded. Mexican families from across the river
expanded into Texas, and these families trace their roots to the early development of Eagle Pass.
The first post office in Eagle Pass was established in 1851. In the ensuing years, lawlessness
prevailed, with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.
In 1856, Maverick County was established from territory broken off from Kinney County. Prior
to the Civil War, the citizens of Maverick County voted 80 to 3 to stay loyal to the Union.
Nevertheless, Confederate soldiers occupied Fort Duncan during the war. An extension of
civilization reached Eagle Pass when telegraph lines reached Fort Duncan from Fort Clark in
1875, and a new courthouse was completed ten years later in 1885.
Still very rural by 1900, the average size of farms in the county was over 37,000 acres, raising
sheep and cattle. Shortly thereafter, the Rio Grande was tapped to provide much needed
irrigation water for large crops of onions, figs, alfalfa, and cotton. In latter half of the 20th
century, the oil and natural gas, mining, and ranching fueled Maverick County’s economy
(Ochoa 1996).
The Kickapoos were first encountered by French explorers in the Great Lakes region in the
1640s. Although their seminomadic way of life suited them well, over the next 200 years they
were displaced both by encroaching white settlers, Indian removal policies, frontier violence, and
internal turmoil forced their relocation and tribal split. One of the three resulting factions moved
into northern Mexico and southern Texas around 1850. It was not until 1983 that they were
officially granted lands near El Indio and Eagle Pass. Their noted independence, self reliance,
and many of their traditions they practiced when first encountered by the French continue to this
day (Nunley 1996).

Previous Archaeological Investigations
Maverick County
Before about 1960, there was only a limited effort to record archaeological sites in Maverick
County. However, due in part to of an infusion of federal and state dollars into Maverick County
over the past 30-40 years, mandated cultural resource survey investigations have been enhanced,
resulting in the documentation of several previously undocumented archaeological sites. A few
of the early local historians who attempted to document sites in the 1960s were Ben Pingenot,
John Woodhull, and Charles Downing.
The first major archaeological survey in the county was conducted in 1975 by J. P. Nunley south
of Eagle Pass. In that effort he recorded 42 sites as part of the Guerrero Gateway Project
(Hunziker 1998). Another large survey conducted on the Dos Republicas Coal Mine property
northeast of Eagle Pass resulted in the documentation of another 42 sites (Uecker 1994; Uecker
and Warren 1994). In her study of 190 archaeological sites recorded in Maverick County,
Johanna Hunziker (1998) found that although projectile points ranging in antiquity from the
Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric have been recovered, the most commonly found point
types could be associated with the Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.). The most common Late
Archaic point types included Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Matamoras, Edgewood, and Figuerora. Of
those sites with diagnostics, approximately half were single component, and half were
multicomponent.
In a sample of 94 components where elevation was known, Late Archaic components comprised
36% of the total, 23% Middle Archaic, 19% Early Archaic, and 19% Late Prehistoric. Middle
Archaic sites tended to be located at higher elevations, Late Archaic at lower elevations, and Late
Prehistoric components even lower, along creeks. Based upon these same 94 components, and
extrapolating for differences in temporal periods, Hunziker demonstrates that the sites were few
in number through the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, increased somewhat during the
Middle Archaic, more than doubled in the Late Archaic, and then remained relatively constant
through the Late Prehistoric period. Only on 12 of the 94 component sites were burned rock
middens or burned rock concentrations observed; 17 had ground stone fragment, 42 contained
freshwater mussel shells, and human burials were found on four sites.
Cultural Resources Studies within One Mile of the Project Area
Numerous sources were reviewed to determine the cultural resource investigations that existed
within one mile of the project area. They included a review of the Texas Atlas database of
archaeological sites and surveys, and various published archaeological reports. In addition, a
1941 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Eagle Pass topographic map was obtained from the Perry
Casteñeda Libray at The University of Texas at Austin. The topographic map indicated that there
were no structures existing on the project area at the time, and corroborated the statement by Mr.
Jose Martinez (personal communication, August 4, 2008) that the tract had been used only for
agricultural purposes for many years.
11

A review of the Texas Atlas database revealed that there had been multiple surveys within close
proximity to the project area beginning in 1990. In 2004, SWCA conducted a cultural resources
survey of the proposed 220-acre Rosita Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and related
facilities and utility rights-of way. The western edge of the 220 acres is located approximately
0.8-mile northeast of the project area. Sites 41MV302 and 41MV303 were documented within
the 220-acre parcel. 41MV302 is located approximately 1.5 miles from the project area and
described as a short term camp and resource procurement site in an upland area above Rosita
Creek. No diagnostics or intact features were observed, and the site was considered as not
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). 41MV303 is located approximately 1.2 miles east of the project area. It is a
large camp and procurement site on the Rosita Creek terraces, and has Middle and Late Archaic
diagnostics. Limited testing at the site indicates that its eligibility for listing on the NRHP or as
an SAL is indeterminate (Carpenter 2005).
Part of SWCA’s 2004 project included a linear survey of an effluent line extending
southwestward from the WWTP to the Rio Grande. This line extends through the southern end
of the current KTTP Riverpark Subdivision. Site 41MV247 was documented in this location by
Prewitt and Associates in 2000 (Ringstaff et al. 2000), and SWCA re-evaluated it in 2004 while
surveying the WTTP effluent line. SWCA estimated the site as an open campsite that its northern
edge where the effluent line was to be installed had been heavily disturbed, and with no intact
features. As such, clearance was subsequently granted by the Texas Historical Commission to
proceed with construction of the effluent line through the northern portion of the site.
As stated above, Prewitt and Associates first documented 41MV247 in 2000; this was a survey
conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a proposed new housing
area project for the KTTP. The northern edge of Prewitt’s survey area lies approximately 250
m south of the KTTP housing area project, but site 41MV247 extends from the northern edge
of that survey area to the southern edge of the current project area, and as stated, the effluent line
surveyed by SWCA impacted its northen edge. Within the Prewitt and Associates survey area
(approximately 1.3 miles south of the current KTTT project), they also discovered site
41MV259, an historic site with historic ceramics, glass, bricks, and a shell button. However, the
site was located in an agricultural field that had been heavily disturbed by plowing (Ringstaff et
al. 2000).
A series of reconnaissance and water development surveys were conducted along the Rio
Grande west and northwest of the current project area in 1985, and again in 1990 in conjunction
with Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Water Development Board (EPA-TWDB)
interests, and another EPA-TPWD survey was conducted approximately 0.5 miles east of the
project area in 1990. All resulted in the discovery of no archaeological sites within one mile of
the current project area (Texas Atlas 2008).
In 2008, TAAI conducted a cultural resources linear survey of water and sewer line trench lines
to be dug in the new Riverpark Subdivision on lands owned by the KTTT. A total of 4,400 feet
of trenching would be excavated to accommodate main water and sewer lines, with an additional
12

3,300 feet of trenches to accommodate lateral lines onto house lots (1.45 miles total). A thorough
pedestrian survey of the surface area within and around the proposed water and sewer trench
lines was conducted, and 27 shovel tests, and four backhoe trenches were excavated. No
evidence of cultural material was observed either on or below the surface, and therefore no
artifacts were collected or curated. As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that
the KTTT be allowed to develop the tract as planned (Nickels 2008).

Methods and Levels of Effort During the Current Project
Preliminary Investigations
Prior to the fieldwork, in
addition to the review of the
Texas Atlas of Archeological
Sites and published and
unpublished reports of
investigations in the area and
region, aerial photographs and
topographic maps were
inspected.

Investigations
Principal Investigator and
Project Archaeologist David
Nickels, and Archaeological
Field Technician Jesse Nowak
met with Tribal Attorney Mr.
Robert Rodriguez, and Housing
Authority Manager Mr. José
Martinez on the morning of
September 20, 2010. We then
conducted a thorough onsite
visit and review of the
proposed areas and properties
that were slated to be turned

purpose of this preliminary
meeting was to ensure that there was no question as to where the archaeological survey was to

familiarize the archaeologists
with previous use of the land.
A total of 25 backhoe trenches
were then excavated within the
40-acre project area using a
backhoe with a 24-inch bucket
(Figures 10 and 11). The
backhoe trenches were
approximately 4-5 meters in
length, and ranged in depth
from 0.8 to 2.1 meters.
The backhoe operator removed
dirt in approximately 30-cm
levels, while the Principal

In addition, five trenches were
dug in the immediate area of BHT 6
(BHTs 6-1 through 6-5), and a shovel
test was dug into the bottom of each
(see Figures 10 and 11). All shovel tests
were 30 x 30-cm in circumference, and
were excavated to sterile sediments.
They were dug in 20-cm levels, and all
sediments were screened through ¼"
wire mesh.

Results of the Investigations
Surface and Subsurface Examinations
A brief description of the 25 backhoe
trenches is included in Appendix A. No
evidence of cultural features or artifacts
were observed either on the surface or
within any of the 25 backhoe trenches
and five shovel tests excavated. With
rare exceptions, the soils and sediments
observed within the backhoe trenches
mirrored the soil descriptions and pedon
profiles as described in the Soil Survey
of Maverick County (Stevens and
Arriaga 1977; see Project Setting,
above). As such, soils and sediments
observed in all of the trenches are very
redundant, and the remarks in Appendix Figure 13. Typical Lagloria series soil profile
A are therefore abbreviated in an attempt observed in west wall of BHT 14.
to emphasize aberrations or anomalies
from the norm.
A very typical profile of the deep,
loamy, and calcareous alluvium of the
Rio Grande, Lagloria series terrace
deposits was observed in BHT 14, and
is shown in Figure 13. The only BHT
where Mavco loam (MaB) was observed
was in BHT 18 (Figure 14) once again,
in a location that was mapped as such by
Stevens and Arriaga (1977) in the Soil
Survey of Maverick County.
During the course of trenching, a small Figure 14. Mavco loam soil profile with heavily
mass of charcoal and ephemerally disturbed upper 35-40 cm, and shallow underlying
burned earth was discovered 90 cmbs in cobbles and gravels observed in BHT 18; facing east.
BHT 6. Based upon the limited exposure offered by the width of the backhoe trench, it was not
conclusive whether or not the burned feature was cultural or natural. As such, excavations in BHT
6 were halted, and five adjacent trenches (BHTs 6-1 through 6-5) were opened to a depth of 80
cmbs (see Figure 11). A shovel test was then dug into the bottom of each of the adjacent trenches
from 80-120 cmbs. No evidence of cultural material or burning was found in any of the five

15

shovel tests. The burned feature in BHT
6 was then excavated by hand with a
trowel. The narrow “U” shape of the
burn outlined in the trench wall, grayish
burned earth above the charcoal, and its
tapered bottom, strongly suggested that
the feature was a naturally burned tree
root. Old timber acreage that has been
uprooted and burned in the immediate
area is common on the KTTP
reservation (Matt Garza, personal
communication, September 21, 2010),
and this feature is apparently a
manifestation of these past practices.

Figure 15. Burned tree root in the bottom of BHT 6,
80-115 cmbs.

No structures older than 45 years were
observed either within the project area
or on the periphery of the project area.
There is a concrete slab in the northern
portion of the project area where a
mobile home was located (see Figure 11)
(Matt Garza, personal communication,
September 21, 2010). Also in the
northern portion is a burned and
abandoned concrete block home that
likely dates to the 1980s or 1990s
surrounded by a chain-link fence
(Figures 11 and 16). Our observations of
this structure included a telephone box
with buried cable, PVC plumbing, and
modern electrical wiring. To the
northwest are the remains of a collapsed Figure 16. Burned and abandoned home in the
northern portion of the project area; facing northwest.
pole barn (see Figure 11).

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered 10% to 100% visibility within the project
area failed to reveal the presence of any historic or prehistoric cultural materials. In addition, no
cultural materials were found in any of a total of 25 backhoe trenches or five shovel tests
excavated across the project area.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
16

sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during future
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
