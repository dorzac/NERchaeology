MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 1 November 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of 3 off-site wastewater line rights-of-way (ROWs)
associated with the Paso Robles Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. Each
proposed ROW will measure 75.0 feet (ft) (22.9 meters [m]) in width. The proposed Centerpoint
ROW consists of 2 potential routes (A and B). The proposed Centerpoint Route A ROW
measures 3794.0 ft (1156.4 m) in length (6.5 acres), and the proposed Centerpoint Route B
ROW measures 2634.5 ft (803.0 m) in length (4.5 acres). The proposed Barnes ROW
measures 3755.2 ft (1144.6 m) in length (6.5 acres), and the proposed Stratford ROW
measures 5100.4 ft (1554.6 m) in length (8.8 acres). Overall, the area of potential effect (APE)
for the undertaking totals 26.3 acres. The proposed ROWs are located on private property, and
their construction will be privately funded. However, because they are located within the San
Marcos city limits, their construction is regulated by the San Marcos City Code and the San
Marcos Horizons Master Plan. Horizon conducted the intensive cultural resources survey of the
proposed ROWs on behalf of Brookfield Residential Properties, Inc. (BRP) in compliance with
the regulations of the San Marcos City Code and the San Marcos Horizons Master Plan. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located within the limits of
the proposed ROWs, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The survey of the proposed ROWs resulted in the reassessment of a portion of
previously recorded site 41HY418. Site 41HY418 was originally recorded as a multi-component
site consisting of a surficial historic-era scatter and an aboriginal lithic scatter that was
considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Horizon’s efforts found the portions of
site 41HY418 traversed by the proposed Centerpoint Route B to have been further impacted by
modern development. As a result, Horizon concurs with the original site recorder’s opinion that
site 41HY418 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Based on the fact that: 1) 41HY418 was originally recommended as ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP; 2) Horizon’s current investigations found the portions of site 41HY418
traversed by the proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW to have been further impacted by modern
development; and 3) Horizon’s survey efforts produced negative results on the remainder of the
proposed ROWs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed undertaking will have no adverse
impact to significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that the project be

human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed ROWs, even in previously surveyed areas, all
work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 3 Off-Site Wastewater Lines Associated with the Paso Robles
Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of 3
proposed off-site wastewater line rights-of-way (ROWs) associated with the Paso Robles
Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Each proposed ROW will
measure 75.0 feet (ft) (22.9 meters [m]) in width. The proposed Centerpoint ROW consists of 2
potential routes (A and B). The proposed Centerpoint Route A ROW measures 3794.0 ft
(1156.4 m) in length (6.5 acres), and the proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW measures 2634.5
ft (803.0 m) in length (4.5 acres). The proposed Barnes ROW measures 3755.2 ft (1144.6 m) in
length (6.5 acres), and the proposed Stratford ROW measures 5100.4 ft (1554.6 m) in length
(8.8 acres). Overall, the area of potential effect (APE) for the undertaking totals 26.3 acres.
The proposed ROWs are located on private property, and their construction will be privately
funded. However, because they are located within the San Marcos city limits, their construction
is regulated by the San Marcos City Code and the San Marcos Horizons Master Plan. Horizon
conducted the intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed ROWs on behalf of
Brookfield Residential Properties, Inc. (BRP) in compliance with the regulations of the San
Marcos City Code and the San Marcos Horizons Master Plan. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if any cultural resources were located within the limits of the proposed ROWs, and,
if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the proposed ROWs, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project, while Michael Mudd conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the proposed ROWs on 1 November 2011. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile on linear projects measuring 100.0 ft (30.5 m) in length. As such, a total of 35 shovel tests
were necessary along the 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers [km]) of proposed ROWs measuring 75.0 ft

(22.9 m) in width in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded these minimum
survey standards by conducting a total of 39 shovel tests along the proposed ROWs.
The survey of the proposed ROWs resulted in the reassessment of a portion of
previously recorded site 41HY418. Site 41HY418 was originally recorded as a multi-component
site consisting of a surficial historic-era scatter and an aboriginal lithic scatter that was
considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Horizon’s efforts found the portions of
site 41HY418 traversed by the proposed Centerpoint Route B to have been further impacted by
modern development. As a result, Horizon concurs with the original site recorder’s opinion that
site 41HY418 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Based on the fact that: 1) 41HY418 was originally recommended as ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP; 2) Horizon’s current investigations found the portions of site 41HY418
traversed by the proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW to have been further impacted by modern
development; and 3) Horizon’s survey efforts produced negative results on the remainder of the
proposed ROWs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed undertaking will have no adverse
impact to significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that the project be
allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the San Marcos City Code and the San Marcos
Horizons Master Plan. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed ROWs, even in previously surveyed areas, all
work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.
This report presents the results of this cultural resource survey. Following this
introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and cultural background,
respectively, of the area containing the proposed ROWs. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
archival research, and Chapter 5.0 presents the methods implemented during the survey.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project consists of the construction of 3 off-site wastewater lines that will
service the Paso Robles development located in southwestern San Marcos, Hays County,
Texas, near the Tangier Outlet Mall (see Figures 1 and 2). The 3 proposed wastewater line
ROWs can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ San Marcos South, Texas,
topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). Each proposed ROW will measure 75.0 ft (22.9 m) in
width. The proposed Centerpoint ROW consists of 2 potential routes (A and B). The proposed
Centerpoint Route A ROW measures 3794.0 ft (1156.4 m) in length (6.5 acres), and the
proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW measures 2634.5 ft (803.0 m) in length (4.5 acres). The
proposed Barnes ROW measures 3755.2 ft (1144.6 m) in length (6.5 acres), and the proposed
Stratford ROW measures 5100.4 ft (1554.6 m) in length (8.8 acres). Overall, the area of
potential effect (APE) for the undertaking totals 26.3 acres.
Both of the proposed Centerpoint ROW options initiate on the southeast side of Hunter
Road, just below the escarpment, and extend southeast across pastureland to an existing
railroad grade (see Figures 1 and 2). From that point, Route A turns to the northeast and
parallels the railroad grade up to Centerpoint Road. Route A then turns again to the southeast
and parallels the northeast side of Centerpoint Road, terminating at an existing wastewater line
located a short distance northwest of Interstate Highway (IH) 35 at Gregsons Bend (see Figures
1 and 2). From the existing railroad grade, Route B continues to the southeast beneath the
railroad grade via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). Once exiting the HDD, Route B turns to
the northeast and parallels the railroad grade to Centerpoint Road. Route B then turns again to
the southeast and parallels the southwest side of Centerpoint Road, terminating at an existing
wastewater line located a short distance northwest of IH-35 at Gregsons Bend (see Figures 1
and 2).
The proposed Barnes ROW also initiates on the southeast side of Hunter Road, just
below the escarpment, and extends southeast across pastureland along the northeast side of a
tributary of Cottonwood Creek. Upon reaching the IH-35 corridor, the ROW turns to the
northeast and parallels the IH-35 corridor before terminating at a HDD bore location on private
property that will serve to connect the Barnes ROW to the Statford ROW beneath IH-35 (see
Figures 1 and 2).
The proposed Statford ROW initiates at the aforementioned HDD bore location. Once it
passes beneath IH-35, this proposed ROW continues to the southeast across open pastureland

Cottonwood Creek within an existing wastewater line ROW to its terminus at another existing
wastewater line near McCarty Lane. Photographs of the proposed ROWs at the time of the
survey are presented in Figures 3 through 5.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed ROWs are all located within slightly undulating pastureland within the
Blackland Prairie just below the Balcones Escarpment (see Figure 1). Elevations across the
ROWs range between approximately 630.0 and 690.0 feet (190.0 to 210.3 m) above mean sea
level, with the elevations increasing predominantly from the southeast to the northwest.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Guadalupe River basin. The proposed
ROWs are drained to the southeast by Cottonwood Creek and its tributaries. Cottonwood
Creek flows to the southeast, joining York Creek approximately 9.5 miles (15.3 km) southeast of
the proposed ROWs. York Creek joins the San Marcos River a short distance to the southeast,
and the San Marcos River eventually joins the Guadalupe River southwest of Gonzales, Texas,
approximately 40.0 miles (64.3 km) southeast of the proposed ROWs. The Guadalupe River
eventually discharges into the Gulf of Mexico at San Antonio Bay, which is situated southeast of
Victoria between Calhoun and Refugio counties.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Hays County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 inches [in])
and temperature averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C
(96°F) in August (the warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During
this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from
30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to
50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less
than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

FLORA AND FAUNA

The proposed ROWs situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the Project Area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 3 Off-Site Wastewater Lines Associated with the Paso Robles
Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius

vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The proposed ROWs are located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas
Archeological Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a
generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to
much of the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have
changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The

14

Development in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas

first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
During the Spanish period, the region lay at the edge of the main route from San Antonio
to East Texas, the Old San Antonio Road 1. In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos crossed the
southern edge of the county on his way to the East Texas missions and the Red River. The
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition explored the upper San Marcos River in 1709, and Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis was attacked by Apaches in 1714 at the San Marcos River crossing. A
mission to be called San Marcos was authorized in 1729 near the site of present San Marcos,
but the authorization was later rescinded in favor of San Antonio. San Xavier Mission and San
Francisco Xavier Presidio were located briefly at the site in 1755-56, but no permanent
settlement was attempted until 1807, when some 80 persons were moved to the Old San
Antonio Road crossing of the San Marcos River. San Marcos de Neve, 1 of a chain of defense
settlements, was abandoned 4 years later, after flooding and attacks by Comanche and
Tonkawa Indians. To encourage settlement after the Mexican War for Independence, the
government of Coahuila and Texas issued land grants in the county to Juan Martín Veramendi
in 1831, Juan Vicente Campos in 1832, and Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. The first
Anglo-American settler in Hays County, Thomas G. McGehee, was issued a league of land in
1835 by the Mexican government and was farming north of the site of present San Marcos in
1846.
On 1 March 1848, the state legislature formed Hays County from territory formerly part
of Travis County. William W. Moon, Eli T. Merriman, and Mike Sessom, original settlers and
members of John Coffee Hays’ company of Texas Rangers, worked with General Edward
Burleson, a member of the Texas Senate, to have the new county named for Hays. County
organization and the designation of San Marcos as the county seat gave impetus to settlement;
the population grew from 387 in 1850 to 2,126 in 1860. The county shrank slightly on
12 February 1858, when it lost acreage to the new Blanco County and gained a portion of
Comal County. On 10 January 1862, the legislature again transferred another small area to
Blanco County. Boundaries remained stable for nearly a century, until resurvey of the HaysTravis county line in 1955 added more than 16,000 acres to Hays County.
A stage line from Austin to San Antonio crossed the county in 1848, the year that
Edward Burleson built the first sawmill. W.A. Thompson built the first cotton gin in the early
1850s, and, between 1855 and 1885, Ezekiel Nance built and operated 5 gins, 5 gristmills, a
sawmill, a shingle mill, and a beef packery. Alfred B.F. Kerr organized the first church in Hays

County in 1847, and a school was built at San Marcos in 1849. Another school was opened at
Snake Lake in 1851, and John D. Pitts built a school in Stringtown before 1860. The Johnson
Institute, founded in 1852 by Thomas Jefferson Johnson, drew students from a large area of
Central Texas until it closed in 1872.
The early settlers of Hays County were a mix of old Texans and Georgia and Arkansas
immigrants. With the coming of the Civil War, most of the residents favored secession. Colonel
Peter C. Woods’ 36th Texas Cavalry regiment was organized at Camp Clark, in neighboring
Guadalupe County, in 1862; Company A was primarily made up of Hays County men. During
the war, county beef helped to feed Confederate forces. Shortly after the war’s end, Colonel
George F. Snyder, a Georgian, established the first newspaper in Hays County, the Pioneer.
During Reconstruction, a Ku Klux Klan group was formed, and, in May 1876, a military
organization, the San Marcos Greys, was formed.
George Neill drove the first herd of cattle from Hays County to Kansas in 1867, and
other drives followed. Farming also became more profitable in the eastern part of the county
and helped encourage a fresh influx of settlers. By 1878, the county was out of debt, several
new communities had been organized, and schools had grown in number to match the
increased population. The Coronal Institute was founded in 1866 followed by the San Marcos
public school system in 1870. Southwest Texas Normal School was authorized at the turn of
the century and opened in 1903 as a teacher-training institution; it became Southwest Texas
State University in 1969. San Marcos Baptist Academy was established in 1907.
In 1880, the first Hays County rail line, built by the International-Great Northern Railroad,
was completed to San Marcos from Austin; it later extended to San Antonio. Another population
boom followed the railroad. The county population nearly doubled, from 7,555 in 1880 to
14,142 in 1900, and then remained virtually unchanged for the next 50 years despite the
influences of World War I and the depression of the 1930s. Even the economic stimulus of
World War II had only momentary effect. Hays County remained predominantly agricultural;
almost 90% of the mid-1960s farm income came from livestock. Not until the establishment of
the Gary Job Corps Training Center on the site of the former Gary Air Force Base in 1964 and
the growth of enrollment at the university in San Marcos did Hays County begin a period of
steady growth—from 19,934 in 1960 to 27,642 in 1970; 40,594 in 1980; and 65,614 in 1990.
Although agriculture remained significant in county economics, nonagricultural income, primarily
at the educational and training facilities, played an even larger role. The 1979 per capita
income of $6,009, however, remained well below the state average of $8,778.
Since early in the century, Hays County has enjoyed a steady influx of tourists attracted
by the caves, springs, and spas of Wimberley and San Marcos. Aquarena Springs and Wonder
Caves are particularly well known. Camp Ben McCulloch, near Driftwood, was organized in
1896 as a site for reunions of the United Confederate Veterans; their descendents continue the
annual tradition. More recently, the county caught the attention of environmentalists. Ezell
Cave, a watery cavern in San Marcos, is the habitat of several rare animal species, including
the Texas blind salamander, and 6 of the 10 known varieties of aquatic cave fauna are found
only in this cave and its underground waters. The only known habitat of the San Marcos
salamander is San Marcos Springs, and 2 other unique fish of the springs, the fountain darter

and San Marcos gambusia, were classed as endangered in 1990. Also on the endangered list
is Texas wild rice, which is not known to exist outside a small area near the springs.
During the 1970s and 1980s, growth in the northern and eastern parts of the county was
influenced by the expanding Austin metropolitan area and the Austin-San Antonio urban strip
along Interstate Highway 35. In 1973, Hays County became part of the Austin Metropolitan
Statistical Area. In addition to the county seat, San Marcos, which had a population of 28,743 in
1990, other county population centers are Wimberley (2,403), Kyle (2,225), Buda (1,795),
Dripping Springs (1,033), and Hays (252).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 15 previously recorded archeological sites and 2
cemeteries within an approximately 1.0-mile perimeter of the proposed ROWs (THC 2011),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer indicated
the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS
2011). These cultural resources and their distances from the proposed ROWs are summarized
in Table 2, while their locations relative to the proposed ROWs are presented in Figure 7.
Of the 15 previously recorded archeological sites within the review radius, site 41HY418
is traversed along its northwestern and northeastern boundaries by the proposed Centerpoint
Route B ROW. Site 41HY418 was originally documented as multi-component site consisting of
a scatter of historic-era debris and a prehistoric lithic scatter. Based on the lack of buried
deposits on this site, the original site recorders recommended it as ineligible for inclusion on the
NRHP. Aside from site 41HY418, no other documented cultural resources, including any listed
on the NRHP, are located within the boundaries of the proposed ROWs. According to the Atlas
data, none of the proposed ROWs have been formally assessed in their entirety for cultural
resources. However, the Stratford ROW does partially follow the route of a linear survey
conducted in 2002 for a project sponsored by the City of San Marcos.
In addition to the Atlas database and the NPS NRHP Google Earth map layer, aerial
photography containing the proposed ROWs was also reviewed via Google Earth prior to the
field investigations. This review indicated the presence of 1 potential historic-era barn structure
on the edge of the proposed ROW near the northwestern end of the proposed Centerpoint
Route A ROW (Figures 8, 9, and 10). However, a review of the 1964 and 1973 USGS 7.5’ San
Marcos South, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps revealed that the structure currently sits
within an area devoid of structures that was previously the original channel of Cottonwood
Creek (Figures 11 and 12). Cottonwood Creek was realigned to its current channel at some
time after 1973 (Figure 13). Therefore, the potential historic-era barn structure had to also have
been constructed at or moved to its current location at some time after 1973. With this modern
date in mind, the structure was not evaluated during the current survey efforts.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed
ROWs on 1 November 2011. This entailed both intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear
projects measuring 100.0 ft (30.5 m) in length. As such, a total of 35 shovel tests were
necessary along the 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers [km]) of proposed ROWs measuring 75.0 ft (22.9
m) in width in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded these minimum survey
standards by conducting a total of 39 shovel tests along the proposed ROWs.
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. If any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., shell, lithic debitage, etc.) were observed on the surface or
within shovel tests, they were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, historic materials with maker’s marks, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and
further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms,
shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. Standardized site forms were also completed for any
newly recorded archeological sites and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) for permanent housing. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as
appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the
UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in
Figure 14. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the proposed ROWs resulted in the reassessment of portions of
previously recorded site 41HY418 (see Figure 7). This site, originally recorded by Horizon in
2006 during the survey of a proposed residential or retail development, was documented as an
extensive multi-component site composed of historic-era debris and a prehistoric lithic scatter.
It is located within an agricultural field southwest of the intersection of Centerpoint Road and an
existing railroad grade. At the time of its original recording, the site measured approximately
1150.0 x 2300.0 ft (350.5 x 701.0 m) and consisted of a low to moderate density scatter of both
historic and prehistoric materials that had been spread over the extent of the site via agricultural
plowing. At that time, the Horizon archeologist recommended mechanical trenching efforts on
the site to determine if deeply buried cultural deposits were present. These trenching efforts
failed to produce any evidence of buried, stratified cultural deposits. As such, the site was
recommended as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Within the current undertaking, the proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW extends along
the northwestern and northeastern boundaries of site 41HY418 (see Figure 7). Survey efforts
along these portions of the site revealed that the area has been heavily modified in advance of
the residential/retail development for which the site was originally recorded or possibly for other
endeavors. The portions of site 41HY418 have been extensively graded and leveled, and
certain locations have been covered with vegetative fiber rolls (Figures 15 and 16). No
evidence of any historic or prehistoric materials was noted within the proposed ROW within the
extent of site 41HY418, primarily due to the presence of fill materials as well as the vegetative
fiber rolls. Because of the degree of impacts, it would appear that the portions of site 41HY418
within the confines of the currently proposed ROWs have been destroyed. The site was
originally recommended as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Given the current state of the
site, Horizon concurs with the original NRHP eligibility status determination.
Aside from the reassessment of the portions of site 41HY418 within the extent of the
current ROWs, no other cultural resources were documented during the current survey efforts.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed ROWs or within any of the
39 shovel tests excavated during the field efforts.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the fact that: 1) 41HY418 was originally recommended as ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP; 2) Horizon’s current investigations found the portions of site 41HY418
traversed by the proposed Centerpoint Route B ROW to have been further impacted by modern
development; and 3) Horizon’s survey efforts produced negative results on the remainder of the
proposed ROWs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed undertaking will have no adverse
impact to significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that the project be
allowed to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the San Marcos City Code and the San Marcos
Horizons Master Plan. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed ROWs, even in previously surveyed areas, all
work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately and the THC should be notified
of the discovery.
