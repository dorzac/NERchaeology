Abstract
A sea survey along a portion of the route of a proposed subsea pipeline in State Tract
460 in Corpus Christi Bay – using echosounder, total-field magnetometer, and side-scan
sonar -- located no anomalies or targets that can be interpreted as obvious evidence of a
shipwreck. An abandoned well pad and some pipelines and/or cable routes were
identified in the data. As a consequence, no new archaeological sites have been
designated, and it is recommended that Cabot oil & Gas Corporation take no special
precautions with respect to cultural resources during construction of the proposed
pipeline.

Introduction
Marmaduke & Associates, LLC has prepared this cultural resource assessment of a
portion of a proposed pipeline route in Texas State Tract 460 (Figure 1) in Corpus
Christi Bay for Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation. The purpose of the analysis is to
determine the potential for preservation of shipwrecks from the historic era of
navigation in the Gulf of Mexico. The Texas Historical Commission has designated
State Tract 460 as a high probability zone for the preservation of shipwrecks. Data
employed in this examination were collected using echosounder (200 kHz),
Overhauser-effect magnetometer set to record total field, and side-scan sonar (600 kHz).
The portion of the proposed route in State Tract 460 is a small section of a longer track
that will begin on Mustang Island (27.71787645° N, 97.17121397° W)1, run westsouthwest for about 0.76 kilometers (0.47 mile), then turn (27.71705552° N, 97.17884393°
W) to a north-northwest heading for a run of 1.56 kilometers (0.96 mile) to a tie-in on
the existing CrossTex 12-inch pipeline (27.73069007° N, 97.18246299° W) in State Tract
460. Only the final 183 meters (600 feet) of the proposed route traverses sea floor within
State Tract 460.
Naismith Marine Services accomplished the data collection between 28 April and 1 June
2008. The survey grid consisted of a primary survey line running along the proposed
route centerline, flanked by secondary survey lines that paralleled the primary line at
intervals of 30.48 meters (100 feet) out to 152.40 meters (500 feet) on each side. Within
60.96 meters (200 feet) of the centerline, additional survey lines were sited between the
30.48-meter (100-foot) lines, to bring the effective secondary line interval down to 15.24
meters (50 feet). Bathymetric, magnetic, and sonar data were collected on each line in
the survey grid.
The data examined for this report consisted of maps of processed magnetic and
bathymetric data, and mosaics of the sonar analog data. No raw digital or analog data
was interpreted specifically in the preparation of this assessment. All data appear to
have been of good quality.
Background
State Tract 460 is located in southeastern Corpus Christi Bay, south of Shamrock Point
on Shamrock Island and west of Boot Cove on Mustang Island. Bathymetric soundings
shown on NOAA Navigation Chart 11309 (Corpus Christi Bay) indicate a water depth
of 3.05 to 3.66 meters (10 to 12 feet) within the tract. A “dangerous wreck,” of
“approximate position,” is depicted on Chart 11309 approximately 506 meters (1,661
feet) north-northwest of the proposed tie-in on the CrossTex 12-inch pipeline; the

Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS), maintained by
NOAA, identifies this feature (No. 4829), however, only as a “sounding.”
A database prepared in 1989 for the Department of Interior, Minerals Management
Service (Garrison et al. 1989) of wrecks in state waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico
indicates six potential wrecks within 8.1 kilometers (five miles) of the proposed tie-in in
State Tract 460. These are:
Abeona (1882)
Amedio First (1880)
Dixie Dandy (1957)
El Capitan (1951)
Laurel (1880)
Traveler (1951)

Unfortunately, the Minerals Management Service database does not provide
information about the type of vessel or circumstance of loss, nor is there an evaluation
of position accuracy. The positions given for the wrecks above must be regarded only
as approximate, and could vary from the actual wreck positions by a significant
distance.
Data Evaluation
Bathymetric soundings taken during the survey in State Tract 460 (Figure 2) indicate
water depths between 4.02 and 4.08 meters (13.2 and 13.4 feet), values slightly greater
than those indicated on NOAA Chart 11309. Correction for tidal variation and to a
mean low, low water datum would probably narrow the difference to an insignificant
amount. A localized topographic high, about 0.19 hectare (0.43 acre) in size, is about
48.8 meters (160 feet) north-northwest of the proposed tie-in. The least water depth
measured over this feature during survey was 3.32 meters (10.9 feet). Soil sampling on
this feature showed it to be compacted coarse materials, consistent with interpretation
as an abandoned well pad.
Numerous magnetic anomalies were recorded along the short section of the proposed
route in State Tract 460 (Figure 3), most appearing in four alignments suggestive of
pipelines, small flowlines, or communications cables. One alignment follows the record
path of the CrossTex 12-inch pipeline, which tracks east-northeast to west-southwest
through State Tract 460. Another lineation, marked by anomalies almost as robust as
those from the CrossTex line, passes south of the proposed tie-in and appears to cross
both the proposed Matagorda-CrossTex route and the CrossTex line itself about 97.54
meters (320 feet) west of the planned tie-in. A third equally robust series of anomalies
indicates another probable pipeline passing north of the proposed tie-in, paralleling the
axis of the second alignment and barely skirting the southern edge of the abandoned
well pad. The fourth lineation suggests a small flowline emanating from the abandoned

well pad and running out of the survey area to the northeast. The largest anomaly
recorded during the survey was a massive dipole centered directly over the abandoned
well pad, signifying the presence of well casing. Other anomalies, much shorter in
duration but sometimes large (>40) in amplitude, are scattered around the abandoned
pad and between the probable pipe- and/or flowlines, indicative of small-scale debris
of limited ferromagnetic mass equivalent that is common in Gulf waters (Anuskiewicz
and Irion 1995; Brown et al. 1998; Texas State Historical Association 2006).
Sonar returns from the survey in State Tract 460 show a smooth and largely nonreflective sea floor, signifying a surface of fine-grained sediments. The abandoned well
pad is delineated starkly, however, with uniform high amplitude reflections off its
coarse surface materials. There are no discernible traces of the pipe- and/or flowlines
delineated in the magnetic data: the lines appear to be buried, with trenches completely
refilled. No notable targets could be designated in the data, largely confirming the
interpretation of the sources of the randomly scattered, individual magnetic anomalies
as debris of small scale.
Recommendations
Marmaduke & Associates LLC recommends that the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation take
no special precautions with respect to cultural resources during construction of the
Mustang Island-CrossTex pipeline in State Tract 460 in Corpus Christi Bay. The data do
not suggest the preservation of a shipwreck within the impact area for the construction.
It should be borne in mind, however, that while the data collection and analysis for this
report conform with the requirements set forth in the Texas Administrative Code, it
remains possible that potentially significant cultural resources may have escaped
detection. Should further examination of the near-surface sediments in State Tract 460
during construction of the Mustang Island-CrossTex pipeline reveal the possible
presence of cultural remains, or of conditions that suggest the presence of cultural
remains, these findings should be reported immediately to the Texas Historical
Commission, Austin, Texas (512-463-6100).
