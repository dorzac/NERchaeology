ABSTRACT
Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC is planning to construct the Riverton Sw.
– Tunstill Point of Delivery (POD) and Arroyo Bluff POD 138-kV transmission
line routes in Reeves County, Texas. Halff Associates, Inc., the routing consultant
for Oncor, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive
pedestrian survey of the 6.57 miles of new 138-kV transmission line on private
property. Survey was conducted June 4-6, 2018. Seventeen shovel tests were
excavated near drainages, where buried deposits were expected, and two 15-m
transects were walked within the 70-ft-wide survey corridor (approximately 54
acres).
Two archaeological sites were identified and recorded. Site 41RV61 is an
abandoned segment of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad, dating from the
early-20th century. This site is in poor condition, the rails and most of the ties having
been removed. Site 41RV142 is a surficial historic trash deposit with artifacts
dating from the late-19th century to the mid-20th century. The site been poorly
preserved. ARC recommends both sites ineligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Properties. Therefore, no additional cultural resources investigations
are recommended for this project. However, should the proposed right-of-way
alignment change, additional archaeological survey may be necessary.
Furthermore, should any cultural resources be discovered during the construction
activities associated with the project, work in the immediate area should cease and the
Texas Historical Commission should be contacted.

INTRODUCTION
Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor) is planning to construct the Riverton Sw. –
Tunstill Point of Delivery (POD) and Arroyo Bluff POD 138-kV transmission line routes in
Reeves County, Texas. They are proposing to construct 6.57 miles of new 138 kV electric
transmission line (Figure 1). The routes are situated approximately three miles east of Orla,
Texas. The Arroyo Bluff POD segment generally parallels SH652, as does a portion of the
Tunstill route. The north-south portion of the Tunstill route north of SH652 will connect to the
Tunstill POD and the north-south portion of the route south of SH652 will connect to the existing
Riverton Sw. station. Both the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD routes are to
be constructed on private land. AR Consultants, Inc. was contracted by Halff Associates, Inc. to
conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of the routes within 70-foot-wide survey corridors (54
acres), which matches the project rights-of-way (ROWs). Throughout this report these ROWs are
combined and discussed as such. The depths of monopole foundation holes generally impact
depths of 10-25 ft (3-7.6 m) and have a diameter of 2-ft (0.6-m). In extreme cases, the depth may
extend as deep as 60 ft (18.3 m).
As part of the permitting process for these projects, Oncor applies for a Certificate of
Convenience and Necessity (CCN) from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC), as
required by Section 37.051 of the Texas Utilities Code (TUC). In granting the CCN, the PUC
routinely requests that Oncor comply with the requirements of the THC regarding the need for
cultural resources investigations within the proposed project area which generally consists of an
intensive pedestrian survey of the ROW. ARC conducted this survey June 4-6, 2018. All work
was performed in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)-approved Generic
Research Design for Archaeological Surveys of Oncor Electric Delivery Electric Transmission
Line Projects in Texas (PBS&J 2008). The generic research design stipulates the methods by
which cultural resources within proposed Oncor transmission line ROWs will be identified and
assessed for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
eligibility, and how site-specific recommendations for additional archaeological research would
be handled.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018) and those found in the Oncor Generic Research
Design (PBS&J 2008). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of
the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous investigations
within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the
investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE TUNSTILL POD & ARROYO BLUFF ROUTES

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD routes are located in the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas ecoregion of Texas, which consists of relatively low-lying flats, slopes, dunes,
basins, hills, and ridges punctuated by isolated mountains and plateaus (Griffith et al. 2007:8).
Reeves County has a distinctly xeric climate, receiving a mean of only nine inches of
precipitation annually (Jaco 1980:Table 1). The high demand for irrigation and industrial water
over the last century in the region has reduced the flow of the Pecos River (Griffith et al.
2007:9).
The northern end of the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route is in the Pecos River valley. Near the
same route’s southern end, it crosses two, unnamed intermittent streams. The remaining terrain is
relatively level. The northern 0.6 miles and the subsequent 2.0 miles are mapped on the
Pleistocene-aged alluvial terraces and deposits, respectively, while the southern 4.4 miles are
mapped on Holocene-aged alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). These deposits are
primarily composed of gravel, sand, and silt. The 2.0-mile portion that passes through the
Pleistocene-aged alluvial deposits skirts the edge of the Guatuña Formation. This formation is
made of layers of sand, marl, conglomerate, gypsum, silt, shale, and limestone with chert,
quartzite, and chalcedony inclusions, some of which may be of knappable quality.
Four soil associations are mapped in the project area and roughly align with the underlying
geology. Most of the Pleistocene-aged terraces are covered with the Monahans association
(nearly level), but the northern 100 m of the project (along the Pecos River) is mapped as the
Delnorte-Chilicotal association (rolling). The Delnorte-Chilicotal association (rolling) is mapped
on the Pleistocene-aged deposits. The Hoban-Reeves-Holloman association (nearly level) is
mapped atop the Holocene alluvium, except for the valleys of the two intermittent drainages,
which are mapped as the Holloman-Reeves association (gently undulating) (NRCS 2018). All of
these associations except for the Holloman association have 5- to 46-cm-thick, light brown to
brown, sandy, clay, or gravelly loam A horizons resting on pinkish gray to brown gravelly or
clay loam. The Holloman association has a 13-in-thick A horizon above a pale brown loam Cy
horizon and very pale brown gypsum Cry1 horizon is profiled at 23 cm below the surface.

CULTURAL HISTORY
A brief overview of the cultural history for the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas is synthesized from
previous investigations in the region that began in the 1930s. This region has not been
intensively studied, and only a few large-scale projects have been conducted (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). The chronological framework for human occupation in this region is as
follows:
Table 1. Cultural Chronology.
Period
Dates
Historic European
AD 140 to present
Protohistoric
AD 1400 to 1450
Late Prehistoric
AD 200-900 to 1400
Archaic
6000 BC to AD 200/900.
Late Archaic
1200 BC to AD 200
Middle Archaic
4000/3000 to 1200 BC
Early Archaic
6000 to 4000/3000 BC
Paleoindian
ca. 10,000 BC to 6000 BC
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period is associated with distinctive Clovis, and later Folsom and Midland,
projectile points (Bousman et al. 2004). There are examples of Clovis, Folsom, and Midland
projectile points discovered in the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas. No Clovis points have been
found in Reeves County; however, four have been found in adjacent Ward County. (Bever and
Meltzer 2007). Little is known about the Clovis Complex in the region outside of some isolated
discoveries of distinctive fluted projectile points associated with the complex (Holliday 1997;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The lack of cultural materials from this earliest stage of the
Paleoindian period may indicate that early inhabitants were widely spread in the eastern TransPecos region (Sanchez 1999), or may reflect the minimal archaeological work conducted in the
region. By contrast, much more is known about the Folsom and Midland complexes (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). Most of what is known about eastern Trans-Pecos Folsom occupation comes
from excavations at the Chispa Creek site located in southwest Culberson County (Lindsay
1969). The site contains a Folsom component along with other Paleoindian materials. Chispa
Creek is considered an occupation site (Mallouf 1985) even though no definitive Paleoindian
habitation structures have been discovered there or elsewhere in the Trans-Pecos region. This is
likely due to the seasonal hunting and gathering lifeway of early Paleoindian people. Additional
evidence for the Folsom culture in the region includes four sites located in the Van Horn area,
west of Balmorhea, in Culberson County, one of which is identified as a kill site (Sommers
1974) and an isolated find in Presidio County (Walter 2015). Midland sites, which may be
partially contemporary with Folsom, include Winkler-1 (Blaine et al. 2017) and the Shifting
Sands site (Rose 2011).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE TUNSTILL POD & ARROYO BLUFF ROUTES

Archaic Period
This period, which is the longest in Texas prehistory, lasting approximately 7,500 years, is
divided into three stages: Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 BC), Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to
1200 BC), and Late Archaic (1200 BC to AD 200). In the Early Archaic the population was
relatively low and widely distributed. Despite the continued use of Paleoindian lithic technology,
the emergence of a broadly-based hunting and gathering adaptation, especially an increase in
evidence of gathering, marks the advent of the Archaic (Lintz et al. 1993:52). The appearance of
grinding stones in period assemblages suggests that the exploitation and processing of plant
resources began to play a part, and the appearance of stone-lined hearths suggests a general
refinement in food processing. The appearance of burned-rock middens marks the end of this
cultural stage. Burned rock middens are the dominate feature of sites from the Middle Archaic.
Burned rock middens suggest the increasing importance of food processing and possibly
specialized food harvesting. Yucca and sotol, which would have been continually available in the
cyclically xeric climatic conditions of the period, are present at several Middle Archaic sites
(Johnson and Goode 1994:26). The Late Archaic is distinguished by broad-body, expanding stem
dart points such as Castroville, Marcos, and Montell. The period is marked by a general increase
in populations, as evidenced by the density of Late Archaic deposits at stratified sites found in
the region, which are disproportionately well-represented compared to earlier or succeeding
periods (Prewitt 1985:217). An increase in the number of sites during the later portions of this
period is attributed to population increases and the region experiencing a wetter, cooler climate.
Late Prehistoric Period
The introduction and spread of the bow and arrow mark the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period. During the Late Prehistoric period some plant cultivation, primarily of beans, squash, and
maize, occurred in the western part of the Lower Pecos but overall hunting and gathering
continued to provide major food sources. Bison appeared during mesic periods and were a
prominent subsistence source. Pottery makes its appearance in this period. Pottery styles range
from plainware to polychrome painted vessels and imported ceramics have been found at sites in
the area (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Simmons et al. 1989). Site types remain the same as during
the Archaic with the addition of wickiups associated with ring and crescent middens (Young
1981). At approximately AD 1400, the area may have been abandoned.
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric period is the transition between the prehistoric and historic periods. Historic
Native American sites are virtually unknown in most parts of the region, and the primary
evidence of occupation is the occasional discovery of a glass trade bead, metal arrowhead, or
crevice burials (Skinner 2016).
Historic Period
Though generally sparse in West Texas, evidence of Euro-American occupation begins during
the time of exploration and trade (AD 1541 to 1820) and steadily increased until the Depression
period (AD 1900 to 1940) (Hays et al. 1989). The Spanish exploration era ranges from AD 1540
to 1821. Spanish explorers visited the Pecos River during this time but left little evidence of their

presence (Chipman 1992). Early exploration was then followed by early Anglo-American settlers
from 1820 to 1860 in the Panhandle and Plains (Hays et al. 1989), while Mexican forces
controlled the Trans-Pecos until 1846 (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:258-265). Though the Civil
War (1860-1865) was an important period of political and social upheaval, there was only
limited military action in West Texas. Settlement increased after the Civil War, after changes in
the southern economy, population growth, immigration, the release of large numbers of men
from military conscription, and the development of railroads. Regional drought and the Great
Depression impacted the region heavily, with economic and ecological disaster provoking
massive migration from West Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to California (Hays et al. 1989).
While many West Texas counties remain sparsely populated, large scale ranching and vegetable
farming are viable industries in the region and the oil industry has brought various economic
booms.
Reeves County was separated from Pecos County in 1883 (Smith 2016). The county’s access to
the Pecos River influenced growth and development. Initial settlers relied on an economy
dependent on sheep and cattle ranching subsidized by corn and cotton farming. The discovery of
oil and related introduction of railroads helped to boost the regional economy and populations
through the first few decades of the 20th century. This was followed by a significant drought and
the Great Depression, which decreased the numbers and values of crops and livestock as well as
oil. Over the last 50 years, oil production has continued to increase while ranching has fluctuated
but is generally on the decline.
Previous Investigations
The lack of large-scale surveys and excavated sites is the main reason that the archaeology of the
project area is not well understood. However, the geomorphology of the study area also
contributes to this deficit of archaeological information. The study area is in the arid Trans-Pecos
region where water is limited to the major waterways like the Pecos River. Multiple surveys have
been conducted near the study area in recent years in association with new pipeline construction,
some of which have recorded sites. However, none of these studies extended into the study area.
Though it is not mapped on TASA, the All-American Pipeline survey passes approximately 300
m south of the southern end of the project, as evidenced by a string of recorded archaeological
sites (only one of which [41RV16] is within a kilometer of the study area).
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA 2018) was reviewed prior to determining the
cultural resources potential of the project area. No cemeteries, historical markers, NRHP
properties or districts, or previous archaeological projects were mapped within a kilometer of the
project area. One previously recorded archaeological site (41RV16) was recorded within the
same radius. It was found during the All-American Pipeline survey and is approximately 0.8
miles east of the project’s southern end. This site consists of cores, hammerstones, and flakes
exposed on the surface of a small hill in a gravel plain. No recommendations were made
regarding the 11-acre site and an official NRHP eligibility determination has not been made.
Historic Map Review
In addition to a review of previous archaeological investigations, a historic map review was
conducted. The 1922 Reeves County Soil Map and 1936 and 1956 Reeves County general

highway maps (GHMs) were reviewed. The more accurately scaled 7.5’ 1961 Orla SE, TX and
1968 Orla, TX USGS topographic maps were also inspected. Additionally, historic aerials from
1954 and 1967 were reviewed. No historic buildings were observed along the proposed project
routes on any of these maps or aerials. The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe (AT&SF) Railway,
which is crossed by the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route 1.25 miles from the southern end,
appears on all these maps. It is also observed on a 1967 aerial photograph. A mine, quarry, or
gravel pit is mapped on the northwest side of SH652 on both GHMs and a quarry appears on the
southeast side of the road in roughly the same location on the USGS topographic map. It is
unclear if these symbols represent the same feature or different ones. The quarry on the southeast
side of SH652 is observed on both the 1954 and 1967 aerial and does not appear to intrude into
the project corridor.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The Oncor generic research design (PBS&J 2008) calls for the study area to be classified into
High Probability Areas (HPAs), Moderate Probability Areas (MPAs), and Low Probability Areas
(LPAs) on the basis of perceived likelihood for the occurrence of archaeological sites in the
Trans-Pecos region. For prehistoric sites, this stratification is based on previously recorded site
distributions, soils, geomorphology, topography, prior disturbances, and distance from
permanent and intermittent water sources (i.e., creeks, rivers, and springs). These areas were
identified prior to fieldwork. For historic sites mapped locations of structures and distance to
roads were the main factors.
In the Trans-Pecos, HPAs for prehistoric archaeological sites were defined as areas relatively
close (<500 m) to water sources, specifically on shoulder slopes, on alluvial and colluvial fans,
near upland edges adjacent to alluvial valleys, and near stream confluences. Holocene-age
alluvial terraces and floodplains were also classified as HPAs. Alluvial deposits offer the greatest
preservation potential for buried and stratified prehistoric sites.
Prehistoric MPAs include areas that may contain archaeological remains, but their presence is
considered to be less likely due to greater distances to water, strongly sloping areas, and/or
eroded soils. These areas include upland margins, Pleistocene terraces, and gently sloping
hillsides and toe slopes more than 500 m from streams.
LPAs are those areas in which prehistoric archaeological sites are unlikely to be present because
of steeply sloping topography, erosion, or modern development. Any prehistoric archaeological
sites in these settings would not likely retain integrity. There are no LPAs in the project area.
Following these guidelines, the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD routes can
be classified as follows:
HPAs MPAs LPAs -

within 500 m of the Pecos River (prehistoric)
the upland edge south of the Pecos River (prehistoric)
within 500 m of the two unnamed drainages (prehistoric)
outcrops along the Guatuña Formation (prehistoric)
AT&SF berm (historic)
the rest of the two routes (prehistoric and historic)
none

No geoarchaeologically-sensitive areas were identified within the proposed ROW because the
deepest subsoil or bedrock is mapped as 46 cm below the surface, which is easily reached using a
shovel.

Methodology
Field personnel walked the proposed routes along two transects each 16 ft (5 m) off the proposed
centerline and 16 ft (5 m) from the ROW edge, resulting in a 70-foot-wide survey corridor (21
m). Shovel tests were excavated within 100 m of drainages regardless of ground visibility.
Personnel made notes about the ground exposure, soil types, drainages, and disturbed areas
where subsoil was exposed. As outlined in the Oncor Generic Research Design (PBS&J 2008),
shovel tests averaged 20 cm in diameter and were excavated in 10-cm (4-in) levels. Sandy soils
were inspected visually and sifted through a ¼” wire mesh in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. Soils with high clay content were troweled through and visually
inspected. Soils were described on the basis of color and texture, and the Munsell Soil Color
Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test (Munsell Color 2009). Shovel tests
and sites were marked with a handheld GPS receiver. Photographs were taken with a GPSequipped, digital camera. Since no artifacts were found in subsurface contexts and no temporally
significant artifacts were noted on the surface, all artifacts were analyzed in the field and none
were collected.
Upon identification of the archaeological sites, the boundaries were delineated on the basis of the
surface distribution of artifacts and features and by shovel tests. A minimum of six shovel tests
were excavated in each site in cardinal directions from features and/or densest concentrations in
order to determine depth and integrity of the sites. A sketch map for each site was drawn in the
field. A temporary field designation was assigned to each site and a TexSite form was completed
and submitted to TARL for assignment of a permanent trinomial designation.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first describes the study area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. The second describes historic sites 41RV61 and
41RV142. Conclusions derived from the survey close the chapter. While shovel tests (STs) are
described generally within the text, they are detailed at the end of the results section in Table 4.
Survey Results
The Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD routes were surveyed in their entirety
along two transects placed five m on either side of the proposed centerlines. Overall, the general
environment of both routes was relatively similar in that they were typical of the types of
vegetation and lack of ground cover expected in the Trans-Pecos region (Figure 2). Observed
vegetation included three to four-foot-tall mesquite, sometimes in clusters of five to ten
individual trees. Succulents observed included yucca and button cactus. Ground visibility
generally ranged from 80 to 90 percent but was 30 to 40 percent at the drainage crossings. Both
routes cross gravel roads and existing pipelines that have been constructed as a result of the
ongoing oil industry in the region (Figure 8 and Figure 9).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE TUNSTILL POD & ARROYO BLUFF ROUTES

Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD Route
The north end of the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route is located on the terraces of the Pecos
River. No gravel was visible on the surface in this portion and no distinct topographic features
were noted. Three shovel tests (STs 1-3) were placed along that portion of the route every 100 m
to test whether buried deposits were present near the river (Figure 3). The shovel tests generally
revealed a 10-20-cm-thick layer of brown loamy sand underlain by pinkish silt sand. Shovel tests
were terminated at 100 cmbs due to a lack of change in the soil color and texture for 80 to 90 cm.
No artifacts or features were identified in the STs. As the route continues south, it gradually
slopes up and the presence of surface gravel, including some pieces of chert but mostly rounded
sandstone, was noted beginning approximately 875 m south of the north end of the route. Within
this segment, the route passes an isolated, elevated landform that is drawn on topographic maps.
Atop the landform, the surface is almost entirely covered in pea to gold-ball-sized gravels
(Figure 10).
The portion of the route between SH652 and the northern drainage has only an occasional cluster
of gravel (Figure 4 and Figure 5). The northern drainage crossing coincides with a railroad track
that was recorded as part of 41RV61 (Figure 6). Vegetation near this drainage is denser than in
other parts of the routes. Mesquite trees range 7 to 10 feet in height and are clustered close
together with additional shrubs and cacti in between. The surface soil at the crossing was visibly
moist. No terraces were noted where the survey corridor crosses the drainage and it appeared as
if the drainage was modified to create a pond, likely for the cattle that were noted in the area
(Figure 11). Shovel tests were excavated at the drainage as part of the delineation of the site
boundary for 41RV61. Approximately 400 m south of the northern drainage a relatively high
density of surface gravel was noted for about 200 m south towards the southern drainage.
Historic surface scatter 41RV142 was recorded in this area and is detailed in the Site Description
section below.
Vegetation and soil condition were essentially the same at the southern drainage crossing as the
northern drainage. However, a portion of this drainage was channelized as part of a recent
pipeline construction project which also disturbed the south bank of the drainage (Figure 7 and
Figure 12). A shovel test was placed on the north bank and one was placed just off the south side
of the pipeline corridor. No cultural resources were noted in either shovel test (Table 2). The
terrain sloped gradually upward moving south from the southern drainage and the route turns
east. Gravel similar to those noted in the north portion of the route, both in type and density,
were visible on the surface in this portion of the route. The route eventually turns south again,
and the remaining 200 m crossed over a new pipeline installation and into the Riverton Sw.
station and were not surveyed due to this disturbance (Figure 13 and Figure 14). Other than the
two sites, no artifacts or features were identified along the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route.

Arroyo Bluff POD Route
The Arroyo Bluff POD route joins with the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route on the north side
of SH652 where the previously discussed route turns south (Figure 15). The Arroyo Bluff POD
portion of the route continues southwest, paralleling the north side of SH652 for approximately
890 m before turning northwest. The route makes three more 90 degree turns; the first towards
the northwest for 280 m, then to the southwest for 130 m, and finally to the southeast for 78 m
before ending at an active construction site. The remaining 50 m of this portion of the route
crosses into the construction site and gravel road that leads to it. Two other disturbances were
observed along this portion of the route, a gravel road located approximately 100 m southwest of
where the two routes meet, and a parking lot. The parking lot is located approximately 550 m

southwest of where the Arroyo Bluff POD and Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD routes join (Figure
17). Approximately 700 m of the route is within this parking lot.
Vegetation and soil conditions were essentially the same as what was observed along the
Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD route. Ground visibility along this portion of the route ranges from
80 to 100 percent. Few surface sandstone gravels were encountered. Due to the high percent
ground visibility and lack of aggrading soils, no shovel tests were excavated.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE TUNSTILL POD & ARROYO BLUFF ROUTES

Site Descriptions
41RV61 Update
SWCA originally recorded site 41RV61 in 2014. The site is a portion of the AT&SF railway,
approximately 8 km from the current study area along the west bank of the Pecos River (TASA
2018). This portion of the railroad consisted of a large scatter of railroad ballast, railroad ties,
miscellaneous metal, nuts and bolts, wooden planks and a single shard of aqua glass. SWCA
recommended the site as ineligible for listing in the NRHP due to high disturbance and
destruction of the site from construction of a gravel utility road (TASA 2018).
An approximately 10-m-long segment of the abandoned AT&SF railway route was recorded
within the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD ROW corridor (Figure 18). This segment measures
approximately five m wide and contains railroad ties that are flush with the ground surface. Six
in-situ railroad ties were recorded; each measures seven ft 10 in long, six in wide, and eight in
tall. Additionally, track ballast stones were observed scattered across the surrounding area. There
is no remaining rail and no evidence of a berm, but two tie plates were recorded attached to two
of the ties. To the east and west of the intact segment, the railroad has either been dismantled or
destroyed due to the damming of an intermittent drainage that the railroad originally crossed (as
seen in Figure 11).
On one of the ties within the intact segment, the letter “W” has been branded in one end (Figure
20). The Southwestern Reporter (1909), a volume of Supreme and Appellate court decisions in
Texas, references the “W” tie brand in a court case as belonging to the Ohio Valley Tie
Company. Based on this lawsuit document, the “W” located at the end of the railroad tie was
created with a heated branding iron along with a painted yellow spot, about an inch in diameter,
located adjacent to the “W.” A yellow spot was not observed during recording of the tie;
however, this could be due to poor preservation of the paint or partial burial of the tie.
A pile of railroad ties was encountered approximately 20 m north of where the intact segment is
located (Figure 21). The pile contains both the same ties as those that are intact as well as larger
ones measuring 14 feet long, one foot wide, and 1 foot high. Two diagnostic elements were
recorded on these ties, a date nail and a brand (Figure 22). The date nail, encountered atop one of
the ties, is embossed atop the head with the number “28.” Date nails were used to identify the
year in which the material (in this case, the wooden railroad tie) was treated or installed (Oaks
2006). This suggests that the raised “28” atop the nail refers to 1928. An additional brand was
noted on the end of one of the ties depicting “AE29.” No information for this brand was found.
Together the intact railroad segment and discarded ties pile occupy an area of approximately
0.29 acres within the ROW corridor, measuring 54 m north/south. The intact segment extends
outside the ROW to the west. Six shovel tests were placed within this boundary in 10-meter
intervals north and south of the intact segment of the railroad. All shovel tests were negative,
revealing between 10 and 70 cm of sandy loam topsoil atop very dense sand or sandy clay.

The AT&SF railway system was founded in 1859 by Cyrus K. Holliday, with the purpose of
expanding across the southwestern United States (Bryant 2010). By 1887, the railway connected
Kansas City to California, with northern and southern branches in construction. A southern
branch from the Gulf of Mexico reached the Texas Panhandle in 1888. The railway, intended for
the transport of wheat, cattle, and cotton, was primarily constructed by the Gulf, Colorado and
Santa Fe Railway (GC&SF) and the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway (P&SF) companies. These
subsidiaries, both headquartered in Texas, worked to extend the track to remote parts of Texas.
Lines were eventually constructed across Texas, reaching Galveston, Lampasas, Fort Worth,
Dallas, Houston, and Conroe.
In 1928, the railway acquired the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, creating additional
lines north to Wichita, Kansas, as well as Sweetwater, San Angelo, and Presidio in Texas
(Bryant 2010). For the next decade, the railway continued to acquire and construct new railways;
its final branch was constructed between Dallas and Denton in 1955. From the 1930s forward,
the Santa Fe Railway expanded its business to include non-railway functions including timber
production, oil and natural gas, real estate and pipeline operations. In 1965 the GC&SF and
P&SF subsidiaries were merged into what is known today as the Santa Fe system. By 1980, the
railway included 12,209 miles, 3,508 of which were in Texas and provided a net income of more
than $80,000,000.
The site can be securely dated to the early twentieth century from diagnostic elements on the
railroad ties. However, the 10-meter-long intact segment of this historic railroad is in poor
condition. The ties are severely weathered and there is no evidence of remaining tracks atop
them. Additionally, the rest of the line within the ROW has been dismantled or destroyed from
damning of the intermittent drainage.

41RV142
41RV142 is a surficial historic trash scatter located approximately 400 m south of 41RV61
within the Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD ROW (Figure 23). The scatter extends approximately
100 m north/south along the ROW and is extends outside the 70-ft-ROW to the east and west.
The highest concentration of artifacts is located along the route centerline and measures
approximately 10 m north/south by 15 m east/west (Figure 24). Additionally, a
southwest/northeast-trending two-track road intersects the ROW at the northern end of the trash
scatter. Six shovel tests (STs 10-15) were excavated within the central artifact concentration and
towards the site boundaries to determine depth of the trash deposit. All were negative and
revealed silty loam atop a dry, dense sand with pea to golf-ball-sized gravels.
Artifacts recorded at the site include piles of unidentified metal scrap, metal can fragments,
pieces of wood, historic ceramics, nails, and a variety of glass vessel shards. The ceramic
assemblage consists of a variety utilitarian wares including earthenware with a brown glaze (2),
whiteware plate sherds (20+), porcelain sherds (10+), and a ceramic insulator (Figure 25).
Several of the whiteware plate rims contained simple decorative molding. However, these sherds
were too deteriorated to identify the decorations to a specific type. No diagnostic bases were
encountered.
The nail assemblage consists of both wire nails (500+), and square-cut nails (100+) (Figure 26).
A sample of the wire nails was measured to determine penny weights in which a wide range was
encountered including 4D, 5D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, and 20D. This wide range of pennyweights
were commonly used in building and roofing. The sample of square-cut nails, on the other hand,
consisted of only 9D type nails. The wire to square-cut nail ratio is indicative of a transition
period, starting around the 1890s in which square-cut nails began to slowly be replaced by the
wire nail. By that point, square-cut nails only accounted for 14.9 percent of U.S. production
(Adams 2002:72).

The glass assemblage consists of melted glass and bottle fragments of varying color including
sun-colored amethyst glass (100+), milk glass (50+), light green glass (10+), green glass (20+),
aqua (aquamarine) glass (20+) (Figure 27and Figure 28). Additionally, one clear, hand turned
bottle neck was recorded. This method of bottle manufacture has a wide date range from the 19th
through the early 20th centuries. No diagnostic bases were encountered, however, the various
glass colors generally date to the late -9th and early-20th century. Aqua glass can range in color
from pale blue to blue-green. This glass type was used from the early 19th century until the
1920s when colorless (clear) glass became popular, along with the use of automatic bottle
machines (Society for Historical Archaeology [SHA] 2018). Sun-colored amethyst glass is
suggestive of a strong manganese content, which was often used to colorize or decolorize glass
during the late-19th and early-20th century (Ketchum 1975: 31). Finally, milk glass was popular
from the late-19th century until the mid-20th century and was often used for cosmetic and
toiletry bottles.
A rifle cartridge was encountered in the central part of the site. The headstamp on the cartridge
reads “W.R.A. Co. .38 Long.” The cartridge was produced by the Winchester Repeating Arms
Company (W.R.A. Co.) (Barnes 1980). No other information could be found regarding this
cartridge. However, similar bullets that the company manufactured, including the .38-70 and .3872 Winchester, were produced at the turn of the 19th century. Additionally, the .38 Long,
Centerfire, along with other brand names, were manufactured around this same time, beginning
in the 1870s and becoming obsolete by 1900. Based on these similarities, it is likely that the
cartridge encountered at the site dates to this time.

In addition to shovel testing, deeds research was conducted for the property on which the trash
scatter was found. No deeds activity was found prior to 1946, when Mrs. D.W. Henderson sold
the property to P.G. Northrup and R.M. Regan. Each portion of the property was conveyed to
family after the landowners’ deaths; P.G. Northrup passing in 1958 and R.M. Regan in 1983.
Both portions of the property remain in family trusts to this day. All landowners, previous and
current, were researched and none made significant contributions to broad patterns of history.
The artifacts at the site date from the late 19th century into the middle part of the 20th century and
are typical of the types of materials expected to be found in a domestic trash dump. The historic

maps review showed no historic structures mapped along the proposed project routes within this
region. Additionally, no structures or other features associated with the trash deposit within the
ROW were encountered with the exception of the two-track road along the northern border.
Historically, trash was dumped along roads away from residences.
Conclusions
No prehistoric cultural resources were located during survey of the proposed Riverton Sw. –
Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD 138-kV Transmission Line routes. Two historic sites were
recorded as expected based on the expectations set forth in the Research Design. One site (41RV61),
the remains of the AT&SF railway, consisted of a 10-m-long, intact segment, though only six ties
remain intact and no rails were present. The historic trash scatter (41RV142) recorded during
survey was located along a two-track road and likely represents a trash dump as no structures
were observed in the immediate area during the historical map review. Based on the negative
shovel test results, the site lacks integrity and depth. The artifacts are typical of turn of the
century household wares.
Neither site contained diagnostic artifacts or a deposit that could yield significant information about
past environments and there were no diagnostic features that could associate these sites with any
significant individuals, events, or styles (36 CFR 60.4a-c). It is unlikely these sites hold any further
potential to provide insight into past lifeways or environments (36 CFR 60.4d).

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
within the proposed Riverton Sw. – Tunstill POD and Arroyo Bluff POD 138-kV Transmission
Line route in Reeves County, Texas. Two historic sites, one abandoned railroad track (41RV61)
and one trash scatter (41RV142), were recorded. These sites are not recommended as eligible for
listing on the NRHP nor to be designated as a SAL. 41RV61 is not recommended because only a
small portion of track is left intact and there are no associated artifacts or features of note. 41RV142
is not recommended due to the lack of features, structures, and diagnostic artifacts; the site has low
potential to yield information about past lifeways or environments. AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that construction of the proposed transmission line project be allowed to proceed
and that no additional archaeological investigations are necessary. However, should the proposed
ROW alignment change, additional archaeological survey may be necessary. Also, if previously
unidentified archaeological artifacts, features, or deposits are encountered during construction, it
is recommended that the discovery be evaluated by a professional archaeologist in consultation
with THC.
