Abstract
The Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State University-San Marcos
conducted intensive archaeological survey and subsurface testing investigations of the Area of
Potential Effect (APE) of the Spring Lake Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project
(SLAERP). The SLAERP proposes to restore the aquatic ecosystem components of Spring
Lake and riparian corridor/grassland habitat located directly adjacent to the lake to a more
natural condition within the constraints of existing land uses. This work will be conducted
under Section 206 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, which provides authority
for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to restore aquatic ecosystems. A
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the USACE, Texas State University-San Marcos
(TxState), and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) regarding the Spring Lake Aquatic
Restoration Project required CAS to develop and implement a subsurface testing program to
determine the extent of intact cultural deposits within the project area. A testing program was
developed and implemented by CAS that included both terrestrial and underwater investigations.
Terrestrial investigations consisted of pedestrian survey, shovel test excavation, test unit
excavation, auger pit excavation and backhoe trench excavation. Underwater investigations
included limited reconnaissance survey, test unit excavation and the extraction of sediment
cores. Investigations were conducted within or adjacent to State Archaeological Landmarks
41HY160 and 41HY165. Neither site was adequately delineated prior to this undertaking, and
the work reported here results in modified site boundaries within the APE. New site boundaries
demonstrate nearly continuous deposits across the APE, confirming that these sites actually
represent a single extensive complex of archaeological deposits associated with the freshwater
springs that presently form Spring Lake. Based on pending impacts as indicated in the 65
percent project design documents together with the results of the survey, six areas were identified
as “Archaeologically Sensitive,” as they contained or possess a high probability to contain
cultural deposits that would be negatively impacted by proposed demolition, modifications,
and construction. Each of these archaeologically sensitive areas is linked with either 41HY160
or 41HY165, although, given the continuous nature of deposits in the APE, CAS concludes
that distinctions between these trinomials are less meaningful than previously believed. CAS
recommended the development of mitigation efforts to offset the loss of important information
from these areas.

Introduction
The Center for Archaeological Studies
(CAS) at Texas State University-San Marcos
conducted a cultural resource assessment for
the Spring Lake Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem
Restoration Project (SLAERP). A Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) between the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Texas
State University-San Marcos (TxState), and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) regarding
the Spring Lake Aquatic Restoration Project,
San Marcos, Texas, was signed and enacted in
June 2009. The SLAERP proposes to restore the
aquatic ecosystem components of Spring Lake
and riparian corridor/grassland habitat located
directly adjacent to the lake to a more natural
condition within the constraints of existing
land uses. This work will be conducted under
Section 206 of the Water Resources Development
Act of 1996, which provides authority for the
USACE to restore aquatic ecosystems. USACE
restoration projects are conducted in areas that
affect water, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands,
and where the environment will benefit through
restoration, improvement, or protection of
aquatic habitats. The project costs are shared
by the federal government (65 percent) and
nonfederal local sponsor (35 percent), which in
this case is TxState. In the current undertaking,
it is the University’s responsibility to ensure
compliance with all cultural resource obligations
under state and federal statute (the USACE
will perform the role of lead federal agency
for Section 106 coordination). The SLAERP
proposed undertaking includes removal of
existing structures and facilities at the Aquarena

Center, removal of all submerged structures,
restoration of valuable aquatic and terrestrial
habitats throughout the Spring Lake peninsula,
removal of exotics, creation of a vegetated buffer
zone between the golf course and Spring Lake,
and construction of new and rehabilitated trails,
traffic control gates, fencing, a rest room facility,
picnic tables, benches, and signage.
The USACE, Fort Worth District, is the lead
agency for this project. The nonfederal, local
sponsor, TxState, is the participatory agency.
The project area is located in south-central
Texas, within the city limits of San Marcos on
the TxState campus, and includes the Aquarena
Center, Spring Lake, and part of the TxState
golf course (Figure 1-1). The USACE, with
the concurrence of the Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) at the THC, has
determined the Area of Potential Effect (APE) to
be ten acres of floodplain habitat on the Aquarena
Center peninsula, nine acres of riparian corridor
habitat along the shoreline of Spring Lake, and 22
acres of lacustrine habitat within the headwaters
of the San Marcos River (Figure 1-2).
The USACE has consulted with the THC and
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(Council) pursuant to 36 CFR Part 800,
regulations implementing Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. An MOA for the SLAERP
between the USACE, TxState, and the THC was
developed as a result of this consultation. During
the consultation, the USACE and the THC

determined that the Undertaking will have an
adverse effect upon known properties included in
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) and that have been
designated as State Archeological Landmarks
(SAL). It was also determined that potential
also exists for negative impacts on yet-unknown
resources that may be present.

The THC is authorized to enter into the
MOA in order to fulfill its role of advising
and assisting federal agencies in carrying out
their Section 106 responsibilities pursuant
to Sections 101 and 106 of the NHPA and 36
CFC Section 800.2 (1) (i) and 800.6 (b). The
USACE, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 800.6(a)(1)(i)
(c), has invited the Council to participate in this

consultation, and the Council has chosen not
participate. The Comanche Nation, the Kiowa
Tribe of Oklahoma, the Mescalero Apache Tribe,
and the Tonkawa Tribe of Oklahoma have also
been invited to participate in consultation to seek
ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate adverse effects
as the result of this undertaking and to concur
in this agreement. These tribes have chosen not
to be concurring parties to the MOA. TxState
has determined that this MOA serves a public
purpose by providing a means for it to meet its
responsibilities under the NHPA.

office. These five subsections include: 1) the
development and implementation of a subsurface
testing program to determine the extent of intact
cultural deposits within the project area; 2)
development of measures to coordinate closely
with the project design team and convey cultural
resource information to assure avoidance of
historic properties during specific design phases
of the project; 3) development and implementation
of an excavation plan for each recorded site
prior to construction; 4) development and
implementation of an archaeological monitoring
program to monitor all ground-disturbing
activities during the construction and restoration
phases of the project; and 5) a treatment plan to
address adverse effects to cultural resources and
unanticipated discoveries. The current document
represents the results of work for a cultural
resources survey and testing program of the APE
(see Figure 1-2).

The MOA requires the development and
implementation of a Historic Properties Treatment
Plan (HPTP) to ensure that the SLAERP will
avoid or minimize impacts to cultural resources
within the APE. The HPTP will include five
subsections and will be subject to review and
acceptance by the USACE Cultural Resources
3

In order to gather data necessary for
completing the HPTP, the MOA calls for a
cultural resource assessment of the APE. Four
archaeological sites, 41HY160, 41HY165,
41HY161, 41HY147, have been recorded within
the project area, and two additional sites, 41HY37
and 41HY306, are located within the vicinity.
None of these sites were completely surveyed
when they were recorded, and the boundaries
of all sites are poorly and imprecisely known.
Therefore, it is recognized that there is a high
probability that ground-disturbing activities
will encounter additional, yet-unknown cultural
resources at or just below the surface that may
appear to be outside the charted boundaries of
any particular site.

assessments of the APE. As a result of this work,
site boundaries for 41HY160 and 41HY165 are
modified based on the documented presence
of archaeological materials outside of previous
site boundaries. Current boundaries indicate
the nearly continuous presence of prehistoric
remains across the APE. However, because
pending impacts from the 65 percent design
documents will be concentrated in only a few
areas, we identify Archaeologically Sensitive
Areas (ASA) within these two SALs. ASAs are
areas that 1) represent intact and near-surface
archaeological deposits that are associated with
one of the SALs; 2) have the very high likelihood
of containing significant deposits; and 3) will be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.

Under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5582
(Carole Leezer, Principal Investigator) CAS
conducted an intensive cultural resource
assessment and limited testing program of
the APE consisting of pedestrian walkover
survey augmented by systematic shovel test
unit excavation, backhoe trench excavation,
an auger excavation, and a limited number of
test unit excavations. As the SLAERP includes
the removal of all submerged structures and
the restoration of aquatic habitats throughout
the Spring Lake peninsula, a limited amount
of underwater investigations of the locations of
proposed modifications was also conducted. Data
gathered during all of these assessments provides
information on the vertical and horizontal
extent of known and previously unknown
archaeological sites, providing information to
aid in the determination of potential impacts to
cultural resources.

The results of the survey and subsurface
testing that are presented in this report will
inform the HPTP. That document (forthcoming)
will present recommendations for mitigating
documented resources that will be affected by
the proposed undertaking. The HPTP will be
submitted for review as a separate report.
This chapter is followed by five chapters
outlining the environmental context of the
project area, a cultural and archaeological
background, methods used in this survey, the
survey results, and a summary of the findings and
recommendations. These chapters are followed
by five appendices. Appendix A describes the
cores collected, and Appendix B contains the
radiocarbon results. The remaining appendices
are on CD. Appendix C is the master artifact
catalog, and Appendix D presents maps showing
the locations of shovel tests, test units, cores, and
the auger. Appendix E is for restricted access
only, as it contains maps depicting site locations
and archaeologically sensitive areas.

This report presents a summary of both
terrestrial and underwater cultural resource

The City of San Marcos is located in Hays County,

and could have supported dense

Springs have attracted human
populations for over 13,500
years; they were known to
early European settlers as St.
Mark’s, to the Tonkawas as
Canocanayesatetlo, and today
as Aquarena Springs (Brune
2005). The springs were an
important stop on the El
Camino Real and the Chisholm
cattle trail. They are the second
largest springs in Texas and
support a tremendous amount
of wildlife. The springs serve
as the headwaters of the San

marked by brownish, yellowish, and olive
mottles. Tinn series B horizons extend from
approximately 80 to 135 cm, though they can
be thinner or not present at all. At the bottom of
the Tinn series soil column, C horizons contain
gray, brown, and olive mottles, and can possibly
also contain up to 50 percent coarse fragments.
The primary difference between these two soils
series is distance from a stream; both soils form
in floodplain settings, but Oakalla series are
adjacent to streams and Tinn series are farther
away. Slight differences in the Oakalla and Tinn
series soil columns are attributable to variable
moisture content/availability, which is partly a
function of distance from the water exposed on
the nearby surface.

Oakalla series soils are composed of an
A-(B)-C soil column. A horizons typically reach
approximately 80 cm in depth and consist of
grayish-brown silty, clayey, loamy sediments.
Oakalla series soils do not always contain a B
horizon, which, if present, is generally grayishbrown to light yellowish-brown. Beneath either
an A or A-B horizons, the C horizon is also
brown to light yellowish-brown. Similarly,
Tinn series typically exhibit an A-(B)-C profile
in which a deep (approximately 80 centimeters
[cm]) A horizon ranges from dark gray at the
top to dark grayish-brown with brown mottles
at the bottom. Where present, B horizons are

fine subangular blocky clay structure (Batte
1984:34, 75). This compact structure allows for
less cracking and movement than other clays.
This means that archaeological investigations
within these soils should be less hampered
by the movement of artifacts as a result of
shrinking and swelling dynamics. Tinn clay
(Tn) is generally dark gray to grayish-brown
in color, and like Oakalla soils, is moderately
alkaline and calcareous. Its structure, however,
ranges from moderate, medium, and subangular
to weak, medium, blocky. As a result of its clay
and variable moisture contents, it is more likely
to crack, thus allowing for possible vertical
movement of artifacts.

Oakalla clay loam (OK) soils are generally
dark grayish-brown in color, moderately alkaline
and calcareous throughout, with approximately
60 percent calcium carbonate, and contain
an extremely firm to very hard, moderate,

Cultural and Archaeological
Background
Cultural Context

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian stage marks the earliest
human occupation of North America and extends
until approximately 8000 BP. According to Hester
(1995:433–436, 2004), the Paleoindian period
occurred between 11,200 and 7950 BP in South
Texas. Collins (1995:381–385; 2004) dates it to
11,500–8800 BP in Central Texas. Diagnostic
Paleoindian artifacts include Clovis, Folsom, and
a variety of later types (Bousman et al. 2004).
Early Paleoindian peoples are thought of as
highly nomadic cultures that relied heavily on
hunting large game animals such as mammoth,
mastodon, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989).
Of these, all but bison were extinct by the end of
Clovis times. Research shows that Paleoindians
utilized a wide variety of plants and animals,
such as raccoons, badgers, mice, alligators,
turtles and tortoises (Black 1989; Bousman et
al. 2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983;
Lemke and Timperley 2008).

Human presence in the study region is
divided into three periods: Prehistoric (including
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric),
Protohistoric, and Historic. Evidence for
prehistoric occupation in and around the San
Marcos Springs extends from the Clovis period,
approximately 13,500 years ago, up until the
arrival of Spanish explorers about 260 years
ago. Historic documents record the use of the
springs by Spanish and Native American groups
in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth
centuries, and as early as the mid-nineteenth
century by Anglo-American settlers such as
General Edward Burleson.
Spring Lake is in a transitional zone in
terms of cultural influences, with traits present
from Central Texas, South Texas, and, to a
lesser degree, the Upper Coast of Texas (Goode
1989). Patterson (1995) has synthesized the
chronological evidence for Southeast Texas,
including the Upper Coastal Region. The cultural
chronologies for Central and South Texas are not
completely understood, but recent syntheses are
presented by Black (1995), Hester (1995, 2004),
and Collins (1995, 2004). Dates for prehistoric
periods and parts of the Protohistoric that
are derived from archaeological contexts are
presented in radiocarbon years before present
(BP, i.e., before 1950). Dates in the historic period
are based on written accounts and are given in
calendar ages.

A large distribution of Clovis points across
North and Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of their makers (Wenke 1990:201).
These points are lanceolate in shape, with a
thinned base resulting from “fluting,” or the
removal of one or more channel flakes, and are
often found associated with remains of large,
now-extinct herbivores. Site types include open
camp sites, quarries, and caches, though kill sites
are the best known. Other artifacts associated
with Clovis are specialized bifaces, prismatic

points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.

and variety of lithic tools for wood working;
greater population stability and less residential
mobility; and systematic burial of the dead. This
stage is also distinguished by environmental and
climatic changes and oscillations.

Clovis is followed by Folsom and Midland
point types, which overlap slightly (Holliday
1997). Folsom points are fluted and are found
in association with ancient bison remains, while
Midland points are manufactured through
pressure collateral flaking, but lack fluted
channels. Very thin bifaces called ultrathin
bifaces are also found at some Folsom sites
(Stanford and Broilo 1981). Folsom peoples are
considered to be specialized bison hunters. Most
Folsom sites occur as surface scatters, although
stratified deposits also occur. Artifacts associated
with this interval are common throughout Texas
(Bousman et al. 2004).

The beginning of the Holocene is marked by
a significant climate change, associated with the
extinction of megafauna, that stimulated many
important cultural changes. Groups focused
more intensively on the exploitation of local
resources such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs. This
dietary adjustment is evidenced by the increased
number of ground stone artifacts, burned-rock
middens, and tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–
256). Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and
are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern
Mexico (Weir 1976). Hester (1995:436–438;
2004) dates the Early Archaic, characterized by
Early Basal Notched and Early Corner Notched
dart points, to 7950–4450 BP, while Collins
(1995:383, 2004) argues that the Early Archaic
spans from 8800 to 6000 BP based on three
divisions of projectile point types.

Archaeological evidence suggests that, with
the exception of bison, large game animals were
extinct in Texas after 10,000 BP. Hunters instead
concentrated on deer, antelope, and other game
(Bousman et al. 2002, 2004). Between 10,000
BP and 8000 BP, Central Texas is characterized
by a series of archaeological cultures based
on changing projectile point styles. Changes
in the subsistence base eventually required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a
new cultural period known as the Archaic.

The Middle Archaic in Central Texas dates
from ca. 6000 to 4000 BP (Collins 1995, 2004).
Collins divides the Middle Archaic into three
projectile point style intervals: Bell-AndiceCalf Creek; Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. The
beginning of the Middle Archaic (Bell-AndiceCalf Creek) was a mesic period when grasslands
expanded southwards into Central and South
Texas; this expanding habitat attracted bison
herds from the Plains. People associated with
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek styles were specialized
bison hunters and who maintained a tool kit
specifically adapted to killing and processing
bison. Points were extremely thin and broad, and
were technologically elaborated in comparison
with many preceding styles. The Middle Archaic
in general is associated with the Altithermal, a

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Archaic in
Central Texas from approximately 8800 to
1200/1300 BP (other archaeologists suggest that
the Archaic began at 8000 BP). Following Weir
(1976), this period is divided into Early, Middle,
and Late periods. The Archaic marks several
important transitions: a shift from hunting large
to smaller game; an apparent increase in the use
of plants and the use of ground stone in food
processing; implementation of stone cooking
technology; increased use of organic materials in
tool technologies and an increase in the number
10

prolonged period of warmer temperatures and
increasing aridity. As the Altithermal progressed
through the Middle Archaic, conditions in South
and Central Texas became ever warmer and drier,
and bison herds probably retreated northwards.
Taylor bifaces were manufactured during this
period; these bifaces are similar to the earlier
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek point styles, but lack the
deep basal notches that characterize the earlier
types. By the latter part of the Middle Archaic,
Nolan and Travis points predominate; both
are stemmed varieties, and are technologically
and stylistically dissimilar to preceding styles
(Collins 1995, 2004). Temperature and aridity
were at their peaks in the Nolan-Travis interval,
and there is evidence of increased utilization of
xerophytes such as sotol (Johnson and Goode
1994). These plants were baked in earth ovens,
associated with middens of fire-cracked rock.
During drier episodes of this period, the aquiferfed streams and resource-rich environments of
Central Texas were extensively utilized (Story
1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).

Castroville, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, Ensor,
and Frio (Turner and Hester 1993:114,122). Darl
points, which vary significantly from earlier
Ensor and Frio styles, are not notched, but rather
have elongated blades and squared stems.

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late Prehistoric
to 1300/1200–260 BP, and follows Kelley (1947)
in dividing it into the Austin and Toyah phases.
This stage is marked by the shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow, and by
the incorporation of pottery in the central and
northern parts of the South Texas Plains (Black
1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Emphasis on bison
hunting during the Toyah phase was a significant
factor in determining settlement and mobility
patterns.
The Austin phase is characterized by small
arrow points, including Edwards, Scallorn,
and other types, indicating a shift from the use
of atlatls to bows. Burned rock middens are
sometimes associated with these types (Houk
and Lohse 1993). Ground and pecked stone
tools for processing plant food are common, and
burials from this time sometimes reveal a high
proportion of arrow-wound deaths (Black 1989;
Prewitt 1974), perhaps suggesting some disputes
over resource availability.

The Late Archaic dates to approximately
4000–1300/1200 BP (Collins 1995:384, 2004).
Bison herds began returning to the southern
Great Plains (Dillehay 1974), again influencing
subsistence. Cemeteries at sites such as Ernest
Witte (Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski
1988) provide some evidence that populations
increased and that groups were becoming
territorial (Story 1985:44–45), though this pattern
may have begun in South Texas by as early
as ca. 6500–7000 BP (Ricklis 2005). Pottery,
which often accompanies increased sedentism,
territoriality, and population growth, began
appearing in limited areas of the South Texas
Plains during the Late Archaic (Story 1985).
However, most regions remained “pre-ceramic”
for another thousand years (Story 1985:45–47).
Due to its length, several point styles characterize
the Late Archaic, including Bulverde, Pedernales,

The beginning of the Toyah period (750
BP) in Central Texas is marked by contractingstemmed points and flaring, barbed-shouldered
points. The Perdiz point is the most common
example (Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346), and
this type occasionally occurs on glass in mission
contexts (Lohse 1999:268). This period is also
characterized by prismatic blades, blade cores,
and scrapers-on-blades. All of these tools are
considered part of a specialized bison hunting
and processing toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985;
Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994), yet they do not
11

occur evenly across the Toyah area. The wide
variety of ceramic styles and materials seen in
Toyah pottery provides information on the social
composition of these groups (Arnn 2005), with
assemblages displaying Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast,
and Jornada Mogollon influences. Johnson (1994)
contends Toyah culture represents a constellation
of traits shared by a limited number of groups
sprawled across a very large area. Ricklis (1994)
describes it as a collection of traits that moved
through relatively stable regional populations.
Recently Arnn (2007) has argued that a large
number of cultural groups, many documented by
European explorers, interacted with each other
over a large area, resulting in the spread of shared
styles and technologies.

established Native American trade routes and
trails, and became a vital link between Mission
San Juan Bautista in Northern Mexico and the
Spanish settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas
(McGraw et al. 1991).
Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided most of the available information on
indigenous cultures of early Texas. The few
surviving accounts of native groups in Texas reveal
a dynamic cultural environment where numerous
tribes passed through or inhabited Central Texas
at different periods. Little is known about the
majority of these tribes, but those documented
around the springs at San Marcos include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane.
Other tribes encountered at San Marcos included
mobile hunting parties from villages in South
and West Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya,
Chalome, Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading
for bison hunting grounds in the Blackland
Prairies (Foster 1995:265–289; Johnson and
Campbell 1992; Newcomb 1993). Later groups
migrated into the region, displacing the former
groups or tribes. These included the Tonkawa
from Oklahoma and Lipan and Comanche from
the Plains (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Dunn
1911; Newcomb 1961, 1993). Archaeological sites
dated to this period typically contain a mix of
both European imported goods such as metal
objects, glass beads, and chipped stone tools. Site
41HY446, recorded within a few kilometers of the
Spring Lake APE, appears to contain evidence of
early Historic or Protohistoric Native American
remains.

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada) Period
The Protohistoric period was marked by
Spanish entradas, formal expeditions into Texas
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. Hester defines the period as “the
transition period between the Prehistoric and
Historic period denoting a phase for which few
written records are available, and for which
most evidence is derived from archaeology”
(1995:449–450, 2004). This period began with
the venture by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de
Vaca and the Narvaez expedition in 1528 and
extends to the establishment of the Mission San
Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in San Antonio,
in 1718.
When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, entradas began
to travel regularly through Central Texas. These
expeditions provide the first detailed observations
on the original Native American inhabitants of
the region. With Alonso de León’s expedition
of 1680, El Camino Real (the King’s Road) was
established from Villa Santiago de la Monclova
in Mexico to East Texas. This roadway followed

occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero, and the later

1970 [1915]; Habig 1977; de la Teja 1995). Most

12

knowledge of this period is gained through the
written records of the early Spanish missionaries.
Between 1746 and 1755, three missions, San
Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, San Ildefonso,
and Nuestra Señora de la Canderlaria were located
somewhere along the San Gabriel (known at the
time as the San Xavier) River in present-day Milan
County. The three missions were eventually
coalesced into one, the San Xavier Mission,
and moved to the San Marcos River in 1755. A
petition to permanently establish a mission in
Apache territory resulted in the founding of the
San Sabá Mission, near present-day Menard, in
1757. Neophytes from the San Xavier Mission in
San Marcos were transferred to the San Antonio
missions and the mission’s property and presidio
were reassigned to the San Sabá Mission. A
small group of local San Xavier Indians, the
Mayeyes, persuaded the missionaries to set up a
new mission for them on the Guadalupe River,
to be named the San Francisco Xavier Mission,
but it only lasted until 1758 (Bolton 1970 [1915]).
The precise location of the San Xavier Mission
along the San Marcos River has not yet been
determined, but is speculated to have been on the
Aquarena Center peninsula (C. Britt Bousman,
personal communication 2004).

is known as South Texas. European presence
increased as settlers received land grants from
the Mexican government until 1835. Settlement
was difficult, however, due to raids by Native
American groups. The Texas Rangers provided
protection from these conflicts after Texas
secured independence from Mexico in 1836.
Settlement in the region increased until 1845,
when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Previous Investigations
Six archaeological sites are recorded within
the vicinity of the proposed APE (Appendix
E, Figure E-1). These are 41HY37, 41HY147,
41HY160, 41HY161, 41HY165, and 41HY306.
Work has been conducted off and on at these sites
for a number of years (Table 3-1).
Based on the results of previous archaeological
investigations within and adjacent to the APE,
cultural materials in good contexts are undeniably
present. Deposits encountered at the base of the
Balcones Escarpment are in colluvial deposits
with questionable contexts. However, materials
in alluvial deposits, such as on the Aquarena
Center peninsula and along Sink Creek (see
Figure 2-3), are intact and are known to contain
isolable components. Assemblages encountered
here have dated from the Paleoindian or Early
Archaic periods continuously through to the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods and even
the Protohistoric and Historical eras. They have
demonstrable potential for providing high-quality
data that would unquestionably contribute to a
better understanding of prehistoric occupations
within the project area.

Besides the mission town of San Antonio,
the only other Spanish settlement in the region
was San Marcos de Neve, established in 1808,
four miles south of present-day San Marcos.
San Marcos de Neve was abandoned in 1812 as
a result of constant raids by local tribes (Dobie
1932). During this time, massive depopulation
occurred among Native Americans due to
diseases to which indigenous people had little
resistance. Those few remaining were gradually
displaced to reservations beginning in the mid1850s (Fisher 1998).

was described to be on the hill behind (west of)
the Aquarena Springs Inn (now the River Systems
Institute) and overlooking the golf course to the

when Clark recorded the reconstructed two-room
log home of Edward Burleson (Clark 1979). The
building was originally constructed in 1848, but
had fallen into disrepair and in 1964 was restored
with the original chimney stones and logs from
different structures that dated to the original
period. Clark also noted that the structure had
most likely been moved from its original location.

with bedrock encountered between 8 and 40 cm
below surface (cmbs), and most of the more than
700 artifacts were recovered from the surface.
Excavations were conducted in areas of noted
surface artifact concentrations, which included a
large pile of unburned rocks. Collected artifacts
included sandstone manos, bifaces, preforms,
reworked broken preforms, scrapers, a Clear Fork
gouge, choppers, cores, 682 lithic fragments, and
four diagnostic projectile points dating from the
Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period
(Garber and Orloff 1984). Site 41HY37 is thought
to reflect a number of activities ranging from
hunting and hide processing to woodworking
and plant processing (Garber and Orloff 1984).
Archaeological site 41HY37 was designated
an SAL on July 23, 1999 (Texas Historical
Commission [THC] 1999a).

In 1983, the Southwest Texas State University
(SWT, now called TxState) archaeological field
school excavated seven 1 x 1-meter (m) units and
one 1 x 2-m unit in addition to collecting numerous
surface artifacts at 41HY37. Soils were shallow,

In the summer of 2000, SWT conducted
an additional field school at 41HY37. The
14

field school was conducted at the request of
Dr. Michael Abbott, Special Assistant to the
President at SWT, to study the original Edward
Burleson Homestead. The objectives of the
study were to determine if the original site still
contained intact archaeological deposits, if the
replica constructed in the 1960s was placed
on the original site and foundation, and if the
information provided by the excavation could
be used for the accurate representation and
interpretation of the site (Bousman and Nickels
2003). Archival and archaeological investigations
indicated that the original location of the
Burleson cabin was on the ridge above Spring
Lake and that the replica structure was erected
in the general location of the original cabin. An
oral history in addition to the archaeological
investigations indicated that replica structure
was not constructed on the original foundations,
and that the original foundation and chimney
were used in the reconstruction (Bousman and
Nickels 2003). Historical artifacts indicate that
the excavation area was the general location of a
mid–nineteenth-century residence. In addition to
the historical component, four fire-cracked rock
features were uncovered. These features were
interpreted to represent prehistoric cooking ovens
and/or hearths (Bousman and Nickels 2003).
In total, 2,265 lithic artifacts were recovered
consisting of projectile points, bifaces, unifaces,
flakes, and cores. The burned rock features in
addition to the recovery of a quantity and variety
of stone tools imply that the site was utilized as an
open campsite during the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric period (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

was extended to the base of the escarpment (Arnn
and Kibler 1999).
Site 41HY37 was again revisited during an
intensive archaeological survey for the Spring
Lake Preserve Project. This survey revisited the
area of the 1983 SWT field school excavations.
During the investigations of this area, a small
amount of patinated lithic debitage was observed
on the surface. Lithic artifacts consisted of small
chert flakes or flaked chert cobbles. Additionally,
a high amount of debris including plastic, paper,
aluminum cans, miscellaneous pieces of metal,
glass bottles, and golf balls was present in
addition to many distinct piles of rubble, trash,
and biomass from Spring Lake. Other recent
disturbances included two unimproved roads;
these have existed since at least since 1983
(Garber and Orloff 1984), and one has been
modified for use as the Preserve trail system
(Yelacic and Lohse 2010).

41HY147
Investigations at the Terrace Site (Takac
1990) or Spring Lake Site (Shiner 1984) were
carried out by Joel L. Shiner intermittently from
1979 until his death in 1988. The site is composed
of several areas of archaeological debris located
along a large submerged terrace adjacent to
the western bank of Spring Lake. Primary
excavations uncovered lithic materials of various
ages within a deflated, mixed, 20-cm stratum
(Shiner 1983). Clovis, Plainview, Angostura, and
Golondrina points were found mixed with Archaic
points. Faunal remains consisting of mammoth,
mastodon, and bison tooth fragments were also
recovered (Shiner 1983). Subsequent excavations
revealed three distinct strata. The uppermost
grey clay matrix varied from 20 to 30 cm in depth
and contained Archaic points. The second layer,
composed of red sand, varied from 10 to 20 cm
in thickness and consisted of Archaic shouldered

A portion of 41HY37 was revisited by Arnn
and Kibler (1999) of Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
preceding the construction of an underground
water line. Five backhoe trenches excavated along
the base of the escarpment yielded a number
of artifacts in colluvial (i.e., slope-washed)
sediments. As a result, the boundary of 41HY37

projectile points and earlier lanceolate styles.
The last layer, containing red clay, possessed the
majority of the megafauna remains in addition
to Clovis, Plainview and other lanceolate points
(Shiner 1983). Among the artifacts collected were
a few “exotic” or nonlocal materials consisting of
red-colored quartzite, terminated quartz crystals,
and chert from 50 to 75 miles away. In addition
several scales of alligator gar were recovered, a
species far different from the local spotted gar
(Shiner 1981). Shiner (1983) postulates that the
presence of scrapers, large amounts of lithic
chipping debris, preforms, and the broken bones
of many species indicate that the site was the
location of a Paleoindian base camp supporting
an almost sedentary hunting and gathering
existence. Johnson and Holliday (1984) refute
this contention and postulate that the large
quantities of lithic artifacts were a direct result of
the presence of chert outcrops in the area.

modified among the Tee Box 6 materials (Takac
1990). Takac’s primary analysis of the Spring
Lake materials indicated a similar occurrence.
Also similar to the Tee Box 6 Site, the Spring
Lake Site (41HY147) contained a wide range of
tool types including projectile points, scrapers,
knives, drills, perforators, burins, and gouges in
addition to bifacial and discoidal cores at various
stages of reduction (Takac 1990). Takac’s project
was eventually abandoned due to the difficulty
and high costs of underwater investigations.
Combined, Takac’s and Shiner’s excavations
recovered a total of 46 Paleoindian projectile
points, most dating to the Late Paleoindian period.
Archaeological site 41HY147 was designated an
SAL on July 23, 1999 (THC 1999b).

41HY160
Archaeological site 41HY160 was initially
investigated during a field school directed by
James Garber (1983) in 1982. 41HY160 is located
on the peninsula between Spring Lake and Sink
Creek. Garber’s work was conducted in the
part of the site near Tee Box 6 of the University
golf course. In total, 34 m3 were excavated to
varying depths, with the deepest unit excavated
to 2.4 m. Intact Late Prehistoric through Early
Archaic occupations were exposed (Garber et al.
1983). The terminus of cultural deposits was not
determined due to the water table. Garber et al.
(1983) speculated that cultural remains are present
beneath the water table level based on Shiner’s
recovery of artifacts from approximately 10
feet (ft) below the water surface of Spring Lake.
Excavations indicated that only the upper 15
cm of soil were disturbed by historic processes,
and that the remaining deposits were intact.
Seventy-five projectile points (53 of which were
identifiable) were recovered; these date to the
Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic-to-Late Prehistoric
transition, the Archaic, and Paleoindian periods.
Late Prehistoric points such as Perdiz, Scallorn,

In October of 1989, following Shiner’s
death, Southern Methodist University graduate
student Paul R. Takac took possession of Shiner’s
notes and collections in an attempt to complete
analysis of the collection and conduct additional
excavations at the Spring Lake Site (Takac
1990). He conducted additional underwater
investigations of 41HY147 in 1990 and 1991.
Takac (1990), like Shiner, contends that the
paleoenvironment of the Spring Lake area in
addition to the abundance of raw lithic materials
and a permanent, reliable water source may have
supported semi-sedentary hunter gatherer groups
in the past. Takac argues that the importance of
readily available and diverse floral and faunal
resources must be incorporated when modeling
economic settlement strategies (Takac 1990).
Takac also compared the Spring Lake material
to the Early Archaic and Late Prehistoric lithic
remains recovered by Garber et al. (1983) at the
Tee Box 6 Site (41HY160). Garber noted a high
incidence of usable flakes that were not utilized or
16

Cliffton, and Alba were found between 0 and 20
cmbs; Transitional Archaic points (Darl, Fairland,
and Edgewood) were recovered between 20 and 40
cmbs; Late Archaic points (Ensor, Frio, Marshall,
and Castroville) were excavated between 30 and
50 cmbs; early Late Archaic points (Pedernales)
occurred between 50 and 70 cmbs; and Nolan and
Early Stemmed points representing the Middle
and Early Archaic intervals were found between
70 and 190 cmbs. No points characteristic of the
Paleoindian to Archaic transition were noted
(Garber et al. 1983). In addition, 429 stone
tools consisting of choppers, scrapers, cores,
fine bifaces, moderately worked bifaces, crude
bifaces, used-retouched flakes, and intentionally
retouched flakes were also collected. Garber et al.
(1983) state that the source of the chert cobbles
is a limestone chert outcrop approximately one
kilometer to the north of the site. It appears that
tool finishing was an important activity at the site,
due to the presence of over 35,000 piece of lithic
debitage (Garber et al. 1983). The majority of
the lithic debitage has been classified as interior
flakes representing the final stages of reduction.
In addition, two bone awls and one flesher (bone
tool) were recovered. Three sandstone grinding
slabs were found in the Late Prehistoric and
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric transition zone.
Twenty-six ceramic sherds were also recovered
from this zone representing Leon Plain ware and
Caddoan type vessels (Garber et al. 1983). Faunal
remains consisted of bison, deer, and antelope.
Thirteen features were encountered and include
five hearths, three stone alignments, two small
burned rock middens, one posthole, one trash
pit, and an area containing charcoal and pieces
of fired, shell-tempered clay, possibly indicating
ceramic production (Garber et al. 1983). Based
on these results, this area seems to contain the
intact remains from occupations dating from the
Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric. The presence
of Paleoindian projectile points suggests early

deposits that are not yet understood. Garber et
al. (1983) recommend additional investigations at
the site to better understand the nature of these
earlier deposits.
SWT field school participants returned to
41HY160 area under the direction of David Driver
in 1991. Three units were excavated in the Tee Box
6 area, three were conducted in the vicinity of the
swimming pool in front of the Spring Lake hotel
(now filled in), and a seventh unit was excavated to
the northeast of the anthropology field laboratory
(present-day biology field laboratory) on the edge
of the golf course. Units in the Tee Box 6 area
were excavated to 70 cmbs. Units in the area of
the swimming pool were excavated to between
50 and 160 cmbs. Most of the upper deposits near
the swimming pool were mixed (James Garber,
personal communication 1999), but some of the
lower deposits appeared to be intact. The unit next
to the anthropology laboratory was excavated to
100 cmbs. While field notes report the recovery
of cultural remains from these units, excavations
have not been cataloged, analyzed, or reported.
A 1993 SWT field school was conducted
at Tee Box 6 of 41HY160 under the direction
of David Driver. During this field school an
additional six units were excavated and varied in
depth from 80 to 160 cmbs. Collected artifacts
include ceramic fragments, shell, lithic cores,
bone, lithic debitage, points, and point fragments.
These excavations have also not been fully
cataloged, analyzed, or reported.
In 1997, Dawn Ramsey (1997) conducted
a pedestrian survey and shovel-testing project
at Aquarena Center. She excavated 10 shovel
tests on the east side (left bank) of Sink Creek
and northeast of the entrance road immediately
east of the escarpment. All but one shovel test
produced prehistoric artifacts.

In 1998, under the direction of Kathryn
Brown, participants in the SWT field school
excavated six units at 41HY160 in the vicinity
of the Aquarena Center buildings. Units
were excavated to between 20 and 148 cmbs.
Excavations were halted in most of the units
when the shallow water table was reached. Intact
deposits were found immediately below the
present surface in two of the units. Collected
artifacts include bifaces, shell, bone, lithic
debitage, and points. This collection has also not
been fully cataloged, analyzed, or reported. Site
41HY160 was designated an SAL on July 23,
1999 (THC 1999c).

purposes of this project were to determine the
presence or absence of cultural remains in the
areas to be impacted, and to evaluate the integrity
of any cultural materials and determine their
potential for providing significant archaeological
information. Additional geological coring was
conducted by the Bureau of Economic Geology,
The University of Texas at Austin, in order to
document the Late Pleistocene and Holocene
depositional history of the valley. This produced
another set of 22 cores that were extracted in two
valley cross sections. Six 1 x 1-m test units were
excavated to an average depth of 1.7 m. Two units
were placed in the footprint of a proposed pavilion
and restrooms, and four units were placed in the
area of the Spring Lake Hotel swimming pool
and surrounding parking lot. Samples collected
from the test excavations included radiocarbon,
archaeomagnetic samples of burned rock from
features, and macrobotanical samples. Over
18,380 pieces of lithic material were collected,
including 18 projectile points, 82 bifaces, 19
cores, two ground stones, one hammerstone, 213
unifaces, and 18,046 pieces of lithic debitage
(Nickels and Bousman 2010). In addition, 2,650
fire-cracked rocks from 12 features were subjected
to in field analysis, 4,388 faunal remains were
collected, and 37,672 snail shells were collected.
No ceramic remains were encountered. The
investigation documented the presence of intact
and well-stratified archaeological deposits within
the upper 1.7 m. Nickels and Bousman (2010)
contended that based on the coring and also their
own investigations and also previous work, intact
alluvial deposits in the floodplain adjacent to the
San Marcos Springs contain evidence of human
occupations extending from Paleoindian to Late
Prehistoric.

In 1999, Prewitt & Associates conducted a
geological assessment of the Aquarean Center
peninsula through the extraction of 17 30-ft (9-m),
3-inch-diameter cores in preparation for potential
limited development by Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD) (Goelz 1999). The primary
result of this work was to provide an outline of the
late Quaternary geological history of the valley
and the potential for prehistoric occupations.
Goelz’s (1999) geological assessment indicated
that soil deposits are shallow near the escarpment,
but quickly thicken to an average depth of 8.4 m
in the central portion of the site. The recovery
of cultural materials in such small cores is
not common, and recovery usually indicates
reasonably dense occupation. The majority of
the core samples produced prehistoric artifacts
indicating a dense concentration of artifacts in
the area. Cultural materials were recovered to
a depth of 6.5 m. The estimated age for cultural
materials at 6.5 m below the surface is 10,000 BP
(Nickels and Bousman 2010).
In 2001, an archaeological testing project
was conducted as part of a master plan and
partnership between TPWD and SWT to develop
a public interpretive and educational center on
the peninsula (Nickels and Bousman 2010). The

More recent investigations at 41HY160
include SWT/TxState field schools conducted in
2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006; these results have
been partially reported by Aery (2007) and a
18

detailed analysis is currently underway by CAS.
Data recovery excavations at 41HY160 began
after the 2001 testing project determined the
potential for stratified and intact buried deposits
at the site in the pecan grove area adjacent to the
River Systems Institute parking lot (Aery 2007).
Excavations conducted during the proceeding
field schools were a result of mitigation measures
to compensate for the loss of information from
proposed construction in the area. The 2001
field school was supervised by Kathryn Brown
and Britt Bousman, and Bousman supervised
the final three seasons of this work. Excavations
reached approximately 170 cm deep before
encountering the water table. Deposits appear
to span from Toyah to the Calf Creek horizon of
the early portion of the Middle Archaic. At the
very bottom of the block, trace amounts of Early
Archaic materials were recovered, though this
period was not well sampled.

investigations immediately below the falls of
this dam, known as the Ice House Falls. Shiner
found artifacts, mostly from the Middle Archaic,
occurring in the sand and gravel among large
cobbles at the foot of the Ice House Falls (Shiner
1979). A clay stratum approximately 1 m below
the water level was identified on the west bank
that may contain a relict portion of a site (Shiner
1979). Altogether these efforts resulted in the
collection of 2,513 artifacts consisting of 1,762
pieces of lithic chips, 29 lithic cores, 201 biface
thinning flakes, 141 cortex fragments, 234 flakes,
and 146 tools. Tools included seven endscrapers,
six side scrapers, two scrapers, six notched tools,
one arrow point, 31 dart points, 51 preforms,
five burins, six gravers, four borers, one drill,
three scaled pieces, six gouges, 12 retouched
flakes, one chopper, three hand axes, and one
hammer. Projectile points included 10 Pedernales
points, five Bulverde points, six Nolan points,
three unidentified notched points, and four
unidentified triangular points. Almost half of the
collected tools consist of broken or incomplete
bifaces (Shiner 1979). Shiner contends that the
assemblage is reflective of hunter-gatherer groups
between 1000 BC and 3500 BC that occupied the
site for a lengthy period of time.

In August of 2006, CAS conducted
monitoring and trench inspection of 1,600
linear feet of proposed fiber optic line conduit
to be placed through the Aquarena Springs Golf
Course (Oksanen 2006). A segment of the line
was within the boundary of 41HY160 in the area
of Tee Box 6. The remains of three small thermal
features were recorded within the localized area
of Tee Box 6. The impacts to the archaeological
deposits were minimal and no significant
cultural deposits were encountered or disturbed.
CAS recommended clearance for the conduit
installation to the THC, and the THC concurred.

In the fall of 1982, SWT maintenance
operations uncovered two burials in the area
of the Fish Ponds on the university campus
and within the boundaries of 41HY161. An
emergency recovery project was conducted by
Garber (Garber and Glassman 1992). Burial 1
was encountered in the sidewall of a narrow water
pipeline trench at 65 cmbs. The fragmentary
nature of the remains prohibited a basic
osteobiographical profile. No skeletal pathologies
or cause of death were identifiable (Garber and
Glassman 1992). Burial 2 consisted of 45 percent
of the skeletal remains of a single individual.
Only four cranial fragments and the left petrous
portion of the temporal bone were present from

41HY161
In 1840, early San Marcos settlers constructed
a large log and earth dam across the San Marcos
River to impound the waters for a flour mill.
This dam, called the Ice House dam, impounded
Spring Lake at a depth of 3–4 m above the
natural river (Shiner 1981). In 1979, Shiner began

19

the cranium (Garber and Glassman 1992). Two of
the recovered bones had been burned, including
the right humeral fragment. The individual was
identified as an adult female between 64 and 66
inches in height. No skeletal pathologies or cause
of death were noted (Garber and Glassman 1992).
Archaeological site 41HY161 was designated an
SAL on March 13, 1987 (THC 1987).

plants and animals with a minor contribution
form riverine resources. In contrast, Individual
1 displayed dietary values suggesting a marinebased diet. This suggests that Individual 1 may
have migrated inland from a coastal region
(Munoz et al. 2011).
In August of 1997, the Center for
Archaeological Research (CAR) at The University
of Texas at San Antonio conducted an intensive
archaeological survey at 41HY161 in advance of
a proposed parking lot adjacent to the Ice House
Mill (Ford and Lyle 1998). Investigations included
pedestrian survey, backhoe trenching, and
shovel testing to identify prehistoric and historic
cultural remains and determine the amount of
possible disturbance. Two backhoe trenches were
excavated to depths of 1.2 m and 1.8 m. Eleven
shovel tests were excavated, with six excavated
in the area of the proposed parking lot and two
along the river bank. Shovel tests were excavated
to a depth of 50 cmbs whenever possible (Ford
and Lyle 1998). Most shovel tests encountered
modern construction or natural disturbances.
One shovel test encountered prehistoric flakes
and faunal remains, but these materials appeared
to be in a mixed context. CAR determined that
modern and historic construction has disturbed
this portion of 41HY161.

Additional analyses of the burials recovered
from 41HY161 were conducted as a part of the
data recovery program conducted by CAS for
archaeological site 41HY163. These remains
were included to enlarge the bioarchaeological
population of the San Marcos area for comparative
analyses. Analyses consisted of descriptive and
isotopic analysis, and also of direct dating. These
recent analyses should be considered the most
accurate and current reconstruction. Less than
25 percent of Individual 1 was recovered and
the remains displayed significant postmortem
trauma, most likely the result of heavy equipment
used during excavation. The remains of Individual
2 provided limited biological profile information.
Metric analyses indicate that Individual 1 was
a female, aged between 25 to 45 years, and
stood between 61 and 66 inches tall (Stull and
Hamilton 2011). These remains were dated to
515 ± 20 BP. Due to the condition of the remains
from burial two, it can only be determined that
this individual was an adult of indeterminate sex
and stature. These remains dated to 3510 ± 20 BP
(Stull and Hamilton 2011).

In the spring and summer of 1998, CAR
returned to 41HY161 to conduct subsurface testing
along the proposed route of a water pipeline for
SWT. The proposed pipeline included a section
along the banks of the San Marcos River and
sections adjacent to the Aquatic Biology Building.
Investigations included excavation of 27 shovel
tests, two backhoe trenches, and three test units,
and monitoring of the pipeline installation (Lyle et
al. 2000). Twenty-six shovel tests were excavated
in three sections; Section 1 (the lawn area south
of the Aquatic Biology Building), Section 2 (the

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data
from bone collagen were also collected from
the 41HY161 burials in order to reconstruct
paleodietary histories of the individuals in an
attempt to determine their point of origin and
possible cultural affiliation (Munoz et al. 2011).
The dietary data from Individual 2 indicated
a subsistence strategy focused on terrestrial

20

breezeway of the Aquatic Biology Building), and
Section 3 (the west lawn of the Aquatic Biology
Building). The richest artifact recovery was from
Section 3. Shovel tests in this location indicated
an upper layer of disturbed soils over lower intact
soils containing prehistoric material remains
(Lyle et al. 2000). The Section 1 trench revealed
an area that appears to be highly disturbed
by construction and the demolition of historic
buildings, while the Section 2 trench displayed
disturbed soils over intact soils encountered at
100–120 cmbs. Backhoe trenches were excavated
to a depth of 140–170 cmbs. As Section 3
possessed a high potential for intact prehistoric
cultural remains, three test units were excavated
in this location to depths between 70 and 100
cmbs. Investigations indicated that the upper 30
cm of deposits contained a mixture of modern,
historic, and prehistoric cultural remains.
Deposits between 30 and 80 cmbs contained
intact Early Archaic remains. While Paleoindian
remains were encountered below 80 cmbs, the
nature of the deposits was not determined.

Investigations revealed intact soil deposits at
180–190 cmbs, at which point a 3 x 4-m block was
established. Eight 1 x 1-m units were excavated
by hand to a depth of 260 cmbs. Unit profiles
indicate the development of a terrace in a slowly
aggrading environment. A series of occupation
zones dating from 7700 BP were identified
during investigations consisting of three distinct
Early Archaic occupation zones and a fourth zone
containing a mixture of Early and Late Archaic
materials (Oksanen 2008). This project provided
information about the little-known Early Archaic
period in Central Texas. The estimated age of
deposits span 1,000 years, from ca. 7700 BP to
6650 BP, and identify three distinct occupational
zones. The site was most intensively used during
the earliest occupation. The assemblages from
the earliest occupation, ca. 7700 BP, indicated
that the area was utilized for the processing of
large game animals, refitting of projectile points,
and procuring of lithic materials. The third
occupation zone, ca. 6650 BP indicated a shift
away from large game coupled with a decline in
projectile points and other big game processing
tools (Oksanen 2008).

In the spring of 2000, CAS conducted
archaeological monitoring of a 200-m-long
irrigation trench located adjacent to 41HY161
(Jones 2002). The area was once the location of
a United States Federal Fish Hatchery that was
established in 1893. Monitoring was conducted
to ascertain if intact deposits were present
and if so, if they would be impacted by the
construction of an irrigation trench. Evidence of
extensive disturbance, possibly dating from the
Fish Hatchery’s construction in 1893, was noted
during the monitoring of trench excavations.

CAS again conducted an archaeological
monitoring of a shallow trench excavation on
behalf of TxState in the spring of 2008 (Yelacic
et al. 2008) to the southwest of 41HY161. The
trench was excavated in order to bury waterlines
supplying water to the decorative ponds around
the University’s Theatre Center. The trench
was approximately 50 m long, 20 cm wide, and
50 cm at its deepest point. No cultural remains
or features were noted during excavations. The
deposit appeared to be disturbed by construction
of the United States Federal Fish Hatchery Ponds
in 1893 (Yelacic et al. 2008).

Between May and September of 2004, CAS
conducted data recovery excavations at 41HY161.
The excavations were conducted as partial
mitigation for the installation of flood control
measures on Sessom Creek (Oksanen 2008).

Finally, CAS conducted investigations during
September 2009, in advance of the construction

21

of a boiler station to be placed adjacent to the
University’s Jowers Center. Two test units were
excavated within the proposed footprint of the
building. While excavations encountered mixed
historic and prehistoric deposits, these deposits
were perceived as a continuation of nearby
archaeological site 41HY161, and the boundaries
of this site were extended to encompass these
newly uncovered cultural remains (Leezer et al.
2010).

projects, the majority of the encountered deposits
appeared in a mixed context. However, discrete
areas of intact prehistoric deposits were also
noted, and CAS recommended that 41HY165 be
extended to incorporate these areas.
Additional prehistoric deposits associated
with 41HY165 were encountered in 2003 during
the monitoring of irrigation trenches for a new
irrigations system on the University Golf Course.
A dense deposit of lithic artifacts were recovered
from an area that extends from the boundary of
site 41HY165 established during the Front Door
Project through the eighth green and fairwary.
It was recommended again that the boundaries
of site 41HY165 be extended to encompass these
deposits (Soucie et al. 2004).

41HY165
Site 41HY165 is located at the confluence of
Sink Creek and Spring Lake on a small peninsula
that extends out into the eastern half of the lake
and also extends around the lake margins to the
southwest. The first investigations at 41HY165
were conducted in 1984 by James Garber as part
of a field school for SWT. A second field school
was conducted in 1988 by David Driver and Jim
Garber, and focused on testing and recording the
site. Finally, three field schools were conducted
on the site between 1996 and 1998 by Garber
and Kathryn Brown that involved intensive
testing. During the 1996, 1997, and 1998 field
schools, 11 test units were excavated over the
eastern portion of the site. Data from the 1996,
1997, and 1998 investigations were used as
the basis for Christopher Ringstaff’s masters’
thesis (Ringstaff 2000). Ringstaff focused on
the geoarchaeological properties of the site, but
offers a relatively comprehensive study of the
three field school seasons. Results from 1996
and 1997 were also used for a preliminary faunal
analysis by Giesecke (1998).

41HY306
Site 41HY306 was identified during an
archaeological survey and geomorphological
assessment of a proposed water line near Spring
Lake (Arnn and Kibler 1999). Investigators
concluded that 41HY306 possessed stratified
cultural remains in alluvial deposits representing
much of the Holocene and having the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of prehistoric
life ways (Arnn and Kibler 1999). Cultural
remains were recovered from two levels: above
1.5 m and below 2.5 m. Although no diagnostic
materials were recovered, it was suggested that
the lower deposits may be of Early Archaic or
Paleoindian age, while the upper deposits are of a
Late Archaic age (Arnn and Kibler 1999).
Additional prehistoric deposits attributed
to site 41HY306 were also encountered during
monitoring of trench excavations associated with
the installation of a new irrigation system on
the University Golf Course (Soucie et al. 2004).
Prehistoric lithic deposits were encountered along
the first fairway and adjacent to Bert Brown Road
at its juncture with Sink Creek. The boundaries of

Between 2000 and 2001, CAS conducted
archaeological monitoring of a tree-planting
project undertaken by the Department of
Biology, and of the construction of the Campus
Map Board along Aquarena Springs Drive (Front
Door Project). While numerous prehistoric and
historic artifacts were uncovered during these

to encompass these newly uncovered deposits

on the Aquarena Center peninsula, along Sink
Creek, and throughout most of the current
APE (see Figure 2-3), represent the most intact
contexts and have the highest potential for
isolable archaeological components. Components
and assemblages encountered in these areas
have the potential to date from the Paleoindian
or Early Archaic through the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods, even into the Protohistoric
and Historical eras. These deposits provide the
greatest potential to provide high-quality data sets
that would contribute to a better understanding of
prehistoric occupations within the project area.

Summary
Based on the results of previous
archaeological investigations within and
adjacent to the APE, cultural materials in good
contexts are undeniably present. Archaeological
remains encountered at the base of the Balcones
Escarpment appear in colluvial deposits with
questionable contexts. However, materials found
in alluvial deposits, such as those encountered

Methods
In order to fully assess the APE for adverse
effects to cultural resources, CAS conducted
archaeological investigations to determine the
presence and, to a degree, nature of prehistoric
deposits. The current undertaking includes
the removal of all submerged structures and
the restoration of aquatic habitats throughout
the Spring Lake peninsula, meaning that the
process of assessing the APE for these deposits
requires both standard terrestrial and underwater
investigations of the locations where proposed
impacts and modifications will occur. As
previously noted and described in more detail
in Chapter 5, known trinomials in the APE have
never been completely surveyed or delineated
prior to this undertaking. Consequently, these
efforts focused on identifying the distribution
of remains across the entire APE with the
understanding that newly encountered deposits
are associated with one of the previously recorded
SALs and do not represent new sites. Results
of this survey are used to define ASAs within
existing SALs; these are discussed in detail in
Chapter 6.

to correspond with available project design work
that indicated the location(s) and nature(s) of
proposed impacts. For instance, the removal of
nonlocal grasses across the APE constitutes a
shallow impact, whereas deeper impacts (e.g., lift
stations) are proposed only for specific locations.
All proposed impacts were addressed by some
combination of shovel tests (n = 196), backhoe
trenches (n = 4), mechanical auguring (n = 1), and
hand-excavated units (n = 3).
A 100 percent pedestrian survey was
conducted of the APE augmented by shovel
tests, followed by 1 x 1-m test units, a single
auger excavation, and the backhoe trenches. The
pedestrian survey involved the visual inspection
of surface areas along transects lines. Transect
lines were spaced no more than 15 m apart in
areas identified for vegetation removal and soil
preparation. All artifacts that were encountered
on the surface during the survey were plotted and
collected, including the location of diagnostic
artifacts. Shovel test excavations were then used
to determine the presence of and evaluate the
horizontal and vertical extent of cultural deposits
down to a meter below the surface. These probes
were spaced as evenly as possible across the APE
and were excavated to a meter in depth except
where sterile sediments, bedrock, impenetrable
strata, or the water table were encountered. The
excavation of three test units focused on areas
possessing buried deposits identified during
shovel test excavations. These areas contained
dense, stratified deposits, and/or were particularly
near the ground surface. Backhoe trenches were

Terrestrial Investigations
CAS
conducted
an
archaeological
assessment of the SLAERP APE in order to
determine existing boundaries for previously
recorded sites, and to assess the horizontal and
vertical distribution of cultural resources that
may occur outside of established site boundaries
within the APE (see Figure 1-2). The methods
for the terrestrial investigations were designed
25

excavated to assess the stratigraphy, integrity,
and potential for buried resources in selected
locations on the Aquarena Center Peninsula. The
mechanical auger was excavated to examine the
proposed location of a lift station at depths that
could not be reached through other means. Each
of these activities is described in detail below.

the locations of deposits, and identify cultural
deposits that may be located between previously
recorded sites and in areas that have never been
subjected to survey. Following the requirements
of the MOA, data from these test units is used to
develop detailed information regarding the nature
of deposits in areas not previously subjected to
extensive excavation. All units were excavated to
a depth of 150 cmbs or until bedrock or the water
table was encountered. A 5-gallon bucket of soil
was collected from each excavated level and
water screened through nested ¼-inch and ⅛-inch
screen in order to recover small-sized cultural
materials and faunal remains. A 4-liter bulk soil
sample was also collected from each unit level.
These samples were processed by flotation for the
recovery of small fauna, plant remains, and lithic
debris that would pass through the ⅛-inch screen.
All remaining excavated soils were screened
through ¼-inch screen. Encountered artifacts
were collected and their vertical and horizontal
locations mapped. Profiles were recorded for at
least two walls of each unit.

Shovel Tests
CAS systematically excavated by hand
196 shovel tests in areas to be subject to exotic
vegetation removal and soil preparation, and that
are to be impacted through their use as routes of
site access during construction and demolition.
Impacts during vegetation removal and soil
preparation are anticipated to be no more than
1 ft (30 cm) in depth, affecting primarily those
deposits on the surface or that are shallowly
buried. Shovel tests were spaced approximately
15 m apart due to the dense nature of previously
identified deposits within the APE, yielding a
clear picture of the horizontal distribution of
cultural materials on the peninsula. Each shovel
test was excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels to a
depth of 100 cmbs or to sterile soil or impenetrable
clay layers. All excavated sediments were passed
through ¼-inch hardware screen. All artifacts
were collected by the level from which they were
encountered. Horizontal and vertical information
as well as soil composition and stratigraphic
information were recorded on standardized
shovel test forms. All shovel test locations were
recorded with a hand-held submeter accurate
GPS unit and plotted on a universal map of the
Spring Lake area.

All excavations were recorded on
standardized unit-level forms, and photographs
were taken to provide additional recording of
the excavations. All unit locations were recorded
with a hand-held submeter accurate GPS unit and
plotted on a universal map of the Spring Lake
area. Back dirt was returned to the units after
each unit excavation was completed. Units were
surrounded by orange plastic mesh (snow fencing)
daily and were covered by plywood boards at
night to prevent animals from accidentally falling
into the units.

Test Units

Data from these units complement that from
the shovel tests in assessing the integrity and
significance of cultural deposits. Results are also
used to develop recommendations concerning
how these deposits might be avoided or protected
during the undertaking, or for appropriate

Three 1 x 1-m test units were excavated in
locations identified during shovel test excavations
as containing intact, stratified, and/or clearly
definable cultural components. The primary
purpose of the testing program was to map out

mitigative efforts to offset the loss of important
cultural information that will result in the event
that the deposits cannot be avoided

screening and description. Screened sediment
was passed through ¼-inch hardware mesh, and
sediments were characterized by color, texture,
and inclusions. Given the method of excavation
and the amount of moisture, description of
structure and other soil characteristics (e.g., pores,
coats, carbonates, etc.) were not possible. Depth
measurements were obtained by tape measure
and are less accurate with depth, especially
beyond the water table, which was encountered
at approximately 144.78 cmbs.

Backhoe Trenches
Four backhoe trenches were excavated in
areas with the potential for deeply buried intact
cultural deposits that were more extensive than
could be understood by additional shovel testing
or 1 x 1-m units. Trenches varied in length from
3 to 6 m and from 1 to 2 m in depth. Width also
varied, as trenches exceeding 1.5 m in depth were
benched or stepped back for safety. In addition
to assessing cultural deposits, these trenches
also allowed geomorphic analysis to interpret
stratigraphy, depositional history, and natural
processes that have affected soil deposition on
the Aquarena Peninsula. Examining depositional
histories is a useful aid for reconstructing the
sequence of cultural and natural events that
contributed to site build-up and preservation.
Intact cultural deposits encountered during
backhoe trench excavations were mapped and
recorded.

Underwater Investigations
In addition to the terrestrial investigations
described above, CAS conducted underwater
investigations in the areas where impacts are
proposed. Specifically, these locations include
areas surrounding (in front of and behind) the
Submarine Theatre (sub), which is to be removed
by yet-unspecified means, and submerged land
formations at the far western end of the peninsula
adjacent to the Landing where a concrete boat
ramp is to be installed. Underwater investigations
included two reconnaissance-level surveys,
extraction of sediment cores, and excavation of
a test unit.

Auguring
An augur pit was excavated in the location of
a proposed lift station to be located approximately
35 m to the east of the Skyline Pavilion Ride. The
proposed depth of this lift station is approximately
12 ft, which easily exceeds any depth that can
be safely reached through manual excavation
or backhoe trenching. This auger was carefully
monitored to assess the location for deeply buried
cultural deposits. The pit measured 38.1 cm in
diameter and 431.8 cm deep. This excavation
took place at the western edge of the parking
lot beneath a very large cottonwood tree, in the
center of the western end of the peninsula. To
the degree possible, sediments were excavated in
61-cm (2-ft) levels, and approximately 50 percent
of the sediment from each level was sampled for

Reconnaissance
Two
reconnaissance-level
underwater
surveys were conducted, one examining the sub
area and one examining the extent of lake bottom
cultural deposits in areas that will be included in
the APE. The goal of investigations around the
sub were to determine the physical relationship
between the sub and the bottom and banks of
Spring Lake to ascertain if removal of the sub
had the potential of impacting intact cultural
resources that might be present in these sediments
and alluvial landforms. These investigations
consisted of a visual inspection and photographic
documentation of the sub’s physical location

27

lake. Specific areas that were
examined included not only the
area around the sub, but also
those between the sub location
and the Landing, where project
design plans currently call for
a boat ramp to be installed so
that the sub can be removed in
sections by use of a barge.

Coring
Alluvial
deposition
processes and chronologies

stratigraphic points and submitted for dating.

During this phase of the underwater
assessment, 12 cores were extracted, 10 of which
were preliminarily assessed for geoarchaeological
data to make recommendations about the
likelihood of underwater deposits and potential
impacts. Eight of the 10 analyzed cores were
removed from around the sub; prior to the
removal of any of these, modern pea gravels

that was excavated to a depth of approximately
150 cm below the lake bottom. This test unit was

to associated provenience information. All
materials were prepared for permanent curation
at the Archaeological Curation Facility at CAS.

Recording
All artifacts, samples for radiometric

encountered during this work were carefully
collected and immediately stored in appropriate
packaging (aluminum foil, plastic vials, and
ziplock bags, with padding and protection as
necessary) in order to maintain their integrity for
later analysis and eventual storage. All collected
materials were removed from the work site and
returned to the CAS lab facility on a daily basis
to ensure their safety and complete processing
as fieldwork commenced. Comparisons were
made between field inventory sheets and items

Curation
All artifacts and records from this project will
be curated at the Archaeological Curation Facility

Results of Terrestrial Investigations

This chapter presents the results of terrestrial
(subsurface survey and testing) and underwater
(reconnaissance survey and coring) investigations
of the APE. Terrestrial archaeological
investigations consisted of pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel tests, limited test units,
an auger unit, and backhoe trench excavations.
Underwater investigations included limited
reconnaissance survey and extraction of sediment
cores (see Chapter 5 for Methodology).

Shovel Test Excavations
The APE for the current undertaking was
divided into three sections (Figure 5-1), Sections
I, II, and III. Section I is location on the hillside
bank on the northwest side of Spring Lake. The
area is 75 ft (22.86 m) wide and extends from the
River Systems Institute building to the parking lot
of the Saltgrass Steak House Restaurant. Section

II encompasses the APE along Sink Creek and
varies between 20 ft and 75 ft (6.09 m and 22.86
m) wide. This area extends along both banks
of Sink Creek from its confluence with Spring
Lake, through the university Golf Course, and
ends at Bert Brown Street. Section III consists
of the Aquarena Center buildings, grounds, and
parking lots.

of bone, building materials, charcoal, ceramics,
glass, lithics, metal, organics, shell, and other.
Collected building materials include concrete
and asphalt; most of these materials are historic
or modern in age. A ceramic wastewater pipe
fragment, fragments of a flower pot, and floor
tile fragments were also collected, in addition
to fragments of vessel-shaped glass and bottles.
These artifacts, including metal nails, pull
tabs, a washer, metal scrap, and various types
of plastic fragments, are most likely associated
with prior use of the area as an amusement park.
Three pieces of faunal bone were recovered, but
only one (from ST17) was identifiable to species
(deer). Organics included a wood fragment and
two pecan nut shell fragments. Collected shell
artifacts mostly included terrestrial snails. Lithic
artifacts included four fragments of fire-cracked
rock, five pieces of chert debitage, and one biface
tool (possibly a scraper and/or graver; Figure
5-2).

Section I
Section I, consisting of 2.99 acres, is
characterized as a steep, sloping area along the
northwestern side of Spring Lake. The area was
once part of the Aquarena Springs Amusement
Park and today contains trails leading to a River
Walk, Grist Mill, Alligator Exhibit, Artist Studio,
Sky Spiral, reconstructed Spanish Mission, Sky
Ride, and a reconstruction of the Burleson Home.
The trails and the former park attractions are
now abandoned and overgrown with vegetation.
The area is dense with tree and lower story
undergrowth. Site 41HY37, a registered SAL,
lies approximately 30–50 m to the northeast
of Section I; this site will not be impacted by
proposed modifications. Another SAL, 41HY161,
lies to the southwest of Section I, is also outside
the APE, and will not be impacted (See Appendix
E, Figure E-2).

Modern artifacts recovered from shovel
test excavations in Section I are indicative of
recent use of the area as an amusement park.
Prehistoric artifacts consisting of lithic debitage
and a possible scraper/graver were collected from
the bottom of the sloping hillside of Section I
and most likely represent down wash from the
upper area of the hillside, where site 41HY37 is
located. The boundaries of 41HY37 lie outside
the APE and the site will not be impacted by
proposed construction. Based on these results, no
new or unknown archaeological sites or cultural
deposits were encountered in Section I. CAS will
recommend that construction/demolition in this
area proceed as there is a low probability that
intact cultural deposits will be impacted.

Shovel tests within Section I were excavated
approximately 15 m apart (where possible) in
relatively flat surface areas (areas with less than
20 percent slopes) (see Appendix D, Figure D-1).
These areas were generally situated along an
upper ridgeline along the northwestern boundary
of the APE and along the lake side. Thirty-one
shovel tests (ST01 through ST31) were excavated
in Section I. Shovel tests were excavated to an
average depth of 40 cmbs, where bedrock was
generally encountered.

In total, 410 artifacts were collected from
shovel tests in Section I. These artifacts consist

artifacts. The majority of
bone collected consisted of
unidentifiable faunal remains;
however, a fish scale (from

investigation, a well and concrete slabs were also
noted, corresponding to structures identified
during the Front Door Drive Project. The historic

Shovel tests in Section II were excavated
approximately 15 m apart along the edge of Sink
Creek (see Appendix D, Figure D-2). In total,
119 shovel tests (ST32 through ST141, STN,
STE, STW, STS, STNE, STNW, STSE, STSW,
and STCENTER) were excavated in this section.
Shovel tests were excavated to an average depth
of 50 cmbs, at which point impenetrable clays
were encountered. Many units encountered the
water table between 20 and 30 cmbs; excavations
continued in these cases to impenetrable clays.

to be an extension of 41HY165. Both previous

caps and pull tabs. Organics included wood
and seed fragments, while artifacts classified as
other generally consisted of plastic fragments.
A pair of earrings were recovered and classified
under personal items. Snail shell composed the
majority of the shell material. Artifacts classified
as building materials, glass, metal, other, and
personal items represent modern use of the area
as an amusement park.

Section III
Section III consists of 8.66 acres and is
located on the peninsula with the Aquarena
Center structures and parking lots. All of Section
III lies within the boundaries of SAL 41HY160
(see Appendix E, Figure E-2). The area is
characterized by level, mowed grass with large
native and nonnative trees. It is bounded on the
north and west sides by Spring Lake and Sink
Creek, and on the southern and southeastern sides
by the TxState Golf Course. The parking lot for
the River Systems Institute lies to the northeast.

Approximately 160 lithic artifacts were
collected from shovel tests in Section III. These
include biface fragments (n = 4), cores (n = 2),
debitage (n = 79), fire-cracked rock (n = 69),
and projectile points (n = 2) (Figure 5-5). One
projectile point (416-1) is a probable Darl and the
other (421-1) resembles an Ensor type. Four pieces
of gravel and/or pebbles were also collected.
Recovered lithic artifacts indicate prehistoric
occupations of the area. Shovel tests encountered
prehistoric lithic deposits in locations adjacent
to the Aquarena Center structures and parking
lots, indicating that dense concentrations of
prehistoric cultural deposits are most likely
located along an area encompassing the central
portion of the peninsula. Locations of dense
prehistoric deposits identified during shovel tests
were further examined through the excavation of
1 x 1-m test units and backhoe trenches.

In total, 54 shovel tests (ST142 through
ST196) were excavated approximately every 15
m surrounding the Aquarena Center structures
and parking lots (see Appendix D, Figure D-3).
These probes were excavated to an average depth
of 60 cmbs, where impenetrable clays were
generally encountered. Shovel tests located in
close proximity to Spring Lake and Sink Creek
generally encounter the water table between
20 and 30 cmbs; these tests continued until
impenetrable clays were encountered or to a
meter in depth.

Test Unit Excavations
Three test units were excavated to further
explore prehistoric deposits identified during
shovel test excavations of Section II and Section
III. Two test units (XU01 and XU02) were
excavated within Section III (see Appendix
D, Figure D-4), and one test unit (XU03) was
excavated within Section II (see Appendix D,
Figure D-5).

In total, 400 artifacts were collected from
shovel tests in Section III. Artifacts were classified
as bone, building material, charcoal, glass, lithic,
metal, organic, personal items, and shell. Building
materials include fragments of brick and tile,
while bone consisted of faunal remains. The glass
classification contains vessel and window glass,
in addition to glass marbles. Metals consisted of
hardware, nails, a coin, scrap metal, and bottle

XU01 and XU02
Both XU01 and XU02 were located and
excavated within Section II. These units were

located in front of and between the Aquarena
Center office building and the Aquarena aquarium
building. XU01 was excavated to 70 cmbs, and
XU02 was excavated to 40 cmbs. Both units
were terminated upon uncovering two different
waterlines. A water pipeline was uncovered in
XU01 running diagonally through the unit from
the southwest corner to the northeast corner at
approximately 67 cmbs. The uncovered waterline
in XU02 was encountered at approximately
40 cmbs running parallel to the western wall
through the western half of the test unit.

4 liters in volume were also collected from
each level. These samples, however, were not
processed by flotation or water screened due to
the disturbed nature of their contexts.

XU03
Test unit XU03 was excavated 2 m south of
ST138 within the boundaries of archaeological
site 41HY165 (see Appendix D, Figure D-5).
This site was the subject of archaeological field
school investigations conducted between 1996
and 1998. Unit XU03 was excavated here during
the current project as the vertical distributions
of cultural deposits uncovered during the field
school investigations were poorly understood.
This unit was excavated in arbitrary 10-cm
levels to a depth of 150 cmbs. A burned rock
layer indicative of either a hearth feature or the
corner of a burned rock midden was encountered
between 60 and 80 cmbs (Figure 5-6). Two Late
Archaic-style projectile points were recovered at
70 cmbs and 70.5 cmbs (Figure 5-7), and a large
bison bone was collected from 62 to 67 cmbs.
Cultural materials were recovered from all levels
and excavations were halted at 150 cmbs, as
continued excavations would be beyond current

Numerous lithic artifacts were recovered
from these units (XU01 n = 172, XU02 n = 89) and
are considered to be indicative of a prehistoric
presence in this area. However, due to the location
of the encountered pipes within the test units, it
is concluded that deposits excavated above these
pipes are disturbed and do not contain intact
cultural deposits. Therefore, recovered artifacts
are not considered to be representative of intact,
undisturbed cultural deposits. A 5-gallon bucket
of soil was collected from each excavated level
and subjected to water screening through ¼-inch
and ⅛-inch mesh. Bulk soil samples measuring

safety standards. A 5-gallon bucket of soil was
collected from each level and water screened
through ¼-inch and ⅛-inch mesh. In addition,
4-liter bulk soil samples were collected from each
level. These samples were processed by flotation
to recover small faunal remains, plant remains,
and lithic debris. Among the materials recovered
from this process was the microscopic tip of a
projectile point, drill, or needle from Level 1
(Figure 5-8).

prehistoric materials are clearly present here.
Preliminary results from the excavation of this
test unit indicate that intact cultural deposits are
located within the boundaries of 41HY165 and
extend at least from 30 cmbs to beyond 150 cmbs.

Backhoe Trench Excavations
Four backhoe trenches were excavated in
Section III in the following locations: 1) between
the southern section of the parking lot and the
access road 2) between the northern section of
the parking lot and the access road, 3) on the
median between the parking lot access road and

grounds (Appendix D, Figure
D-6). These locations were
identified during shovel test
investigations as having the
potential for deeply buried,
stratigraphically intact deposits
that would be negatively
affected by the proposed
undertaking. Trenches were
excavated to examine the
depositional
history/context
and to further confirm the
potential of this area to contain
intact archaeological deposits.

was
encountered
at
varying
depths, and severely limited
the excavation and subsequent
observation of each backhoe
trench. As the backhoe trench
excavations targeted the narrow
peninsula formed above the
confluence of the San Marcos
River and Sink Creek, soils
encountered did not conform
to either of the mapped soil
series, but rather appeared as a
combination of the two.
In each of the backhoe
trenches, a single longitudinal
exposure was chosen for
profile description. Adjacent
walls were also inspected
for
additional
evidence,
particularly in cases where
anomalies, features, intrusions,
and other important features or
data were present. Zones are
the basic unit of description and

consist of distinct geological deposits, distinct soil
horizons, or a combination of the former where
both are present and upper and lower boundaries
are distinguishable. Zone attributes including
color, texture, structure, and inclusions, as well
as horizon designation, lower boundaries, and

detail in Figures 5-9 and 5-10.

2 and BHT 4 were oriented perpendicularly
(see Appendix D, Figure D-6). Orientation and
distribution of backhoe trench excavations were
chosen to optimize artifact recovery (i.e., near
shovel tests that yielded cultural material), while
simultaneously exposing sediments and soils
over a broad area.
BHT 1 was the southernmost excavation,
and it was also the closest to the confluence of
the two streams. BHT 1 was located adjacent to
the southeast corner of the parking lot near Tee
Box 7 of the University Golf Course. This trench
measures 6 m long, 1 m wide, and just over 1
m deep. BHT 2 was excavated approximately
60 m north-northeast of BHT 1. BHT 2 was
also situated adjacent to the parking lot, but was
excavated perpendicular to the potential flow

Backhoe Trench Locations
All four backhoe trenches were excavated on
the nearly-flat terrace adjacent to the headwaters
of San Marcos River just above its confluence
with Sink Creek. Backhoe trenches (BHTs) 1
and 3 were oriented parallel to the potential
direction of stream flow (potential is used in
the case of floods and the natural behavior of
the streams prior to damming), whereas BHT

of the streams. BHT 2 was approximately 4 m
long, 1 m wide, and 2 m deep. About 120 m north
of BHT 2, BHT 3 was excavated parallel to the
potential direction of stream flow and between
two roads providing access to the parking lot.
BHT 3 was approximately 5.5 m long, 1 m wide,
and about 1.65 m deep. BHT 4 was excavated 30 m
west-northwest of BHT 3 in a picnic area situated
between a parking lot access road (to the east)
and the top of Spring Lake (west). This trench
was excavated perpendicular to the potential flow
direction, and it was approximately 3.5 m long, 1
m wide, and 1.4 m deep.

As much as 14 cm at the top of each profile
exposure was disturbed as a result of routine
maintenance. Evidence for this included crumby,
weakly (if at all) structured organic-rich
sediment and a relatively increased amount of
coarse fragments. This zone is designated Ap, for
plow zone (this zone is not interpreted as having
been plowed). Other modern perturbations
included a very gravelly zone overlying a coarse
sandy zone in the northeastern corner of BHT
1. Gravels and coarse sand extended from the
surface to approximately 35 cmbs, and have very
abrupt boundaries. The origin and/or purpose
of this intrusion are not clear. Aside from a gas
42

line discovered in BHT 4, these two anomalies
(i.e., Ap and gravel/coarse sand) were the only
signs of modern disturbance, and otherwise
sediments and soils observed in the four trenches
are consistent with each other and with the soils
mapped in the area.

Given the setting on a terrace between two
streams and low amounts of gravels, it is likely
that these sediments were low-energy deposits
resulting from floods. Also, given the vegetation
patterns adjacent to the perennial springs, it may
also be the case that a portion of the sediments
are formed in situ of weathering organic material.

Beneath the Ap, A horizons extended to 50
cmbs in BHTs 1 and 2 to approximately 80 cmbs in
BHTs 3 and 4. A horizons were generally weakly
to moderately developed, and fine to medium
subangular blocky in structure. They contained
very less than five percent coarse fragments, and
ranged in texture from clayey loam to silty clay,
very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to very dark brown
in color (10YR 2/2). Shell fragments, common
roots and rootlets, and worm excrement provide
evidence of bioturbation. However, no signs of
severe shrink-swell dynamics were observed.

Observations: Cultural Materials
Varying amounts of cultural materials were
observed in each backhoe trench. Most artifacts
were recovered without provenience. A number
of artifacts were, however, observed in trench
profiles; these are recorded by provenience. In
the southern portion of the examined profile of
BHT 1 (away from the gravel and coarse sand
intrusions described above), two flakes were
observed at approximately 25 cmbs. These flakes
were situated at the boundary between the Ap
and A horizons. No other artifacts were observed
in situ within BHT 1.

Below the A horizons and above the water
table in each trench, B horizons were observed.
B horizons were composed of clay loam to clay,
very dark gray to very dark brown in color, and
they had slightly stronger and larger subangular
blocky structure than those in A horizons. In
BHTs 1 and 2, the B horizon was marked by
secondary calcium carbonates in the form of
filaments near the top and also by mottling near
the bottom of the exposures. BHTs 3 and 4 did
not exhibit secondary carbonate accumulation or
mottling, but did have a marked increase in clay
content. B horizons of BHTs 3 and 4 contained
increased shell fragments and uncommon roots,
and worm excrement was noted as deep as 90
cmbs in BHT 4. Shell, roots, and worm excrement
presence are the only signs of noncultural subsoil
disturbance. Sediments comprising the backhoe
trench’s profiles contained a very low amount of
coarse fragments that were not culturally derived.
Due to high water tables, excavations could not
proceed beyond these depths, and no C horizons
were observed.

In the northern wall of BHT 2, fire-cracked
rock was observed between approximately 35
and 110 cmbs, with a distinct cluster in the center
of the wall at approximately 110 cmbs. Above
(67–75 cmbs) and to the left of the fire-cracked
rock cluster, there was a distinct lens of burned
clay. The burned clay is yellowish-red (5YR 4/6),
and a sample of the material also contains small
fragments of unidentifiable burned bone. A low
number of flakes were also observed in proximity
to the fire-cracked rock cluster and burned clay.
Unidentifiable faunal remains were observed
as deep as 137 cmbs, and lithic debitage was
observed as shallow as 50 cmbs. No diagnostic
artifacts were observed in situ or in excavated
sediment, and so without radiometric dating,
it is not possible to estimate cultural periods
associated with these artifacts.
Similar to BHT 2, BHT 3 also contained insitu fire-cracked rock and lithic debitage. Fire43

cracked rock was present from approximately 75
to 155 cmbs (the maximum depth of excavation),
and other cultural materials, primarily lithic
debitage, were observed from about 65 cmbs
to the bottom of the trench. Artifacts appeared
to be in two horizontal concentrations, one
at approximately 70 cmbs and the other near
the bottom of the trench, with a relatively light
scatter of artifacts between. BHT 3 also yielded
a projectile point and a biface; these are without
provenience (Figure 5-11).

BHT 4 contained undisturbed, intact
deposits of fire-cracked rock and lithic debitage.
Fire-cracked rock was observed between about
30 and 135 cmbs (trench bottom). Unidentified
faunal remains and lithic debitage were also
observed in the same range of depth. These
findings are consistent with the distribution of
artifacts observed and recovered from previous
excavations in this area. However, no temporally
diagnostic artifacts were recovered from this
trench.

Backhoe trench excavations
were conducted across Section
III of the APE, and were
located based on the results
of shovel test investigations
previously described. The
objectives of this component
of the project were to 1)
gain an understanding of the
depositional processes present
in the project area in order to
examine potential integrity of
buried cultural deposits, and 2)
identify previously unrecorded
archaeological deposits. From
the soils and sediments exposed
in these trenches, depositional
processes that shaped this part
of the APE include low-energy
alluviation (i.e., a distance from
the main flow of flood waters)
and in situ weathering of organic
material. These depositional
regimes have the potential
to preserve intact cultural
deposits. An archaeological
concern with clayey soils of this
nature, however, is that shrink-

swell behavior may lead to movement of artifacts.
However, proximity to a perennial water source
appears to have somewhat ameliorated extreme
soil moisture variability that can lead to this type
of disturbance. The sediments and soils also
reveal that the upper approximately 14 cm have
been recently disturbed and therefore may lack
integrity in certain localities. Below this initial
zone (Ap), perturbations are localized (i.e., occur
with utility lines and other infrastructure), and
sediments and soils appear to be mostly intact
with varying, albeit low, amounts of bioturbation
caused by roots and worm activity. Cultural
materials were observed in and recovered from
all backhoe trenches, and intact cultural deposits
were identified in BHT 2, 3, and 4. However,
lacking provenienced diagnostic artifacts, these
cultural deposits are not anchored in time.

table, sediment was very dark gray sandy clay
and contained approximately 15 percent coarse
fragments to a depth of 177.8 cmbs. Between 177.8
and 218.44 cmbs sediment was similar to that in
the level above; however, scattered subangular
pebbles and cobbles (5–8 cm in diameter) were
encountered. To a depth of 325.12 cmbs, sediment
encountered was very dark grayish-brown silty
clay with 15 percent coarse fragments and 10–20
percent distinct dark yellowish-brown mottles.
From 325.12 cmbs to depth (431.8 cmbs), there was
strong brown clay with 25 percent distinct dark
yellowish-brown and dark grayish-brown mottles
and approximately 10 percent coarse fragments.
Overall, these sediments were similar to others
encountered in the vicinity of the springs, and
aside from the uppermost 30 cm, appear intact.
The auger unit is easily the deepest
exposure achieved during all investigations
conducted on the peninsula during this project.
As such, finding comparable soils data from
other exposures is difficult or impossible. Still,
different lines of contextual data are available
from nearby. Backhoe trenches east of this auger
test terminated at the water table, approximately
1.5 m below the surface, and did not reach deeper
sediments excavated by auger. Backhoe trenches
did, however, contain cultural material in intact
contexts. Sediment cores removed from off
shore (see below) revealed deposits similar to, if
not the same as, the bottom zone (325.12–431.8
cmbs) seen in the auger. In the subaqueous cores,
this stratum is topped by disconformities, with
millennia of “missing” or eroded sediment.
Given the above factors, the presence of cultural
material nearby, and the depth of impact for the
proposed construction at this location, there is
potential to encounter a long record of artifacts.
However, no artifacts were recovered or observed
in the auger, and it is not presently confirmed that
cultural deposits are present here.

Auger Investigations
An auger pit was excavated in the location of
a proposed lift station to be associated with new
infrastructure following the removal of existing
buildings (see Appendix D, Figure D-7). The pit
measured 38.1 cm in diameter and 431.8 cm deep,
and was excavated at the western edge of the
parking lot in the center of the western end of the
peninsula. Insofar as possible, sediments were
excavated in 61-cm (2-ft) levels. Approximately
50 percent of all of the excavated sediments from
each 2-ft level were screened and described.
From the surface to approximately 30 cmbs,
sediments appeared relatively modern, and
included a mix of yellowish-brown very gravelly
clay fill and asphalt (Figure 5-12). Beneath this
modern cap, black silty clay extended to 63.5
cmbs. Deposits at approximately 63.5–144.78
cmbs were composed of very dark gray silty
clay with 10 percent coarse fragments. Nearing
144.78 cmbs, the sediment became increasingly
moist to the point of saturation. Beneath the water

bed sediments, while intermittent places along
the sub’s front are also in contact with sediments
(Figure 5-14).

Reconnaissance – Submarine Theatre
Prior to coring and excavations, the entire
circumference of the sub was examined.
Throughout the process of designing project
specifications, it was uncertain whether the
bottom of the sub was in physical contact with
the lake bed and whether there was the potential
for impacts to arise from the removal of the sub.
Examination clearly showed that the bottom of the
sub is in fact in direct contact with the lake bed in
a number of places around its perimeter, though
it is resting a slight distance above the lake bed
in a few locations (Figure 5-13). Generally, the

During the visual assessment, a deposit of
pea gravel was identified across the entire area
in front of the sub. This material was deposited
in modern times while Aquarena Springs was in
use as an amusement park in an effort to prevent
lake bed sediments from being stirred up during
underwater performances. Very little to no pea
gravel was noted across the rear of the sub. Depths
of this layer of gravel vary at present from only
a couple of inches to as much as 2 ft. Where it is
present, this deposit of pea gravel has the ability
to effectively cap underlying intact deposits, and
may offer an important degree
of protection from potential
impacts through the course of
the removal of the sub.
This visual reconnaissance
survey clearly determined that
the sub is in contact with the
lake bottom. CAS concludes
that the removal of this
structure has the potential to
impact underlying sediments.
However, this reconnaissance
did not establish whether
sediments are intact, or whether
they contain cultural materials.
To address these issues,
sediment cores were extracted
and a test unit was excavated
in front of the sub. These are
discussed below.

the lake bottom (Figure

assess the stratigraphy of
sediments underneath the

main depositional strata. The
bottommost of these three strata
was composed of poorly sorted,
clast-supported,
subround
cobbles as large as 20 cm in
diameter, encased in reddish
sandy matrix. The middle unit
is composed of grayish clay
containing organic material
and poorly sorted, matrixsupported, subround cobbles,
ranging from 1 millimeter
(mm) to 10 cm in diameter.
Organic matter in the middle
stratum included pieces of wellpreserved wood, a fragment of
which was radiocarbon dated
to 13,320–13,190 cal BP (2σ).
Upper and lower boundaries
of the approximately 40-cmthick middle stratum were

deposit was another depositional stratum
containing an increased amount of gravels.
Unlike the bottom stratum, this upper stratum
contained bedded, moderately sorted, matrixto clast-supported, subround gravels encased in
reddish to yellowish clays.

To further explore the nature of the sediments
beneath the sub, several sediment cores were
extracted in front of and adjacent to the sub, and
also near the Landing where a boat ramp is to
be constructed (Figure 5-21). Before this work
started, deposits of pea gravels were removed
from each location (if present) so that samples
could be extracted as closely as possible from
the sediments that remained below the gravel
layer(s).

Together, these three depositional strata
represent disparate alluvial facies, which are
believed to represent ancient features (e.g., gravel
bar, floodplain/marsh) closely associated with the
channel of the San Marcos River. These features
may be attributable to fluctuation in discharge
from the adjacent springs, and/or different
periods/amounts of influence from Sink Creek
(and/or its watershed). Sink Creek currently
merges with Spring Lake and the San Marcos
River about 150 m downstream from the project
area. In any case, the upper and bottom deposits
are stream-derived gravels, whereas the organicrich middle stratum is a floodplain/marsh deposit.

Core samples were taken from locations
along the front of the sub designated Site 2 (2
cores), Site 3 (3 cores), Site 4 (1 core), and Site 6
(1 core) (Table 5-1, see Appendix D, Figure D-8).
The core from Site 6 was extracted with great
difficulty, so no additional core was taken from
Site 5 (adjacent to and within the same sediment
type as Site 6), as had been initially planned.
Additionally, Site 1 is the location of a test unit
extending ~145 cm beneath the lake bed (see
Figure 5-20).
50

Figure 5-20. Test unit in excavation in front of sub.

Figure 5-21. Archaeologist removing one of the sediment cores from near the sub.

The extracted cores revealed intact, bedded
strata in the sediments underlying the sub.
Descriptions of these strata are presented in
Appendix B, Table B-1. Five sediment and
organic samples from these cores were submitted
to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating and are
presented Appendix B, Table B-2.

Sediments recovered from the first set of
cores contain differing characteristics than those
observed in the test unit. A surprising aspect
of these sediments is that they did not contain
the same gravelly strata noted in the unit. This
evidence suggests that the upper gravelly stratum
exposed in the pit represents a gravel bar, as

and Bousman 2010), and as pea-gravel has
covered these sediments for at least half of the
time they were submerged, they are considered to
be intact and relatively free of disturbance.

On the far eastern side of the sub, Core 7
from Site 6 contained different sediments. Here,
two distinctly different strata are marked by an
abrupt interface; the lower was yellowish clayey
matrix with strong ped development and nodular
calcium carbonate, and the upper is darker in
color and contains a small amount of matrixsupported, subround gravel. Development of
ped structure and secondary carbonates can be
a function of time (Birkeland 1999; Schaetzl
and Anderson 2005), and though currently
submerged, these sediments and soils were
clearly terrestrial in their past. Two samples were
extracted from this core: one from the top of the
lower stratum, and the other from the top of the
upper stratum. An age of 19,300–19,020 cal BP
(2σ) marks a minimum age of deposition and
soil formation of the lower stratum, and it also
serves as a maximum age of the upper stratum.
The sample from the top of the upper stratum
provides a minimum age of 7680–7580 cal BP
(2σ). The age of these sediments, in addition to
their relative elevations, indicates that they were
once on a terrace above the river channel.

indicated earlier. Cores extracted from Sites 2
and 3 (Figure 5-22), located on either side of the
excavated pit and at elevations corresponding
with the upper gravelly unit, contained similar
(to each other) fining-upwards sequences of dark
sediments with basal small (< 2 cm diameter),
moderate- to well-sorted, clast-supported,
subround gravels. These gravels are noted in
Figure 5-22 as “Gravelly marker stratum.” The
fining-upwards sequence present in the three
cores is currently interpreted as a floodplain/
marshy environment. Bulk sediment samples,
one from below the gravelly zone in a core
from Site 3 and one from the top of the finingupwards sequence in a core from Site 2, frame
the deposit between 2790–2730 BP and 1510–
1460 cal BP (2σ). It is possible that the younger
age, derived from the top of the fining sequence,
could be older. A concern with radiocarbon
dating sediments in lacustrine environments
involves the introduction of older material (and
older carbon) to the sediment sampled (Goudie et
al. 1981). CAS acknowledges that this margin of
error exists; however, as these sediments appear
to represent a formerly terrestrial environment,
as the lake has been in existence for a relatively

The investigation of sediments immediately
in front of the sub show that this location, close to
a number of different alluvial environments (e.g.,
terrace, marsh, channel), was once more dynamic
than today and contains complex stratigraphy.
While sediments and soils encountered in front
of (spring-side) and to the east of the sub date to
periods that are relevant to archaeology in Central
Texas (< 12,000 years BP), these sediments
represent environments (e.g., marsh and river
channel) that are not conductive to preserving
intact archaeological deposits.

Figure 5-22. Stratigraphic reconstruction based on results from coring, excavation, and radiocarbon analysis
adjacent to the spring-side portion of sub.

A second set of four sediment cores were
extracted from Sites 7, 8, 9, and 10 (west to east)
located behind the sub and adjacent to Spring
Lake’s southern bank (see Appendix D, Figure
D-8). These cores all contain at least one stratum

similar to that of Site 6 (from initial coring
investigations), which yielded radiocarbon dates
of 7630 ± 50 and 19,260 ± 140 cal BP (2σ). This
common stratum, compared to the overlying
sediment, is considerably lighter or yellowish
53

in color, has blocky structure, contains clay
coats, and also contains calcium carbonate
nodules, irrefutable evidence of having once
been terrestrial. Site 7’s core contained only this
stratum, whereas cores from Sites 8, 9, and 10
contained approximately 11–25 cm of this older
deposit overlain by relatively dark and organicrich sediment. The overlying sediment in each
of these cores could be divided into two strata:
at the top of each core was a spongy layer with
tremendous amounts of well-preserved organic
material (15–35 cm thick), and below, lying
directly atop the older deposit, was clayey
sediment with varying amounts of organic
material, shells, and coarse fragments (10–25 cm
thick). Two radiocarbon samples were collected
from this suite of cores; one from the yellowish
stratum at Site 9, and the other from the directly
overlying sediment at Site 10. The yellowish
sediment yielded a date of 10,370 ± 130 cal BP
(2σ), and the sediment above yielded a date of
1080 ± 100 cal BP (2σ). These dates corroborate
the younger, mid-Holocene, age yielded from Site
6, and suggest that the strata directly overlying
the yellowish sediment are also prehistoric, and
thus, potentially terrestrial in origin.

location also contain the contact between
yellowish and dark, organic-rich sediments.
These two cores are similar to the sediments
near the sub in that they contain the yellowish
sediment at the bottom and spongy sediment
at the top. They differ, however, in the middle
strata. Dark, organic-rich sediment just above the
contact zone is clearly bedded. Two radiocarbon
samples were taken from Site 11’s core, one from
just below the contact, and one from just above.
These samples yielded dates of 8235 ± 25 cal
BP (2σ) and 1235 ± 65 cal BP (2σ), respectively.
Both dates are prehistoric and suggest that these
sediments were formerly terrestrial. Bedding of
the dark, organic-rich sediment above the contact
zone, however, indicates that this location was
frequently flooded. As the San Marcos River’s
discharge is regulated by the springs at the
headwaters of the river (and bedding is not clearly
seen in contemporary sediment from near the
theater), it seems that the bedding of sediments is
a function of Sink Creek floods.
Sediments encountered in this second suite
of cores, extracted from behind the sub and from
the west end of the peninsula near the Landing,
are relevant to culturally significant periods and
represents formerly terrestrial environments.
Though no artifacts were encountered in any
of the cores, their proximity to significant sites
suggests that the paucity of artifacts should not
be taken as an indication that no archaeological
materials are here.

Two additional cores were extracted from
Sites 11 and 12 located at the west end of the
peninsula to determine the likelihood that the
proposed construction of the boat ramp would
disturb deposits with the potential to contain
cultural remains. Cores extracted from this

Summary, Discussion, and
R ecommendations
An archaeological cultural resources survey
for the SLAERP was conducted in response
to the MOA signed by the USACE, THC, and
TxState. This MOA calls for an archaeological
assessment of the APE to determine the extent of
intact cultural deposits within the project area. A
testing program was developed and implemented
by CAS that included both terrestrial and
underwater
investigations.
Terrestrial
investigations consisted of pedestrian survey,
shovel test excavation, test unit excavation,
auger pit excavation, and backhoe trench
excavation. Underwater investigations included
reconnaissance survey, test unit excavation, and
extraction of sediment cores. Four archaeological
sites, 41HY160, 41HY165, 41HY161, 41HY147,
have been previously recorded within the project
area; however, none of these sites were completely
surveyed when they were recorded, and as a
result the boundaries of all sites within the APE
are poorly and imprecisely known. Therefore, it
was recognized that there is a high probability
that ground-disturbing activities will encounter
additional, yet-unknown cultural resources at
or just below the surface that may appear to be
outside the previously charted boundaries of any
particular site.

are associated with one of the four previously
recorded SALs (41HY160, 41HY161, 41HY165,
41HY147) and do not represent new sites. Results
of the archaeological survey, therefore, were used
to define locations labeled as Archaeologically
Sensitive Areas within existing SALs. ASAs are
areas that (1) represent intact and near-surface
archaeological deposits that are associated with
one of the SALs, (2) have the very high likelihood
of containing significant deposits, and (3) will be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
As a result of this work, the site boundaries for
41HY160 and 41HY165 were modified to include
archaeological materials encountered outside of
and adjacent to the previous site boundaries. These
new boundaries indicate the nearly continuous
presence of prehistoric remains across the APE,
confirming that these sites actually represent
a single extensive complex of archaeological
deposits associated with the freshwater springs
that presently form Spring Lake. As proposed,
the undertaking will not affect 41HY147 or
41HY161.
Based on pending impacts indicated in the 65
percent project design documents together with
the results of the survey, six areas identified as
“Archaeologically Sensitive” contain or possess a
high probability to contain cultural deposits that
would be negatively impacted by the proposed
undertaking (see Appendix E, Figure E-3).
Each of these archaeologically sensitive areas
is associated with either 41HY160 or 41HY165,
although, given the continuous nature of deposits

As the previously recorded sites located
within the APE have never been completely
surveyed or delineated prior to this undertaking,
efforts focused on identifying the distribution
of remains across the entire APE with the
understanding that newly encountered deposits

in the APE, CAS concludes that distinctions
between these trinomials are less meaningful
than previously believed. The results of the survey
and subsurface testing that are presented in this
report will inform the HPTP. That document
(forthcoming) will present recommendations for
mitigating documented resources that will be
affected by the proposed undertaking. The HPTP
will be submitted for review as a separate report.

SAL 41HY160 occupies the peninsula
between Spring Lake and Sink Creek, upon which
Aquarena Center and a portion of the TxState
Golf Course is located. According to the Texas
Archeological Site Atlas, no site boundaries
existed for this site prior to the current survey
effort; however, all previous archaeological
investigations conducted on the peninsula
attributed encountered archaeological deposits
to 41HY160. As a result of the archaeological
survey, CAS has redrawn the boundaries
of site 41HY160 to include archaeological
deposits encountered during both terrestrial
and underwater investigations on and adjacent
to the peninsula, as well as archaeological
deposits noted during previous investigations
(see Appendix E, Figure E-4). Large quantities
of lithic debitage noted during the underwater
reconnaissance survey of upper Spring Lake are
now attributed to SAL 41HY160. Much of this
debris is present on the lake bed where vegetation
permits good visibility, while abundant materials
were also noted eroding from the peninsula’s
banks. Four ASAs (ASA 1, ASA 2, ASA 5, and
ASA 6) were identified within SAL 41HY160
during investigations (see discussion on ASAs
below; Table 6-1). CAS recommends the
development of mitigative measures to offset the
potential loss of information from these locations
within SAL 41HY160 that may result from the
proposed undertaking.

Summary
41HY161
SAL 41HY161 lies just outside of the SLAERP
survey area, to the southwest of Section I (see
Appendix E, Figure E-2). No cultural deposits
were noted in the portion of Section I adjacent
to site 41HY161, and therefore the boundary
of this site was not modified. As the site lies
outside of the APE, it will not be impacted by the
proposed undertaking. No recommendations are
warranted.

41HY147
41HY147, also a SAL, is located along a large
submerged terrace adjacent to the western bank
and within Spring Lake and survey Section I.
This location was also determined to be outside
of any pending impacts and therefore not subject
to survey investigations. As the location of site
appears to be imprecisely mapped on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, its location was
remapped using the sketch map submitted with
the original archaeological site form and visual
assessments (see Appendix E, Figure E-4).
According to the 65 percent design plans for the
SLAERP, site 41HY147 will not be impacted.
Therefore, no recommendations for this site are
warranted at this time.

Building and the grassy area adjacent to the
parking lots within the northeastern portion of
Section III. These intact deposits were attributed
to SAL 41HY160 (see Table 6-1, Appendix E,
Figure E-3).

Located at the confluence of Sink Creek
and Spring Lake, SAL 41HY165 sits on a small
peninsula that extends out into the eastern half
of the lake and follows along the lake margins
to the southwest and along Sink Creek to the
northeast (see Appendix E, Figure E-4). The
site boundaries were also redrawn to include
deposits encountered during the current survey.
Two ASAs (ASA 3 and ASA 4) were identified
and attributed to SAL 41HY165 during survey
investigations (see Table 6-1 and discussion
below). CAS also recommends the development
of mitigative measures to offset the potential loss
of important archaeological information that may
result from the proposed undertaking.

ASAs 3 and 4 were identified during shovel
test investigations of Section II and are associated
with SAL 41HY165 (see Appendix E, Figure
E-3). ASA 3 first appeared as a surface scatter
of lithic material. Shovel tests excavated in this
location revealed intact subsurface deposits.
These deposits are located along the southern
side of Sink Creek in an area adjacent to the
TxState Golf Course’s eighth green. Shovel tests
excavated in the location of ASA 3 encountered
lithic deposits to a depth of 100 cmbs. ASA 4,
also identified by a surface scatter of lithic
material, is located along the southern bank of
Sink Creek. The area extends from the “Front
Door”/Information Kiosk area, along the East
Athletic Fields, and ends at the small peninsula
that extends into Spring Lake. Shovel tests
excavated here encountered prehistoric deposits
to a depth of 80 cmbs. The presence of buried,
stratigraphically intact cultural deposits in this
area was confirmed by the third test unit (XU03),
which encountered deposits to a depth of 150
cmbs.

Discussion
Archaeologically Sensitive Areas
The current boundaries of SALs 41HY160
and 41HY165 were redrawn as a result of survey
investigations. These new boundaries indicate
the nearly continuous presence of prehistoric
remains across the APE, confirming that these
sites actually represent a single extensive complex
of archaeological deposits. Consequently,
investigative efforts focused on identifying the
distribution of remains across the entire APE to
determine the extent of intact cultural deposits
within the project area, with the understanding
that newly encountered deposits are associated
with one of the previously recorded SALs. These
deposits were designated as Archaeologically
Sensitive Areas. Six ASAs were identified during
survey investigations.

The distribution of prehistoric lithic debitage,
bifaces, tools, and projectile points encountered
in all these areas was further examined to
determine the vertical and horizontal extent
of cultural deposits. These distributions were
plotted in ArcGIS to create layers displaying
cultural deposits at 0–20 cmbs, 20–40 cmbs,
40–60 cmbs, 60–80 cmbs, and 80–100 cmbs (see
Appendix E, Figures E-5 through E-9). Together,
these distributions reveal the depths of intact
cultural deposits in areas that were first identified
during shovel test and confirmed by backhoe
trench and test unit excavations. These cultural

terrace area located at the western end of the
peninsula. These are designated ASAs 5 and 6,
respectively, and are attributed to SAL 41HY160
(see Table 6-1, see Appendix E, Figures E-3 and
E-11). Cultural material was observed on the
lake bottom adjacent to the sub area (see Figures
5-16 though 5-19) and close to the location of
the proposed boat ramp during reconnaissance
survey (Figures 6-1 through 6-3). While it was
not conclusively determined that intact cultural
deposits are present in these two areas, our
examination of the sediments in these locations
indicates a high probability for intact cultural
deposits, and revealed undisturbed and highly
significant cultural resources nearby.

As most of the proposed impacts associated
with the current undertaking are not projected to
impact below 40 cmbs, the horizontal and vertical
distribution of deposits between 0 and 40 cmbs
was also evaluated. These areas (see Appendix
E, Figure E-10) will be most directly affected
by proposed sod removal, and by construction
vehicle traffic and staging as demolition proceeds
across the APE.
In addition to these terrestrial investigations,
underwater reconnaissance, testing, and
sediment coring have concluded that there is a
high probability that culturally significant and
intact cultural deposits may also be impacted by
proposed modifications along shoreline areas and
on the bottom of Spring Lake. Areas of concern
include the area around the sub and between
the sub and the lake bank, and the underwater

geologic data derived from a series of sediment
cores and complemented by a suite of six
radiocarbon assays on organic soil and other
materials. This area encompasses what was

and includes all areas to the rear of the sub
extending to the bank of Spring Lake. During
our work in this locality, no artifacts or cultural
materials were observed either on the lake bed or
in sediment exposures in the test pit or through
coring. However, strata are clearly intact and
time-ordered, and reflect typical depositional
sequences associated with stream-side settings.
Cultural deposits have been recorded nearby and
should be expected to occur here as well.

Based on the survey and assessment results
presented here, intact cultural resources are
clearly present across parts of the APE that will
be impacted by the proposed undertaking. In
some underwater areas, resources are considered
likely to be present though remain unconfirmed.
With these results in mind, CAS recommends
the development of mitigative measures to offset
the loss of important cultural information in
identified Archaeologically Sensitive Areas that
correspond with parts of SALs 41HY160 and
41HY165. Mitigative measures proposed for the
Spring Lake Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration
Project will be presented in the Historic
Properties Treatment Plan for the Spring Lake
Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration
Project (forthcoming).

ASA 6 is defined at the end of the Landing
and encompasses the spring referred to as Deep
Hole (see Appendix D, Figure D-8, and Appendix
E, Figure E-11). According to project design
information, this area is to be impacted by the
construction of a boat ramp extending into the
water that will accommodate a barge that will
be used to remove dismantled pieces of the sub
from the lake. A pair of sediment cores (cores
11 and 12, see Appendix D, Figure D-8) taken
from between the shoreline and Deep Hole reveal
intact stratigraphy corresponding with portions
of the stratigraphic sequence established by cores
from around the sub. These two cores were taken
from what appears to be a deep, intact alluvial
terrace that immediately overlooks Deep Hole.
There is abundant cultural material on the lake
bed near the spring including projectile points,
cores, chipping debris, and more (see Figures 6-1
through 6-3).

In addition, the site boundaries of
archaeological site 41HY165 should be extended
to include cultural deposits identified during
the recent subsurface survey and testing
investigations. As no site boundaries currently
exist for archaeological site 41HY160, site
boundaries should be established to reflect the
limits of current and previous investigations as
well as the underwater deposits observed in the
northeastern portion of Spring Lake. These site
boundaries, depicted in Appendix E, Figure E-4,
are based on the results of the current effort.

Appendix A

Core Descriptions
David Yelacic
The following tables supply technical descriptions for a total of ten sediment cores extracted around
and near the submersible theatre along the southern bank of Spring Lake. Coring methods consisted of
driving 2.5-inch PVC pipe into the lake bed with a very large post driver (slide hammer), capping and
removing the sediment cores and transporting them to the Center for Archaeological Studies, draining
excess water within each core, and exposing the sediment with longitudinal cuts on opposite sides of
each PVC pipe. Once exposed, characteristics, including depth, color, texture, structure, consistency,
and geologic, pedogenic, and biogenic features of the sediments were recorded. Measurements below
are recorded in centimeters from the bottom to the top of each core, because of the core not being
completely full and sediment consistently being present at the bottom—it is not clear whether the
sediment was compacted by the physics of core-driving, or if the sediment at the bottom of each core
acted as a plug displacing sediment below.
