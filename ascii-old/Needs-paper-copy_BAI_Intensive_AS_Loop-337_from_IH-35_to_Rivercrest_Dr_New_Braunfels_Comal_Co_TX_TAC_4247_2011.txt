At intervals between September 2006 and March 1, 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc.,
conducted an intensive non-collection archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching of
approximately 6.6 miles of the existing Loop 337 right-of-way in the City of New Braunfels, Comal
County, Texas (CSJs: 0216-01-026 and 0216-01-036). The survey was performed at the request of the
Texas Department of Transportation’s San Antonio District prior to proposed roadway improvements on
Loop 337 from IH 35 on the south to Rivercrest Drive. Investigations discovered four prehistoric sites
(41CM312, 41CM313, 41CM314, and 41CM315) within the Area of Potential Effect, none of which are
recommended as eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places or for formal State
Archeological Landmark designation. No artifacts were collected and curation was unnecessary.

Between September 2006 and March 1, 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A)
conducted an intensive archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching of approximately
6.60 miles (34,848 feet) of Loop 337 in the City of New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas (CSJs: 021601-026 and 0216-01-036) (Figures 1 and 2). The survey area encompassed TxDOT’s existing Loop 337
right-of-way (ROW), including 14 drainage easements (DEs), between IH 35 on the south side of New
Braunfels and Rivercrest Drive. The survey was performed at the request of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) San Antonio District prior to proposed roadway widening and bridge
replacement construction.
The existing ROW is variable but averages approximately 230 feet wide and contains an undivided
roadway that is 68 feet wide with four 12-foot wide lanes and two 10-foot wide shoulders (Figure 3). The
proposed project would provide a four lane divided roadway, with two 12-foot wide travel lanes and
10-foot shoulders in each direction, separated by a variable width median that would average 52 feet
wide. New bridges parallel to existing bridges would be necessary at the Guadalupe River, Blieders
Creek, and Dry Comal Creek. Existing overpasses would be expanded at three railroad and roadway
crossings as well as at SH 46. Significant cut sections, many cut through limestone bedrock, already exist
within the ROW, undoubtedly excavated during construction of Loop 337 for future expansion of the
roadway. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) is therefore 6.6 miles (34,848 feet) long, averages
230 feet wide, extends four feet or less below ground surface for roadway construction and 30 feet or
more below ground surface for bridge support columns at stream crossings, and encompasses
approximately 185 acres.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed
in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects an undertaking may have on archeological historic properties that might
be threatened by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The
act, which created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic
Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural
resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or
actions funded or permitted by federal agencies.

Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP as per criteria defined
by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites under state law is
tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state review of this project
will occur pursuant to the First Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, TxDOT, Texas
Historical Commission (THC), and the ACHP Regarding the Implementation of Transportation
Undertakings as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC. Field
investigations were also conducted in accordance with the PA and MOU.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

The project area is in the City of New Braunfels and is bordered by commercial, recreational, residential
and industrial areas. As such, the existing ROW and the majority of locations adjacent to the ROW have
experienced severe landscape alterations from surface and subsurface utilities, building construction,
roadway construction, and natural erosion (i.e., substantial loss of topsoil throughout the APE due to
vegetation clearing). Cut-and-fill roadway construction and the use of explosives to blast through
limestone bedrock during the construction of Loop 337 have significantly impacted the existing highway
ROW. However, the majority of the proposed drainage easements extend beyond the existing ROW into
seemingly less disturbed adjacent private property.
The study area straddles the border between the Balcones Escarpment and the Blackland Prairie.
Approximately 70 percent of the existing Loop 337 ROW is underlain by shallow to very shallow
rocky/stony and gravelly upland clay soils overlying limestone bedrock. However, the southwest part of
the project area between roughly Landa Street and IH 35 is within the margins of the Blackland Prairie
that extends east and northeast of New Braunfels. This area is undulating and hilly with dense clay upland
soils and Holocene alluvium along Dry Comal Creek.
G E OL OG Y
Approximately 80 percent of the study area is underlain by undivided Pleistocene terrace deposits found
adjacent to Balcones Escarpment, while the remainder of the APE roughly between the Guadalupe River
and just north of Dry Comal Creek is underlain by Edwards Limestone undivided. The undivided
Pleistocene terrace deposits consist of gravel, sand, clay, and silt deposits. The constituent gravels are
primarily limestone, chert, and dolomite found as low terraces above the floodplain adjacent to
entrenched streams. Edwards Limestone undivided is fine- to coarse-grained with abundant chert and
fossils (Barnes 1983). Chert gravels and cobbles are common throughout the project area as a veneer of
varying thicknesses over the limestone bedrock. Although not mapped on the Texas Geologic Atlas, there
is some Holocene alluvium along Dry Comal Creek and accordingly, there is a good potential for buried
archeological deposits there. On the other hand, the probability of discovering intact archeological
materials in the Pleistocene-age terrace deposits is low.
SOI L S
Soils associated with the streams in the APE vary considerably throughout the project area. Both banks of
Dry Comal Creek are bordered by a narrow strip of Tinn Clay, 0-1 percent slopes, frequently flooded.
This soil is composed of Holocene clayey alluvium that extends as deep as 60 inches. Adjacent to the
Tinn clay on the southern bank is Lewisville silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, with Krum clay, 1 to 3
percent slopes on the northern bank. Lewisville silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes is composed of Holocene
alluvium and extends to 61 inches in depth. Krum clay is composed of Pleistocene clayey alluvium.
Comfort-Rock outcrop complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, is extremely stony clay with a depth of two inches
or less to bedrock (Batte 1984).

Blieders Creek is bordered by a narrow strip of Orif soils, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded. This
soil is composed of alluvium derived from limestone and is described as gravelly loamy sand and
stratified gravelly coarse sand to very gravelly sand. The west side of the creek is occupied by Lewisville
silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, while the east side contains Comfort-Rock outcrop complex, 1 to 8
percent slopes (Batte 1984).
The Guadalupe River has Okalla soils, 0 to 2 percent slopes, frequently flooded on both banks. This is a
Holocene loamy alluvium with clay loam extending to depths of 80 inches. Boerne fine sandy loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes, rarely flooded, is found in the more upland area west of the river. It is made up of
alluvium and extends to depths of 65 inches. On the terrace east of the river is Sunev silty clay loam, also
made up of alluvium with a depth of 62 inches. Alluvial soils such as these have been shown to possess a
reasonable potential for containing buried deposits.
Upland soils of the project area consist of gravelly and rocky clays typically found on the escarpment or
dense clays immediately adjacent and below the escarpment (Batte 1984). Upland soils in the Balcones
Escarpment part of the APE consist primarily of Comfort-Rock complex, undulating, and RumpleComfort association. The Comfort-Rock complex, undulating, is described as shallow (ca. 10 centimeters
deep) clayey upland soils found on hilltops and ridge tops in the Edwards Plateau that formed in place
from clay weathered from dolomitic limestone (Batte 1984:21 and 69). The Rumple-Comfort association,
undulating, is clayey and cherty, found in the uplands, and formed in situ from indurated and fractured
limestone (Batte 1984:77).
In terms of the potential for archeological preservation in the project area, previous research in the region
has shown that prehistoric and historic cultural deposits could be buried in alluvial soils along the streams
mentioned above. However, the remainder of the APE possesses little potential for containing intact
buried cultural deposits given the rocky and dense clays of the uplands that developed in situ.
F L OR A
New Braunfels and Comal County lie within the Balconian and Kansan Biotic Provinces (Blair 1950,
Black 1989). The existing ROW has also been cleared of much vegetation, with trees restricted largely to
a narrow border at stream crossings and along the ROW fencelines. Dense bermudagrass (Cynodon
dactylon) and johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) area also present near streams, but grasses are sparse in
upland areas.

C UL T UR A L SE T T I NG
From various synthesized interpretations of archeological research in the regions (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Hester 1995; Prewitt 1981, 1985), the prehistoric cultures of Central and South Texas were
organized into small bands and, for the most part, practiced hunter−gather subsistence up to Historic
times. These ancient peoples are now only represented by the refuse they left behind, which includes
stone tools, flaking debris from stone-tool production, burned rock from various hearth/cooking features,
and disarticulated and fractured animal bone.
Distinctive artifact styles such as stone projectile points are often used as relative chronological
indicators. Typological frameworks established by Kelley (1947), and Suhm et al. (1954) are based on
specimens recovered from hundreds of excavated sites throughout Texas and the United States. These
stylistically diverse diagnostic types are often used as temporal and cultural markers and have been the
basis for establishing a Central Texas archeological chronology (Collins 1995; Prewitt 1981, 1985).
Arguing that stylistic variability in diagnostic artifact forms is in itself insufficient to distinguish cultural
change, recent refinement by Johnson and Goode (1994) makes extensive use of radiocarbon dating to
account for paleoclimatic influences in an attempt to refine the Central Texas archeological chronology.
The culture history of Central and South Texas has been generally divided into four broad periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994; Prewitt
1981; Suhm et al. 1954). These periods are further subdivided based on changes in the archeological and
paleoenvironmental records. As no historic properties or sites were discovered during survey efforts, this
section is limited to prehistory.
PA L E OI NDI A N PE R I OD
The Paleoindian period represents the first known human occupation of the area and dates from 11,500 to
8,800 B.P. During the terminal Pleistocene, the Paleoindian period is noted for its association with the
hunting of megafauna and high mobility. However, recent inquiries into Paleoindian subsistence have
revealed greater reliance on small-game and plant resources (Meltzer 1995). This period is divided into
two subperiods: Early Paleoindian and Late Paleoindian.
The Early Paleoindian period in Central and South Texas dates from approximately 11,500 to 9,500 B.P.
(Collins 1995). This subperiod of prehistory is represented by three general cultural traditions defined by
subsistence and tool technology: Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview. The first well-documented, large-scale
intrusion of people to enter North America is known as the Clovis culture. Named after the famous site on
Blackwater Draw near the town of Clovis, New Mexico, the Clovis technological complex is represented
archeologically by distinctive fluted stone points and association with extinct Pleistocene mammals
including mammoth (Elephas columbi), bison (Bison antiquus), camel (Camelops sp.), and Pleistocene
horse (Equus). Though Clovis materials are found over a wide range of North America, there is a paucity
of Clovis sites having materials in situ with stratigraphic integrity (Haynes 1993). Ten of these sites
reviewed by Haynes (1993) have yielded radiocarbon dates ranging in age from 11,650 years B.P. at the
Agate Basin site in Wyoming to 10,500 B.P. at the Vail site in Maine.

Toward the end of the Pleistocene, changing climate and possibly human hunting pressure (Haynes 1991)
caused the abrupt extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna with the exception of Bison antiquus. This
change is evident in the faunal assemblages of Folsom and Plainview complex sites including Blackwater
Draw (Hester 1972), Lubbock Lake (Johnson and Holliday 1980), and Wilson Leonard (Collins 1998).
Mesic conditions and vast Great Plains grasslands supported an abundance of the now-extinct form of
bison. It appears Folsom and Plainview peoples tracked bison over great distances as evidenced by lithic
sourcing and technological organization (Hoffman 1991). Radiocarbon dates for Folsom sites range from
10,900 B.P. at Indian Creek, Montana, to 10,200 B.P. at the Hanson site in Wyoming (Haynes 1993). The
Plainview bison kill/butchering component at the Lubbock Lake Site (41LU1) is radiocarbon dated as
being post-Folsom at 9,900 B.P. (Johnson and Holliday 1980). Unfluted lanceolate Paleoindian points
similar to Plainview from the northern Great Plains (referred to as “Goshen”) dating to approximately
11,000 B.P. (Frison 1993) obfuscate clear chronological affiliation of unfluted points.
Late Paleoindian sites and associated artifacts are dated from 9,500 B.P. to 8,800 B.P. This subperiod is
marked by changes in site frequency and artifact density with these sites being more numerous and
containing higher artifact densities. Diagnostic tool types associated with the late Paleoindian subperiod
have been recovered at sites across Central and South Texas and include Scottsbluff, Wilson, San Patrice,
Big Sandy, St. Marys Hall, Barber, and Golondrina (Black and McGraw 1985; Collins 1995, 1998;
Hester 1995). Though the San Patrice and Big Sandy types are more common in the southeastern United
States, the presence of these types along the eastern plateau margin represents the western extent of those
technological traditions (Patterson 1989).
A R C H A I C PE R I OD
The Archaic period, which lasted from 8,800 B.P. to 1,200 B.P., is the longest of the defined cultural
periods and comprises two-thirds of Central Texas prehistory. This period is divided into three
subperiods: Early, Middle, and Late Archaic. Marked changes in the material culture of the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period include burned rock middens and ground stone indicative of a shift toward more
intensified utilization of local flora and fauna (Black and McGraw 1985; Collins 1995). The majority of
the Archaic is marked by a prolonged drought that ended by the Late Archaic subperiod with a change to
a more mesic climate.
The Early Archaic dates from approximately 8,800 to 6,000 B.P. In Central Texas, this subperiod is
represented by a diagnostic tool tradition consisting primarily of corner-notched, barbed, and split-stem
projectile points (i.e., Gower, Uvalde, and Martindale), though vestiges of the previous lanceolate
tradition remain in Angostura type. The later half of the period sees the introduction of basally-notched
dart points like Hester (1995) defined two horizons, “Early Corner Notched” and “Early Basal Notched”
for this period. The “Early Corner Notched Horizon” (ca. 8,500 to 6,000 B.P.) represents a continuum of
corner-notched dart points that include the Martindale, Uvalde, and Gower types listed above, as well as
Baker and Bandy types (Hester 1995:436). Often associated with this earlier horizon in the San Antonio
and Guadalupe river basins are gouge-like artifacts referred to as Guadalupe tools (Black and McGraw
1985). The “Early Basal Notched” horizon (ca. 6,100 to 5,500 B.P.) overlaps the subsequent Middle
Archaic in Central Texas and consists of dart points with deep basal notches, long distinctive stems, and

large barbs, such as Bell and Andice dart points (Hester 1995:437). Hester (1995:437) also posits that the
triangular bifaces appear in South Texas at this time.
The Middle Archaic subperiod lasted from approximately 6,000 to 4,000 B.P. and in Central Texas is
represented by numerous diagnostics artifacts, including Andice, Bell, Early Triangular, Nolan, and
Travis. In South Texas, triangular dart points (i.e., Tortugas and Abasolo) are typical, as are distally
beveled bifacial and unifacial tools (Hester 1995:438). In the San Antotnio area, Middle Archic sites often
contain triangular dart points with stemmed varieties (see above) identified with Central Texas (Black and
McGraw 1985; Collins 1995, 1998). The Middle Archaic coincides with the onset of a xeric climatic
interval that has been referred to as the Middle Holocene Altithermal. This middle Holocene climatic
interval is marked by extensive erosion and limited alluvial deposition. Erosion destroyed many of the
Middle Archaic sites that would have formed on stream terraces. Surface stability allowed other stream
terraces to accumulate cultural debris into aggregates or palimpsests representing centuries or even
millennia of occupation (Collins 1995; Holliday 1992).
The Late Archaic subperiod is dated to about 4,000 to 1,200 B.P. and indicates a shift to a mesic climatic
interval and the resumption of aggradation of many stream terraces. Increased distribution and density of
Late Archaic sites in Central Texas may be attributed to population growth resulting from an increased
resource base associated with increased precipitation. This period is represented by a wide variety of
diagnostic projectile points including Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville types
during the early Late Archaic, and Fairland, Frio, Ensor, and Darl types in the latter part of the period
(Black and McGraw 1985; Collins 1995, 1998; Johnson and Goode 1994). Shumla dart points typically
associated with the Texas Trans-Pecos appear frequently in South Texas assemblages at this time, as do
Matamoros and Catan types (Hester 1995:441).
L A T E PR E H I ST OR I C PE R I OD
The Late Prehistoric period spans 1,200 to 500 B.P. and is marked by several notable technological
changes, including the introduction of the bow and arrow and ceramics. This was apparently associated
with an increased population and cultural diversity. The climate shifted again to a xeric interval that
increased in intensity throughout the period. In Central and South Texas, two subperiods (or phases) are
recognized: Austin and Toyah. These subperiods are based on changes in artifact assemblages and
subsistence practices (Collins 1995; Hester 1995; Prewitt 1981).
The Austin subperiod is dated at approximately 1400 to 800 B.P. and is marked by the presence of
Edwards and Scallorn arrow points. Austin-phase materials found in association with burned rock
middens are not uncommon, suggesting similar subsistence practices to earlier Archaic hunter−gathers
(Collins 1995; Hester 1995). In South Texas, Matamoros and Catan specimens that appeared in the Late
Archaic continue into the Late Prehistoric (Hester 1995).
The Toyah subperiod, which dates to approximately 800 to 500 B.P., is characterized by plainware
ceramics and Perdiz arrow points. A shift toward bison hunting is apparent with increased bison remains
present in Toyah sites (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Lithic tools such as thin beveled bifaces and end
scrapers are also present in Toyah sites (Prewitt 1985)

A review of records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and data available on the
THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any
previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of Loop 337. Eleven sites
have been recorded within this zone. Previous cultural resource surveys adjacent to the project area
include those related to water or wastewater pipeline construction, electrical transmission line
construction, and the construction of a baseball park. Portions of the IH 35 ROW have also been
surveyed.
41C M 187 A ND 41C M 188
Site 41CM187 was recorded on a tributary of Blieders Creek as part of a wastewater pipeline survey
conducted in New Braunfels in the late 1980s (Kotter 1989). Described as a lithic procurement site
consisting of several tested cobbles and a few flakes, the site was assessed as disturbed and lacked
potential for designation as a SAL or inclusion to the NRHP.
Recorded during the same survey as 41CM187, site 41CM188 was described as a large surficial
prehistoric lithic procurement site. The site was not recommended for further investigation and was not
recommended as eligible for designation as a SAL or for inclusion to the NRHP (Kotter 1989).
41C M 198
No site form or other information available.
41C M 199
No site form or other information available.
41C M 200
No site form or other information available.
41C M 202
This site was recorded as part of a water main construction project in 1993. Cultural materials including a
hearth, lithic materials, bone, and burned rock were noted to depths of two meters in one backhoe trench.
The site was recommended as eligible for formal designation as a SAL and for inclusion to the NRHP
(TASA, Comal County site files).
41C M 219 A ND 41C M 220
Site 41CM219 was recorded as part of a survey of a proposed Little League Ball Park by John Arnn and
Kimberly Kvernes in 1997 (Arnn 1998). A prehistoric and historic component site located within the Dry
Comal Creek drainage, it was noted that it was virtually impossible to take a step without encountering

artifacts. Presumably historic stone structural remains were also noted. The site was recommended for
further investigation and was recommended as eligible for formal designation as a SAL and for inclusion
to the NRHP.
Site 41CM220 is a prehistoric open campsite on the banks of the Dry Comal immediately downstream of
Loop 337 that was also recorded during Arnn’s 1998 survey. One possible Angostura dart point was
noted, as was an extensive scatter of lithic debitage and small amounts of fire-cracked rock. Due to
extensive plowing, fill storage, and other activities, the site was deemed to have limited research value
and no further investigations were recommended.
41C M 286 A ND 41C M 287
Site 41CM286 was recorded as part of a Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) transmission line
survey by Andy Malouf in 2005 and is adjacent to Loop 337 on a bluff overlooking the Guadalupe River
(TASA and TARL site files). Burned limestone and flakes were noted on the surface and two shovel tests
indicated the presence of cultural remains up to 80 centimeters in depth. The site was recommended for
further investigations and as potentially eligible to the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
Recorded during the same transmission line survey noted above, site 41CM287 was located at the base of
the bluff near 41CM286 and adjacent to several springs. Several discrete burned limestone features were
noted in a creek bank, along with mussel shell, litihc debitage, and informal tools. A 20-centimeter thick
cultural lens was noted at a depth of approximately 1 meter below ground surface. Further investigations
were recommended as the site was considered as potentially eligible to the NRHP and for designation as a
SAL.
41C M 290
This is a prehistoric lithic scatter/quarry recorded by Dan Prikryl during a 2004 LCRA transmission line
survey (Prikryl et al. 2006). Located on an upland terrace of Blieders Creek, it was described as having a
low research value and was not considered eligible to the NRHP or for designation as a SAL.
Based upon the above known site density, it was felt that the APE possessed a good potential for
containing previously undocumented historic and prehistoric cultural resources. In upland areas
archeological sites were hypothesized to most likely consist of surficial lithic scatter/procurement areas,
given the thin and rocky upland soils. Major stream crossings within the project limits are limited to the
Guadalupe River, Dry Comal Creek, and Blieders Creek. Although there is no Holocene alluvium
mapped within the APE, alluvial soils are present on both banks of the Guadalupe River and Dry Comal
Creek, and the west bank of Blieders Creek. When the known site locations are considered, these stream
crossing areas have a high potential to contain cultural resources and potentially buried cultural resources.

The intensive non-collection archeological survey on Loop 337 involved surface and subsurface
investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of
any discovered cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the
guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines (NPS 1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the existing Loop 337 ROW and
proposed drainage easements by two archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for
cultural remains. Where available, cutbank profiles were inspected for the presence of any buried cultural
materials. Field investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras and no cultural materials
were collected. Curation was unnecessary.
There are alluvial deposits along several streams in the APE with the potential to contain intact buried
archeological deposits. Subsurface investigations emphasized backhoe trenching to prospect for such
materials at the Guadalupe River, Dry Comal Creek, and two unnamed tributary of Dry Comal Creek.
Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) wide,
and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep and plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS). Following
excavations, archeologists immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
cultural features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench
were described in detail on a B&A geologic profile form. All trenching activities were monitored by an
archeologist to avoid any unnecessary damage to potentially buried cultural deposits. When trenching in
the ROW was not possible, shovel tests were excavated.
In addition to the above streams, there are 14 drainage easements within the APE. Four (DEs 8 and 10
through 12) required backhoe trenching due to their potential for deeply buried archeological material.
Backhoe access for DEs 8, part of 10, and 11–12 required right-of-entry (ROE) across private property
adjacent to the Loop 337 ROW and ROE was not available at the time of the survey. The majority of the
easements were investigated, including shovel tests or probes as appropriate, during the pedestrian survey.
Upland areas in the APE that contain rocky and gravelly clay soils were subject to judgmental shovel
testing or probing as the upland soils in those locations formed in situ and have little to no potential for
containing intact buried archeological deposits. Judgmental shovel tests (STs) and shovel probes (SPs)
were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel. Shovel tests extended to a
maximum depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface or until soil or bedrock conditions prohibited
further excavation. All sediments removed from shovel tests were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh,
with shovel test data recorded on B&A shovel test form and plotted with a hand-held GPS receiver.
Shovel probes were an expedient method to assess the nature of the subsurface to determine if shovel
testing was possible.

The Loop 337 APE is surrounded by residential, commercial, recreational, and industrial areas (Figures
4.1 through 4.6). The existing Loop 337 ROW is disturbed by buried and overhead utilities, as well as by
the original construction of the roadway and subsequent maintenance. The original Loop 337 construction
involved extensive road cuts through solid limestone ridges and hills. These areas (as is much of the
ROW) are bedrock. Thus, the ROW has experienced significant surface and subsurface impacts that have
removed much of its original soil and topography. Surface investigations resulted in the discovery of four
previously unrecorded prehistoric archeological sites while subsurface investigations discovered no
buried archeological material. The following first discusses the archeological resources discovered during
the survey then briefly synthesizes the subsurface investigations conducted during the survey.
SI T E DE SC R I PT I ONS
41CM312
This site is a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on an upland ridge roughly 350 meters west of
Blieders Creek in the north part of the project area (Figures 5 and 6). The site within the Loop 337 ROW
measures approximately 300 meters east-west by 40 meters north-south, though it extends on to private
property for an undetermined distance north of the existing ROW boundary (Table 1). The topography is
gently undulating to almost level (due to roadway construction grading) across the top and side slope of
the landform. Vegetation consists of maintained ROW grasses and isolated live oaks. Ground surface
visibility was at least 40 to 50 percent across the site.
The site consisted of an amorphous surface scatter of roughly 15 to 20 tested chert cobbles, 30 to
40 primary and secondary flakes, and only a few (< 10) interior flakes. No formal tools (i.e., bifaces) were
observed and the lithic raw material varies in color from primarily dark gray to light gray in the cobbles
with typically tan and brown smaller gravels. There was no evidence of features or burned rock. Shovel
Probes 12, 13, and 14 were completed on site to assess its potential for a subsurface component. Those
probes revealed a brown, extremely thin and gravelly marly and clayey matrix with bedrock fragments.
Formal shovel testing was considered unnecessary.
Site 41CM312 presumably represents the remnants of a much larger lithic procurement/scatter site
associated with exposed cherty gravels and cobbles. Natural erosion and roadway construction have
virtually destroyed the site. This site type is ubiquitous in the region due to readily available chert
resources of the local limestone. Considering the disturbed conditions of this site, the high occurrence of
this site type in the region, and the lack of subsurface deposits, it is the opinion of B&A that the part of
the site within the APE has no additional research value beyond locational data and site recordation has
exhausted the site's research value. However, the research potential of the part of the site north of the APE
is unknown.

41CM313
This site is as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located on a bench-like area on the midslope of a
northeast-southwest trending limestone ridge (see Table 1). The bench area is located on the northeast end
of the ridge and slopes gently from southwest to northeast. In the existing Loop 337 ROW, 41CM313
measures approximately 200 meters east-west by 30 meters north-south, though the scatter continues
outside of the APE an unknown distance to the north (Figures 7 and 8). Immediately north of 41CM313 is
a large church complex with three north-south trending driveways traversing the site.
The topography is gently undulating to almost level (due to roadway and church construction grading).
Much of the site surface is exposed dirt, as the area serves as an informal access road and a church
parking lot. An overhead transmission line easement occupies the northern edge of the existing ROW.
What vegetation there is consists of sparse grasses and several lone junipers and live oaks. Ground
surface visibility was 50 to 100 percent.
Cultural materials consist of tested and untested chert cobbles and gravels, as well as chert debitage (i.e.,
primary and secondary flakes but no tertiary specimens) but no formal tools. Raw material color varies
from dark grays to lighter grays. The site yielded no evidence of features or burned rock. Shovel Probes
19, 20, and 21 were placed along the site’s long axis and yielded an extremely thin and gravelly, marly
and clayey matrix with bedrock fragments extending to at least 15 centimeters ground surface (see
Appendix A). Given those conditions formal shovel testing was not possible.

Figure 8. View of 41CM313
Similar to site 41CM312, this site represents the remnants of a much larger surficial lithic
scatter/procurement site, but construction and natural erosion have greatly impacted the integrity of the
site. This site is typical of the ubiquitous upland lithic scatters found in the area due to readily available
chert resources provided by the local limestone. Given the disturbed conditions of this site, the high
occurrence of this site type in the region, and the lack of subsurface deposits, it is the opinion of B&A that
the part of the site within the APE has no additional research value beyond locational data and site
recordation has exhausted the site's research value. Because investigations were not possible on the part
of 41CM313 on private property north of the APE, its research potential is unknown.
41CM314
This site is a large (275 meters north-south by 125 meters east-west) moderately dense to dense
prehistoric lithic scatter/lithic procurement locale. The site is located on the top and side slopes of a large
limestone ridge at the transition between the escarpment and the Blackland Prairie due north of the
intersection of Loop 337 and Landa Drive (Figure 9). The ridge slopes from northwest to southeast,
dropping about 70 feet in elevation in 300 meters from the crest of the ridge down to Landa Drive. The
crest of the ridge provides an exceptional 360-degree view of the surrounding area. Much of the ridge top
and side slopes are bare limestone rock (Figure 10), though some areas of in situ clay (10 centimeters or
fewer thick) that have formed in and around cracks in the bedrock are present. Shovel testing and probing
were not necessary.

Figure 10. Representative view of site 41CM314
Cultural material consisted of hundreds of tested chert cobbles and gravels, as well as hundreds of
primary and secondary flakes. Occasional interior flakes but no formal tools, nor discernible patterns were
present in the surface scatter. Lithic raw material consisted of brown, tan, and gray chert cobbles and
gravels littering the exposed bedrock. Investigations yielded no evidence of features or burned rock.
Along the northeast edge of the site is an approximately 80 to 100-foot wide and 80-foot deep road cut
prepared during the construction of Loop 337. This cut separates the site area from the remainder of the
ridge that extends north and east outside of the APE where the site likely continues. No survey was
possible on the adjacent private property so it is not confirmed that the site continues north-northeast on
the remainder of the ridge.
Site 41CM314 is typical of large upland lithic scatters/procurement locales found throughout the region.
Considering the disturbed conditions of this site, the high occurrence of this site type in the region, and
the lack of subsurface deposits due to the local geology, it is the opinion of B&A that the part of this site
within the APE has no additional research value beyond locational data and site recordation has exhausted
the site's research value. The research potential of the part of the site north and east of the ROW/APE is
unknown.
41CM315
This site is as small (50-meter diameter) low-density prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located entirely
within the ROW adjacent to a roadside storage/laydown area (Figure 11; see Figure 9). The area was

AN INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY ON LOOP 337 FROM IH 35 TO RIVERCREST DRIVE

27

originally part of a limestone ridge cut during the construction of Loop 337. None of the original ground
surface remains, as the area was extensively graded and leveled. The site and landform slope steeply
southward and exhibits limestone gravels and bedrock. Vegetation in the area consists of mowed ROW
grasses and occasional live oak trees. Surface visibility is 60 to 70 percent.

Figure 11. Typical conditions of ROW at site 41CM315

Cultural material consists of approximately 20 to 30 primary and secondary flakes and roughly 10 tested
chert gravels. No formal tools or expedient tools were observed and the artifacts were randomly dispersed
across ground surface with no discernible concentrations. No burned rock or other materials suggestive of
previous cultural features suggest that site represents the fortuitous procurement of chert gravels. As with
the other three sites discovered during this project, it appears only initial reduction and raw material
testing occurred on site. Shovel Probes 31 and 32 confirmed that the site has no potential for a buried
component due to mechanical grading and contouring of the area during road construction, as well gravel
and bedrock exposed on the ground surface.
Site 41CM315 is highly disturbed by roadway construction and does not represent a unique prehistoric
site for the region. Considering the disturbed conditions of this site, the ubiquity of this site type in the
region, and the lack of potential for subsurface deposits, it is the opinion of B&A that the site has no
additional research value beyond locational data and documentation has exhausted the site's research
value.

Upland environments with thin (≤ 10 centimeters below ground surface) and stony to extremely stony
clay soils that developed in situ account for the majority of the APE. Given those conditions,
judgmentally excavated shovel tests and shovel probes were utilized in the uplands (and some limited
stream-side locations) to prospect for buried cultural remains, while backhoe excavations occurred in
creek-side locations.
Shovel Tests and Shovel Probes
Shovel tests were excavated both in the ROW and immediately adjacent to the ROW in DEs 1–10 and
12–13. A total of 18 shovel tests were excavated in the APE (Table 2). The greatest depth of shovel test
excavations was 50 centimeters below ground surface in STs 9–16 adjacent to DEs 8, 12, and 13. Those
tests yielded dense moist clay and fill that could not reasonably be excavated deeper by hand. Shovel
testing throughout the APE discovered no buried archeological materials.

confirm the presence of disturbed construction fill. These are plotted on Figures 4.1 through 4.6.
Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe excavations were conducted along four streams within the APE (Appendix A). Trenching areas
included the Guadalupe River (BHTs 1–4), Dry Comal Creek (BHTs 5–7 and 16), and two unnamed
tributaries of Dry Comal Creek (BHTs 8–15) near the Loop 337/Landa Street intersection (see Figures 4.1
through 4.6). No archeological material was discovered during backhoe trench excavations, only dense
massive clayey alluvium overlying bedrock; gravelly to rocky unconsolidated sandy alluvium overlying
lag gravels and bedrock; or rocky and gravelly clayey alluvium (Figures 12–15). When trenching was not
possible, shovel tests were excavated.

Figure 12. View of BHT 1 during excavation. BHT 2 contained similar strata
Outside of the ROW but within the APE, DEs 8 and 10 through 12 required backhoe trenching due to a
potential for deeply buried archeological material. Backhoe access for those DEs required ROE across
private property adjacent to the Loop 337 ROW to reach the trenching areas. ROE was not available at
the time of the survey so trenching in DEs 8 and 10 through 12 was not possible.
Although proposed, trenching at Blieders Creek was not possible in the northwest quadrant of the
crossing due to existing buried utilities (i.e., wastewater, water, and telephone) and very rocky soils with

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
The existing Loop 337 ROW is disturbed by buried and overhead utilities, as well as by the original
construction of the roadway and subsequent maintenance. Much of the original Loop 337 construction
north of Landa Street involved massive cuts through limestone ridges and hills resulting in broad areas of
exposed bedrock or areas leveled with construction fill overlying bedrock. South of Landa Street in the
Blackland Prairie margins, roadway construction involved extensive cut-and-fill construction involving
wide fill sections. Thus, the existing ROW has experienced significant surface and subsurface impacts
that have removed much of its original soils and topography. Consequently, the Loop 337 ROW
possesses little to no potential for containing buried intact and potentially significant archeological
deposits.
Subsurface investigations within the Loop 337 ROW discovered no buried cultural deposits, though
surface examinations of the study area discovered four previously unrecorded prehistoric sites. Sites
41CM312, 41CM313, 41CM314, and 41CM315 are prehistoric lithic scatters/procurement locales
associated with upland limestone ridges with exposures of cherty bedrock gravels and cobbles. With the
exception of 41CM315, the sites extend outside of the APE on to private property.
It is the opinion of B&A that, 41CM315 and the parts of 41CM312, 41CM313, and 41CM314 located
within the Loop 337 ROW have no potential for yielding intact buried archeological deposits that could
provide new or important data for local and regional prehistory. These resources are suficial palimpsests
and the lack of diagnostic artifacts and cultural features greatly impedes the ability to discern multiple
components. As such, none are recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP (as per 36 CFR 60) or
for formal SAL designation (as per 13 TAC 26.8), nor would they be considered contributing elements if
the parts of the sites outside of the Loop 337 ROW were determined at a later date to be eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or eligible for formal SAL designation (Table 3). However, because the parts of
41CM312–314 that extend outside of the APE on to private property could not be investigated, their
eligibility is unknown.

There is little to no potential for the Loop 337 ROW to contain previously unidentified archeological
historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12). It should be noted that trenching could
not be conducted at DEs 8 and 10 through 12, and it is possible for those areas to contain previously
unidentified buried archeological historic properties. As such, additional investigations are recommended
in DEs 8 and 10 through 12 prior to the proposed construction. Further investigations would also be
necessary prior to construction in the parts of sites 41CM312–314 that extend beyond the ROW if the
proposed project or future projects require additional workspace, easements, or ROW in those locations.
If evidence of archeological resources is identified during construction, work in the immediate area would
cease immediately and TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery
procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
