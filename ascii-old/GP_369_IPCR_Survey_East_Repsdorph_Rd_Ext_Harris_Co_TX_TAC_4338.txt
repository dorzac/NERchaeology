ABSTRACT

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on an estimated 0.68
kilometers (0.42 miles) of property proposed for road widening and extension in Harris
County, Texas. The archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) associated with this
project covers a total of 1.31 hectares (3.25 acres).
The proposed widening of East Repsdorph Road begins 213.36 meters (700 feet) east
of State Highway (SH) 146 and will end approximately 182.88 meters (600 feet) west of SH
146. Approximately 6.10 meters (20 feet) of new right-of-way (ROW) is proposed on both
sides of East Repsdorph Road, thus expanding the current ROW from 18.29 meters (60 feet)
to 30.48 meters (100 feet). This portion of the archaeological APE encompasses 0.48-hectare
(1.19 acres).
The proposed extension of East Repsdorph Road begins approximately 182.88 meters
(600 feet) west of SH 146 and extends northwest approximately 274 meters (900 feet) from
into an open field. This section of the project area is proposed for new 30.48-meter (100foot) wide ROW. This portion of the APE encompasses 0.83-hectare (2.06 acres).
All fieldwork and reporting activities were conducted with reference to the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4338, issued by the Texas
Historical Commission in January 2007. Fieldwork was conducted on January 11, 2007, and
required 8 person hours to complete. Survey activities were designed to assess the potential
impact that road widening and extension would have on any cultural resources located within
the proposed project areas. A reconnaissance level survey was conducted over previously
disturbed areas primarily in the area proposed for road widening and two shovel tests were
excavated in the previously undisturbed area proposed for road extension.
During this investigation, no archaeological sites or historic structures were observed
within the project area. The area has been highly disturbed by urban development including
drainage ditches, buried fiber optic cable, pipeline construction, and residential and
commercial buildings. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work
is required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on an estimated 0.68
kilometers (0.42 miles) of property proposed for road widening and extension in Harris
County, Texas. The property is associated with East Repsdorph Road, from east of State
Highway (SH) 146 and runs west to northwest into an open field on the west side of SH 146.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) includes all property proposed for
widening and extension of East Repsdorph Road, totaling approximately 1.31 hectares (3.25
acres). The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4338, issued by
the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Division of Archeology in January 2007. All
fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities
Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA] 1966; Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines 1981, 1983) law and guidance for conducting cultural
resources surveys pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation 2001).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area is located on the League City 7.5-minute United States Geologic
Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed widening of East
Repsdorph Road begins approximately 213.36 meters (700 feet) east of SH 146 and ends
approximately 182.88 meters (600 feet) west of SH 146. Approximately 6.10 meters (20
feet) of new road right-of-way (ROW) is proposed on both sides of East Repsdorph Road,
thus expanding the current ROW from 18.29 meters (60 feet) to 30.48 meters (100 feet).
This portion of the archaeological APE encompasses 0.48-hectare (1.19 acres). This portion
of the project area is predominantly urban and is characterized by overhead utility lines,
buried cables and pipeline, roadside ditches, paved driveways, and residential and
commercial development.
The proposed extension of East Repsdorph Road begins approximately 182.88 meters
(600 feet) west of SH 146 and extends northwest approximately 274 meters (900 feet) into an
open field. This section of the project area is proposed for new 30.48-meter (100-foot) wide
ROW. This portion of the APE encompasses 0.83-hectare (2.06 acres). Open fields divided
by a north-south fence line characterize this portion of the project area. The western section
of the proposed road extension is located in an open field with visible disturbances including
a drainage ditch and several buried pipelines associated with the TEPPCO Seabrook Pump
Station. The eastern section of the proposed road extension is composed primarily of an
undisturbed open field with a modern farm shed and two aboveground trash dumps situated

CHAPTER II. SOILS

The proposed project area contains soils that have been mapped and described by
Wheeler (1976), and updated by the National Cooperative Soil Survey Web Soil Survey
(NCSS WSS 2006) and the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA 2006). Soils within the project
area have been classified as Aris fine sandy loam (Ap), Edna fine sandy loam (Ed), Lake
Charles clay (LcA), Verland silty clay loam (Md), and Verland-Urban complex (Mu).
According to Abbott (2001:21-23), geoarchaeological potential is low for all of these soils.
Descriptions of these soils using the sources listed above are summarized below.
The soils in the majority of the project area are Aris fine sandy loam and Lake Charles
clay. The Aris series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils.
These nearly level soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene age. Slopes
are less than 1 percent. Aris series soil colors range from dark grayish-brown to dark gray to
light gray. Pastureland is the most common use for these soils. The Lake Charles series
consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in
clayey sediments. These soils are on broad coastal prairies. Slopes are mainly less than 1
percent, but range from 0 to 8 percent. These very dark gray clayey soils are also mostly
used for pastureland.

CHAPTER III. CULTURE HISTORY

Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D.
400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that
a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC,
indicates that only one previously recorded site (41HR538) is located within 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) of the project area. Site 41HR538 was recorded as a prehistoric Rangia shell
midden located on the east shoreline of Taylor Bayou, northwest of the current project area.
Ross Fields of Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in Austin, Texas recorded the site in 1984. The
site has been destroyed by shoreline retreat associated with continuous wake caused by
recreational boating. Based on the lack of integrity maintained at the site, it was determined
to be ineligible for National Register status. This site was identified during a 1984 survey
conducted at the behest of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District. No additional sites were identified as a result of this survey.
Three additional cultural resources investigations have been previously conducted
within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. In 1988, a linear survey along Nasa Road
1 was conducted on behalf of the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(SDHPT). No additional information could be located regarding this survey although it
appears hat no cultural resources were recorded as a result of it.
In 1992, a large tract of land was surveyed on behalf of the USACE west of SH 146
and south of the current project area. No additional information could be located regarding
this survey although it appears hat no cultural resources were recorded as a result of it.
In 2006, Michael Baker, Jr., Inc. conducted a survey of 15.37 hectares (38.00 acres)
on the east side of SH 146 from Fairmont Parkway to SH 3 in Harris and Galveston Counties
(Mooney and Mathews 2006). The survey was conducted on behalf of the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). As a result of the survey, no previously identified cultural
resources were located and no buried cultural materials or living surfaces were identified.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Background research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization, and included a
review of archaeological site files, architectural resource files, and previously conducted
cultural resource surveys in the project vicinity. This information was collected by
consultation of on-line research archives maintained by the THC.

FIELD METHODOLOGY
This investigation was treated as an intensive pedestrian survey, though the majority
of the project area was surveyed at a reconnaissance level. The reconnaissance level survey
consisted of a walkover survey and visual inspection of a portion of the existing East
Repsdorph Road ROW approximately 396 meters (1300 feet) in length and 6.10 meters (20
feet) in width on both sides the road where road widening is proposed. No shovel tests were
excavated in this area due to the observation of severe disturbances. These disturbances
includes drainage ditched with culverts buried fiber optic cable, and overhead utility lines,
intersecting roads, and residential and commercial development. Photographs of these
disturbances were captured and are provided in Figure 2.
Shovel testing was within the 274-meter (900-foot) swath of property proposed for
road extension within entirely new 30-meter (100-foot) wide ROW (Figure 2). Due to the
presence of standing water and vegetation characteristic of marshland, only two shovel tests
were excavated along one staggered 30-meter (100-foot) wide transect. Shovel tests were
placed between 80 meters (24.38 feet) apart in the only areas with higher dry ground. Both
shovel tests were excavated to a depth 15 centimeters (5.90 inches) below the ground surface
and stopped because they began filling with water. Both shovel tests measured 30
centimeters (11 inches) in diameter within the testable areas. Vertical control was
maintained by excavating each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels, although the
excavation of two levels was not possible due to inundation. One wall of each shovel test
was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected despite the water level
for color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. Soils
were not screened through ¼-inch wire mesh due to the thick saturated clay that was
encountered; rather the excavated soils were hand sorted. Descriptions of soil texture and
color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional
information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for
each excavation.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY

No new archaeological sites or historic standing structures were encountered as a
result of this survey effort. The cultural resources survey for this project consisted of a
reconnaissance level survey and minimal shovel testing of 1.31 hectares (3.25 acres) of
property associated with the widening and extension of East Repsdorph Road.
Reconnaissance level survey was limited to 6.10 meters (20 feet) on both sides of the existing
ROW for a length of 396 meters (1300 feet) from 213.36 (700 feet) east of SH 146 to 182.88
meters (600 feet) west of SH 146. Reconnaissance level survey was conducted over 0.48
hectares (1.19 acres).
Two shovel tests were excavated in an open field within new proposed 30.48-meter
(100-foot) wide ROW. This area covers approximately 0.83 hectares (2.06 acres). None of
the shovel tests yielded cultural material or had any indication of the presence of cultural
features.
Both shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 15 centimeters (5.90 inches)
below the surface and were stopped due to inundation. Because of the inundation and clayey
nature of the soil, the excavated soil could not be screened and were hand sorted and visually
inspected. The soils present within the shovel tested portion of the project area generally
contained three soil strata, although only the uppermost stratum was most typically
encountered due to inundation just below the ground surface. Excavated soils generally
consisted of moist to saturated dark gray (10YR4/1) or very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay or clay
loam at the ground surface to depths ranging from 15 to 30 centimeters (5.91 to 11.81 inches)
below the surface. Both shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.

CHAPTER VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted on an
estimated 0.68 kilometers (0.42 miles) of property proposed for the widening and extension
of East Repsdorph Road and improvements to an adjacent manmade drainage channel in
Harris County, Texas.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, initial investigation consisted of a background
literature and site files search to identify the presence of recorded cultural resources in close
proximity to the project property. Background research identified no previously recorded
cultural resources within the project area and only one previously recorded archaeological
site (41HR538) within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
As a result of the survey, no previously unrecorded archaeological sites or historic
structures were located within the project APE. Survey results indicated that indicates buried
cultural resources are unlikely to be present within the APE due to extensive disturbances to
the natural ground surface. This is supported by visible surface conditions, lack of cultural
materials recorded in shovel tests, and by the presence of mottled and disturbed soils. HRA
Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required, and that the
project be cleared to proceed as planned.
