TIME AND TYPES IN ARCHEOLOGICAL
ANALYSIS: THE BRAINERDROBINSON TECHNIQUE
By

RUDOLPH

C. TROIKE

It is the special province of the archeologist to document
and interpret the culture history of man, as reflected in the
material artifacts of daily life which man leaves wherever he
lives. The first important step in this task is the chronological
ordering of archeological deposits. Until this has been done,
the archeologist is unable to speak intelligently about the culture history of a single site, much less about the time-space
framework of an entire area. Despite recent criticisms of overemphasis on chronology in archeologica! studies, there is a
great need for more, rather than less, attention to this aspect
of culture history. It is therefore important that more precision and refinement be sought in techniques for the chronological ordering of archeological deposits.
Seriation offers one of the most sensitive possible measures
of temporal change in an archeological sequence. This is due
to the fact that it relies on internal changes in the artifacts
themselves rather than on external evidence such as stratigraphy. Seriation is made possible by the nature of cultural
change. The members of a culture living at a single time and
place tend to behave alike, and the artifacts which they produce likewise tend to be similar. Individual differences in successive acts by each person in the group gradually bring about
changes in the culture of the group. This is reflected archeologically by changing frequencies of artifact classes or of such
features as the material, techniques, decoration, or forms employed in the manufacture of artifacts. Artifact classes or features tend to have a frequency distribution in time which may
be represented graphically in the form of a lens. It is this
characteristic lens-like cycle which makes it possible to order
related artifact collections chronologically.

If time is the major factor responsible for the differences
among a series of artifact collections, a graph of the elements
chosen for seriation should show profiles of continuous increasing or decreasing frequency. When the collections are
placed in their correct chronological order and the percentages
of constituent artifact classes or features are computed and
graphed, a picture such as that in Fig. 65 should result. To
obtain a sequence when the chronology is not known, the procedure is reversed and the graphs of the collections are shuffled
about until the elements approximate the desired lenticular
profiles. (This technique has been extensively developed and employed by James A. Ford in several publications; see Ford and
Willey, 1949, for a more detailed discussion.)
Although this technique of seriation suffices when the number of collections and distinctive analytical units is small, it
becomes quite cumbersome when dealing with large quantities
of materials. For this purpose, George W. Brainerd (1951) and

W. S. Robinson (1951) developed and described a statistical
technique for seriation which offers many practical advantages
for the manipulation of large masses of data. In addition, it
holds considerable promise of being a valuable tool in the
interpretation of archeological sequences. The original presentation by Brainerd and Robinson has been amplified and clarified
in two subsequent articles by Belous (1953) and Dixon (1956).
The present discussion will be devoted to the methodological
aspects of the application of the Brainerd-Robinson technique.
II
Although the archeologist may deal exclusively with the histories of individual artifact features in his analysis, such a
procedure becomes very complex when the cultural inventory is
very rich. It is an empirical observation that these features are
not distributed at random among various kinds of artifacts
in a collection, but rather that certain combinations of features
repeatedly occur in individual artifactsÂ¯ As a matter of convenience for analysis, and because the repetition of artifacts
presenting the same unified attributes appears to reflect cultural reality, the archeologist classifies his material into units
known as types. A type comprises a group of artifacts all of
which share a number of distinctive features; these shared
attributes are taken to define the type.
An artifact type, if correctly formulated, should also reveal a
lens-like history. The Brainerd-Robinson technique of seriation
Â¯ . . is based on the concept that each type originates at a given time
at a given place, is made in gradually increasing numbers as time
goes on, then decreases in popularity until it becomes forgotten, never
to recur in an identical form (Brainerd, 1951, p. 304).

Since seriation can only be as accurate and sensitive as the
typology upon which it is based, certain methodological assumptions implicit in the Brainerd-Robinson technique should be
mentioned before proceeding to a discussion of the technique
itself.
When the materials from a site excavation or from a number
of site collections have been catalogued and are to be sorted
into types, in order to reduce bias in the typology it is desirable

272

Texas Archeological Society

to mix all of the materials in a single pile before sorting begins.
This permits more objective classification and reduces the unconscious tendency to unequal sorting in different collections
(see Dixon, 1956, pp. 20-26, 29). Before a type is formally
defined, an adequate sample from one or more sites (if possible)
should be available, in order to avoid the inclusion of individual
or local variations in the type definition. Traits chosen for defining the type should be as numerous, complex, and distinctive
as possible, to preclude overlapping of types; types should contrast with one another (Brainerd, 1951, p. 304). All artifacts
classified as of a single type must, without exception, present
all of the characteristics chosen to define the type. This rigid
requirement will leave a number of unique and untyped artifacts, which should be described but which are irrelevant for
purposes of seriation (Brainerd, 1951, pp. 303, 305). Finally,
all types should show roughly lens-shaped histories, when the
collections have been seriated. If several similar types show
parallel frequency distributions through time, they should
probably be combined into a single type. A tentative type which
does not show a lenticular profile will adversely affect the seriation, and should be re-analyzed or excluded (see Dixon, 1956,
pp. 10, 17, for a discussion of Gila Plain Ware as an invalid
type in the Snaketown ceramic sequence).
III
Although the Brainerd-Robinson technique of seriation involves statistical procedures, they are very simple and do not
require any knowledge of statistics to follow. The empirical
basis for seriation lies in the fact that collections from deposits
close together in time wilt (barring accidents of nature, excavation, or analysis) show greater similarity in relative frequencies
of shared artifact types or traits than will collections further
removed from one another in time. Brainerd and Robinson developed a simple numerical index to express this degree of
similarity, and then used this index to allign the collections in a
chronological sequence.
The principal steps in the Brainerd-Robinson seriational
technique may first be summarized, and then discussed by the
aid of examples. Although other traits than types may be seri-

Time and Types in Archeological Analysis

273

ated, it is assumed for purposes of the present discussion that
types are to be used, and that the artifacts have been adequately
typed. The unit employed in seriation is the collection, which is
defined as "a group of artifacts which were found together"
(Brainerd, 1951, p. 304), whether in a level of an excavation
unit or on the surface of a site. Only those collections and types
for which there is an adequate sample are included in the calculations.

The percentage of each type in each collection is computed
and tabulated.
Each collection is compared in turn with all other collections in respect to the percentages of each type included in the seriation. The smaller percentage, regardless
of which collection it belongs to, is ahvays subtracted
from the larger.
The remainders (those figures obtained by subtracting)
are then added together to give the total difference between each two collections.
This total is subtracted from the figure 200. The resulting
number represents the index of similarity between the two
collections.
The similarity indices are then plotted on a table, or
matrix, in which all collections are listed by column and
row, and the indices placed at the intersections.
The columns and rows are then shifted about until they
most closely approximate a situation with the highest
index figures along the diagonal and a continuous decrease
in the magnitude of the numbers away from the diagonal
in both directions. A mechanical device to aid in this stage
of the work, the "ordering board," is described by Dixon
(1956, pp. 11-12).
The resulting sequence of collections should then be accurate, if time is the major dimension operative in the
the differences between the collections.

If it is impossible to obtain a satisfactory ordering, two factors may be responsible. First, the typological procedures may
have been inadequate; also, the profiles of suspicious types

274

Texas Archeological Society

should be checked (see Dixon, 1956, pp. 17, 20ff., on both these
problems). If the types fulfill specifications, it is possible that
factors other than time, such as distance (in the case of several
sites) or social stratification, may be influencing the sequence.
In this case, the only solution is to seek the best possible ordering under the circumstances. Brainerd (1951, pp. 307-308)
has discussed some of the inferences which can be drawn from
the examination of even chaotic matrices. This can be done
because the present technique, besides ordering collections
chronologically, also provides valuable insights into the nature
of certain processes of culture change.
If the materials seriated are from a stratigraphic excavation, the internal ordering can be checked against the external
evidence of deposition. Brainerd (1951, p. 311) has discussed
how analysis of the ordered matrix may suggest the direction
of the sequence from early to late without the need of stratigraphic data. This possibility at present remains somewhat
experimental.
Several hypothetical examples will be presented to explain
the operation of the Brainerd-Robinson seriation technique.
EXAMPLE 1. There are two collections of ceramics which
share no types in common. Collection I has only Type A, while
Collection II is composed entirely of Type B. This may be expressed in terms of percentages:
I
II

A
100%
0%

B
0%
100%

100%

100%

By subtracting the smaller percentage of each type from the
greater, there results a difference of 100% in Type A and
100% in Type B between Collections I and II. These figures
may be added together to give the total difference between Collections I and II, which is 200%. In other words, when two
collections have no types in common, they are 200% different.
This figure expresses maximum dissimilarity in the collections.
When the total percentage of difference between two collections
is subtracted from the figure of maximum difference, 200, a

Time and Types in Archeological Analysis

275

figure is obtained which expresses the degree of similarity in
the two collections. This will be demonstrated in the second
example.
EXAMPLE 2. There are three collections in which four
types of ceramics are found. Types C and F occur only in Collections III and IV, while Types D and E are changing frequency in opposite directions. The first step is to tabulate
what percentage of each collection is formed by each type.

The totals of differences are then subtracted from 200 to give
the measure of similarity between each pair of collections, as

The arrangement of the indices on the matrix is the most
important step in the whole procedure of seriation, so some
attention to this step is desirable. It will be noted that when a
collection is compared with itself, there is no difference and
the resulting index of similarity is 200. It is therefore unnecessary to fill in the diagonal line. In the ideal matrix arrangement, when all of the collections are in their correct chronological order, the highest figure of similarity should fall along
the diagona!, with a steady decrease away from the diagonal
in both directions. This is understandable since the diagonal
represents the line of highest possible similarity, which is
identity. If all collections are arranged in correct order, there
should be a consistently high agreement between each two adjacent collections, while similarities with further separated collections should decline as the separation increases. Since the
squares of the matrix furthest from the diagonal should contain the index of those collections most removed from one
another in time, these numbers should therefore be the smallest.
EXAMPLE 3. This example is employed to demonstrate
how the matrix is used to order collections. In this case, the
numbering of collections does not refer to stratigraphic position but is entirely arbitrary. It is here assumed that all the
previous necessary tabulations and calculations have been made.

CORRECT

In the first table above is given the initial ordering, which
fails in a number of instances to approximate the ideal pattern. Rather than decreasing evenly from the diagonal towards
the edges of the table, the numbers are irregularly distributed.
In order to arrive at the best possible seriation, the columns
and rows need to be shuffled until the numbers approximate the
ideal pattern as closely as can be achieved. In this, it is helpful
to circle those numbers which deviate from the desired pattern, and continue shifting columns and rows until the fewest
circled numbers result. The second table shows the correct
seriation of the collections, arrived at after some experimental
shifting of the columns.

IV
The Brainerd-Robinson seriation technique may now be applied to an actual archeological case, to show a complete instance of the technique carried out step by step. A convenient
example for this purpose is the report by Drucker (1952) on
the site of La Venta, in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. [This refers to an earlier project at La Venta than that reported in the
papers by Heizer and Squier in this volume.--ED.]
At La Venta, two stratigraphic trenches were excavated in
different parts of the site. Therefore, although the stratigraphy
was known for each trench, there was no direct way to correlate the two trenches. In addition, "The same wares occur
in both trenches, and moreover, the same wares appear as
major components of the ceramic pattern (i. e., the wares of
higher frequency), and the same ones.., are of low frequency

Texas A~âcheological Society

278

in both stratigraphic sections" (Drucker, 1952, p. 129). Thus
on the basis of the presence or absence of any ceramic type, it
would only be possible to say that the two occupations are
evidently contemporaneous. However, an examination of the
changing percentages of each type in the two trenches shows
that this case furnishes an excellent subject for seriation, since
only on this "internal" basis can the two trenches be related
in time.
For purposes of seriation, each level in each trench wilt be
treated as a collection. Since only the major wares, which are
common enough to give dependable frequencies and to show
changes in percentage, are to be used, it will first be necessary
to calculate the percentages of each from the figures which
Drucker (1952, pp. 127-128) gives (Table I). After this, the
similarity index for each pair of collections may be calculated
(Table II). The final step is to plot the similarity indices on a
matrix form, and shuffle the rows and columns about as much
as necessary to arrive at the desired pattern (Table III).

It is seen from the matrix (Table III) that Collection A of
Trench I deviates in almost every instance from the ideal pattern, and that the indices are scattered irregularly in the
column and row pertaining to this collection. For this reason
the collection is regarded as suspicious and excluded from consideration. This is confirmed by Drucker (1952, pp. 127-128) :
"It is apparent that the two uppermost levels have a greater
probable error, which we may interpret here as including the
effect of destructive soil action, as well as error of sampling .... "
The highest index of similarity between the two trenches is
between Collection E of Trench I and Collection 1 of Trench III.
From the stratigraphy it is known that Collection E is the bot-

Time and Types in Archeological Analysis

281

tom level and Collection 1 the top level of their respective
trenches, hence it may be concluded that Trench III represents
an earlier occupation than Trench I.
Several other conclusions may be drawn from an examination
of the matrix. The similarity index between the adjacent levels
of the two trenches is the lowest figure along the diagonal, suggesting a lapse of time between the final occupation at Trench
III and the first occupation at Trench I. Although it is not possible to determine the length of time between the two occupations, it may be noted that the similarity index for Collections
E : 1 is about the same magnitude as the indices for Collections 2 : 4 or 3 : 5 within Trench III. From this fact it may
be suggested that the equivalent of only one or two occupation
levels is missing between the two trenches. As Drucker has
noted (1952, pp. 129-132), the presence of the same ceramics
throughout both trenches definitely points to a single culture
which gradually underwent small internal changes. It is significant to point out that the success of the seriation demonstrafes the validity of Druckerâs ceramic typology.
An additional inference may be drawn from the matrix. It
is evident that the similarity between the levels in Trench I
is higher than in Trench III. This suggests that the occupation
represented in Trench I was of shorter duration but of greater
intensity, or underwent considerably slower change than the
occupation found in Trench III.
The conclusions reached on the basis of the Brainerd-Robinson technique of seriation may now be compared with Druckerâs results. Rather than relying on internal evidence, he turns
to a comparison with the sequence at the Tres Zapotes site, in
the state of Veracruz, Mexico, as a basis for his conclusions.
In order to determine the sequence of the trenches, "On the
basis of the sherds alone, this would be very problematical,
were it not for the evidence of the nature of the trends of
ceramic changes at the related site of Tres Zapotes" (Drucker,
1952, p. 131). If Trench I is considered later than Trench III,
then the increase of Fine Paste wares from early to late matches
the trend at Tres Zapotes in the Middle Period. Furthermore,
"It seems possible that an unconformity exists between our two
sections as they now stand" (Drucker, 1952, p. 131).

Virtually all of Druckerâs conclusions are confirmed independently through the application of the Brainerd-Robinson
seriation technique, a point of no small importance to archeological theory. It is especially significant that the chronological
sequence of Trenches III and I was determined by this seriational technique, without recourse to comparative evidence. This
underscores the methodological point that internal evidence is
more dependable and important, and should be exploited as the
first line of investigation, before turning to tenuous comparatire correlations. In the present case, for instance, there is no
way as yet to verify the hypothesis that two different sites
such as La Venta and Tres Zapotes underwent parallel developments, so that Druckerâs basis for the relative chronology
of the two trenches is indeed a shaky one. In other words, internal chronology should be developed first where this is possible, as a basis for external comparisons, rather than vice
versa. In this way the investigator will be on much firmer
ground when he undertakes the reconstruction of culture sequences.

Some of the advantages of the Brainerd-Robinson statistical
technique of seriation may now be briefly summarized.
.

It is easy to use and provides a convenient means for
handling large quantfties of data. In his unpublished
work on northern Yucatan, Mexico, Brainerd seriated by
this technique some 345 different ceramic types, features,
and other associated artifacts.

2.

It permits the archeologist to establish a very sensitive
and finely-scaled internal chronology in his materials, and
permits more accurate assignment of a collection within
a sequence than would otherwise be possible.

3.

It can serve as a check on stratigraphy, which at times
may be difficult to establish within an excavation or between two excavations. It would be particularly useful for
tracing cultural developments within natural strata which
were subdivided into artificial levels during excavation.

4.

It serves as a test of the artifact typology developed by
the investigator. Once the deposits have been seriated, the

lens-like history of each type may be extracted as a byproduct.
Â°

Finally, as demonstrated in the analysis of the La Venta
sequence, the technique can often be made to yield very
vaIuable insights into the nature of culture change within
a site.

As the work of both Brainerd and Dixon has shown, there
are many promising avenues of investigation in the use of this
technique which need to be explored. The potentialities of the
technique have as yet only been partially developed, and much
remains to be done. It is hoped that the presentation in this
paper will contribute to the more general understanding of the
technique and perhaps stimulate its more extensive use. Only
thereby can the results of the technique receive their needed
testing, and growth take place in the body of interpretative
knowledge, both of which are necessary for the more significant
application of the technique. As Brainerd concluded (1951, p.
312), "Techniques for the utilization of the numerical data
produced by the procedure are the present need and these must
be evolved by archeologists."
