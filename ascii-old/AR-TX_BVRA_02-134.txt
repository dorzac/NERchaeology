ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a 3 mile (7.3 acres) water line in central Brazos County,
Texas was conducted in March 2004 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of
Bryan, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 3367. The Principal Investigator was William
E. Moore, and the Project Archaeologist was Edward P. Baxter. No new archaeological
sites were found in the project area, and it is recommended that the City of Bryan be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division; the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL); the City of Bryan; and BVRA. No artifacts were collected.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The contract for this project was awarded to BVRA by the City of Bryan. The
cooperation of Graduate Civil Engineer Richard Reynosa throughout the project is
appreciated. Mr. Reynosa provided maps and other logistical support. I am also grateful
to Edward P. Baxter for his assistance in the field and with the preparation of the figures
that appear in this report. Allegra Azulay, Records File Search Assistant at TARL,
conducted the background check for previously recorded sites in the project area.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct an archaeological survey for the
proposed 2004 West Side Water and Wastewater Expansion Project in central Brazos
County (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on United States Geological Survey
topographical maps Bryan West dated 1962 and photorevised 1980 (map number 3096423) and Chances Store dated 1962 and photorevised 1980 (Map Number 3096-422)
(Figure 2). The proposed water supply line is three miles in length with a permanent
easement of 20 feet (7.3 acres). It begins at Leonard Road, turns south at Jones Road,
turns southwest at Chick Lane, and terminates at Villa Maria Road. The line parallels a
tributary of Thompsons Creek, a major stream in the county, which runs into the Brazos
River. The size of the pipe is 24 inches, and it will be placed in a trench 36 inches wide
with an average depth of 7 feet. Since the construction of this project is being financed by
a local municipality, an Antiquities Permit was required, and permit number 3367 was
issued. No federal agency is involved.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to the planning
document (Biesaart et al. 1985:114), Brazos County contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985,
0 sites in the county had been excavated, 0 had been tested by hand, and 33 had been
surface collected. Two recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Paleoindian,
1 was listed as General Archaic, and 1 was listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al.
1985:114). The archaeological potential of Brazos County is reflected in part by the
increasing number of recorded sites found as a result of cultural resource management
studies. As a result of these investigations, the number of recorded sites now stands at
157 (TARL site records). A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas revealed five archeological sites within one mile of the project
area. Not one is within the path of the water supply line as currently proposed. The
nearest previous investigation was an archaeological survey of a water supply line by
BVRA in 2002. This study (Moore 2002) examined 17,000 feet along Leonard Road to
Chick Lane and a 2000 foot segment on private land. No sites were found. Typically,
archaeological sites in Brazos County are found on sandy hills overlooking creeks and
rivers where water and other resources were available. Sites occur on first terraces and in
upland settings. Deeply buried sites in the Brazos River alluvium have also been recorded.

It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Brazos County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and the in-depth
report by Thoms (1993) for more detailed information regarding the archaeology of Brazos
County.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in the project
area and vicinity was conducted. No previously recorded sites were found to be within the
area to be surveyed. The project area was examined on March 3, 2004. Based on a
review of the topographic maps, an area approximately one mile in length was selected for
shovel testing. The field crew, consisting of the Principal Investigator (William E. Moore)
and the Project Archaeologist (Edward P. Baxter). All exposed areas (10% to 40%) were
surface inspected. The majority of the tests (n=19) were dug to clay, and the remaining
test was terminated due to water-saturated soils. The size of each test was 30 centimeters
in diameter, and they varied in depth from 10 to 50 centimeters below the existing ground
surface. All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Data obtained
from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all, 20 shovel tests
were dug (Figure 3), and each test was backfilled. Approximate locations of the shovel
tests are depicted on the topographic maps in Figure 3.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No previously recorded archaeological sites were found to be within the path of the
water supply as currently proposed by the City of Bryan. Overall, the project area
traverses an area containing clay at or near the surface. At about 50 cm, the ground is
extremely saturated with water. Strata of fine sandy loam without clay were not observed.
These conditions indicate that this is an unlikely setting for prehistoric occupation with the
exception of very transient or brief episodes. The few types of gravel observed were quite
small and are not suitable resources for arrow or dart point manufacture. It is possible that
sparse lithic scatters and procurement sites are present in the general area, but no
evidence of these site types was observed. It is, therefore, concluded that the route of the
water supply line does not pass through any prehistoric or historic sites.
The Archeological Survey Standards for Texas states that 16 shovel tests per mile
are considered the minimum number for linear projects. Since only one mile was selected
for survey, the 20 shovel tests excavated during this project meet these standards.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is my opinion that there are no significant archaeological sites within the route of
the water supply line. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any
cultural resources survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered
during construction of the proposed water supply line, work in the area of the find should
cease until assessed by a professional archaeologist in consultation with the THC, BVRA,
and the City of Bryan.
