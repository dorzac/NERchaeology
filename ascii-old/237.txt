ABSTRACT
The Walker County Special Utility District (SUD) proposes to install a fourinch water line within the Lake Falls Estates subdivision in central Walker County,
Texas. An archaeological survey of the area in close proximity to previously
recorded prehistoric site 41WA56 was requested by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in order to determine if significant portions of this site is within
the Area of Potential Effect (APE). This survey was conducted by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) on May 8, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5630. The
Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and he was assisted in the field by
Randall Anderson. The project area was investigated by shovel testing. One
probable secondary flake made from quartzite was found at 70 cm in the first
shovel test, but no additional cultural materials were found in three adjacent tests.
The area has been greatly disturbed since prehistoric site 41WA56 was first
recorded, and there is no evidence of this site today. It is, therefore, recommended
that the Walker County SUD be allowed to proceed as planned. The area
investigated consisted of 0.37 acre. The state agency involved in this project is the
Texas Department of Rural Affairs, and Rachel Louviere is the agency contact.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of that portion of a proposed water pipeline that
will be placed in the road (Lake Falls Lane) and/or on the north side of Lake Falls
Lane (depending on landowner permission) that passes near previously recorded
prehistoric site 41WA56 and parallels Harmon Creek, one of the major streams in
Walker County (Figure 1). The area investigated consists of 1600 feet of the larger
water distribution system project. The easement acquired by the Walker County
SUD is ten feet. According to the soil survey for Walker County (McClintock et al.
1979), there are two soil types in the project area. At the location of previously
recorded site 41WA56, the soil is Falba fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (13).
This is a moderately deep soil on convex uplands. The surface layer consists of
very friable, strongly acid, fine sand loam about five inches thick. Between 7 and
24 inches is very firm clay. At 55 inches, tuffaceous sandstone is present. This soil
is poorly drained, and is saturated in winter and spring in most years. Permeability
is very slow. Rock crops out where the slope break is abrupt. The remainder of the
project area is in a soil identified in the soil survey as Landman association, gently
undulating (32). This is a deep soil on convex stream terraces. The surface layer
is loamy fine sand about 7 inches thick. Clay loam extends from 74 to 80 inches.
This soil is moderately well drained, and it has a low available water capacity. The
project area is depicted on the Riverside USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle
(3095-432) (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to assess the potential for significant
cultural resources within the APE, and it was conducted by William E. Moore and
Randall Anderson on May 8, 2010. In all, 16 person hours were expended.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) and the
site files and maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory were checked
for the presence of previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity.
Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in the area were reviewed in
order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the
area, especially an unpublished report by the Principal Investigator (Moore 1976)
that documented a private survey conducted on personal time. The current survey
was conducted by the Principal Investigator and Randall Anderson. Since surface
visibility was very poor in the APE, the area was investigated through shovel
testing, and five tests were excavated (Figure 3). The first three tests were dug on
the western edge of the project area where exposed soil was present. Figure 4
depicts the area where the first three tests were excavated. Shovel Test 2 is
indicated in the background by a shovel sticking out of the test. The exposed dirt
from Shovel Test 1 is in the foreground. The fence in the background is the
beginning of a continuous series of mobile homes, temporary buildings, and fences.
The fourth test was dug on the south side of the road. At 30 centimeters,
sandstone that was brought in when the road was constructed was encountered.
We did not have permission to dig tests outside of this disturbed area. All earth
removed through shovel testing was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth. No
shovel tests were dug in the site area, as the landowners (Kevin Shafer and his
wife) did not want us digging in their garden or in the area between the road and
the garden. According to the Shaferâs, they have never found any artifacts in their
garden even though they till it to a depth of at least one foot. The road surface was
too hard to allow shovel tests to be dug in the road. The project was documented
by field notes, a shovel test log, and digital photography.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed the
presence of a previously recorded prehistoric site (41WA56) very close to the APE.
This site was recorded in 1974 by William E. Moore during an informal survey of
Walker County on personal time. At the time, the area was not developed. Moore
observed flakes and the distal tip of a biface in an exposed area on the north side
of the road, and he did not dig any shovel tests. The site was later recorded at
TARL, but the artifacts remained in his personal collection that will be donated to an
accredited curational facility in the future. Moore (1976) documented the results of
this survey in an unpublished report that is on file at TARL. No evidence of this site
in the project area was found as a result of this survey. The only cultural material
observed was a probable secondary flake made from quartzite found at a depth of
70 cm in the first shovel test, and it was found to the northwest of the location of site
41WA56. Three additional tests in close proximity to Shovel Test 1 were dug to
depths of 100 cm, and they were negative. A fourth test was dug across the road,
and sandstone was encountered at 30 cm. According to the client, this is rock that
is associated with road construction. Kevin Shafer, who lives across the road from
where we were shovel testing stated that the soil on his place is sandy and extends
to a depth of about five feet. He allowed me to walk over the area, and I observed
one core fragment that was confirmed as cultural by William A. Dickens. According
to Mr. Shafer, he has found several projectile points on gravel bars along the creek
about 50 yards upstream. He showed us one corner-notched point with a reworked
tip that he had found in this area.
In 1974, when Moore visited the area, the area was wooded and no houses
were present. The area where the site is plotted on the Atlas and the maps at
TARL is now being cultivated as a vegetable garden and part of the area contains a
metal building that houses chickens (cover photo shows site area looking
northeast). The owners were working in the garden at the time of our visit, and they
allowed the Principal Investigator to examine the exposed dirt, and no artifacts or
rocks of any kind were observed. As stated above, the majority of the area is
covered with mobile homes and metal buildings. In these areas, the water line will
probably be placed in the road. It is my opinion that there is no significant portion of
site 41WA56 remaining. Since this site was plotted on the topographic map based
on the original plotting on a highway map, it is possible that this site was not plotted
correctly.
Harmon Creek is a major stream in the area, and it appears that there was
some prehistoric activity in the area, but there is no evidence of significant deposits
within the APE that would require additional work. Therefore, it is recommended
that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Should evidence
of an archaeological site be encountered during the installation of the water line, all
work must stop until the situation can be evaluated by the THC.
