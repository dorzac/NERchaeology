INTRODUCTION
Site 41 W1.1 71 (designated the flBarker Site" after the land­
owner, Mr. Ray Bark~r) is situated on an alluvial terrace .of
the North San Gabriel· River (30°41' 53 tl N. ~ 97°.49 ' 36" W.). The
Barker Site was recorded during an initial archeological recon·
naissance of the area to be inundated by the proposed North Fork
Reservoir (Shafer and Corbin 1965: Fig. 2 and 23,24). It was
notable in that it was the only locality in the immediate area
where ceramics c·omprised part of the collection. Twenty-one pot.­
sherds, 2 dart po.ints (late Archaic forms),. 14 arrow points, and
16 end scrapers were collected from the surface (1965:24). All
material considered diagnostic is associated with late manifes­
tations of the prehistoric occupations in central Texas. Most
could be associated with the post-Archaic Toyah Focus of the
Central Texas Aspect dating from about A.D. ·1300 to historic
times (Jelks 1962: 86,87 and 89). The dart points (one each of
the types Ensor and Fairland) are recognized as late Archaic
forms; based on excavated materials from sites in nearby regions
they are estimated to date from circa 500 B.C. to 500 A.D.
(Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross 1967: Fig. 72).
The possibility that the site would yield additional
materials from the prehistoric occupations represented by the
surface collections and the absence of similar sites in the area
were the primary reasons for choosing this site for testing.
The tests liere intended to examine the subsurface deposits
to provide for an evaluation of the site's potential for more
intensive investigations in subsequent seasons.

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Barker Site is located on the front edge of an alluvial
terrace on the north side of the North San Gabriel River near
its confluence with a small, spring-fed tributary (Fig. 6).
Most of the terrace has been under recent cultivation, and
the entire terrace surface has been utilized for stock grazing.
The terrace margins appear to have been relatively undisturbed;
1

these areas currently support native grasses and scattered harci­
wood trees. The latter occur primarily at the corner of the
terrace formed by the intersection of the small tributary and
the river.

Internal Structure of the Terrace
The terraces of the North San Gabriel are in general composed
of "soil materials transported from eroded areas of upland soils
and deposited by overflow water of streams l1 (Templin, Bean,
Huckabee, Smith, and Layton 1938:39). The soil at this locality
has been identified as "Catalpa clay loam"and described as fOllows:
dark grayish-brown calcareous friable clay loam
grading into brown or light yellowish-brown cal­
careou~ friable clay loam (Templin and others
1938:39).
All profiles revealed that the dark grayish-brown soil
varied from 1-1/2 to 2 feet in thickness. The thickness of the
underlying light yellowish-brown clay loam is unknown because it
exceeded the depth of the backhoe tests made at the site.

Testing Procedure
Initially a surface collection was made in the plowed field.
The reconnaissance was intended to amplify the eXisting sample
recovered by Shafer and Corbin (1965) and to locate the area of
heaviest concentration. Collection of surface material was
limited to artifacts of known diagnostic value (i.e., projectile
points, scrapers, and potsherds) although numerous flint flakes,
mussel shell fragments, and burnt rocks were observed.

"

Adjacent to the plowed field a series of seven backhoe
trenches, averaging about 10 feet in length and 5 feet in depth,
were dug in hopes of isolating some evidence of occupation other
than that visible on the surface. Although the profiles of
several did reveal isolated burnt rocks/evidence of concentrated
subsurface cultural material was not found.
Four-hand-excavated units (each 5 x 5 feet) were dug in one­
half foot levels. Three units were dug near backhoe trench
number 2; a fourth was dug at the eastern limits of the terrace
(Fig. 6). With the exception of the latter unit all excavations
were done next to the plowed field.

Two units were dug to a depth of two feet (four o.s foot
levels); one unit was dug to a depth of one foot, and one was
dug to a depth of o.s feet. All fill was passed through one­
third inch mesh hardware cloth.

THE ARTIFACTS

Collections from the Barker Site include chipped and ground
stone artifacts, flaking debris, ceramics, and a single antler
artifact. Most of this material (except flaking debris) is from
the surface. In those excavation units next to the cultivated
field, most of the artifacts came from the upper one·half foot,
but flint flakes, a few scraper fragments, and burnt rock did
occur as deep as Level 4. In the isolated unit, limited cultural
material was collected through Level 4; however, with the excep­
tion of a single dart point, a side scraper, and a few scraper
fragments, no diagnostic artifacts were found below Levell. All
of the material from the site, including that previously collected
by Shafer and Corbin (1965:23,24) will be included in the follow­
ing discussions. Unless otherwise noted, artifacts described
here are surface finds.
Lithic Artifacts
Arrowpoints
PERDIZ (11 specimens, Fig. 1, A-E)
Seven of these specimens are well made and are modified
over the entire surface of each face. Four are rather crudely
made and retain small areas of the Hfracture plane tt of the
original flake.
The signal attributes of the Perdiz type are a contracting
stem and a pointed or rounded base. This type is defiried by Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks (1954:504). In central Texas it is included
as a trait of the Toyah Focus of the Central Texas Aspect (Suhm
1957:54-56 and Jelks 1962:86).
Five arrow point fragments were collected that are tenta·
tively identified as Perdiz. Most are medial fragments, retaining

f~aemen~ary

specimen

YOUNG (6 specimens, Fig. 1, F-I)
These sp'ecimens are crude. roughly ovate, marginally trimmed
flakes. One exhibits a face with extensive modification; the
remainder are modified only along the margins.
Young ~s defined by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954:510) and
is tentatively included with the Toyah Focus by Suhm (1957:35,
36).

CLIFFTON (3 specimens. Fig. 1, J-L)
The characteristic attributes of these specimens are the
crude workmanship. triangular shaped blades, and short pointed
stems. One is extensively modified on both faces; the remainder
retain one face with much of the original fracture plane.
Cliffton is defined as a type by Suhm~ Krieger, and Jelks
(1954:496) and linked with the Toyah Focus by Jelks (1962:86.87)
and Suhm (1957:35 and 55).
UNTYPED ARROW POINT FRAGMENTS (7 specimens)

Four are distal tips, two are medial sections, and one retains
part of the bas.e. The latter specimen has a slightly expanding
stem resembling what has been called Scallorn eddy (Shafer, Suhm,
.
and Scurlock 1964: Fig. 10, M-O).
One specimen was collected from the excavation.
Dart Points
ENSOR (1 specimen, Fig. I, M)
This side-notched specimen is missing the distal end. The
blade was apparently long, narrow, and triangular; the'base is
wider than the maximum blade width.
.
Ensor is defined by Suhm,Krieger, and Jelks (1954:422)
and is considered to be a late Archaic form. (Johnson, Suhm~ and
Tunnell 1962: Fig. 45 and Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross 1967: Fig. 12).
5

FAIRLAND (1 specimen, Fig. 1, N)
This well-made specimen is corner-notched with slight but
definite barbs. The stem is slightly expanding with a shallow,
coacave base thinned by removing wide, flat flakes from both
fac·es.

Similar specimens have been separated from the Fairland type
by Sorrow (Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross 1967:65); however. I am now
inclined to View the differences expressed in 1967 as simply
variation withln a single type. Fairland is recognized as a late
or transitional Archaic form (1967: Fig. 72).

MIscaLLAIBOUS

(2 specimens, Fig. 1, O,P)

Neither of these specimens is comparable 'to recognized types.
One (0) exhibits a narrow blade resembling a drill or awl, and
,is missiRg the distil tip. The second specimen appears unfinished.
The flake, in longitudinal cross section, fs irregular in curvature,
and despite efforts to thin the distil tip, the bulb of percussion
is still present.

retouched.
The second specimen, found in excavation, (Fig. 2,B) is
roughly oval in outline with a rounded distal end and a slightly
convex base. Marginal retouch is sparse and limited to one face.
The third specimen (Fig. Z,C) is lanceolate in outline and
is missing part of the rounded, proximal end. It is extensively
chipped on both faces, but no marginal retouch is evident •..

Biface Fragments
Out of a total of thirty-one specimens, twenty-three,
including soae lateral, medial and. distal fragments, cannot De
extensively described because of their fragmentary nature. Five
were collected from the excavation.
.
Eight fragl1lents are complete enough to suggest that the
outline was either lanceolate or oval. Four are between 3.0 em.
and 4.0 cm. wide·, and four range from 4.20cm. to 6.10 cm. One
is from the excavation.
Most of the fragments exhibit excellent workmanship and are
extensively retouched on the margins.

Miscellaneous Chipped Stone
Four crude chopper-like tools were collected (three from
the surface and one from the excavations). One is a tabular
piece of flint. that is flaked only on one end. It measured
13.4 em. by 9.78 em. by 3.10 cm.
A second specimen retains the cortex on most of one face.
It measures 12.10 cm. by 8.12 em. by 4.53 em.

A third specimen is an angular rock from which flakes
were removed along two facets in addition to the bifacial
flaking at the bit. It measures 13:;75 cm. by 5.84 cm. by 4.6 cm.
The fourth chopper-like artifact is flaked on both faces,
and heavily patinated on only one face. It is triangular in
outline, measuring 9.27 em. by 7.53 cm•. by 2.90 cm •

..

All of these specimens are crudely made'by the removal of
large, irregular flakes. Battering on the bits resulted in
some isolated hinge fractures.
.
Two small' cores were collected (one from the surface and
one from the excavations). They are angular with no consistent
patternof flake removal. One weighs' 87. 7g. and the second
weighs %29.9g.

Group 3
Nine end scrapers (Fig. 3, D-F) were made on heavy elongated
flakes. Three exhibit large areas of cortex on the dorsal sur­
face; the remainder exhibit less amounts or no cortex on the
dorsal surface. Two were made on initial cortex flakes, six on
secondary cortex flakes, and one was made on an interior flake.
Miscellaneous. (1 specimen)
One end scraper was made on an irregular flake a.nd is wider
than long. It was made on a secondary cortex flake.
Fragments,
Nine speelmens are identified as fr~gm.entary end scrapers,
only one of which came from the test excavations.

Side Scrapers
Out of a total of seventeen specimens, thirteen exhibit
flaked ed,es parallel to the long axis of the flake; the length
of the ch1pped surface varies from 2.0 cm. to S.O em. and is
usually straight to slightly convex. Four specimens have
concave chipped edges. Two of the latte,r group are notched
blades having a short notch near the proximal' or distal end,
and two exhibit long concave edges (4.5 cm. and 6.0 cm. in
length). Of the total five are fragmentary and the nature of
the complete artifact cannot be determined. Ten are secondary
cortex flakes, one is an initial cortex flake, and six are
interior flakes. Seven are from the test excavations.

Scraper Fragments
Five of the six specimens have slightly convex cutting
edges and one has a straight cutting edge. Two are initial
cortex flakes and one is a secondary cortex flake. The
remainder appear to be interior flakes. All are from the test
excavations.

FLAKE KNIFE (1 specimen, Fig. 4,C)
This specimen is ovate in outline and retains a patch of
nodular cortex on-the dorsal surface. The lateral edges
exhibit minute flake scars, usually prese:p.t only on the dorsal
surface.

Flint Flakes
Three hundred and thirty eight flakes were recovered from
the test excavations. Since the surface collection is biased
by the absence of unworked flakes it will not be considered here.
The flakes were separated on the basis of initial cortex
flakes, secondary cortex flakes, and interior flakes. Initial
cortex flakes are the first flakes removed from a core and
they retain cortex over the entire dorsal surface. Secondary
cortex flakes are removed subsequent to initial cortex flakes
and retain cortex along one or both lateral edges. Interior
flakes have no cortex on the dorsal surface but may have cortex
~n the striking platform.
Figure 1 gives a breakdown of flakes having been altered
either as scrapers, utilized flakes, or some other artifact
type, and of flakes that have not been altered in terms of the
above mentioned flake types.
Based on the presence of initial and secondary cortex flakes
it would appear that, at least on occasion, the total manufacturing

Ceramic Artifacts
A total of sixty-five potsherds were collected from the
site. The average sized sherd is around 2.0 em. by 2.Scm. '
with a maximum dimension of 5.0 cm. At l.east three and possibly
five vessels are represented. Thirty-three of the thirty-five
sherds from the excavations came from Levell. The remainder
are from the surface.

14

99'

Vessel I
Twenty-nine sherds are attributed to this vessel (Fig. 5,
A-G). Four sherds are incised. The remaining twenty-rive are
plain; one is a rim section and one is a handle. They are
included together on the basis of color, thic.kness t similarity
in paste and temper, hardness, and because many exhibit
fractures along coil junctures.
The color is a reddish brown (approximately SYR4/3 on the
Munsell Soil Col.or.Chart). There is little variation in colQrs
represented, but occasionally the interiors are more reddish
and some exterior surfaces are duller or more brownish. Thickness
ranges between 0.8 ·em. and 1.0 cm.; the average thickness was
0.88 cm. The pas'teis black and composed of' a fine sand
.
tempered with larger angular quartzite sands and fine particles
'of . ' burnt bone.. Hardness on the Mohs r scale is between 2.0 and
2." 5. Sixteen sh.erd,s :.show evidence of fi'actures along the coil
junctions (Pig •. S,B).
Vessel shapeapp~ars to be a jar (Fig. StG) with the rim
section flaring outward from the neck. The rim section is
joined to the body'. in: a gentle arc.
If all the sherds can be attributed to a single vessel,
then the decorative elements are limited to the rim section.
Decoration consists of two incised parallel lines circling the
vessel and additional incised lines intersecting the encircling
lines at a 40° to 45° angle. Panels of parallel incised lines
delineate areas on the rim with no decoration.
The small strap handle, presumably with at least one other,
was probably located somewhere on the rim section. The inclusion
of the handle with the other sherds of this vessel is based on
similarities in paste, temper, and color.
Surface finish was floated and the vessel was manufactured
by coiling.

Vessel 2
Two small brushed sherds represent this vessel. The
exterior surface is brushed, exllibiting numerous, closely
spaced t parallel, incised lines. The color of the exterior
surface is pale brOlm to brownish gray (approximately 50YR7/3
to approximately IOYR6/2 on the Munsell Soil Color Chart). The
interior surfaces are smoother and are a light yellowish-brown

GRINDING SLAB (1 specimen)
This specimen is a large tabular limestone slab. One face
is smoothed over the entire surface, with a shallow circular
depression in the approximate center. The slab is 26.0 em. long.
17.0 cm. wide, and 4.0 em. thick. The circular depression has
a diameter of about 13.0 em.

Faunal Remains
.

.

Fifty.. three fragments of bone were recovered from the test
excavations. The· bone is badly corroded and most is unidenti­
fiable. Howevet, 'the 'size of the fragments indicate most are
from a large mammal, probably deer. Most of the fragments' appear
,to, be splinters of long bones. Three of these fragments were
burned.
Identificab1e remains include two teeth, an antler tine,
and a phalange.' ,
Antler Artifact
ATLATL HOOK (1 specimen, Fig. S,H)
This specimen is missing the proximal end and has been
burned. It was made on an antler tine by cutting the proximal
end of the tine longitudinally toward the distal end.

DISCUSSION
As noted, the preponderance of cultural materiais from the
Barker Site (excluding chipping debris) are 'surface finds.
Because of the situation of recovery, it is not possible to
confidently interrelate the materials in terms of use or activity.
The paucity of subsurface materials might indicate that the
occupation was very thin and occurred on or near the surface.

18

The relationship between groups of artlfacts is;> at best
fraught with uncertainty Ii but the cohesiveness of most. surfac·e
collections from an open site such as the Barker Site is even
more difficult to demonstrate. IIowever, the fact that most of
the diagnostic artifacts present are elsewhere affiliated with
the Toyah Focus and that no other central Texas archeological
construct is well represented implies that the surface material.
is associated in at least a definitional sense.
The Toyah Focus is represented as a distinct construct at
few sites, most notable are the Blum Rockshelter (Jelks 1953:
189-207), the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962), and the Smith Rockshelter
(Suhm 1957:26-58). In all instances Perdiz and Cliffton arrow
points and pottery occur stratigraphically above Scallorn arrow
points.
End scrapers are present at all these sites, but in
surprisingly few numbers compared with the Barker Site collection.
At the Blum Rockshelter six end scrapers were found and uf
these four cwne from above the zone having only Scallorn arrow
points (Jelks 1953:201). Only one end scraper is reported from
the Kyle Site; it came from the Toyah Focus zone (Jelks 1962:87).
At the Smith Rockshelter eleven end scrapers were found. Eight
occurred in a zone containing 201 Perdiz arrow points and other
arrow points of the Toyah Focus (Suhm 1957:42).
Although all of these other sites have been extensively
occupied, end scrapers do not represent a major tool category
at any of the sites. In contrast, the Barker Site, with its
large numbers of end scrapers, shows comparatively less evi­
dence of occupation. Possibly this difference exists because
the Barker Site is an open site and the remainder are rock­
shelters, but 1 think such an argument by itself might circum­
vent the real issue, i.e., the significance of end scrapers in
terms of site function and/or areal subsistence patterns or
activities.
'
The thin occupational debris and the relatively large
number of end scrapers found here imply that the utilization
of the Barker Site was ephemeral and associated with some
activity represented by this specific tool category. End
scrapers are usually connected with hiue preparation, and if
we accept' this momentarily as a working hypotheSis at the
Barker Site, the obvious first thought is that the Barker Site
is a "hunting camp" or possibly a temporary base camp where
hunting was a primary endeavor. In this regard, we note again
that most faunal remains were the splintered long bones of
large mammals such as deer.
If so, it could be argued that the absence of end scrapers
at the three rockshelters indicate hunting was not a primary

activity at those sites. However, the faunal material for the
Toyah Focus occupations at the Kyle Site (Lundelius 1962: Table
4) and the Smith Rockshelter (Suhm 1957:53,54) indicate that
hunting was very important to residents of those sites.
Therefore, a simple "hunting camp" hypothesis seems UIl.3UP­
..'
portable. Perhaps the Barker Site was anigh1y specialized
camp concerned with hide production, an activity which may not
have been undertaken at (or at least lfithin) the rockshe1tl3rs
This question opens a unique opportunity for associating specific
economic technologies with specific site types. Alternatives
will have to be checked, and the function of end scrapers
investigated more closely--both in ethnohistoric data from central
and northern Texas and in possible wear patterns on the barker
specimens--but the unique proportion of these tools in tne site
indicate some functional difference from more typical T()yah
Focus components.

In conclusion, the Barker Site appears to have potential
.for providing important knowledge of central Texas prehistory.
Additional excavations in this site should be conducted subse­
quent to the investigation of other sites with higher priorities.
I would suggest a stripping operation as the initial phase of
renewed excavation at this site. This would allow immediate
appraisal of the" area for occupational features such as hearths,
living surfaces, and possibly postholes from temporary shelters.
