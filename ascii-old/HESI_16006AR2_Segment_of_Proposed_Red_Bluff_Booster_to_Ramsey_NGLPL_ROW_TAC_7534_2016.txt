MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 21 January 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of a 0.6-mile (1.0-kilometer [km])-long segment of Anadarko
Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline
right-of-way (ROW) located in northwestern Reeves County, Texas (Project Area). The
development of the pipeline ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal
permitting or coordination. However, a 0.6-mile (1.0-km)-long segment of the proposed ROW is
located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered
to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of the undertaking on GLO property falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on
behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if
the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 7534.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 3.9 miles (6.3 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1
meters [m]) wide with a total area of approximately 14.2 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses GLO property) measures only 0.6 miles (1.0
km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of approximately 2.2 acres.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 11
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline ROW across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of a 0.6-mile
(1.0-kilometer [km])-long segment of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed
Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located in northwestern
Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The development of the pipeline
ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination.
However, a 0.6-mile (1.0-km)-long segment of the proposed ROW is located on property owned
by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision
of the state, the portion of the undertaking on GLO property falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project
Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 3.9 miles (6.3 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1
meters [m]) wide with a total area of approximately 14.2 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses GLO property) measures only 0.6 miles (1.0
km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of approximately 2.2 acres.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator,
while Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist) and Stefan Barker (archeological field
technician) conducted the field investigations. The cultural resources investigations were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 7534.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 21 January 2016. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the surface of the
Project Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a

minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide. As the Project Area totals 0.6 miles (1.0 km) in length, a minimum of 10 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 11 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 11
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline ROW across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Anadarko’s proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline ROW is located in
northwestern Reeves County, approximately 8.5 miles (13.7 km) northwest of Orla, Texas. It
can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Screwbean Draw NE, Texas
topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 3.9
miles (6.3 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of approximately 14.2 acres.
However, the Project Area (i.e., the segment of the proposed ROW that crosses GLO property)
measures only 0.6 miles (1.0 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of
approximately 2.2 acres. Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural
resources survey are presented in Figures 2-1 and 2-2.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in northwestern Reeves County in far West Texas. It is
situated within an area of gently undulating desert hills south of China Draw (see Figure 1-1).
Elevations within the Project Area are generally level at 2980.0 feet (908.3 m) above mean sea
level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Pecos River basin. It is drained to
the north by overland sheet flow into China Draw. China Draw flows northeasterly, emptying
into Red Bluff Reservoir on the Pecos River approximately 3.8 miles (6.2 km) northeast of the
Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of 46.0
degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of 83.0°F.
The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with roughly
70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 2016a).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair notes that portions of
Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now drained by the
Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the Chihuahuan Deserts
ecoregion, the Project Area is situated within geologic formations comprised of sand sheet and
caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities dominate the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland.
The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline playa margins plant
community include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp. (seepweed), Salicornia
spp. (pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The dominant species associated
with the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia
spp. (blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s jointfir). The dominant species associated
with the desert shrubland plant community include Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia
cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca), Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia
rigidula (blackbrush), Cylindropuntia leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla
(lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the Paleoindian (pre-8500 BP),
the Archaic (8500 to 1250 BP), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 BP). The Archaic period
is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000 BP to
3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 BP)

The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early Paleoindian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 BP)

Like the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.

HJN 160006 AR 02

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 BP)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increases, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 BP)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence is focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 BP)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the
recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices
also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2016). Similarly, a
review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google
Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the
review perimeter (NPS 2016). No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the
NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources
surveys have been undertaken within the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite.
This site, 41CU800, is located approximately 4.2 miles (6.8 km) northwest of the Project Area.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
Project Area on an elevated landform adjacent to Chana Draw, it was Horizon’s opinion, prior to
the field efforts, that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased potential
for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on 21 January 2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing across the surface of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide.
As the Project Area totals 0.6 miles (1.0 km) in length, a minimum of 10 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 11 shovel tests across the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD
83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in
Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 21 January 2016, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of a 0.6mile (1.0-km)-long segment of Anadarko’s proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8”
pipeline ROW located in northwestern Reeves County, Texas. The development of the pipeline
ROW will be privately funded and will not require any federal permitting or coordination.
However, a 0.6-mile (1.0-km)-long segment of the proposed ROW is located on property owned
by the GLO. As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the portion of
the undertaking on GLO property falls under the regulations of the ACT. At the request of
Whitenton, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as SALs. The cultural resources survey was conducted under TAC permit number
7534.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 3.9 miles (6.3 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m)
wide with a total area of approximately 14.2 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e., the segment
of the proposed ROW that crosses GLO property) measures only 0.6 miles (1.0 km) long by
30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of approximately 2.2 acres.
The cultural resources survey consisted of intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing across the surface of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16
shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the
Project Area totals 0.6 miles (1.0 km) in length, a minimum of 10 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 11 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 11
excavated shovel tests.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Red Bluff Booster to Ramsey NGL 8” pipeline ROW across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
