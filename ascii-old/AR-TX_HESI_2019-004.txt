MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2018 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for five proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power
Control District (RBWPCD) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included
well pads, access roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs). All five projects were privately
funded and did not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the RBWPCD is
considered to be a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the portions of the five projects on
RBWPCD property all fell under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the
request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys
of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. Overall, these surveys
assessed approximately 25.8 acres of RBWPCD property. The purpose of the surveys was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the five Project Areas and, if any
existed, to determine if the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural
resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8466.
The cultural resources surveys of the five Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
1 new archeological site. Site 41RV169 was documented as a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter
within Anadarko’s Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H/3H & Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 1H/2H/3H Remote
Production Pad Project. The presence of early stage lithic flaking debris and the absence of
any formal tools, fire-cracked rock (FCR), or cultural features on the site suggest that it
functioned as a lithic procurement area rather than a campsite. The boundaries of the site were
only documented within the limits of the current Project Area, and the site’s deposits could
continue for a currently undefined distance to the north. As such, the full horizontal extent of
site 41RV169 was not assessed, and its overall SAL eligibility status remains undetermined.
However, based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of
buried, stratified cultural deposits; 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site;
and 4) the lack of any preserved floral/faunal remains, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion
of site 41RV169 within the boundaries of the current Project Area is a non-contributing element
to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site.

Management Summary

In addition to the prehistoric materials observed on site 41RV169, debris associated with
a historic-era roadside refuse dump was noted on the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H-3H and Threadfin
57-1-38 Unit 1H Well Pad. However, as this debris was merely a roadside dump and not
associated with any obvious occupation in the immediate area, it was not formally documented
as an archeological site. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the other 3
assessed locations or within any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. The THC concurred with these recommendations for all
five projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2018 calendar year for five proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD) in
Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All five projects were privately funded and
did not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the RBWPCD is considered
to be a political subdivision of the State, the portions of the five projects on RBWPCD property
fell under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural
resources survey of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the five
Project Areas and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8466.
The five Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2018 included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) that were located in whole or in part on tracts of land
owned by the RBWPCD. The well pads are typically constructed by leveling each area by
bulldozing the higher elevations and using that material to fill the lower elevations. Additional fill
may be brought in if necessary. The well pads often have associated reserve pits to contain
liquids associated with or produced by the well drilling. Reserve pit construction typically
consists of the excavation of pit several feet deep that is then lined with a polyethylene liner.
Access road construction consists of the bulldozing (cutting and filling) of the alignment and may
also include the capping of the alignment with caliche or other forms of road base. Pipeline
construction efforts consist of the clearing of each ROW of vegetation via heavy machinery
followed by the excavation of the pipeline trench measuring several feet wide and excavated
down to depths around 6.0 feet (1.8 meters [m]) below surface. Only the portions of each
project situated on RBWPCD land were assessed under TAC annual permit number 8466.
These included the entirety of certain projects and only portions of others. Overall, these
surveys assessed approximately 25.8 acres of RBWPCD property. Each of the five projects is
listed in Table 1-1, along with its map identifier in Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports
prepared for each project, as well as the individual responses from the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), are presented in Appendix A.

The cultural resources investigations for each of the five projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s
president) served as the project’s principal investigator, while Jacob Lyons, Foster Duncan,
Jared Wiersema, and Steven Schooler conducted the field investigations at various times in
2018 and early 2019.
The cultural resources surveys of the five Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
1 new archeological site. Site 41RV169 was documented as a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter
within Anadarko’s Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H/3H & Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 1H/2H/3H Remote
Production Pad Project. The presence of early stage lithic flaking debris and the absence of
any formal tools, fire-cracked rock (FCR), or cultural features on the site suggest that it
functioned as a lithic procurement area rather than a campsite. The boundaries of the site were
only documented within the limits of the current Project Area, and the site’s deposits could
continue for a currently undefined distance to the north. As such, the full horizontal extent of
site 41RV169 was not assessed, and its overall SAL eligibility status remains undetermined.
However, based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of
buried, stratified cultural deposits; 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site;
and 4) the lack of any preserved floral/faunal remains, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion
of site 41RV169 within the boundaries of the current Project Area is a non-contributing element
to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site.
In addition to the prehistoric materials observed on site 41RV169, debris associated with
a historic-era roadside refuse dump was noted on the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H-3H and Threadfin
57-1-38 Unit 1H Well Pad. However, as this debris was merely a roadside dump and not
associated with any obvious occupation in the immediate area, it was not formally documented
as an archeological site. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the other 3
assessed locations or within any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or

considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery. The
THC concurred with these recommendations for all five projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The five Anadarko projects on RBWPCD land that were assessed in 2018 are all located
in northwestern Reeves County, Texas on the southwestern side of Red Bluff Reservoir. They
all can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red Bluff, Texas, topographic
quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1; also see individual interim reports in Appendix A). The five
projects include 1 pipeline/flowline ROW, 3 well pads with associated access road ROWs, and 1
production pad. Each of these five projects is summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The five Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Salt Creek, its tributaries, and tributaries of the Pecos River.
Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all five of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin. All
are located to the west or southwest of the Red Bluff Reservoir on elevated landforms
overlooking the Pecos River. All are drained to the east or northeast by overland sheet flow in
to the reservoir.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The five Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all
of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950).
Blair notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprising sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum
frutescens) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY

3.1

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. to
3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.) subperiods.
3.1.1

PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.
3.1.2

Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces

HJN 160006 AR 101

9

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.
3.1.3

Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.
3.1.4

Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.
3.1.5

Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.
3.1.6

Historic (250 B.P. to Present)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented, due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of 3 Jumano
Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to have
irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the region
noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the 1870s
that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the 20th century, state law
permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the region.
By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in the

numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the only
2 towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s saw the
expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407 residents. By
the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and agriculture. In the early
2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

3.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The northwestern region of Reeves County has undergone extensive archaeological
surveys in the last 60 years, with the majority having been completed since the mid-1980s.
Most of these archaeological projects included Phase I and II subsurface investigations in
support of oil and gas extraction projects. These investigations were undertaken along pipeline
corridors and well pads for companies such as Anadarko, El Paso Natural Gas Company, and
All American Pipeline. Archaeological surveys were completed by environmental engineering
firms such as Horizon, SWCA, Inc., and Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, as well
as from academic institutions such as the Cultural Resource Management Division from New
Mexico State University.
The archaeological sites recorded in Reeves County demonstrate a wide range of Native
American historic and prehistoric material culture, with noteworthy examples of skilled artistic
expression in both pictographs and petroglyphs, as well as in the form of richly decorated clay
vessels, and other ritual and ceremonial objects depicted in media such as exotic shell, bone, or
rare stone, such as turquoise, malachite, and kaolinite (O’Laughlin and Black 2019). The
temporal range of these cultures spans from Paleoindian, through the Archaic, and into the
Contact period. Many of the sites consist of prehistoric lithic scatters, burned rock middens
containing fire-cracked rock (FCR), hearth features with faunal remains, and ceramic sherd
assemblages. The distinct archaeological tradition Jornada Mogollon existed in the region from
roughly A.D. 400- 1500 (Lehmer 1948). These peoples practiced sedentary lifeways, including
an emphasis on cultigen intensification, such as maize and squash. The Jornada Mogollon, a
part of the Pueblo complex, lived in pithouse villages (Whalen 1981) and produced skilled
ceramic techniques such as El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-White, and Playas Red
incised (O’Laughlin 2001). All of these ceramic styles favor the Casas Grandes (Paquime)
culture artistic style to the south near Chihuahua, Mexico (Lehmer 1958). These shared artistic
types demonstrate extensive trade networks in and out of the Reeves County area. Later
historic tribes in the region included the Jumanos, Apache, and Comanches.
The Red Bluff Reservoir region in northwestern Reeves County contains several
archaeological sites, which are exceptional and notable to mention. Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric petroglyphs occur at 41LV1, also known as Jackson’s Petroglyph Site. This site and
many others within close proximity occur in Loving County just north and northwest of Red Bluff
Reservoir. However, the lake’s south end and southwest region has yielded very few artifacts
and features. Site 41RV169 includes a low-intensity lithic scatter, site 41LV22 includes lithic
debris, as well as two bifaces and mussel shells, and site 41RV130 contains several hearth
features, lithic debitage, and a broken mano. Farther to the southwest of the reservoir, and

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and via the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of the five Project
Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys in the
area, none of the five Project Areas had documented cultural resources within the 1.0-mile (1.6
km) review perimeters. The results of the archival research conducted for each of the five
projects are presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A 1- to 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the five separate
Project Areas at various times in 2018 and early 2019. The survey efforts typically entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For
projects between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which included most of the well pads, the Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests
per acre. For linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all of the
assessed pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per mile. Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all of the five Project Areas. The number of
shovel tests excavated within each Project Area are presented in Table 4-1. The specific
methodology for each of the five projects is presented within the associated interim reports in
Appendix A. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were completed and filed at the TARL for permanent housing. Similarly, for any
previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated site forms were completed
and filed at the TARL.

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld Global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations and shovel test data are presented within the
associated interim reports in Appendix A.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at TARL in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

2018 Annual Report: Cultural Resources Surveys Conducted for Five Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Projects on Red Bluff Water Power Control District Property in Reeves County, Texas

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources surveys of the five Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
1 new archeological site. Site 41RV169 was documented as a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter
within Anadarko’s Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H/3H & Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 1H/2H/3H Remote
Production Pad Project. The presence of early stage lithic flaking debris and the absence of
any formal tools, FCR, or cultural features on the site suggest that it functioned as a lithic
procurement area rather than a campsite. The boundaries of the site were only documented
within the limits of the current Project Area, and the site’s deposits could continue for a currently
undefined distance to the north. As such, the full horizontal extent of site 41RV169 was not
assessed, and its overall SAL eligibility status remains undetermined. However, based on: 1)
the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural
deposits; 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site; and 4) the lack of any
preserved floral/faunal remains, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41RV169 within
the boundaries of the current Project Area is a non-contributing element to the overall SAL
eligibility status of the site.
In addition to the prehistoric materials observed on site 41RV169, debris associated with
a historic-era roadside refuse dump was noted on the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H-3H and Threadfin
57-1-38 Unit 1H Well Pad. However, as this debris was merely a roadside dump and not
associated with any obvious occupation in the immediate area, it was not formally documented
as an archeological site. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the other 3
assessed locations or within any of the excavated shovel tests. The results for each of the five
separate Project Areas are summarized in Table 5-1.
Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery. The

Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 1H and 2H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8466
HJN 160006 AR 85

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit
1H and 2H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 4). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located
on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD). As the RBWPCD
is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on RBWPCD property
and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on
sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8466.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.0 miles (8.1 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a 4.6-acre well pad
and an access road right-of-way (ROW) that measures approximately 930.0 feet (283.5 meters
[m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (approximately 0.6 acre). Overall, the Project Area totals
approximately 5.2 acres.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic scatter. This
site, 41LV22, is located approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) southeast of the Project Area in Loving
County.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 26
June 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel
tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size.
As the well pad portion of the Project Area totals approximately 4.6 acres, a minimum of 9
shovel tests were necessary within this portion of the Project Area. In addition, the TSMASS
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) in width. As the proposed access road portion of the Project Area measures
approximately 930.0 feet (283.5 m) in length, a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary along
this portion of the Project Area. In all, a minimum of 12 shovel tests were necessary across the
entire Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 15 shovel tests
within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter
[mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
15 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bluegill
57-1-38 Unit 1H and 2H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 1H Flowline, Lift Gas, and Fiber Optic Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8466
HJN 160006 AR 86

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit
1H Flowline, Lift Gas, and Fiber Optic Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD).
As the RBWPCD is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is
regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group
(Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on
RBWPCD property and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8466.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.0 miles (8.1 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a right-of-way (ROW)
that measures approximately 3710.0 feet (1130.8 meters [m]) long by 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide.
Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 4.3 acres.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2018). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic scatter. This
site, 41LV22, is located approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) southeast of the Project Area in Loving
County.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above the floodplain of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 26
June 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel
tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the Project Area measures approximately 3710.0 feet (1130.8 m) in length, a
minimum of 11 shovel tests were necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded
the TSMASS by excavating a total of 12 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
12 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bluegill
57-1-38 Unit 1H Flowline, Lift Gas, and Fiber Optic Project will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 calendar year.

Map Review
An old 2-track roadbed extends across the Project Area from its southeastern corner to its
northwestern corner (see Figure 2). This old ranch road is visible on aerial imagery dating back
as early as 1967. This roadbed is the only manmade feature on the available aerial imagery,
with no evidence of any structures or ranching related features adjacent to it in the immediate
vicinity of the current Project Area. This roadbed is not present on any of the available
topographic quadrangles that date back as early as 1925. With this in mind, there is no obvious
historic-era occupation or ranching related feature within or immediately adjacent to the Project
Area on any of the reviewed map or imagery sources.

Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for

Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist assessed the Project Area on 29 November 2018. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per
acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As the Project Area totals
approximately 7.4 acres, a minimum of 15 shovel tests were necessary to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 15 shovel tests within the Project
Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of
the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table
2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the observation of scattered
historic-era refuse within the northwestern corner of the Project Area (Figure 7). The observed
materials appear to represent a portion of a roadside dump of historic-era domestic debris.
Materials within the dump consisted of primarily of food containers and dish fragments (Figures
8 through 11). The following text is a description of the materials provided by Steven Schooler,
the field archeologist who conducted the assessment of the Project Area on behalf of Horizon.

The historic scatter has at its heart a small but dense cluster of several dozen
steel cans intermixed with various condiment jars, ceramics, and other items of
household refuse. The main concentration measures approximately 9.8 feet (3.0
m) in diameter, with a diminishing concentration of debris in the surrounding 32.8
feet (10.0 m). Other debris is scattered much more widely across the area, with
smaller sub-concentrations of several cans and/or glass containers in several
locations. A fairly continuous distribution of historic debris of the same
approximate age suggests it to all be related. The distribution does not appear to
correlate directly to any existing current or historic roads - the main concentration
is rather isolated - but also does not seem to be linked to any existing structures,
ruins, or foundations (survey of a broader area could reveal a nearby historic
dwelling or ranching features, however).
A camp fire ring or "cowboy hearth" consisting of seven larger stones was found
forming a rough circle, near to a couple of the smaller concentrations of cans. It
measures about 4.3 feet (1.0 m) in diameter.
Cans noted within the main cluster and surrounding area include several solderdot vent-hole type cans (post 1900), sanitary cans with crimped edges (post
1904), rectangular sardine type cans with key-wind openings, oval tins, a Log
Cabin syrup tin (1897 to 1940s), larger cans (that do not appear to be pails), a
cone-top beer can (post 1935), spice tins, and a possible kerosene or fuel can.
Tobacco tins were not noted. A smaller type of Coors beer can, opened with a
church key (post 1935), was found along the south edge of the Project Area and
may be more directly related to the more proximate county road. Based on can
types and manufacture, an age from the 1930s-40s is speculated (Waechter
2010).
Typical can sizes noted included:
6.5 x 6 inches
4 x 3 inches (solder dot cans appear to all be this size)
6.5 or 6 5/8 x 6 inches
4.5 x x3.25 inches
5.5 x 5 inches
7 x 6 inches
Glass objects included at least 5 whiskey bottles or flasks, including one fully
intact bottle of brown glass, 2 fully intact clear bottles (one marked Old Quaker
brand with a white metal screw-top lid, the other marked "Federal law forbids sale
or re-use of this bottle" – 1935 to 1964), and 2 clear bottles broken into many
pieces at the same location. Numerous glass condiment bottles and jars were
within the main concentration, including examples that appear to have held
ketchup, mustard, pepper sauce, and other uncertain contents. A glass drinking
tumbler and part of a green glass bowl were also noted. The neck of a glass milk

HJN 160006 AR 91

Page 15

bottle was also found closer to the south edge of the Project Area, more isolated
from most of the debris (SHA 2019).
Dishware included several pieces of broken whiteware, including pieces with
scalloped edges and floral design, a saucer and teacup with embossed floral
decoration (of different types), and fragments of a teacup with floral transfer
decoration. Other ceramics include fragments of a tan-glazed bowl decorated
with white and brown lines and a fragmentary milk glass Mentholatum jar.
A rectangular metal plate with clover-like tri-lobed holes in the corners was one of
the more interesting items, with the wording "NCR Co. Billy Light" surrounding a
central opening spanned by a raised strip of metal. One side of the object is
upturned at an angle. Function is unknown but has the appearance of a possible
hinge or light switch plate. Other objects include a smashed tin pail (made of
actual tin) with a steel handle, a bundle of numerous thin metal strips with fibers
wound around them that may be part of a battery or electrical component, and
the green enameled hood to a kerosene or oil lantern. In addition, 3 weathered
milled lumber boards were noted away from most of the scatter, as well as short
segment of board with a hole bored through it within the scatter.
The primary concentration of the historic-era refuse dump is located just outside (northwest) of
the northwestern corner of the Project Area, and the materials within the actual limits of the
Project Area appear to be secondary scatter around the fringes of the main dump (see Figure
7). Recalling that a visible 2-track ranch road extends across the Project Area from its
southeastern corner to its northwestern corner, and recalling that no obvious signs of historicera occupation or ranching activities are visible on available maps and imagery of the location,
the observed refuse dump appears to represent an isolated roadside trash dump in the desert
that dates to the 1930s. As this is an isolated refuse dump with no obvious association with an
occupation or ranching site, and because the materials within the Project Area appear to
represent peripheral scatter away from the main dump location outside of the Project Area, it
was not formally recorded as a historic-era archeological site or assigned a formal trinomial.
All cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area, and no evidence of
subsurface cultural deposits was noted within any of the 15 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the lack of formally documented archeological sites within the Project Area, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H-3H and Threadfin 57-1-38
Unit 1H Well Pad Projects will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources
designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends
that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial
features are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing

maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and the
RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

For Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 4H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8466
HJN 160006 AR 95

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit
4H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 5). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located
on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD). As the RBWPCD
is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on RBWPCD property
and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on
sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8466.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.5 miles (12.1 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of an approximately 5.3acre well pad and 2 access road rights-of-way (ROW) that total approximately 761.0 feet (232.0
meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (approximately 0.6 acre). Overall, the Project Area
totals approximately 5.8 acres.

According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, there is a 24-inch (61.0 centimeter [cm])
elevation difference across the pad area. As a result, pad construction will consist of 12.0
inches (30.5 cm) of cutting and 12.0 inches (30.5 cm) of filling to create a level well pad.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite with
associated petroglyphs. This site, 41LV1, is located approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northeast
of the Project Area in Loving County.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
Steven Schooler, a Horizon archeological subconsultant, assessed the portion of the Project
Area on 1 and 2 February 2019. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation
of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0
and 10.0 acres in size. As the well pad portion of the Project Area totals approximately 5.3
acres, a minimum of 11 shovel tests were necessary within this portion of the Project Area. In
addition, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the proposed access road portions of the
Project Area measure approximately 761.0 feet (232.0 m) in length, a minimum of 2 shovel tests
were necessary along these portions of the Project Area. In all, a minimum of 13 shovel tests
were necessary across the entire Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating
a total of 17 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
17 excavated shovel tests.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 13
February 2019. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size.
As the overall Project Area totals approximately 3.1 acres, a minimum of 6 shovel tests were
necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total
of 8 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric lithic scatter within the Project Area. This site, 41RV169, is summarized below.
Site 41RV169
General Description
Site 41RV169 is a newly recorded prehistoric lithic scatter that covers the majority of the
production pad portion of the Project Area (Figures 8 and 9). It is situated on the crest and
northern slope of a desert upland that overlooks Red Bluff Reservoir to the north. Vegetation
across the site includes mesquite, yucca, ephedra, creosote, pencil cholla, prickly pear, short
grasses, and other sparse thorny brush species (Figures 10 and 11). The surface of the site has
been disturbed by an active pipeline ROW to the south, gravel roads to the west, as well as
small mammal burrowing and natural wind/water erosion across its surface.

All UTM coordinates are located in Zone 14 and utilize the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).

cmbs = Centimeters below surface

ST = Shovel test

UTM = Universal Transverse Mercator

Surface visibility across the site ranged from 80% to 100%. A total of 8 shovel tests were
excavated across this site within the Project Area. All 8 produced negative results for
subsurface cultural materials.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41RV169 consisted of roughly 20 specimens of lithic
debitage (mostly primary and secondary flakes), 1 utilized flake, 1 crude biface, and 1 core
(Figures 12 through 14). No formal tools or fire-cracked rock (FCR) specimens were noted on
the site that would reflect the use of the location as a campsite. Rather, the presence of
available gravels on the erosional surface of the site and the number of specimens reflecting the
early stages of the lithic reduction process suggest that the location likely served as source of
raw lithic materials.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the surface of site 41RV169, and no evidence of any
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the assessed horizontal extent of the
site measures approximately 278.9 feet (85.0 m) north to south by 278.9 feet (55.0 m) east to
west. The site was only documented within the limits of the current Project Area and its
deposits could continue for an undefined distance to the north. As such, its full horizontal extent
was not assessed.
All observed cultural materials were noted on the erosional surface of the site. No evidence of
subsurface cultural deposits was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Summary
Site 41RV169 was documented as a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter on the crest and northern
slope of a desert upland that overlooks Red Bluff Reservoir to the north. A variety of gravels on
the erosional surface of the site provided a source of raw lithic material that was exploited by the
aboriginal occupants of the region. This is evidenced by the variety of early stage lithic flaking

debris scattered over the surface of the site. The absence of any formal tools, FCR, or cultural
features on the site suggested that it did not double as a campsite.
The boundaries of the site were only documented within the limits of the current Project Area,
and the site’s deposits could continue for a currently undefined distance to the north. As such,
the full horizontal extent of site 41RV169 was not assessed, and its overall SAL eligibility status
remains undetermined. However, based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural
deposits; 2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and 3) the lack of any temporally
diagnostic materials on the site; and the lack of any preserved floral/faunal remains, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41RV169 within the boundaries of the current Project
Area is a non-contributing element to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that no additional investigations are warranted on site
41RV169 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.
Recommendations
Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41RV169 within the boundaries of the current
Project Area is a non-contributing element to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit 2H/3H & Threadfin 57-1-38
Unit 1H/2H/3H Remote Production Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8466 during the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Dear Russ Brownlow:
Thank you for your submittal regarding the above-referenced project. This response represents the comments of
the Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), pursuant to review under the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
The review staff led by Drew Sitters and Caitlin Brashear has completed its review and has made the following
determinations based on the information submitted for review:
Above-Ground Resources
• No historic properties are present or affected by the project as proposed. However, if historic
properties are discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties are found, work should cease in
the immediate area; work can continue where no historic properties are present. Please contact the
THC’s History Programs Division at 512-463-5853 to consult on further actions that may be necessary
to protect historic properties.
Archeology Comments
• THC/SHPO concurs with information provided .
• Property/properties are not eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks .
• THC has comments on the draft report submitted to this office for review .
We have the following comments: We concur that site 41RV169 is ineligible within the boundaries of the
current Project Area due to a lack of chronometric data potential, and a lack of horizontal or vertical data
potential. In future Interim Reports please: 1) Identify the Principal Investigator. You can add this title below
your signature towards the end of the report; and 2) Identify the repository where project generated
documentation will be curated. This can be incorporated into paragraph two, where you discus compiling a
formal report.
