ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORY AND
PLAINS ARCHEOLOGY 1
RUDOLPH c. TROIKE
The use of ethnological concepts in archeology is certainly
not new. Diffusion and the taxonomic approach were well
developed by cultural anthropologists before being taken
over into archeology. However, more abstract conceptual
tools have not been adopted so readily. When such concepts
have been employed, it is often without a clear idea of their
nature. To make them more available for use, it is necessary
first that they be understood.
One such concept is acculturation. It has been very profitable in the study of modern culture contacts. Only a few
workers have applied it to the study of archeological remains, yet there is an unrivalled opportunity in archeology
to study acculturation as it has occurred between nonWestern cultures in the past. Even these occasional studies
reflect the increasing awareness among archeologists of the
responsibility they bear to the rest of anthropology.
The neglect of the important concept of acculturation can
be laid to two factors. Many have tended to confuse it
with diffusion, and not see it as a useful independent tool.
Also, to study acculturation from material remains, it is
first necessary to apply the "conjunctive approach" and
express archeological information in ethnological terms.
These difficulties must be bridged to encourage wider use
of the acculturation concept.
In order to establish the value of acculturation as a tool
of archeological research, it will be necessary to clarify
the distinctions and relations between diffusion and acculturation. When this has been done, it then remains to demonstrate these differences through an analysis of some
problem, emphasizing first diffusion, then acculturation.

This procedure is significant, since the test of a concept
lies in its application. The problem chosen for examination
here concerns the effects of culture contacts on a series of
Central Plains groups which moved south into Texas and
Oklahoma approximately during the 12th and 13th centuries.
Diffusion and acculturation are properly parts of a larger
subject, culture change. Before they can be profitably discussed, some basic working definitions must be formulated.
"Diffusion" summarizes a whole set of statements about
observed phenomena and their results. Ethnologists have
described the transfer of artifacts from one area to another
through a series of individual exchanges. A set of such
activities, taken together, is said to constitute a pmcess of
diffusion. A concept, on the other hand, organizes observed
phenomena in a meaningful way. An archeologist discovering two similar artifact types some distance apart must
infer the whole sequence of interactions which together
account for the observed distribution. Diffusion, therefore,
conceptualizes the distribution of culture elements in space
and time as the end product of cultural transmission between groups in contact (either directly or indirectly).
The concept of acculturation derives from the view that
cultures are structured wholes whose contents are organized
or related through patterns or systems integrated to form
cultural universes. When foreign elements or patterns are
introduced as a result of contact, an imbalance may be
produced in the existing system. This initiates a process
of change in the structures or their functional links; this
is the process of acculturation. Therefore, acculturation formalizes the concept of change in sociocultural systems as
a process resulting from contact between culturally differentiated groups.
There is evident in the literature a considerable measure
of disagreement over where and how to draw a dividing
line between diffusion and acculturation. Willey (1952)
suggests the compound "diffusion-acculturation" to com-

promise the conflicting statements of theorists. Among these,
Herskovits (1938) has called diffusion "accomplished acculturation," while Linton (1940: 470, 479) has described diffusion as an "aspect of acculturation." Thus the first considers
acculturation to be a process leading to diffusion, while the
second regards diffusion as a process producing acculturation. This apparant paradox can be resolved only by an
understanding of the relative significance of the two concepts.
The statements of both Herskovits and Linton seem to
assume that a fixed relationship between the two processes
has been established by their very definitions. Such an
assumption does not hold good. Quite the contrary, no
fixed and invariable status can be assigned to either, but
rather a statement of their relations is needed. Treated
separately, each concept is independent and coordinate
with the other. However, when either diffusion or acculturation becomes the focal point in the course of a study
on culture change, the other is reduced to a subordinate
process. The crucial thing, then, is where the focus of
interest lies.
There remain certain prevalent ideas about the differences in diffusion and acculturation which should be dealt
with. These ideas are largely responsible for the confused
question: "Is this an instance of diffusion or acculturation?"
This is evoked by frequent attempts to establish some
quantitative distinction between the two processes, such as
length and number of contacts, or extent of modification
in borrowed traits. It is often said that the adoption of
several traits constitutes diffusion, but a large number of
borrowed traits makes acculturation. It could be pointed
out that the steel axe alone produced extensive acculturation
in some cultures, while a study of diffusion might well
take in the whole Mississippian Culture Pattern. Moreover,
no maximum or minimum scale exists to separate diffusion
and acculturation, nor has any objective weighting of
traits been established.

116

Texas Archeological Society

Quimby and Spoehr (1953) have used "acculturation" to
mean modification either in form or use of an artifact in
a new cultural context. Since material objects are not properly part of culture, this usage seems legitimate only if the
artifacts are taken as reflecting acculturative changes in
the cuiture patterns to which the objects have been introduced.
A second important consideration is the purpose of the
investigation. This will determine which process is to be
primary and which subordinate. A diffusion study is historically oriented, and is concerned with the spread of
traits or complexes from culture to culture through space
and time. The history of the bow in North America is an
example; the numerous cases of acculturation are only
background to the larger historical picture of diffusion.
However, an acculturation study is concerned with structural-functional integration of borrowed traits, either from
the view of the trait and its new cultural context, or from
the view of the cultural alterations set in motion by the
adoption of the new trait. A documentation of the trait's
diffusion is only a historical preface to the acculturation
study. The following may serve to illustrate the preceding
discussion:

Ethnologists and archeologists have a common basic tool
in the trait list. It permits extended comparisons to be
made as the initial step in the study of either diffusion or
acculturation. Depending on what traits and how many are
shared by two cultures, it is possible to infer borrowing
through contact or common historical origin. In analyzing
the problem selected for demonstration of the differences
in diffusion and acculturation studies, the first step must
therefore be the collection and comparison of trait lists.

T exas Archeological Society

Donald Lehmer (1954: 139-140) has compiled a list of
traits characteristic of what he has termed the "Plains
Village Pattern." He states that "these traits, many of them
decidedly generalized, appear as the warp of all the village
cultures of the Plains. Specific modifications of these traits,
occurring in combination with other and distinctive traits,
have definitely limited distributions in time and space."
Within this largest and most general complex, he has specified three basic variants: the Central Plains, the Middle
Missouri, and the Coalescent Traditions. Wesley Hurt (1953:
54) has amended "tradition" to "phase." The principal
aspect of the Central Plains Phase is the Upper Republican,
for which Krieger (1946: 270) has suggested a date of 1100
A.D. for its "patternization."

Plains Village Pattern
(Lehmer 1954: 139-140)
1. Subsistence based about equally on hunting and agriculture.

2. Semi-permanent villages.
3. Villages located adjacent to floodplains of large rivers.
4. Semi-subterranean earth lodges with entryways.
5. Undercut and straight-sided cache pits in and between
the houses.
6. Grit-tempered pottery with paddle-marked bodies and
cord- or tool-impressed decoration.
7. Small, light projectile points.
8. Chipped end-scrapers.
9. Hoe blades of bison scapulae.
10. Bone hide-dressing tools.
Hurt (1953: 51) adds "plain-surfaced pottery" to this list
and suggests that "earth lodges" should be reduced to phase
level, since they seem to lack universality. He has compiled
the following list from Lehmer (1954).

Anthropological Theory and Plai ns Archeology

119

Central Plains Phase
(Hurt 1953: 54)
1. Square houses, rounded corners, four primary posts set
in a square around a central firepit, entrance to the
east or west.
2. Ossuary burial, occasional individual inhumations.
3. Grit-tempered pots, bodies plain or cord-roughened,
flared or collared rims, decoration tool-impressed
(cord-impressed in the Sweetwater focus) .
4. Villages small, unfortified; houses arranged in no apparent order.
5. Arrowpoints with base notches, multiple side notches.
6. Diamond-shaped beveled knives.
7. Chipped celts.
8. Equal-arm (stone) elbow pipes
9. Bone awls generally made of deer cannon bones.
10. Single-hole arrowshaft wrenches of bone and antler.
11. Figurines of baked clay.
These traits give an outline of the cultures existing in
the Great Plains between the 12th and 16th centuries. At
the southern borders of the plains, in Texas and Oklahoma,
contemporaneous manifestations of similar character have
been found. Each one shares some traits with adjacent
circum-Plains traditions. A number of cultures on both sides
of the southern frontier of Plains expansion have been
chosen for comparison with one another and wi~h the
culture of the Central Plains hearth. The list used herein
(Table II) is based on functi onal groupings used by Krieger
(1946) and the revised versions by V. Watson (1950) and
Gallaher (1951). The cultures are arranged in geographical
order to give a picture of trait-distributions. Table I summarizes essential data on the cultures compared.

120

Texas Archeological Society

Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) have recently adjusted
age-estimates for the Gibson and Edwards Plateau Aspects
(Table I). The terminal dates for these complexes are now
set at 1200 and 1000 A.D. respectively. However, this shift
has left some disjunctions with certain established datings.
Antelope Creek and Upper Republican have been crossdated by Pueblo trade sherds (Wedel 1947: 153; Krieger
1946: 47, 143-144) and cannot be pushed much earlier than
1200 A.D.; Henrietta Focus has been placed at 1400-1600
A.D. by similar means, even in the latest estimate (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks 1954: 87). The close of Edwards Plateau
Aspect (or the start of Central Texas Aspect) is thus set
200-400 years before the establishment of Henrietta. However, Henrietta shares a number of traits with Edwards
Plateau, while Central Texas materials do not appear in
that region until much later (Krieger 1946: 97), probably
around 1500. Also, Henrietta pottery occurs along with
Sanders ware in the Wylie focus, which Stephenson (1951)
places at 1300-1600 A.D. Several alternative conclusions are
possible. Five hundred years could be allowed for the spread
of Central Texas traits to the Brazos River and a span of
1100-1500 credited to Wylie, or Henrietta could be set back
to about 800 A.D. As neither of these seems very tenable,
it may be suggested that a less drastic downward revision
of the Gibson and Central Texas Aspect dates would be
desirable.
Matrix form is used in Table III to present numbers
and percentages of common traits for each pair of cultures.
The percentage figure refers to the number of traits in
the list for the culture being matched in that horizontal
row. The list of traits was constructed specifically to reveal
the reciprocal exchange of traits between Plains groups
and the circum-Plains cultures. Where this exchange was
most extensive, a higher representation appears on the
chart. Hence the large number of traits for Optima and
Antelope Creek, which combine features of Upper Republican and Pecos; as against the lower figures for the "Caddean area" groups, whose contacts with eastern Plains

cultures produced little effect either way. Many of the
similarities they share with Upper Republican simply reflect the common origin of the Mississippian and Plains Village Patterns. The percentages given for these pre-Caddoan
cultures therefore express degrees of similarity to other
cultures only with respect to this list and not to their total
inventories. Some of the comparisons were undoubtedly
skewed by the absence of comparable or relevant data.
In general, though, if two cultures were historically related,
the preponderance of trait agreements will override even
important gaps in data. Occasionally, it may be necessary
to resort to qualitative assessments of specific features in
order to reach a conclusion.
Antelope Creek and Optima show the highest degree of
similarity, a fact which justifies their inclusion in a single
Panhandle Aspect. It could become necessary to re-interpret the two foci on a temporal rather than a spatial basis,
if differences in architecture should prove to be the result
of development through time. This is suggested by the
presence of Antelope Creek house-forms in the Optima area
and the assumption that some unidentified forms must have
preceded the development of the Antelope Creek house.
Henrietta has the smallest number of traits common to
other Plains cultures; at the same time, it shares over half
of its traits with Central Texas and nearly as many with
Edwards Plateau. Were it not for the higher correspondence
with such intermediate complexes as Washita River and
Antelope Creek, it is questionable whether Henrietta would
be easily recognized as Plains. It might eventually be desirable to combine Henrietta with Custer, Washita River,
and perhaps the Paint Creek Culture of Kansas in a "Southern Plains Aspect."
An examination of Table II shows the characteristic
Plains Village bison-scapula hoe to be one of the most
widely diffused items. In some areas it competed with hoes
of other material, such as slate or mussel shell. These bone
hoes have been reported from as far south as the Bonnell

124

Texas Archeological Society

site, a J ornada Mogollon site in New Mexico (Holden
1952: 128), where they occur with Alibates flint, quarried
near Antelope Creek, and with other Plains-like bone artifacts. There was also some slab-wall masonry reminiscent
of Panhandle foundations.
Cordmarking on pottery appears to decrease toward the
south and east. There may be some correlation between
the disappearance of this trait in the Plains region and the
spread of shell tempering. Orr (1946) traced the evolution
of shell temper as it began in Spiro and became institutionalized in Fort Coffee. It occurs only sparingly in Custer,
predominates in Washita River, and completely characterizes Henrietta pottery, which is also entirely plain.
Baerreis (1954: 44) has discussed the diffusion of the
Fresno point, which he describes as the "typical Middle
Mississippi" point. Whatever its origin, its introduction into
the southern Plains and "Caddoan" areas seems to be coextensive with the appearance there of Central Plains manifestations.
The trait lists brought together here contain material for
many more such observations. However, enough has been
said to illustrate the kind of results to be obtained from a
diffusion study, and to provide a basis for the second part
of this study-acculturation.
The concept itself has already been discussed, but the
procedures for the study of acculturation should be examined briefly. Keur (1941) has set forth these necessary
conditions to such a study by an archeologist.
(1) Trace the history of a particular culture, to establish
its characteristics and autonomy.
(2) Demonstrate a situation of contact and the cultural
differences between the contacting cultures.
(3) Document the history of the contact and consequent
changes in either or both cultures.

( 4) Draw the inferences necessary to describing the results of the whole process.
(5) Comparisons may be made and recurrent incidences

It is clear from these conditions that an analysis of diffusion must precede a study of acculturation. This is nowhere more obvious than in James Watson's (1952) study of
Cayua acculturation. Although announced as an non-historical, "structural" investigation, yet it had to begin with an
informal recognition of the diffused elements. His deliberate
neglect of the diffusion approach somewhat weakened his
material. In the present study of southern Plains Village
acculturation, the first three conditions have been substantially met already. The fourth step will be to put meat on
the bones of the trait lists.

A fairly clear quantitative presence-and-absence difference separates the Plains colonies from those native cultures
they encountered. Changes in specific traits shared reveal
more genuinely the actual relationships between these colonies. As differences are generally cumulative with distance,
the Panhandles cultures exhibit a continuous gradation of
features between Plains and Pueblos.
Krieger (1946: 73) has aptly expressed the implications
present here: "One can hardly escape the impression that
the peoples of this [Antelope Creek] focus were Plains
agriculturalists who pushed southward from one valley to
another as far as eastern New Mexico. Here contact was
established .. ." Krieger (1949: 98-9) has traced the boundary line which was created by this contact, across northeastern New Mexico, north Texas, and up through eastern
Oklahoma, wherever the immigrants found established native cultures.
Who these people were, and where they originated has
not been substantiated by archeology or ethnology. However,
they had achieved a culture which was economically balanced and well adapted to exploit the environment of the

132

Plains. Where and when this specialized culture was developed before it appeared full-blown on the Plains is as
yet unknown. Once in the Plains, the ecological integration
of the culture was remarkably successful and permitted a
rapid expansion of the population. The stage was thus set
for an early chapter of "manifest destiny," for the Great
Plains were almost uninhabited. The climate was favorable,
and the vast domain was there for the taking. The absence
of any obstacles to the spread of these horticulturist-hunters
is evidenced in the lack of defensive organization among
their villages.
Within a fairly short time the limits of the Plains environment were reached, and expansion came to an end.
Perhaps it was because the areas around the southern end
of the Plains were occupied by peoples of differing cultural
traditions who had specialized to meet the conditions of
their own environments and were uninterested in exploiting
the adjacent country. Or perhaps the Plains Villagers were
not equipped either offensively or ecologically to subdue
these new areas. Whatever the cause, the boundary was
established and acculturation began to modify the frontier
settlements.
The contact established between the Plains colonists in
the Panhandle and those of Pecos Pueblo and nearby
related sites had important results for both groups. It is
probable that from time to time, hunting parties visited
the Pueblo, and it may be that groups from Pecos also
travelled east. A valuable item of trade from which "a
majority of the Pecos chipped artifacts were fashioned was
'Alibates Flint', a red-banded agatized dolomite which could
only be obtained from the quarries north of Amarillo. That
many of the objects were actually chipped at Pecos is
shown by large numbers of flakes of this material in the
upper rubbish" (Krieger 1946: 62). It appears that the
Panhandle Plains groups stimulated the Pecos men to take
a greater interest in hunting, including bison-hunting. This
would explain the greater number and variety of bone

Anthropological Theory and Plains Archeology

133

and chipped flint artifacts at Pecos than is found in other
pueblos of the Southwest (Krieger 1946: 62-63).
Along with a few pieces of Pueblo trade pottery, the
visiting Plains hunters brought back observations and information on Puebloan architecture. The result was that the
Antelope Creek villages on the South Canadian River took
over the idea of stone masonry and multiroomed structures,
reproduced these by their own unique methods, and in the
resulting syncretism expressed their essentially different
social heritage. Krieger (1946: 43) has devoted considerable
discussion to these structures. It is apparent that it was
largely a Puebloan idea but not Puebloan techniques which
were adopted. Internally, the houses retain most of the
features characteristic of the Central Plains house. Externally, the use of adobe and masonry, the presence of multiroomed dwellings oriented to the cardinal directions, the
conversion of the entryway into a ventilator, the adoption
of the roof hatchway, and possibly the presence of a clay
bank "altar" inside the house opposite the ventilator, all
point to an attempt to reproduce the Southwestern pueblo.
The evidence that this was a native effort seems to lie
in the unique masonry technique employed. Foundations
were formed by two parallel rows of upright caliche slabs
with rubble fill between them; masonry walls continued
on above or another paired row of slabs might be set inside
the margins of those below, and so on up the wall. Watson
(1950: 60-61) has suggested a possible sequence by which
such slab-masonry could have developed from the singleslab rows set around Optima house walls. The slabs functioned in an entirely different way from those in Antelope
Creek Focus sites. In the Optima Focus, they are outside
the wall, where they supported the wall posts and sealed
out rain water. It may be that the practice was suggested
by the Upper Republican use of slabs for lining graves, as
at Optima the entryway was built and roofed with slabs.
Without any stratigraphy or seriation of ruins only speculation is possible.

134

------------------

------~---------------

As a rule, the greater the differences between two cultures in contact, the stronger will be the stimuli to acculturation. This may be responsible for the more extensive acculturation which occurred between Pecos and Antelope Creek than between the latter and Optima. In addition,
the conditions surrounding contacts serve to stimulate as
well as control the direction of subsequent changes. Krieger
(1946: 74) repeats Kelley's suggestion that the marriage
of a few Pueblo women into the Panhandle villages could
have initiated the architectural changes there; this would
explain the absence of Puebloan ceremonial features, because Pueblo women control the houses while men own the
ceremonial properties.
According to Kidder (1924: 5), the Pueblo "women built
the walls of stone and adobe mud, the men cut and set the
roof beams." But structural details at Antelope Creek argue
for an indigenous architecture. Women are the potters and
corn-grinders among the Puebloans. Again, Krieger (1946:
17-39) nowhere mentions more than a handful of Pueblo
sherds at any Panhandle site, no more than might be
expected from trade. Finally, even the eastern Pueblos
were probably all matrilocal at this time, as most likely
the Plains groups were also. Such a situation militates
against the removal of a woman from her home to a foreign
village where she could claim no residence. A more likely
alternative for sources of diffusion through hunting-trading
parties has already been mentioned.
1The hybrid culture in the Panhandles was short-lived,
however. "According to Weakley ... the period 1439-1468
was one of almost continual drought in the Panhandles
region" (V. Watson 1950: 44). The high tide of Plains Village
expansion was past. Like the San Juan Anasazi 200 years
before, these horticulturists evacuated their frontier and
began a retreat. By the time of Coronado's entrada of 1541,
only nomadic, non-ceramic bison hunters occupied the area
(Krieger 1946: 370). The retraction of the Plains Village
boundaries culminated when "the Upper Republican occu-

Anthropological Theory and Plains Archeology

135

pation of the Central Plains was terminated by the drought
of 1539 to 1564" (Lehmer 1954: 149).
The Custer and Washita River foci show few distinctive
modifications from Upper Republican, partly due to the
absence of any strong cultural boundary. Most of the
changes which took place must therefore be treated as
simple diffusion or ecological adaptation.
Farther south, the Plains Village colonies of Henrietta
Focus encountered a real cultural frontier when they overran the northern ranges of the Edwards Plateau culture.
The invasion was countered sometime later by bands of
the developing Central Texas culture to the south. Krieger
(1946: 97) has documented a case of contact between these
peoples. Two graves at the Harrell site were "multiple
interments and all nine arrowpoints found in them suggested the cause of death." These were all Central Texas
Scallorn points, of which but 24 occurred in the site. Such
evidence at least helps set Henrietta apart from Central
Texas, despite close cultural similarities resulting from intensive acculturation. Cliffton and Alba points from northeast Texas suggest earlier contacts with groups down the
Red or Trinity Rivers, perhaps through Wylie Focus.
The use of shell tempering for pottery probably diffused
among the Plains Villagers before they migrated as far
south as Texas. The practice was already institutionalized
among the Henrietta peoples. They seemingly also acquired
the atlatl from local Edwards Plateau natives. Krieger
(1946: 95) remarks that "the presence of a number of dart
points also distinctive of 'Edwards Plateau Culture' points
to a continuum of older central Texas traits into what is
otherwise a radically different and later culture in the
upper Brazos Valley."
Perhaps even more significant is evidence for the adoption of "burnt-rock middens" in the Henrietta Focus area.
These are a characteristic feature of Edwards PlateauCentral Texas sites. They arose from the custom of drawing
up slabs of native Cretaceous limestone around campfires,

136

Texas Archeological Society

which caused the stone to crack and required new pieces
to be brought in at intervals, the cracked sections being
tossed out. In time a favored camping spot might come to
possess a low circular mound of stones.
Since house structures are unknown for Henrietta, it is
reasonable to assume that these hearths, ringed by some
sort of light, temporary buildings which left no remains,
served as the occupational sites of the acculturated Plains
colonists. The degree of acculturation they experienced
amounted to virtual syncretism; a measure of this is given
in Table III, which shows Henrietta shares 30 traits with
Upper Republican, but 27 with Edwards Plateau and 34
with Central Texas.
Just to the east of Henrietta, the Wylie focus has been
recognized (Stephenson 1951) . Results of work done there
have been inconclusive regarding the assignation of the
complex to either the Plains or the Gibson-Fulton Aspects.
The present comparisons indicate a possible predominance
of Plains traits, with the highest agreement lying between
Wylie and Henrietta (30) as against 22 common traits
between Wylie and Sanders. However, this difference is
insufficient to establish a genetic Plains relation for Wylie,
since the list used here does not give complete representation to the traits of the "Caddoan" area complexes. It may
be that this was a "border culture" which was the result
of a fusion of Gibson and Plains traits, with a certain admixture of elements from the south. If so, this would be a most
interesting case of intensive acculturation. However, more
definitive work is needed for this and the neighboring foci
to place the Wylie sites in their true historical perspective.
Sanders, Fort Coffee, and Turkey Bluff were in a sense
all frontier cultures, a position which left them exposed
to the effects of contact with immigrant Plains groups.
Each differs rather distinctly from the contemporaneous
cultures of the same aspect which were not so directly
exposed. The earliest of the three, Sanders, came to an
end before the Plains colonies had become very numerous

in the southern Plains. Only three typically Plains traits
reached Sanders: bison scapula hoes, sandstone hones, and
L-shaped stone elbow pipes (Krieger 1946: 157, 218). These
were probably trade objects, since there is little evidence
for actual acculturation in Sanders. The two later foci, after
longer contact, picked up a few additional traits. However,
again no substantial acculturation seems to have taken
place.
Archeological material can be used to derive what Lowie
has called "metaethnological" information. Such broad cultural characteristics as basic orientations, ecological adaptation, or degrees of social integration, when recognized,
can add a new dimension to the interpretation of problems
of culture history which the archeologist encounters. Here
the recognition can increase the understanding of the
course which acculturation took in the cultures concerned.
The Edwards Plateau and the succeeding Central Texas
cultures were a part of the great "ethnographic sink," as
Swanton has described it, which covered northeastern
Mexico and southern Texas. Cultures of this area were
traditionally rooted to their ancient simple hunting-andgathering existence. Their extreme conservatism made them
almost proof against influence from the various complex
cultures surrounding their borders.
The Gibson and Fulton aspects of the "Caddoan area"
had a very complex history which has not been fully explored yet. Some time before the Plains Village expansion
took place, the great Southern Cult developed in this area,
with its great ceremonial center at Spiro. This intense
religious ferment, perhaps sparked from Mexico and carried
by the evangelistic activities of missionary-priests throughout the Southeast, had a relatively short though brilliant
career. In its wake the contours of culture growth continued largely unaffected, leaving villages of fairly stable,
quiescent populations. By the time the migrating Plains
bands appeared, the religious fervor was gone and the
Fulton Aspect groups were indifferent to outside contacts.

Kroeber's characterization of Southwestern culture would
partially serve for the "Caddoan area" as well. The Plains
culture he mentions is of the later horse-nomads, but his
remarks will serve for the Plains Village tribes as well.
"The Southwestern culture has been non-expansive; its
Pueblo form conspicuously so ... . In the Plains there are
some traits that can presumably be led back to a Southwestern origin, earth-altars, for instance, dice-scoring on a
circuit, perhaps the fetish bundle and shields. In the main,
however, it is remarkable how little the Plains seem to have
taken over from the Southwest. The reciprocal influence
seems at least equal . . . . As normally it is the more advanced culture that affects the other most, Southwestern
impulses are indicated as unusually self-contained, centripetal, perhaps weak in all respects except tenacity"
(Kroeber 1928: 393) .
By contrast with all of these cultures, the Plains Village
peoples must have appeared active, responsive, aggressive.
They showed a greater flexibility in accommodating to
local conditions and a readiness to exploit the adaptive
techniques found in other cultures. Despite some similarities in the characteristics of the three circum-Plains cultures,
various other factors differentially affected the results in
each case of acculturation. Most of these factors, such as
distance, conditions of contact, and distinctiveness of culture patterns, have already been discussed.
Turning now to Keur's fifth step in the study of acculturation, the results of the analyses made in this investigation
can be profitably compared with preceding studies. Willey
(1952) examined three archeological cases of "culture colonization," in which a local group was conquered by another
of more complex culture. In time a single "fusion culture"
developed. Keur (1941) studied archeological evidence for
Navajo acculturation developing from Pueblo contacts; only trade and agitation probably were involved. Despite
differing degrees of intimacy and social control in the two
sets of contacts, both studies reveal similar contours in the
acculturation process. Of the examples of Plains accultu-

ration, only the Panhandle groups fit this picture; the variable of distance is probably responsible for any disparity.
(1) The less advanced group remained culturally subordinate (or peripheral) and distinct from the higher
culture.
(2) The less advanced group borrowed extensively from
the more complex culture.
(3) Final acculturative results were:
(a) The more advanced achievements were permanently accepted: architecture, agriculture.
(b) Native arts of the simpler culture resurged after
quiescence or repression: pottery, ritual, hunting.
(c) Specialized arts of the higher culture, temporarily adopted as novelties, were "worn down":
elaborate pottery forms, art styles.
Plains Village contacts with proto-Caddoan groups, although resulting in a few cases of diffusion, brought about
no traceable acculturation involving an entire category of
culture. Krieger (1946: 156-157) remarks on the situation:
"We find here a striking and highly significant circumstance
in that there is very little in common between the Plainslike Henrietta focus and the cultures of the 'Caddo area'
directly to the east . . . . The contrasts are so strong that
there can be little doubt that two basically different cultural
traditions existed here side by side with practically no
interchange of specific traits." The relationships of these
cultures constituted a situational type of "cultural pluralism." The only exception might be the Wylie Focus, which
perhaps was a true "fusion culture."
Where the Plains Village culture was carried south of
the Red River, acculturation followed a perverse path of
ecological accomodation. The situation began as one of "cultural colonization" and ended in what might be called "cultural regression." Two explanations are possible: the tradi-

tional conservatism of the Edwards Plateau natives may
have overweighed the incentives to cultural advancement,
or the lack of reinforcing influences from the cultural
hearth, again owing to distance, may have left the Henrietta
colony on the cultural defensive. It would be desirable to
conduct further research to discover whether these results
fit into a separate acculturational type, and if so, what its
determinants and parameters are.
SUMMARY
What contribution can archeology make to ethnology?
The additional time depth archeology adds to the ethnographical picture can add greatly to an understanding of
culture history. Southwestern ethnologists and archeologists have tended to be as centripetal in their interests as
the cultures they study. Consequently there has been scant
attention given to the important chapter of foreign relations
in Pueblo prehistory. The materials analyzed here, along
with certain others, can provide solutions to a multitude
of ethnological problems.
It has been twenty years now since archeologists demonstrated the recency of bison-hunting nomadism in the Great
Plains. Before that time, ethnographic evidence for Plains
culture influence in the Southwest Pueblos was understood
to refer to the Plains cultures known in historic times. In
1929, Elsie Clews Parsons explained Pueblo-Pawnee ritual
parallels by suggesting a Southwestern origin for the Pawnee. The Caddoan linguistic affiliation of the Pawnee disallows this idea.

However, Wedel (1940) has conclusively demonstrated
the identity of proto-historic Pawnee with the Lower Loup
Focus, which in turn can be derived from the Upper Republican Aspect of an earlier period. Further, Upper Republican sites have now been recognized in western Kansas
and in Colorado. From here it is but a step to the partially
contemporaneous Pueblo III occupation of the San Juan
Anasazi in southern Colorado and northern Arizona . Contacts between these groups, perhaps reinforced by the later

contacts between Pecos and the Panhandle groups, can
probably account for the parallels which so puzzled Parsons.
Certainly this phase of An asazi- Plains Village relations
deserves more intensive study, with a combining of archeological and ethnological data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of culture history in both areas.
