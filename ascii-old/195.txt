ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC’s
Pride Prospect was conducted on February 26, 2008 by BVRA in eastern
Galveston County, Texas with negative results. The investigation examined a
proposed drill site, a proposed Central Gas Sales Facility, and two proposed
segments of pipeline, an area consisting of 3.64 acres. Virtually all of the project
area is located in a low marshy setting with no high ground; therefore no shovel
tests were excavated and no artifacts were collected. At the site of the Central
Gas Sales Facility, the soil consists of dredged spoil formed by the creation of
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. It is recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC of Corpus Christi, Texas plans to
conduct drilling and production activities in order to develop oil and gas reserves
underlying private property in a marshy area east of the Gulf Intracoastal
waterway and south of a large bend in East Bay Bayou and in a separate marshy
area east of State Highway 124 in the extreme eastern end of Galveston County,
Texas (Figure 1). This area is known as the Pride Prospect, and it includes the
proposed construction of a boarded drill site, boarded access road, 10-inch
pipelines, and a Central Gas Sales Facility. From the drill site to the existing
road, the distance of the boarded road will be 561 feet long and 30 feet wide. If
the well is successful, the access road and underlying culverts will be upgraded
to allow the mobilization of heavy equipment to the proposed drill site. The
access road will be augmented with additional aggregate that will be added to its
surface. While drilling operations are active, the drill site will occupy a footprint of
approximately 3.10 acres and will be 300 feet by 450 feet in size. Suemaur will
use a lined berm and borrow ditch around the drill site. If the well is successful,
the temporary board pad will be replaced with one constructed of compacted
clay, sand, and gravel. These materials will be stabilized as required with a
cement additive. The permanent pad may be raised as much as 12 inches to 18
inches from the ground surface. A 10-inch pipeline will be installed primarily
along existing roads from the well pad site to the Central Gas Sales Facility for a
distance of approximately 9347 feet as well as from the Central Gas Facility to an
existing facility for a distance of approximately 237 feet. The Central Gas Facility
will occupy a footprint of 0.34 acre. The project area is depicted on the 7.5’
USGS topographic quadrangle High Island (2994-422) (Figure 2).
The project area is located in close proximity to the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway, a major transportation route which was created in part using the main
channel of East Bay Bayou. Since prehistoric shell middens and campsites have
been found along this stream and throughout the area, an archaeological survey
was required by the Texas Historical Commission. In order to fulfill this
requirement, DESCO subcontracted with BVRA to perform this service.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information is taken from the soil survey for Galveston
County (Crenwelge et al. 1988). Galveston County is located in the southeast
part of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico and has a total area of 424,961 acres.
Generally, the land surface is characterized as broad and nearly level with
elevations ranging from sea level to about 45 feet in the northwest part of the
county. The modern climate of Galveston County consists of hot and humid
summers and mild winters. In winter, the average temperature is 47 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the average daily temperature is 33 degrees Fahrenheit. In
summer, the average temperature is 83 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average
daily temperature is 87 degrees Fahrenheit. Total annual precipitation is 39.73
inches. Of this amount, 23 inches (60%) usually falls in April through September.
A check of the soil survey for Galveston County revealed that the Central Gas
Sales Facility, short pipeline (237 feet), and a portion of the long pipeline (9347
feet) is located within Ijam clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes (ImA). According to
Crenwelge, et al. 1988:21), this soil is found in coastal marshes and is formed
from materials dredged from bays and canals. In a typical profile, the surface
layer of ImA soils is dark grayish-brown clay about 10 inches thick. Below this is
an underlying layer of calcareous dark gray clay to a depth of 25 inches. The
middle part consists of moderately alkaline gray clay with a few strata of sand to
a depth of 56 inches. The lower part, to a depth of 61 inches, is neutral bluish
gray sand that has a few strata of sandy clay loam. This soil is poorly drained,
and flooding is a hazard. The drill site is located in Kemah silt loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes (KeB). It is described in the soil survey for Galveston County
(Crenwelge et al. 1988:23-24) as a gently sloping, somewhat sloping, poorly
drained soil that has clayey subsoil. In a typical profile, an acidic silty loam
overlies a gray clay at a depth of 35 inches.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The areas most likely to contain significant prehistoric sites are the
shorelines along the mainland and the inland bays and streams where Indians
gathered to consume Rangia cuneata, oysters, and brackish water clams. As
they discarded the used shells, large middens often accumulated. This was a
seasonal practice, as they camped on the shell heaps until they moved to other
areas. Evidence for campsites consists of pottery, animal bone, flakes, and flint
tools such as arrow points. Shell middens have been recorded along the coast
and in inland settings, and these sites are a common occurrence in the area.
Since the prehistoric Indians probably traversed the entire area within the project
area boundaries, any elevated landform above water is likely to contain evidence
of their presence. A recent survey by archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates
(Gadus and Moss 2001), for example, documented shell middens along East Bay
Bayou, which has been dredged (in part) to form the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.
Prewitt’s project area extended from High Island to the Brazos River Diversion
Channel in Brazoria, Chambers, and Galveston counties. The potential for
offshore sites has to be viewed as high based on the presence of the McFaddin
Beach site (41JF50) in adjacent Jefferson County.
Historic accounts of Indian activity in the area suggest that the area was
intensively utilized during different seasons of the year. Explorers such as
Cabeza de Vaca observed the local Indians moving about the area where they
subsisted on various foods and animals that were available at that time. He
noted that in the winter they inhabited an island (possibly Galveston Island)
where they ate roots and fish and slept on mats on shells with a few skins for
cover. In the spring they returned to the mainland or seashore where they
collected berries and oysters. In the summer they moved back to the island
where they ate wild potatoes along with a few buffalo and deer (Gilmore 1974:
Table 1).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the site records by Jean Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records
at TARL in Austin, Texas, revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites h
in the project area. In the 1950s, Thomas Nolan Campbell (1957) reported on
the Caplen site (41GV1), and his work represents the first professional study of a
prehistoric site in the county. Prehistoric cemeteries have been documented in
the area and include the Caplen site located just south of the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway on Bolivar Peninsula, the Jamaica Beach site (41GV5) and the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) located on Galveston Island facing West Bay. Aten
(1965) conducted excavations at the Jamaica Beach site and found human
remains believed to be associated with the coastal Karankawa. Work by Ricklis
(1994) at Mitchell Ridge identified habitation features such as hearths, pits, a
house floor, activity areas, and four burial areas with about 52 individuals
present. In 1998, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted a very large survey (85
miles) along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from High Island to the Brazos River
Diversion Channel in Brazoria, Chambers, and Galveston counties (Gadus and
Moss 2001), and portions of this study were very close to the current project
area. Seven new sites were identified: four prehistoric shell middens, one
twentieth-century house site, and two twentieth-century shipwrecks. Two of the
shell middens in Chambers County (41CH360 and 41CH361) were considered to
be potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Both
sites are on low rises surrounded by natural marsh vegetation. In addition to the
detailed monograph by Ricklis (1994) and the in-depth report by Gadus and
Moss (2001), the interested reader is referred to two major works that discuss in
detail the archaeology of Southeast Texas. These are Aten’s (1983) exhaustive
work entitled Indians of the Upper Texas Coast and The Archeology and
Bioarcheology of the Gulf Plain (Story et al. 1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator discussed the project
with the lead reviewer for this project, William A. Martin, Staff Archaeologist of
the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. It was decided at this
meeting that the Central Gas Sales Facility, the 327-foot segment of pipeline that
connects this facility with the access road, and 2000 feet of pipeline that passes
through the marsh north of the Central Gas Sales Facility are the only areas that
needed to be investigated. The rest of the pipeline, between the marshy area and
the drill site, was viewed by all parties at the meeting as a low probability area for
an archaeological site. Next, relevant reports involving previous archaeological
research in the area and elsewhere in the county were reviewed in order to
become familiar with the kinds of sites known to occur in the area. Phil Bishop
and Ally Freer walked over as much of the project as possible given the wet
conditions of the marshy setting. The footprints of the Central Gas Facility and
drill site were not flagged. Therefore, the field survey crew located the corners of
the Central Gas Sales Facility and drill site using a Trimble Geo-Explorer GPS
unit with sub-meter accuracy. Because of the wet conditions and lack of high
ground, shovel testing was not conducted. The field survey crew also looked for
the presence of historic sites that might be visible in the form of features. The
project was documented through field notes and digital photographs.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A review of site records at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin,
Texas revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area,
and the area has not been examined by professional archaeologists. The site of
the Central Gas Sales Facility is not viewed as a likely setting for a prehistoric
site because of the marshy conditions and presence of disturbed soils. If the soil
survey for Galveston County is accurate, the proposed construction in the area
where the Central Gas Sales Facility and 237-foot pipeline will be constructed will
not be deep enough to penetrate the ImA soils created by dredge spoil resulting
from the creation of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. It is possible that prehistoric
shell middens or small camps may have been present along the bank of the
bayou in prior to the creation of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, but the dredging
of the canal in some areas would have destroyed them. The 1998 survey by
Prewitt and Associates (Gadus and Moss 2001) examined a large area north of
the canal for a distance of six kilometer and one kilometer inland from the canal
and main channel of the bayou. The four shell middens were found near the
bayou, no prehistoric sites were found inland from this stream, and no sites were
found in the low-lying marshy areas. The proposed drill site is not viewed as a
likely setting for a prehistoric site because of the marshy conditions and distance
to the nearest stream (East Bay Bayou). This study revealed that portions of the
project area had been disturbed through oil and gas activities. This study was
performed according to the minimum survey standards as outlined by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC. be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site
be found during construction, all work in the area of the find must cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In the event that
additional areas are added to the project, the Texas Historical Commission must
be notified as additional survey(s) by a professional archaeologist may be
necessary.
