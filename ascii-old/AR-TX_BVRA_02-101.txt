ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a cultural resources
survey of a 22 acre tract in the city limits of Huntsville, Texas in April of 2002 at the site
of a proposed subdivision on private property to be leased by the Texas Department of
Corrections (TDC). This work was performed under the supervision of William E. Moore
and was sponsored by the engineering firm Gerald B. Harris, Jr. and Associates, Inc. of
Huntsville, Texas. Shovel testing and surface inspection of disturbed areas did not
reveal evidence of a prehistoric site. Courthouse research conducted as part of a
separate environmental assessment indicated that no standing structures were ever
present in the project area. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned.

I would like to thank everyone whose cooperation made the completion of this
project possible, especially Gerald B. Harris, Jr. who provided maps and other
information regarding the project area. The fieldwork was conducted with the
assistance of James E. Warren and Christine Brennecke. The figures that appear in
this report were drafted by Lili Lyddon. Adrianne Mraz, Research Assistant at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, performed the literature
search.

INTRODUCTION
The TDC intends to lease a 22 acre tract in the city limits of Huntsville in central
Walker County, Texas (Figure 1). Prior to this, certain modifications to the landscape
are planned for development of a commercial site and include streets, sewers, water
mains, drainage system, parking lots, and buildings. This development is referred to as
the Henderson Land Company Section 4, sections 1-3 having already been completed.
At the request of the engineering firm Gerald B. Harris, Jr. and Associates, Inc. in
Huntsville, Texas, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a Phase I
cultural resources assessment of the tract on April 22, 2002. Since the project area is in
close proximity to Parker Creek to the northwest, a major stream in the area, an
archaeological survey was warranted. A check of the site records at TARL revealed a
prehistoric site recorded on Town Creek approximately 0.25 kilometers southeast of the
project area. Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by the 7.5' Huntsville
topographic quadrangle dated 1963 (photorevised 1976) (Figure 2). The project area is
at the northern edge of the Huntsville quadrangle; therefore, the Pine Prairie quadrangle
was also used, and it is incorporated into Figure 2.

FIELD METHODS
A check of the site records at TARL was made by Adrianne Mraz, Research
Assistant, for BVRA. She identified one previously recorded prehistoric site (41WA123)
approximately 0.25 km southeast of the current project area. This is a probable Archaic
site that was recorded by William E. Moore in 1993 on personal time. The age of this
site is based on the presence of dart points in the private collection of David Zellar,
Huntsville resident. At the time of the visit, Mr. Moore observed flakes on the surface of
a very disturbed landscape. The site was determined to lake significant research
potential.
Fieldwork was conducted on April 22, 2002 by William E. Moore (Principal
Investigator), James E. Warren, and Christine Brennecke. The area examined consists
of a 22 acre tract approximately 100 meters southeast of Parker Creek. It was
immediately noted by the field survey crew that much of the 22 acre tract had been
disturbed by heavy equipment. According to Gerald B. Harris, Jr., a grading contractor
bulldozed the surface in 1994. He pushed the high spots into the low spots in order to
level the area. A small area of approximately six acres in the northeast corner (Figure
1) was relatively undisturbed. This area is located on the slope of a sandy hill
overlooking an unnamed tributary of Parker Creek.
The survey crew relied on the topographic quadrangles Huntsville and Pine
Prairie and an engineering map provided by the client. It should be noted here that the
contours as depicted on the topographic map have changed due to the extensive land
alteration that was carried out in 1994. The engineering map was used to create the
project area map (Figure 1), but the contours were omitted since they were not current
as well.
The entire area was investigated by a 100% pedestrian survey with the survey
crew examining the ground surface for evidence of cultural materials in the exposed,
disturbed sandy mantle. The six acre tract in the northeast corner was shovel tested,
and no cultural materials were observed. Three tests were dug in this area. Tests were
30 x 50 cm in size, and all soil was passed through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. The
approximate location of each test is depicted on Figure 1, and more detailed shovel test
information is found in Appendix I. Although this area was the most promising in terms
of prehistoric site location, it was considered to be low probability because the nearest
water source is a small tributary of Parker Creek. Also, there is enough disturbances
that it is unlikely that cultural materials, if present, are intact. No additional shovel tests
were deemed appropriate.
Another area south of the tributary on a slope appeared to be a likely area for site
potential, and it was examined through shovel testing and probing. Three shovel tests
revealed clay at the surface, and shovel testing was discontinued. Additional probes
confirmed the presence of clay in the general area. Because of the presence of
previous disturbance and distance to water, the southern and western parts of the
project area were not shovel tested.

As part of a Phase I environmental assessment conducted by James E. Warren
(2002) on this tract, tax and courthouse records were checked for the presence of
previous structures. No evidence of any buildings was found, and Mr. Harris stated that
he was not aware of any on the site in the past.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The project area had been greatly disturbed by heavy equipment. It was
determined in the field that the six acre tract in the northeast part of the project area was
the most likely area to contain intact cultural materials; however, shovel tests and
examination of exposed areas did not produce evidence of a site, prehistoric or historic.
A records check that included examination of tax and courthouse records indicated that
the area had been used as pasture and woodlands with no previous structures present.
According to the soil survey for Walker County (McClintock et al. 1979:Sheet 31), the
soils in the project area consist mainly of Falba fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes.
This is a moderately deep soil found on convex uplands. The surface layer is a very
friable, strongly acid, brown fine sandy loam about 5 inches thick. Between 7 and 24
inches is a very firm, very strongly acid, grayish-brown clay (McClintock et al. 1979:11).
This soil is somewhat poorly drained and is saturated in winter and spring in most years.
The soils encountered in shovel tests 1-3 contained very wet sandy soils in the upper
strata. Although the color of the underlying clay in the first three shovel tests was
different from that in the soil description, the wet soils suggest an area probably
considered as a good location for a campsite by prehistoric groups.
A check of the site files and topographic maps at TARL revealed no previously
recorded sites in the project area. This investigation covered a 22 acre tract. It is
believed that the area most likely to contain archaeological sites is the sandy ridge to
the north along Parker Creek. The 22 acre site is considered very low probability for the
presence of archaeological sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found in the 22 acre project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible
that evidence of archaeological sites is missed during any cultural resources survey.
Should a prehistoric site be found during construction it is recommended that work
cease until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission.
