Temple Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste Water Pipeline

Abstract
The City of Temple plans to construct a reclaimed waste water pipeline in Bell County,
Texas. The waste water pipeline will initially connect the Temple-Belton Waste Water Treatment
Plant (TBP) to the Panda Temple II Power Plant. The project is subject to the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) which requires the
consideration of any potential effects on cultural resources before new construction begins.
In order to facilitate construction of the waste water pipeline, TITAN Engineering, Inc.,
on behalf of Panda, contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the route. The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit
Number 6691 and following Section 106 of the NHPA. APC performed a cultural resources
survey of about 19.2 acres. No new archeological or historical sites were found. No diagnostic
artifacts were seen and no artifacts were collected for analysis or curation. APC, therefore,
recommends that construction of the Temple-Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste Water Pipeline
(TBPRWWP) proceed without further investigation.
Lastly, APC recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during
construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the Archeology Division of Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified, by telephone at (512) 463-6100. The find
should be evaluated by archeologists in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission
before digging resumes at the location.

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The City of Temple proposes to construct the Temple-Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste
Water Pipeline (TBPRWWP) to the Panda Temple Power, LLC ( Panda), natural gas-fired power
plant located southeast of Temple, Texas, in eastern Bell County. The utility route will cross land
owned by the City of Temple (Temple), City of Belton (Belton), the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT), and private property tracts inside a permanent easement. The endeavor
is a dual jurisdiction project subject to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
In order to facilitate construction, TITAN Engineering on behalf of Panda, contracted
with Antiquities Planning and Consulting (APC), to comply with the ACT and to perform a
survey of the proposed TBPRWWP route. The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit
Number 6691 following Texas Archeological Survey Standards. APC performed a survey of a
total of 19.2 acres. The results showed that no potentially eligible cultural resources are present
that could be affected by the new construction because no cultural material is present in the
proposed easement.
Based on negative findings, APC, therefore, recommends that the installation of the
reclaimed water line inside proposed TBPRWWP ROW proceed with routine conditions. Lastly,
APC also recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during construction,
digging should stop at the discovery location and THC Archeology Division should be notified,
by telephone at (512) 463-6100. The find should be evaluated by archeologists, in consultation
with the THC, before digging resumes at the location.

2.0 TEMPLE BELTON PLANT RECLAIMED WASTE WATER PIPELINE
INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple proposes to construct the Temple Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste
Water Pipeline (TBPRWWP). The pipeline will consist of an 8 mile long reclaimed waste water
pipeline. The line will be built inside a publically owned right-of-way (ROW) and on private
property.
Construction of the project will be performed under a United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) 404 nationwide permit and is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act. Due to it’s location in a publically-owned Texas ROW, the project is also
subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas. In order to facilitate construction, TITAN Engineering,
on behalf of Panda, contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW in accordance with federal and state regulations.
PROJECT AREA
The TBPRWWP connects to the existing Temple Belton Plant (TBP) to the Panda
Temple Power Plant locale (Figure 1). It will be placed principally inside the FM93 Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) ROW. The route crosses the Leon River and at that
location bore pits will be placed within the TxDOT ROW. After leaving the FM93 ROW, the
alignment turns north east and parallels an existing utility easement to FM3117, where it turns
north onto private property and into the plant.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will take place is twodimensional and includes surface and subsurface impacts and measures about 19.2 acres in area.
The proposed TBPRWWP route is about 8 miles long by 20 feet wide by 4-6 feet deep. A total of
5.5 miles will be installed inside the easements of FM93 and will total about 13.2 acres in area.
The remaining 2.5 miles will be located on private property and will principally parallel existing
utility easements. The newly acquired permanent ROW along existing utility easements will be
20 feet wide by 4-6 feet deep or about 6 acres in area.
The depth of the reclaimed waste water pipeline trench will be around 6 feet deep based
on 20-inch pipe with a minimum of 48-inch cover. The trench will be about 2 to 3 feet wide by 5
to 6 feet deep. Boring will also utilized to cross under the Leon River and roadway ROWs and
will affect additional subsurface areas of unknown volume at the time of writing.
At the Leon River crossing on the west side, a bore pit will be placed about 510
feet/162.4 meters west of the river channel in the TxDOT easement. A laydown yard will be
situated on property that is part of the TBP. Lastly, the pipeline will connect the bore pit with the
TBP. The locale has been landscaped and sculpted. The bore pit, the laydown yard and a part of
the pipeline route entering the TBP will also fall inside previously known archeological site
41BL260.

Cultural Resources Survey

Temple Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste Water Pipeline

Bell County and the project area contain calcareous clay and clay loams formed from
Cretaceous Period rocks deposited up to 15 million years ago. Late Pleistocene Epoch/ Holocene
deposits laid down about 15,000 years ago are present along drainages and also overlays
Cretaceous material. Recently formed alluvial soils are present along major streams less than
15,000 years ago. Cultural material in Central Texas can date back to 12,000 year before the
present (B.P.). Buried cultural deposits are found in Holocene Epoch strata starting at that time.
The presence of buried cultural material can be predicted by the types of soils present along
streams and tributaries. Huckabee et al. (1988) describe soils found in Bell County and are quoted
below.
Altoga Silty Clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes is found on hilltops, hillsides, and foot slopes. A
characteristic profile is 0-6 inches light grayish brown silty clay, 6-28 inches of very pale brown
silty clay, and 28-58 inches light gray silty clay, and 58-62 inches light gray chalky marl. Altoga
soils are well –drained with medium run-off. Parent material is marly and clay material.
Austin Silty Clay, 1 to 3 percent slope is present on uplands. Most profiles consist of 025 inches grayish brown silty clay, 25-35 inches brown clay, and 35-48 light brownish gray marly
clay. Austin soils are well drained with medium to rapid runoff. Parent material is clayey marl or
chalky limestone.
Fryer Creek is lined in Frio Silty Clay deep soils are situated in flood plains formed in
alluvial material. A view of the soil profile is 0-35 inches dark grayish brown silty clay over 3688 inches brown silty clay. These soils are well-drained with slow run off and have a high
probability of containing buried cultural material. Many archeological sites have been reported in
locations covered by Frio Silty Clay.
Houston Black Clays are upland and drainageway soils made up of 0-24 inches very dark
gray clay, 24 -46 inches dark gray clay, and 46- 68 inches of gray clay. These clays form in clay
and marl and are moderately well-drained with slow run off. Houston Black Clays along
drainages are known to contain buried cultural strata in Central Texas.

3.0 CULTURAL HISTORY
REGIONAL CHRONOLOGY
The survey area is in the Central Texas archeological region which is known to contain
many archeological and historic sites, many of which have been investigated Jelks 1962; Shafer
1963, Shafer et al. 1963; Sorrow 1967; Weir 1976, 1985; Prewitt 1974, 1981, 1985; and Collins
1990). Archeological finds in Bell County have shown that the region has been occupied for at
least 13,000 years (Collins 2003). Investigations in Central Texas have resulted in the formation
of detailed chronologies for the region based on work by Collins 2003; Prewitt, 1980; Weir
1976; and Shum 1960 (Table 2).

PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCES STUDIES
The Central Texas region and the Bell County area have been investigated by
archeological and historical scholars since the early twentieth century (Jackson 1931; Sellards
1933, Tyler 1936; Watt 1936). Pertinent to TBPRWWP project, previous cultural resources
studies have been performed inside the area where the reclaimed waste water pipeline will be
installed. Previous highway and utility improvement projects included survey and testing level
investigations.
Archeologists from the Texas Department of Water Resources conducted survey level
investigations related to the TBP in the early 1980s and recorded one prehistoric archeological
site at the TBP which falls inside the proposed TBPRWWP ROW. Jurgens and Whitsett (1982)
recorded archeological Site 41BL260 as part of an improvements project for what was known at
the time as the Brazos River Authority (BRA) Temple-Belton Regional Wastewater Treatment
Plant (TBRWWTP).
Fox and Whitsett (1984) reported the overall results of the BRA TBRWWTP
improvement project cultural resources survey. In addition to Site 41BL260, six other prehistoric
sites (41BL261, 41BL262, 41BL263, 41BL264, 41BL278 and 41BL279) and one prehistoric and
historic site (41BL259) were found during the survey. Five of the locales (41BL259, 41BL260,
41BL262, 41BL78, and 41BL279) were recommended for testing and three (41BL261, 41BL263,

Cultural Resources Survey

and 41BL264) were not recommended for further work.
Site 41BL260 is described as an open terrace site overlooking the confluence of Nolan
Creek and the Leon River. Chipping debris of chert (primary, secondary, and thinning flakes),
thick bifaces, chert hammerstone, burned rock, and a Gower-like projectile point make up the
artifact scatter present which measures 200 meters north-to-south and 120 meters east-to-west.
Deposits were reported to be disturbed by plowing, sludge application, and plowing of sludge and
Waste Water into the sites and probable crossing of the site by a sewer line.
The Bell County soil map unit assigned to the Site 41BL260 locale is Krum Silty Clay
(Huckabee et al. 1988). The recorders of the site report reddish-brown loam about a meter thick
overlying loamy and silty terrace sediments several meters thick. Based on the thickness of the
soil strata and the presence of a Gower-like projectile point dating to the Early Archaic period
(5050-4050 BC), the locale was judged to have the potential to contain buried archeological
deposits. It was recommended that if avoidance of new construction was not possible, the site
should be tested for significant buried deposits.
In the late 1980s, SDHPT archeologists inspected the west and east sides of the Leon
River inside the proposed FM93 ROW. The presence of Site 41BL260 was confirmed on the
southwest side of the river crossing. No new archeological sites were found at the Leon River
Crossing adjacent to the proposed TBPRWWP bore pit locations. In 1986, to determine the site
depth, cultural content, and the significance of the deposits in Site 41BL260, SDHPT
archeologists conducted archeological testing of the site inside the US93 ROW.
During the testing of 41BL260 inside the proposed US93 ROW, three backhoe trenches
were dug at 50 m intervals and three shovel tests and one test unit were excavated. Trenching to a
depth of one meter exposed a 30 cm thick plow zone of reddish-brown clay over 70 cm of reddish
clay. At about 50 cm, all soils present have been stained a blackish hue by sledge pumping. No
cultural material features, burned rock snails, shell, or bone were recovered.
The researcher concluded that the Site 41BL260 is limited to the plow zone and is
extensively disturbed by past land use activity. Based on these findings, Site 41BL260 was
determined to be ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and as a State
Antiquities Landmark and that no further archeological investigation is needed at the site in the
future. The ROW for US93 was constructed through the location and destroyed additional parts
of Site 41NL260. The 1987 TxDOT testing results at Site 41BL260 confirmed that no further
work is needed at Site 41BL260 and the THC concurred.
In 1996, an archeological and geoarcheological survey was performed as part of
regulatory requirements in preparation for construction of the Southeast Temple Water Line and
Sanitary Improvements (Kleinbach and Kibler 1996). The survey crossed the northern portion of
the Panda power plant locale. No new archeological sites were found inside the plant tract,
however, two archeological sites were found along Knob Creek. Sites 41BL1096 and 41BL1097
are prehistoric open campsites.
Prior to the construction of the Panda Temple Power Plant, three cultural resources
studies have been completed (Godwin 2009, 2012a, 2012b). Inside the tract where the plant will
be built, but outside the APE, two historic nineteenth century house sites were found along with
one twentieth century house site (Godwin 2009). Along the proposed alignments of a natural gas
line six historic sites were also present (Godwin 2012a). An Waste Water water line route was
also inspected and no cultural resources were found (Godwin 2012b). The sites consisted of a

Cultural Resources Survey

nineteenth century family cemetery and five late nineteenth to early twentieth century house sites.
No evidence of prehistoric archeological sites was found during the three surveys.
Very recently, the City of Temple sponsored a cultural resources survey for the Leon
River Waste Water Line, which included subsurface investigations across and along the Leon
River to the north of the TBWTTP and the TBPRWWP project area (Bradle and Uecker 2013).
Two possible prehistoric and two historic archeological sites were found. The possible sites are
made up of fresh water mussel shell concentrations absent of association with man-made
materials. The historic sites are an early twentieth century farm house and a bridge and culvert.
Back hoe trenching and augering within 200 meters of the river exposed clay loams, silty clay,
and fine sandy loams to a depth of 2 meters.
SUMMARY
The background research showed that one known cultural resource falls inside the
proposed TBPRWWP ROW. Site 41BL260 was an open prehistoric campsite overlooking the
Leon River to the east. An artifact found at the site indicated that deeply buried Early Archaic
components may have been present at the site. However, previous archeological investigations at
Archeological Site 41BL260 demonstrated that the archeological deposits at the site are shallow
and disturbed and requires no further work.
During a preliminary records search, it was also determined that the west part of the
TBPRWWP route along FM93 has been examined for cultural resources by archeologists and the
east part along FM93 has not been inspected. Historic map reviews yielded eleven loci where
historic buildings were and/or are present. Topographic map reviews identified seven creek
crossings with the potential to contain cultural resources based on setting and soils present. These
findings indicate that HPAs for the presence of cultural resources exist inside the proposed
ROW.
For these reasons and to comply with the NHPA and ACT, an intensive pedestrian
survey was performed by APC in October of 2013 in order to determine if any significant cultural
resources are present that could be affected by the proposed activity and should be avoided.
Discussions of the survey research direction, methods, and results follow in the next two report
sections.

4.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The purpose of the TBPRWWP survey was to collect new regional cultural resources
data about the eastern Bell County area. The objectives were to determine whether or not any
significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) are present in the proposed ROW that might
be affected by the new construction and to produce a compliance report for use in agency
consultation.
METHODS
Before going into the field, APC completed an application and obtain an Antiquities
Permit form the THC. APC reviewed records from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas),
the Texas State Library (TSL), the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory (TARL), and APC
holdings. Site files and pertinent archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were
checked and to determine whether historic properties listed on the NRHP, SALs, and/or recorded
sites are located inside or in the vicinity of the project area.
Historic USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs were reviewed to indentify
potential historic cultural resources loci. USDA Soil Survey guides were checked for soils with
the potential to contain buried cultural resources. Such soils along the TBPRWWP ROW were
identified and judged to be HPAs. The field survey was performed following rates and
requirements of the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas by an RPA certified archeologist
and also followed the Secretary of the Interior Guidelines.
Archeological Site 41BL260 was revisited and found to be destroyed by previous
disturbance. The part of the site located outside the TxDOT easement where the TBPRWWP will
be built was intensively surveyed. No surficial material was observed in the introduced fill that
covers the locale at this time. Shovel testing was not performed at the site and backhoe trenching
is not needed at the site.
All HPAs identified along the proposed ROW were visited and intensively surveyed,
with shovel testing as needed. HPAs consist of historic building locales taken from twentieth
century maps, potential historic loci identified from nineteenth century maps, and areas within
200 meters of rivers, tributaries, and streams. Newly acquired ROW was considered to be an
HPA until shown differently and was also intensively surveyed.
Sections of the proposed TBPRWWP ROW measuring 30 feet wide by 600 feet long on
each side of the creek channels crossed with alluvial sediments were intensively inspected inside
existing easements. At locales thought to be house sites, the existing FM93 easement was not
intensively surveyed for 300 feet by 30 feet wide on both sides of the potential house site loci due
to extensive disturbance in the existing TxDOT ROW. For the newly acquired ROW section, a
corridor 50-feet wide was inspected.
The rate of survey was 2-3 miles per person per day. Technicians walked parallel
transects at 5 meter intervals in 30-foot-wide FM93 ROW and 10 meter intervals in newly
acquired 50-foot-wide ROW. Random transects were also used to achieve one hundred per cent
coverage of the newly acquired ROW.

5.0 RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The findings of the cultural resources survey of the TBPRWWP ROW were negative and
clearly demonstrated that no significant cultural resources are present that will be affected by the
proposed construction. An intensive survey of Archeological Site 41BL260 revealed that the
original ground surface had been altered. An interview with the TBP Chief Operator revealed that
the archeological deposits were removed and relocated to other parts of the plant in 1989.
Intensive inspection of seven creek crossings and newly acquired ROW shovel testing at two
crossings inside the newly acquired ROW yielded negative results. Based on the cultural
resources survey findings, no additional archeological and/or historical investigation is necessary
before construction commences.
TBPRWWP ROW
A windshield survey with intensive survey at creek crossings was performed for existing
FM93 ROW which has been previously disturbed. The roadway has been elevated and between
the pavement and the easement edge are v-shaped ditches (Figure3). Between the ditches and
fence lines, underground utilities have been installed including fiber optic, phone natural gas,
water lines, and sewer lines. The existing ROW was judged to be a No Probability Area (NPA).
for cultural resources.
Intensive pedestrian survey was completed inside newly acquired ROW. It crosses
upland plowed fields on low hills with artificial terracing and is adjacent to a permanent overhead
transmission line easement (Figure 4). Reliable water sources and alluvial soils are not present on
the hills. For theses reasons, the newly acquired ROW was judged to be an NPA also. Leaving the
uplands, near the power plant the route crosses Knob Creek a locale thought to be an HPA.
However, intensive survey and shovel testing yielded negative results and the show that the locale
is a NPA.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 41BL260
The parts of Archeological Site 41BL260 situated on TBP property and in the TxDOT
ROW were revisited. The part of the site inside the TBP boundaries was intensively inspected by
technicians and no evidence of the surficial site was observed. The remainder of Site 41BL260
has been destroyed (Figure 5).

The current ground surface is made up of artificial fill that appears to be 10-15 feet above
the original ground surface (Figure 6). A 345 kV Transmission line crosses the southern part of
the site inside a one hundred-foot-wide permanent easement. A 30-inch sewer main is present
under the eastern section of archeological site location. The proposed TBPRWWP ROW will
parallel the sewer main in an extensively disturbed area.
Plant manager, Randy Lock provided an oral history of plant land use inside of
Archeological Site 41BL260. The original plant entrance was built in 1976 and at that time the
site was situated in a plowed field. Improvements and alteration have been ongoing since the late
1980s, and include mechanical alteration and removal of original topsoil.
The soil containing the archeological site deposits inside the TBP property were removed
and relocated to the west and reused for landscaping berms around the plant in the late 1980s,
despite recommendations to avoid the archeological sit deposits during improvements. Overhead
utilities and under ground utilities are present that have previously disturbed the site.
Six feet of fill was placed on top of the archeological site location (Lock 2013). The
entrance road was upgraded and the route was changed slightly (Figure 7). Construction of the
realignment of FM93 in 1997 brought the addition of more fill to the site location. Due to the
presence of artificial fill, no shovel testing was performed.
Based on survey findings, no part of Archeological Site 41BL260 remains undisturbed. In
fact, the site has been destroyed. Archeological deposits have been impacted by plowing, removal
of topsoil/cultural zone, addition of artificial fill, installation of a 30-inch sewer line, construction
of FM93, and construction of a light industrial complex.

A site revisit form was completed for Site 41BL260 and submitted to TARL. The
eligibility status and condition of Site 41BL260 were updated in the database. At this time, based
on extensive destruction of Archeological Site 41BL260, deposits have been relocated and are
judged to be ineligible for listing in the NHRP and or as a SAL. No deposits remain in 2013 and
no further work is needed at Archeological Site 41BL260 in the future.
POTENTIAL HISTORIC SITE LOCI
Historic loci indentified from early twentieth maps were visited and viewed from the FM
93 ROW. No historic structures were observed. Many modern buildings are present at the
locations today. Inside the proposed newly acquired TBPRWWP ROW, one such loci was
identified and visited. Today, an overhead power pole is present at the locale and no evidence of
the house site was observed during the intensive pedestrian survey of the loci.
HISTORIC PROPERTIES
At locations thought to be early twentieth century structures, none was found. Instead
new houses had taken their place. At the current location of the Taylor’s Valley Baptist Church,
historic maps indicate a church was present in 1916, however; no late nineteenth or early
twentieth century buildings were observed. Instead modern mid twentieth century buildings were
encountered, including a fellowship hall (Figure 8) and chapel (Figure 9). The section of the
TBPRWWP ROW at this locale is disturbed by paving and underground utilities (Figure 10).

HPA CREEK CROSSINGS
Ten locations at seven creek crossings were considered to be HPAs for the presence of
cultural resources were visited (Table 3). Of the ten HPA localities, seven fall inside the existing
FM93 ROW and were found to be Low Probability Areas (LPAs), such as Fryer’s Creek where
concrete aprons are present (Figure 11). Two HPA creek crossing loci are located inside the
newly acquired TBPRWWP ROW.
Boggy Creek Tributary is situated in an upland plowed field and is shallow and actively
down cutting homogenous Houston Black Clay (Figure 12). The Knob Creek Crossing is situated
in a well developed floodplain and is deeply incised (Figure 13). Shovel testing was performed at
the two creek crossings inside newly acquired ROW because surface visibility was less than 40
percent.

Shovel testing yielded negative results at two creek locations inside newly acquired ROW. Homogenous clays and clay loam soils were
exposed in the tests and screed through ¼ dry mesh. No shovel testing was performed in newly acquired ROW despite low surface visibility due
to previous disturbance. The proposed ROW inside upland plowed fields has been subject to long-time plowing and artificial terracing. It falls
adjacent to a 100–foot-wide permanent overhead transmission line easement. Shovel testing would be ineffective in such a disturbed setting.
Lastly, no shovel testing was performed inside the existing FM93 ROW due to previous construction disturbance.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The negative results of the Temple Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste Water Pipeline survey
confirm that the installation of the Reclaimed Waste Water Pipeline will not affect any cultural
resources eligible for the NRHP or SAL listing. Therefore, construction can proceed without
realignment or additional cultural resources work.
From a research perspective, no new knowledge about the region’s prehistory and/or late
nineteenth and early twentieth century settlement resulted from the survey. In terms of new
construction, the absence of any cultural materials in the reclaimed waste water pipeline easement
eliminates any potential impacts to significant historic or archeological properties.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that construction of the Temple Belton Plant Reclaimed Waste Water
Pipeline project proceed, as planned. Lastly, APC recommends that if unexpected archeological
deposits are exposed during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the
Archeology Division of the THC should be notified, by telephone at (512) 463-6100. The find
should be evaluated by archeologists in consultation with the THC before digging resumes at the
location.
