ABSTRACT
On May 26-27, 2005, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation for a proposed retention basin along Halls Bayou, in north Harris
County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify prehistoric cultural
materials or sites within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for the Texas Department
of Transportation, Houston District, and the Harris County Public Infrastructure Department, at
the request of Carter & Burgess, Inc., under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 3777. The project
area consists of approximately 15 acres (6 ha) located along the west side of Aldine-Westfield
Road and the north bank of Halls Bayou, and is depicted on the Humble, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was
conducted, and included both surface and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trench)
examination. A total of 15 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated. No
archeological or historic remains were identified. Consequently, no further archeological
investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
Westfield Road and the north bank of Halls
Bayou. In the eastern half of the project
area, the bayou appears to have been
partially modified. This straightened a
portion of the stream by shifting the channel
slightly to the south (up to a maximum of
200 ft). The old, filled-in channel and the
area between it and the new channel are
easily visible due to differential vegetation
coverage.

On May 26-27, 2005, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed retention basin along Halls Bayou,
in north Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify prehistoric cultural materials or
sites within the proposed impact area, and to
prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The
investigations (MAC PN 04-16) were
conducted for the Texas Department of
Transportation, Houston District, and the
Harris
County
Public
Infrastructure
Department, at the request of Carter &
Burgess, Inc., under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 3777.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 15 shovel
tests and three backhoe trenches were
excavated. The field investigations were
conducted by project archeologist Randy
Ferguson and field technician Steve Hall.
Roger Moore served as the projectâs
principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Humble, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project area
consists of approximately 15 acres (6 ha)
located along the west side of Aldine-

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
Halls Bayou rises in central
northeastern Harris County.
It runs
southeast for 20 miles to its confluence with
Greens Bayou (Tyler 1997). The project
property is located approximately 8Â½ miles
upstream from the confluence. Much of the
bayouâs course appears to remain relatively
nature, with limited channelization.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The project area is depicted on sheet
58 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler et al. 1976). The soil type present
in the tract is limited to Clodine-Urban land
complex (Ce). Clodine soils are considered
to be poorly drained with very slow runoff.
The urban designation of the soil type
indicates that much of the area has been
disturbed and/or covered by urban
development. The PALM model (Abbott
2001) recommends deep reconnaissance
along the flank of the bayou, but only
surface survey (including shovel tests) in the
interior of the tract.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a

the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing

of the park, and identified three historic
archeological sites, 41HR805, 41HR806,
and 41HR807. All three were determined to
be early 2oth century in date, and each had
suffered significant levels of disturbance.
None of the sites were recommended for
further archeological work.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in the project area.
However, there are two previously identified
sites, 41HR805, 41HR806, located within Â½
km of the property.

Greens Bayou, located to the north
of the current project, has been the subject
of
more
intensive
archeological
investigation. Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
conducted a pedestrian survey of
approximately 10 km (ca 25%) of the 40 km
section of Greens Bayou which runs from
stream mile 14.2 at Lake Houston Parkway,
to stream mile 39.2 just east of FM 1960
(Howard et al. 1991). A total of 17 sites
were recorded: 13 prehistoric, three historic,
and one site with both prehistoric and
historic components.

There has been little archeological
work conducted along the Halls Bayou
drainage. The earliest site located on the
bayou, 41HR83, was identified in 1957 by
Wayne Neyland, an avocational archeologist
(TARL records). The site is prehistoric in
date, and is located approximately 8 km
southeast of the current project area.

Two additional surveys have been
conducted on portions of Greens Bayou
which are located approximately 12 km east
of the current project area. A survey by
Ensor et al. (1990) of a 1500 acre area for a
proposed regional rainwater detention
facility identified 36 prehistoric and two
historic sites. A survey by Moore (1993) for
a water detention basin located near the
1500 acre facility identified an additional 11
prehistoric sites. All of these sites were
located on natural mound features (pimple
mounds). Further archeological work was
recommended for each of the sites.

In addition, two archeological
projects have been conducted within the 500
acre Keith-Wiess Park, located immediately
east of the current project. An initial, 180
acre survey in 1983 focused on the 100-year
floodplain area of the park (Hudson 1983).
No archeological sites were identified. A
later survey was conducted by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc, in 1997
(Prikryl 1997). The survey focused on the
moderate-high probability areas (212 acres)

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
intervals of approximately 150 m. The
remaining seven tests (STs 9-15) were
placed opportunistically across the interior
of the tract. STs 1-5 and 7-8 documented
the presence of disturbed fills, clearly the
result of generalized dredging of the bayou
channel, as well as the more extensive
channel modifications in the southeastern
portion of the tract. In the reminder of the
project area, all but one of the tests were
able to reach ancient (pre-Holocene)
subsoils. These dense clay soils were
encountered at an average depth of 61 cmbs.
No cultural materials were found in any of
the shovel tests.

The fieldwork was conducted on
May 26-27, 2005, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing, backhoe trench excavation,
and visual examination for surface exposure
of cultural materials.
The project area is depicted on the
Humble, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project area
consists of approximately 15 acres (6 ha)
located along the west side of AldineWestfield Road and the north bank of Halls
Bayou (Figure 6). In the eastern half of the
project area, the bayou appears to have been
partially modified. This straightened a
portion of the stream by shifting the channel
slightly to the south (up to a maximum of
200 ft). The old, filled-in channel and the
area between it and the new channel are
easily visible due to differential vegetation
coverage.

In addition to the shovel tests, three
backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-3) were
excavated along the north bank of the bayou
(Figures 2-5, 9). The lengths of the trenches
ranged from 3.5 to 4 m, and from 2.0 to 3.1
m in depth. One wall of each trench was
cleaned and examined, and the profile was
then drawn and photographed. A GPS
reading was taken for one corner of the
excavation and the orientation of the trench
was taken with a hand compass. Once it had
been profiled and photographed, each trench
was backfilled.

The majority of the property
consists of dense secondary regrowth
vegetation that suggests extensive clearing
the in the past (Figure 7). However, as
noted above, the southeast corner of the tract
has been cleared and is covered by anklehigh grasses (Figure 8). The thick nature of
the ground cover in both areas resulted in a
surface visibility of less than 10-15 percent.

BHT 1 was placed in the grassy area
near the eastern end of the tract and helped
determine the extensive nature of
disturbance in this area. The remaining two
trenches (BHTs 2, 3) were placed at
intervals along the bank to prospect for
deeply buried sites. No cultural materials or
features were identified in any of these
trenches.

A total of 15 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). The tests were conducted in
two irregular transects.
One transect
paralleled the bayou bank, and consisted of
eight shovel tests (STs 1-8) placed at

RECOMMENDATIONS
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination. A total of 15 shovel tests and
three backhoe trenches were excavated. No
archeological or historic remains were
identified.
Consequently, no further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

On May 26-27, 2005, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed retention basin along Halls Bayou,
in north Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify prehistoric cultural materials or
sites within the proposed impact area, and to
prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The
investigations (MAC PN 04-16) were
conducted for the Texas Department of
Transportation, Houston District, and the
Harris
County
Public
Infrastructure
Department, at the request of Carter &
Burgess, Inc., under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 3777.
