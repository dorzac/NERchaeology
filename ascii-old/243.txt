ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of three proposed well pad sites, two proposed
access roads, and two frac pit sites at the Ferguson Unit of the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice in Madison County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) on July 27 and 29 and August 6 and 18, 2010. The
project was conducted under Antiquities Permit 5714. The client is Navidad
Resources, LLC. The total area investigated consisted of 19.2 acres. Evidence of
prehistoric activity in the area was revealed by the presence of three flakes at well
location 1-1, one flake at well location 2-1, and three flakes at Frac Pit 1. The
flakes are small interior flakes, and it is believed that they are the result of tool
refurbishing activities and not indicative of an actual site worthy of a state trinomial.
Historic artifacts were found at well location 2-1 and consist of three fragments of
whiteware, two fragments of clear glass, and a metal bolt. In addition a fragment of
mammal bone was found. According to prison personnel, the area where the
historic artifacts were found had been used in the past as a place for dumping
trash. Due to the sparse amount of materials recovered, this area was not
considered to be worthy of an official site number. The artifacts from both areas
have been discarded, as they are not considered significant and worthy of curation
Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, the Texas State Library, Navidad Resources,
LLC, the Ferguson Unit, and BVRA.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Navidad Resources, LLC plans to construct three well pads for gas and oil
extraction. Adjacent to one of these well pads will be a frac pit. In addition, there
are two areas where access roads are proposed. The area investigated is on the
Ferguson Unit in eastern Madison County (Figure 1). When constructed, the well
pads will be 250 feet by 250 feet in size. The pads will be enclosed by a fence
that will increase the size of the footprint to 375 feet by 375 feet. Each pad will
have a reserve pit that will be located within the pad area, and these pits will be
eight feet deep. The frac pit will occupy of approximately three acres and will be
located adjacent to the proposed 1-1 well pad site. According to the client, the
two access roads will be constructed by placing rock on the surface, and the
subsurface will not be disturbed. The approximate width of each road will be
sixteen feet. The road to well location 1-1 will be 1350 feet long, and the other
access road will be 1970 feet long. The project area is depicted on the USGS
7.5â topographic quadrangle Baker Lake (3095-343) (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is Navidad Resources, LLC.
The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore. Field supervision was divided
between Mr. Moore and J. Randy Ferguson. The survey involved sixty person
hours and was performed on July 27 and 29, 2010 and August 6, and August 18,
2010. The field crew consisted of J. Randy Ferguson, Rachel Goings, Abidemi
Babatunde Babaloa (AKA Tunde), and Christal McMillion. The reviewing agency
is the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and other archaeological surveys in the
project area and vicinity. The soil survey for Madison County (Neitsch 1994) was
checked for the types of soils at the location of each well pad and access road.
Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in Madison County were
reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites
found in the area. The most relevant source for this project is a report by the
contract firm Antiquities Planning & Consulting (Godwin et al. 1998) that documents
a prehistoric site (41MA25) that was recorded in the vicinity of well location 2-1. The
findings of this project are discussed in the Results section below.
The Principal Investigator, Project Archaeologist, and the survey crew were
taken to the site of the well pads, frac pits, and access roads by Jimmy Estridge
and Tim Estridge of Navidad Resources in order to assess the level of work needed
at each location. Each area was covered with grass used by the prison as pasture
for livestock. Therefore, a surface inspection was not possible. The well pads, frac
pits, and access roads had been staked and the coordinates identified by surveyors
who used control points for accuracy. The well pads, frac pits, and one of the
access roads were investigated by shovel tests. Backhoe trenches were excavated
at the frac pits. The soil removed as a result of shovel tests was screened using Â¼â
hardware cloth. The results of the shovel tests were documented by a shovel test
log (Appendix I), shovel test forms, and field notes. In all, 57 shovel tests were dug
in the various areas. The backhoe trenches were excavated in areas where deep
sandy soil was present in an attempt to identify buried features in the deep sandy
soil. Selected screening was performed in the back dirt and from a column of
Backhoe Trench 1. The walls were cleaned, and profiles were drawn in the field.
Profiles of the backhoe trenches are presented in Appendix I, and photos of the
backhoe trenches are presented in Appendix II. All artifacts or suspected artifacts
were collected for analysis in the laboratory. The project was documented by a
hand-held GPS, project notes, and digital photography. Details regarding the
various areas investigated appear below.

Well Pad 1-1
The size of this well as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet. With
the fenced enclosure, the size of the area will be increased to 375 feet by 375 feet.
The surface was in pasture, and this made a surface inspection impossible except
for the possibility of observing ground historic features that might be present. This
area is on a grassy hillside (Figure 3), and the soils have been identified by the soil
survey as Cazos loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (ChB). This is a deep,
gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. According to the soil survey, clay is
often found at around 14 inches. However, sandy soil was encountered to a depth
of 100 cm in some areas of this well pad. It is also in the area where Gredge fine
sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (GrC) soils are known to occur. This is also a
deep, gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. These soils are reported to
have red clay at seven inches. Thirteen shovel tests were excavated at this
location, and three flakes were found in two of these tests (Figure 4).
Well Pad 2-1 (previous location)
The size of this well pad as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet.
With the fenced enclosure, the size of the area will be increased to 375 feet by 375
feet. The surface was in pasture, and this made a surface inspection impossible
except for the possibility of observing historic features such water troughs, dip
tanks, and other aboveground features that might be present. The soils have been
identified by the soil survey as Zack fine sandy loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes (ZaD)
with clay at five inches. Nine shovel tests were excavated in this area, and three
were positive (Figure 5). At Shovel Test 7, one thinning flake was found in Level
2. At Shovel Test 9, three whiteware fragments and one metal wire nail were
found in the northwest corner of the proposed well pad between 0 and 20
centimeters below the existing ground surface. At Shovel Test 31, two fragments
of clear glass and a piece of bone from a large mammal were found between 10
and 30 centimeters below the existing ground surface.
Well Pad 2-1 (current location)
The client decided to move the location of this well pad to a new area that
overlaps the original site. When the shovel tests excavated at the original site are
included, the number of tests at the final location is eleven, and three were
positive (Figure 5). Two of the positive tests are discussed above. The only new
shovel test that yielded artifacts is Shovel Test 33. A metal bolt of unknown age
was found in this test.

Frac Pit 1
The size of this frac pit as proposed by the client is approximately 3.4 acres.
The surface was in pasture, and this made a surface inspection impossible except
for the possibility of observing above-ground historic features that might be present.
This area is on a grassy hillside, and the soils have been identified by the soil
survey as as Cazos loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (ChB). This is a deep,
gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. According to the soil survey, clay is
often found at around 14 inches. However, sandy soil was encountered to a depth
of 105 cm in some areas of this well pad. It is also in the area where Gredge fine
sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (GrC) soils are known to occur. This is also a
deep, gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. These soils are reported to
have red clay at seven inches. Ten shovel tests were excavated at this location,
and one was positive (Figure 6). A thinning flake was found in Shovel Test 48 at 4050 cm. In addition, two backhoe trenches were excavated at this location, and two
flakes were found in the back dirt of Backhoe Trench 1. Shovel Test 14 was dug at
the site of proposed well pad 1-1. The footprint of the new frac pit overlaps the
northeast corner of the site of the proposed well pad 1-1, and this places Shovel
Test 14 within the footprint of the fract pit as well as at the well site.

Frac Pit 2
The size of this frac pit is approximately 2.9 acres, and it is approximately
250 feet west-southwest of well site 1-1. This new frac pit area is on the opposite
side of a barbed wire fence from pad 1-1 and is in a bottom or low-lying area that
was waist-high in weeds that made it difficult for the crew to conduct a surface
inspection unless above-ground historic features were present. This lowest part
of the frac pit is in the center, and the landform rises slightly towards the east and
west. At the time of this survey, the pasture was void of trees and appeared to
have been farmed fairly recently in the past. The soils at this site have been
identified by the soil survey as Cazos loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (ChB).
This is a deep, gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. According to the soil
survey, clay is often found at around 14 inches. However, sandy soil was
encountered to a depth of 110 cm in some areas of this well pad. It is also in the
area where Gredge fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (GrC) soils are known
to occur. This is also a deep, gently sloping soil on high stream terraces. These
soils are reported to have red clay at seven inches. Five shovel tests were
excavated at this location, and no artifacts were found (Figure 7). One backhoe
trench was excavated at this location, and no artifacts were found.
Well Pad 9-1
The size of this well pad as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet.
With the fenced enclosure, the size of the area will be increased to 375 feet by 375
feet. The surface was in pasture, and this made a surface inspection impossible
except for the possibility of observing historic features such water troughs, dip
tanks, and other aboveground features that might be present. The soils have been
identified by the soil survey as Burleson clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (BuA). The
soil survey states that black clay is present at the surface. Five shovel tests were
excavated, and all were negative (Figure 8). According to prison officials, part of
this area is under water during rainy weather.
Access Road to Well Pad 1-1
The size of this road is 1350 feet long, and its proposed width is sixteen
feet. The road will be constructed by adding gravel to the surface. There will be
no subsurface disturbance. The field survey crew dug shovel tests at intervals of
100 meters. In all four shovel tests were excavated.
Additional Access Road
The size of this road is 1970 feet long, and its proposed width is sixteen
feet. The road will be constructed by adding gravel to the surface. There will be
no subsurface disturbance. The field survey crew dug shovel tests at intervals of
100 meters. In all seven shovel tests were excavated.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin,
Texas and the Atlas revealed one previously recorded prehistoric site (41MA25)
had been recorded in close proximity to the project area. This site is described on
the site form as an upland lithic scatter that yielded chert and jasper debitage, a
fragment of burned bone from a small mammal, fire-cracked rock, and one possible
pebble tool. The artifacts were found at eight centimeters below the surface that
had been plowed and deflated through erosion. The site form does not make a
recommendation in terms of its significance and and/or future work. Site 41MA25 is
in the vicinity of well site 2-1.
The only evidence of prehistoric utilization of the current project area was
the seven small flakes found at well pad location 1-1 and the adjacent frac pit.
They were identified by William A. Dickens as thinning flakes made from chert and
possibly jasper. Dickens views these specimens as evidence of single events in
which tools were modified by tasks such as thinning or reworking. It is the opinion
of the author that there is not enough evidence to warrant assigning a site number
to this area.
The only evidence of historic utilization of the current project area was the
presence of a few historic artifacts. These artifacts consisted of a few fragments of
three whiteware sherds, two pieces of clear glass, one large wire nail, and one
metal bolt found at well pad location 2-1. One bone from a large mammal was also
found in the same area. These artifacts are likely part of a past dumping episode
by the prison. No site number was assigned. At the time of this investigation,
much of the area was being used as pasture for livestock.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
