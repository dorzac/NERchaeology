ABSTRACT
ONE Gas, Inc./Texas Gas Service (One Gas) is proposing to construct and operate the State
Highway (SH) 130/SH 71 approximate 4.6-mile natural gas pipeline along the east side of SH130
(SH 130) in the south and the north side of SH 71 in the north; it is east of Fallwell Lane on SH
71 and north of Pearce Lane on SH 130 in Travis County, Texas. This proposed Project may
require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (Section 404); however, Onion Creek will be avoided via boring.
The proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way
(ROW) and is regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No. 8986 to the
proposed cultural investigation. Much of the area surrounding the proposed Project has been
previously surveyed; however, there are strips that are located between previous surveys or was
surveyed in the 1970s lacking modern survey standards. As well, three known sites, 41TV453,
41TV410, and 41TV540, are located adjacent to the proposed Project and may extend into the
ROW. These areas were identified as the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the cultural resources
investigation (Apex Project No. 453242-002). Locational data of the proposed Project is presented
in Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2 on aerial and topographic maps, respectively. See
Attachment A, Figure 3 for the survey boundaries (APE), previously recorded sites, and shovel
tests/backhoe trench locations. The APE measured 1.71 miles in length and 100 feet in width; the
total acreage investigated measured 20.04 acres.
Between July 8 and 12, 2019, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex), at the request of One Gas,
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the APE. A cultural and environmental
literature review was followed by the cultural resources survey to identify archeological and
historical resources within the APE. The survey methodology followed the Survey Standards of
Texas developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and THC. Moderate to significant
impacts associated with agricultural practices and pipeline development, animal burrows, and
surface erosion were observed within and adjacent to the APE. Erosional features were walked
in an attempt to identify cultural resources. Shovel tests were excavated in areas lacking
subsurface exposure and backhoe trenches were excavated north of site 41TV540 due to
evidence of deeper soil deposits. All were negative for cultural materials.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing in the areas that had not been previously surveyed were
negative for cultural resources. The backhoe testing was located north of site 41TV540 where
deeper deposits were possible; these were negative for cultural resources Site 41TV540 was
previously determined ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) and no evidence of the site was observed to the
north.
Due to the lack of any cultural resources within the APE, Apex recommends that the proposed
Project proceed without further cultural resources investigation as the proposed Project would
have no effect on cultural resources with the potential for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.

INTRODUCTION

ONE Gas, Inc. (ONE Gas) is proposing to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline along the
east side of State Highway 130 (SH 130) and north side of SH 71 in Travis County, Texas,
hereafter referred to as the proposed Project (Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2, aerial imagery
and topographic maps, respectively). The proposed Project occurs to the southeast of the city of
Austin. The southern terminus of the proposed Project is located at the intersection of SH 130
and Pearce Lane. The northern terminus is located at the intersection of SH 71 and Fallwell Lane.
Two alternative routes are being proposed: a 2.60-mile route and a 3.59-mile route that largely
overlap. The shorter route crosses SH 71 and SH 130 next to their intersection and the longer
route crosses SH 71 at an approximate distance of 1,500 feet southeast of the intersection and
SH 130 at an approximate distance of 2,000 feet north of the intersection. Survey boundaries,
site areas, and shovel tests and backhoe trench locations are provided in Appendix A, Figure 3.
The APE for the cultural resources survey consists of the portion of the proposed Project adjacent
to known cultural resource sites with undetermined boundaries or that had not been previously
surveyed or surveyed in the 1970s predating modern survey standards, measuring approximately
1.53 miles (Apex Project No. 453242-002). The pedestrian survey of the APE consisted of a 100foot wide corridor for the cultural resources investigation.
This proposed Project may require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Section 404); however, there will be no impacts to potential
waters of the United States. In a Desktop Review, Apex biologist identified three potential waters
of the United States (US) at seven locations. however, Apex recommended that the crossing on
Onion Creek be constructed by horizontal directional drilling for avoidance purposes. The other
crossings could be directionally drilled or trenched and restored following the requirements of
NWP 12 and its general conditions.
The proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) ROW and is
regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No. 8986 to the investigation of the APE,
described as portions of the SH 130/ SH 71 4.6-mile natural gas pipeline project that are located
adjacent to known cultural resource sites or located in areas that have not been previously
surveyed or were surveyed predating modern survey standards. See Attachment A, Figure 3 for
the survey boundaries, previously recorded sites, and shovel test and backhoe trench locations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is in southeastern Travis County southeast of the city of Austin, Texas; it is
located within the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau Section of the Gulf Coastal Plains
Physiographic Province and bordered by the Balcones Escarpment to the east. It lies in the
Blackland Prairie ecological region characterized by tall grasses. Hydrology, topography,
vegetation, and soils within the proposed Project are detailed below.
3.1 Hydrology
The proposed Project is located in the Carson Creek-Colorado River (120902050409)
subwatershed, which is located within the larger (HUC 8) Austin-Travis Lakes (12090205) and
Lower Colorado-Cummins (12090301) watersheds (EPA 2017). Aerial imagery, United States
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, USGS National Hydrography Data (NHD), and the
National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) database (2018a) indicate that there are three tributaries
marked on USGS maps as blue-lines, intersected by the proposed Project. The NWI map did not
indicate the presence of freshwater emergent, forested/shrub wetlands or ponds intersected by
the proposed Project.
3.2 Topography
Elevation of the proposed Project ranges from 419 feet above mean sea level (amsl) at the
crossing with Onion Creek to 460 feet above amsl approximately 800 feet southeast of the
intersection of SH 130 and SH 71. The topography of the proposed Project is mainly rolling and
decreases in elevation near the creek crossings (Attachment A, Figure 2).
3.3 Vegetation
The proposed Project is located within the Crops (44) vegetation type according to McMahan et
al. (1984). This vegetation type consists of cultivated cover crops or row crops that provide food
and/or fiber for human or domestic animal consumption. This vegetation type may also portray
grassland associated with crop rotation and fallow fields. Review of aerial imagery indicates the
vegetation intersected by the proposed Project was primarily agricultural fields or rangeland prior
to the construction of SH 130 and is now disturbed roadside, herbaceous communities.
3.4 Soils
Eight soil units are intersected by the proposed Project alignment as mapped in the Web Soil
Survey. Table 1 below lists the soil units within the 100-foot corridor along the proposed Project
(NRCS 2016).

CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The traditional cultural sequence of central Texas includes the Paleoindian period (11,500 to 8800
BP) followed by the Early (8800 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 4000 BP), and Late (4000 to 1300
or 1200 BP) Archaic periods; the latter Late Prehistoric period (approximately 1200 to around 250
BP) is followed by the Historic period (250 BP into the mid-to late 19th century) (Collins 2004).
These temporal divisions are reflected in changes in technologies and subsistence adaptations.
Archeological site types range from lithic scatters and isolated heaths to open camps, burned rock
middens, hearth fields, lithic procurement/quarries, rockshelters and cemeteries. Within the
general area of the proposed Project, most of the prehistoric sites are open camps situated on
alluvial terraces near streams or rivers. The cultural assemblages may include fire cracked rock
(FCR), lithic debitage, lithic tools (hammerstones, unifaces, bifaces, diagnostic projectile points),
ground stones, and ceramic sherds. Historic site types range from Mexican period ranchos, early
Anglo farmsteads and settlements to the Camino Real de los Tejas, a network of roads linking
outposts and supply towns. Most of the historic sites, within the general area of the proposed
Project, are homesteads and tenant farms dating to the late 19th century.
A preliminary review of the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
Database (ATLAS) was conducted to assess known cultural resources and previous surveys
conducted within a 1.0-mile radius study area (0.5 mile in each direction of the proposed Project).
Thirty archaeological sites have been recorded and segments of fourteen previous cultural
resource surveys are located within the study area (ATLAS 2019). Details from these sites and
surveys are presented below. While more than fourteen sites are listed below, not all of the sites
are described as they are located outside of the study area. Many of the sites are listed multiple
times as they were investigated several times for reassessment, testing, and mitigation.
Previous cultural resource surveys:
Previous cultural resource surveys:
The results of multiple permits, TAC permit numbers 2693, 2692, and 2691, were documented in
one report linked under TAC permit number 2691 (ATLAS 2019). Between 2001 and 2004,
PBS&J investigated SH 130, Segments A, B, and C, resulting in the survey of approximately
6,534 acres and examination of 97 cultural resource sites. TAC permit numbers 2693 (Segment
C) and 2692 (Segment B) overlap the proposed Project. The linear survey for TAC permit number
2693 was conducted in 2004, documenting sites 41TV2159, 41TV416, 41TV419, 41TV421, and
41TV540 within the study area. TAC permit number 2692 was conducted in 2001,
documenting/revisiting sites 41TV455, 41TV456, 41TV1991, 41TV410, 41TV1988, 41TV540,
41TV2160, and 41TV2161 within the study area. Only one site, 41TV456, within the study area
was National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) tested. Trenching at site 41TV410 led to the
discovery of a deeply buried prehistoric component, which was excavated as part of the
pedestrian survey. None of the seven sites, recommended for further work in Segment B, received
data recovery. The site types included unknown Prehistoric and Archaic period lithic scatters,
campsites, quarry/workshops, as well as historic farmsteads, cemeteries, house sites, trash
dumps, tenant house sites, and historic Indian bison kill sites (ATLAS 2019).
As well, multiple surveys were conducted by Hicks and Company under TAC permit number 3001
over several years; the survey of Additional Properties in Segment B of SH 130, resulted in the
survey of 514.5 acres between August 2004 and October 2006 (ATLAS 2019). During the course
of the survey, a total of 964 shovel tests, 96 backhoe trenches, and 30 hand-excavated units were

ONE Gas, Inc.

excavated within the additional properties. Twenty-nine previously recorded sites and 14 new
sites were identified within the ‘Additional Properties’ of the proposed SH 130 right-of-way (ATLAS
2019). Within the study area, sites 41TV2160, 41TV2161, 41TV2349, 41TV540, 41TV421,
41TV1625, 41TV410, 41TV419, 41TV2159, 41TV420, 41TV454, 41TV455, and 41TV456 were
recorded in 2005; a second survey in 2005 documented sites 41TV2159 and 41TV453; and sites
41TV452 and 41TV420 were recorded/revisited in 2003. Sites 41TV2161 and 41TV2162 (located
beyond the study area) were recommended for additional investigations to determine if they were
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Site 41TV2162 was tested by Hicks & Company under a
separate permit and the portions of the site overlapping the right-of-way were determined to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP; the remaining portion of the site was not assessed for
significance. Site 41TV2161 was determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and impacts
to this site were mitigated by TRC under a separate permit (ATLAS 2019). All of the other sites
were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (ATLAS 2019). The surveys overlap
portions of the proposed Project.
A linear survey for a remote sensing project for TxDOT was conducted by PBS&J in 2006 under
TAC permit number 4239 (ATLAS 2019). Sites 41TV2159 and 41TV453 were recorded/revisited
within the boundaries of the study area (ATLAS 2019). The proposed Project traverses this
survey.
A large area survey was conducted in 1979 for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Data
is not available on the ATLAS database (2018); however, sites 41TV408, 41TV412 through 422,
41TV2159, 41TV432, 41TV433, 41TV1645, 41TV421, 41TV1988, 41TV410, and 41TV1625 were
documented within the study area. A second large area survey was conducted for EPA in 1979
to the west of the above referenced survey; sites 41TV410, 41TV2411, 41TV453, 41TV204,
41TV443, 41TV2441, 41TV2352, 41TV440, 41TV441, 41TV217, 41TV449, 41TV1862, 41TV451,
41TV452, 41TV2351, 41TV2347, 41TV2346, 41TV457, 41TV456, 41TV454, 41TV1991,
41TV460, 41TV442, 41TV465, 41TV450, 41TV459, 41TV458, 41TV444, 41TV448, 41TV447,
41TV445, 41TV446, 41TV461, 41TV463, 41TV464, and 41TV17 were documented within its
boundaries (ATLAS 2019). However, no data is available on the ATLAS regarding the survey
methodology or results for these 1979 surveys. Within the boundaries of this large survey, a small
area survey and testing project was conducted for Travis County under TAC 2018 in 1998; sites
41TV441, 41TV217, 41TV449, 41TV451, 41TV452, and 41TV1862 were documented, and sites
41TV441 and 41TV217 were tested for NRHP eligibility (ATLAS 2019). Prehistoric site 41TV441
was determined NRHP eligible and 41TV217 may be part of 41TV441. The two large surveys
cross the proposed Project; approximately half of the above-listed sites are located within the
study area.
A linear survey was conducted in 2009 for the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) for the
Clear Springs to Hutto Transmission Line Project under TAC permit number 5073; it is located
immediately east of SH 130 and resulted in the recording or revisit assessments at sites 41TV443,
41TV2351, 41TV2346, 41TV457, 41TV456, 41TV540, and 41TV2349 (ATLAS 2019). Prehistoric
sites 41TV457 and 41TV2351, as well as the multicomponent site 41TV456 and historic site
41TV2346, were assessed as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (ATLAS 2019). The survey is
located east of SH 130 and east of the proposed Project.
In 2004, a small linear survey for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was
conducted by Hicks and Company for Lake and Land Management and Kinder Morgan’s Sandhill

Pipeline. Sites 41TV457 and 41TV456 were recorded or revisited within the study area and
41TV1991 was investigated beyond the study area, (ATLAS 2019). The survey boundary parallels
the proposed Project near the intersection of SH 130 and SH 71.
A large 1993 survey is plotted on the ATLAS (2019) without any specific data; it overlaps the
proposed Project and includes sites 41TV410, 41TV1988, and 41TV2125 located beyond the
study area and sites 41TV540, 41TV2160, 41TV2161, and 41TV2349 within the study area.
A linear survey was conducted in 1985 for TxDOT along the west bound access road of SH 71
from east of FM 973 to beyond the western boundary of the study area. No data is available on
the ATLAS and no sites have been plotted within its boundary (ATLAS 2019). It is located
immediately west of the proposed Project.
Previously recorded sites (due to the extensive number of previously recorded sites within the
study area, a representative sample is described below):
41TV2159, a historic artifact scatter, is located on an upland hilltop, covered in short grasses;
the entire area had been plowed. Artifacts were recovered in two shovel tests on a hillslope and
were suspected of eroding down from the uphill deposits. The site was SHPO determined
ineligible in 2006 (ATLAS 2019).
41TV416, a prehistoric artifact scatter, is located on the north bank of Onion Creek; it consists of
lithic debitage and mussel shelf fragments on a slight rise in a plowed field and was recommended
NRHP ineligible (ATLAS 2019).
41TV419 was recorded as a very light prehistoric lithic scatter with minor amounts of fire cracked
rock; it is located on a terrace edge overlooking Onion Creek. The depth of the cultural deposits,
as observed in a gully cutbank, appeared to be 15 to 20 centimeters (ATLAS 2019). It was not
assessed for significance.
41TV1988 was recorded as a prehistoric open camp located in an open field; the assemblage
included three bifaces, utilized flakes, and lithic debitage (ATLAS 2019). Although Phase II testing
was recommended; however, the Texas SHPO determined the site to be NRHP ineligible.
41TV2349, a prehistoric open camp and historic trash scatter, is located on a broad floodplain in
previously cleared and plowed fields. The assemblage included lithic debitage, cores, a few formal
tools, historic ceramics, glass, and bricks (ATLAS 2019). This very large site fills the entire width
of the Onion Creek floodplain within the inside meander of an upland ridge system. The location
of the greatest density of artifacts was seen outside the survey boundary to the east; the site was
completely disturbed within the survey boundary and no further work was warranted (ATLAS
2019).
41TV1625, a buried prehistoric open camp, is located on an upper terrace of Onion Creek with
natural erosion and farming, fenceline, and electric transmission line disturbances. However, the
site appears to contain a buried intact prehistoric component with potential for deep deposits.
Backhoe trenching and shovel testing was recommended (ATLAS 2019).

41TV2162, a prehistoric open camp and historic residential area, is located across a hilltop and
downslope into the Onion Creek floodplain. The historic materials included brick, ceramic, glass,
wire nails, metal frags, and a steel auto chassis with wood frame. The prehistoric lithic
assemblage, including lithic debitage, fire cracked rock, hammerstones, manos, and bifaces, is
found across the entire site, with deeply buried occupational deposits in the floodplain (ATLAS
2019).
41TV2160, a historic scatter located on the edge of a hilltop overlooking Onion Creek to the
northwest, was determined NRHP ineligible by the Texas SHPO (ATLAS 2019).
41TV2161, a prehistoric Archaic period open camp was determined NRHP eligible and subjected
to a data recovery/mitigation. A sample of the site was investigated under TAC permit number
4064 prior to its destruction by the planned construction of SH 130 (ATLAS 2019). TRC
Environmental Corporation (TRC) conducted geoarchaeological documentation and data
recovery excavations in 2016. The investigations were restricted to a 70 centimeter (cm) thick
target zone between 220 and 290 cm below surface (bs) on the western side of the site. The site
has been fully mitigated within their project area (ATLAS 2019).
41TV2349, a widely scattered prehistoric lithic scatter and historic trash scatter, was recorded by
the LCRA under TAC permit number 5073 in 2009 (ATLAS 2019). It is located adjacent to and
just south of SH 130 in a combination of old pasture and cultivated land. This is a very large site
and fills the entire 1-kilometer width of the Onion Creek floodplain which at this location fills the
inside meander of an upland ridge system that rises about 50 feet above the valley floor (ATLAS
2019). The assemblage includes lithic flakes, cores, few tools, historic ceramics, glass, and bricks.
The portion of the site located in the SH 130 ROW and the electric transmission line has been
determined NRHP ineligible; this includes the proposed Project.
41TV441, a buried prehistoric open camp, is located on a terrace near the southern bank of Onion
Creek. It is described as a Toyah period occupation with extensive lithic debitage, fire cracked
rock, burned caliche, charcoal, bone, ceramics, and bifaces. The Texas SHPO determined the
site to be NRHP eligible (ATLAS 2019).
41TV451, a prehistoric quarry/procurement area, is located on a large eroded bluff overlooking
bottomlands. The site consists of chert cobbles and the density of artifacts varied across the site.
The site was Texas SHPO determined to be NRHP ineligible (ATLAS 2019).
41TV2347, a prehistoric open camp, is located at the base of the slope of a deep artificial pit in
the floodplain of Onion Creek. The assemblage consists of a low density lithic and fire cracked
rock scatter; the site was determined to be NRHP ineligible (ATLAS 2019).
41TV4547, a prehistoric Late Archaic open campsite and historic scatter, is located on a low
terrace adjacent to Onion Creek; part of the site is in a plowed field and riparian woodlands. The
historic component consists of traces of a historic structure, glass fragments, metal fragments,
brick, and ironstone. The prehistoric component, recorded up to 50 centimeters in depth, consists
of lithic debitage, fire cracked rock, ground stone, bone, and mussel shell, along with Fairland and
Castroville dart points. However, the Texas SHPO determined the site to be NRHP ineligible due
to poor preservation (ATLAS 2019).

41TV441, a buried prehistoric open camp, is located on a terrace near the southern bank of Onion
Creek. It is described as a Toyah period occupation with extensive lithic debitage, fire cracked
rock, burned caliche, charcoal, bone, ceramics, and bifaces. The Texas SHPO determined the
site to be NRHP eligible (ATLAS 2019).
41TV410, a prehistoric open camp, is located on a broad alluvial terrace adjacent to Onion Creek
(ATLAS 2019). According to the investigating archeologist, the only portions of this site, with the
potential for intact deeply buried deposits, are located to the north nearest Onion Creek. These
areas are also the only portions of the site that have not been thoroughly investigated. Deposits
could extend up to 5 to 6 meters in depth and future investigations should primarily consist of
deep trenching (ATLAS 2019). It is located in the proposed Project; however, it is located within
a county park, the Onion Creek Greenbelt Park, that will be directionally bored to avoid impacts
to the park.
41TV540 is a very large prehistoric open camp on an old terrace of Onion Creek. The assemblage
consists of primarily quarry debris: cores, quarry blanks, large flakes, and tested cobbles (ATLAS
2019). The portions investigated as part of the SH 130 project contained very few artifacts, no
features, and did not contain significant deposits to warrant inclusion in the NRHP; this includes
the proposed Project. However, it was recommended that the site boundary be reevaluated as
the northeast corner of the site was later tested by UTSA-CAR and resulted in the identification
of several features, organic preservation, and numerous artifacts (ATLAS 2019).
Within the study area, site settings include prominent ridge tops, upland hilltops, gravelly hillsides,
large ridges overlooking Onion Creek, broad upland terraces overlooking drainages, low terraces,
broad floodplains, previously cleared and plowed fields, large eroded bluffs overlooking
bottomlands, and broad alluvial terraces. Site types include prehistoric open camps, lithic scatters,
lithic procurement area/quarries, and isolated finds; as well as historic farmsteads, cemeteries,
house sites, trash dumps, tenant house sites, artifact scatters and historic Indian bison kill sites
Three sites (41TV540, 41TV410, and 41TV453), located adjacent to the proposed Project,
warranted further investigation to determine whether they extended beyond their known
boundaries into the proposed Project and whether intact cultural deposits exist. As well, areas not
previously surveyed or surveyed in the 1970s, predating modern survey standards, required
further investigations; this included approximately 1.71 mile of the proposed Project on the north
side of SH 71 and east of SH 130 south of SH 71; these areas are considered to have a moderate
to high probability of containing cultural resources.

METHODOLOGY

Because the survey area is located on State Public Land, TxDOT, a TAC permit was acquired
prior to the cultural resources survey. TAC permit number 8986 was assigned to the Principle
Investigator on July 01, 2019.
Prior to the survey, the THC’s restricted use ATLAS database (ATLAS 2019) and the Texas State
Library and Archives Commission’s (TSL 2019) historical county maps for Travis county were
reviewed to identify significant cultural resources within the 0.5-mile study area of the proposed
Project.
The survey was conducted by the Principal Investigator, who meets the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology (NPS 1983) and the requirements
for Principal Investigator defined in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 26;
and two cultural resources field technicians. The intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed
Project met the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (THC n.d.). The pedestrian survey was
conducted in 15-foot (4.6 meter) transect intervals and was augmented with judgmental shovel
testing to a minimum of 2 feet to 3.3 feet (60 cm to one meter) in depth or as restricted by hardened
subsoil of bedrock. The shovel tests (STs) were to be used to assess the subsurface for cultural
deposits and extensive distributions of surficial cultural materials defined the extended boundaries
of known archeological sites. Shovel test soil descriptions, along with Munsell color designations,
were collected for STs that varied from their predecessor. Existing ground disturbances
associated with agricultural practices, mechanical clearing, fence lines and fire breaks, animal
burrows, and surface erosion were examined within and adjacent to the APE in lieu of shovel
testing, allowing for larger exposures than those provided by STs. The locations of backhoe
trenches (BHTs) and STs were entered into the GPS unit.
The purpose of the investigation was to identify cultural resources within the proposed Project
and make recommendations about their significance; however, the survey was negative for
cultural resources. The draft technical report meets the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines
for Cultural Resource Management Reports (CTA 1987). The report describes the natural and
cultural history of the project area, discusses the methodology and results of the survey, and
concludes with recommendations about whether further archeological work should be conducted
in the project area.
The project records will be curated at a Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) per
THC requirements. The draft report will be submitted to the THC for review and comments; copy
to be provided to the client and TxDOT as requested. Once approved, the final report completion
requirements of the THC will be met; this will include curation of records at TARL. The curation
form from the certified curatorial facility will be forwarded to the THC. One hard copy of the final
report will be submitted to TxDOT and the client, as requested. One hard copy report will be
furnished to the THC along with a tagged formatted PDF electronic copy on CD, the Abstracts in
Texas Contract Archeology Summary form, and shapefiles showing the boundary of the project
area, and areas surveyed will be submitted to the THC.

RESULTS

The APE included three segments of the proposed Project that had not been previously surveyed
or was surveyed in the 1970s, predating modern survey standards that included areas adjacent
to three prehistoric cultural sites that may extend beyond their original boundaries, measuring
approximately 1.58 mile in length. The sites, 41TV540, 41TV410, and 41TV453, were determined
ineligible for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP; however, this determination was made for
the portion of each site within previous survey boundaries which did not include some areas of
the proposed Project. The previously surveyed portions of each site were not resurveyed as they
were considered NRHP ineligible. Information from the previous site forms suggested that the site
boundaries may extend beyond their recorded boundaries. The Onion Creek Greenway Park,
including site 41TV410 will be avoided by directional boring, and was not included in the cultural
resources investigation.
Additional sites in or near the proposed Project did not warrant further investigation as they were
either determined NRHP ineligible, had been fully mitigated, or are located a sufficient distance
from the proposed Project. These are discussed in Chapter 4.0, Cultural History and Previous
Investigations.
The APE was subjected to a systematic pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing and
backhoe trenching, as needed. Based on field observations, the proposed Project was
significantly impacted by highway construction, electric utility corridor construction, past pasture
and agricultural practices; clearing and blading; animal burrows; fence lines; sheet wash; and
minor erosional gullies. Erosional exposures, measuring between two and six feet in depth were
observed between ST 32 and ST 33 and in the area of ST 24 through 30; these were walked in
an attempt to identify cultural resources. See Table 2 for shovel test data, Appendix A, Figure 3
for survey boundaries, existing site areas, and shovel test and backhoe trench locations, and
Appendix B for photographs of the ST locations and landscape settings.
The survey was initiated at the northern terminus of the APE along the north side of SH 71 just
east of Falwell Lane. The western limit was a large wet drainage feature which was not shovel
tested. Twenty-three negative STs (ST 1 through 23) were excavated along the previously
unsurveyed segment between the drainage feature at Falwell Lane and a large drainage borrow
adjacent to the intersection of SH 130 and SH 71. The remainder of the proposed Project located
along the majority of SH 71 had been previously surveyed.
The northern portion of the APE along SH 130, located between SH 71 and Onion Creek, was
surveyed between two disturbances related to the construction of a Kinder Morgan oil and gas
pipeline and an Enterprise oil and gas pipeline. Representatives of the pipelines walked their
routes with the Principal Investigator prior to the survey in this area. Shovel Tests 24 through 30
were excavated in this area with negative results. Approximately 500’ of this proposed project,
located north of Onion Creek will be directionally drilled as part of the crossing of Onion Creek;
the official site 41TV453 boundary is located in this area and will not be impacted. No cultural
deposits were encountered along the 100’ wide APE of the proposed Project within and north of
site 41TV453.
Site 41TV410, a prehistoric open camp, is located within the Onion Creek Greenbelt Park, located
south of Onion Creek According to the ATLAS (2019), the only portions of this site, with the
potential for intact deeply buried deposits, are located to the north nearest Onion Creek. These

areas are also the only portions of the site that have not been thoroughly investigated. However,
it is located within the county park, the Onion Creek Greenbelt Park, that will be directionally bored
to avoid impacts to the park and thereby, avoiding site 41TV410.
The southernmost portion of the APE extends south between the area to be directionally bored
between Onion Creek Greenbelt Park/site 41TV410 and the previously surveyed site 41TV540.
Erosional cuts located south of 41TV410 show evidence of deep soil profiles, therefore, a series
of BHTs (BHTs 1-5) were excavated to the south beyond the limits of the directional boring of site
41TV410/Onion Creek. These were excavated to approximately 4-5 feet in depth and 2 feet width;
all were negative for cultural resources.
Site 41TV540 is a very large prehistoric open camp on an old terrace of Onion Creek. The
assemblage consists of primarily quarry debris: cores, quarry blanks, large flakes, and tested
cobbles (ATLAS 2019). The portions investigated as part of the SH 130 project contained very
few artifacts, no features, and did not contain significant deposits to warrant inclusion in the
NRHP. It was recommended that the site boundary be reevaluated as the northeast corner of the
site was later tested by UTSA-CAR and resulted in the identification of several features, organic
preservation, and numerous artifacts. However, the proposed Project is located just to the north
of the northwest corner of the site and the soils observed in erosional cuts was shallow in nature.
Three negative STs (ST 31 through 33) were excavated immediately north of the known boundary
of site 41TV540, which is adjacent to a drainage feature or tributary to Onion Creek.
The entire APE was negative for cultural resources. See associated photographs in Appendix B
(B-1 through B-16).

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The pedestrian survey and strategically placed shovel tests and backhoe trenches, within the
areas that had not been previously surveyed, were negative for cultural resources. Sites 41TV453
and 41TV540 were not observed within the APE and site 41TV410 will be avoided via directional
drilling of the county park located south of Onion Creek and was not included in the APE for the
cultural resources survey.
Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further cultural resources
investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural resources with the potential
for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
currently proposed infrastructure, then further archeological investigations may be necessary in
those areas prior to any construction. If evidence of intact archeological and historic resources is
identified during construction, work in the immediate area should cease until the in advertent
discoveries are assessed by a professional archeologist.
