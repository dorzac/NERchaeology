Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In October of 2011, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive archeological survey
for the City of San Marcos Hutchison Street Drainage Project located adjacent to the San Marcos River at
the northwest corner of the intersection of CM Allen Parkway and East Hutchison Street (Figure 1). The
project is partially located within right-of-way (ROW) owned by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) and is being funded by the City of San Marcos. The existing drainage of the project area
collects along E. Hutchison Street and outfalls into the San Marcos River east of CM Allen Parkway
through a 24-inch corrugated metal pipe (CMP). The existing drainage system is no longer functioning
adequately, which results in flooding in the project area. According to current design plans, the proposed
project would replace drainage features along the streets, as well as replace the 24-inch CMP outfall with
a seven-foot by three-foot reinforced concrete box culvert (RBC). The proposed RBC would be located
in the same location as the outfall structure. Additionally, a water quality pond would be constructed
adjacent to the San Marcos River near the outfall location. Maximum depth of impact at both the outfall
and the detention pond locations would be nine-feet below ground surface. With the exception of the
outfall and the detention pond, the proposed project would be conducted entirely within existing roadway
ROW. Since the project will take place on land to be owned by the City of San Marcos, it is subject to
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, since the lead permitting agency for the project is the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), a federal entity, the project is also subject to the
requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
This project was previously reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and a 100 percent
intensive archeological survey, supplemented with mechanical trenching, was recommended for the
portions of the proposed project that lay between CM Allen Parkway and the San Marcos River (Figure
2) in their response dated February 9, 2011 for an approximate survey area of 1.02 acres (letter, Martin to
Brooks: Appendix A: Regulatory Correspondence).
The field investigations were conducted over the requested survey area on October 18, 2011 by Hicks &
Company archeologists. The cultural resource investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented
by mechanical trenching. A total of five backhoe trenches (BHT 1-5) were placed within the San Marcos
City Park, where underlying sediments were accessible. Subsurface cultural materials were recovered
from BHTs 2-5. Collectively, these deposits were recorded as newly documented Site 41HY485. As
recorded, the cultural remains associated with Site 41HY485 include 17 flakes, a biface fragment, and
three burned rocks recovered intermittently from depths of 20-100 centimeters below ground surface
(cmbgs). Largely, the project area exhibits a high degree of disturbance due to the installation of
underground utilities, road and parking lot construction, landform modification, and park maintenance.
Due to the low density of artifacts, lack of temporal diagnostics and discernable cultural features, and
degree of disturbance, the known segment of the site 41HY485 that lies within the proposed project area
has minimal research potential. As a result, Hicks & Company concludes that no prehistoric or historic
deposits that can be construed as potentially significant to the City of San Marcos’ or the State of Texas’
history under any criteria of the Texas Antiquities Code exists within the Area of Potential Effects (APE).
Based on the results of the investigations, Hicks & Company recommended that no additional
investigation or coordination be required for this project relative to the ACT and received THC
concurrence on December 9, 2011(Appendix A). In the event that unrecorded cultural resources are
encountered during construction, all ground disturbing activities in the project area will cease pending
notification and comment from the THC. Since the current investigations resulted in the recordation of a
new archeological site, Site 41HY485, all project related materials will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Resource Library (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geology and Soils
According to the Geological Atlas of Texas (GAT), the survey area is predominantly underlain by
Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) containing gravel, sand, silt, and clay in various proportions with gravel
more prominent in the older, higher terraces (Figure 3) (BEG 1974). A small portion of the project area,
towards its eastern extent, is mapped as recent Alluvium (Qal). This formation is described as floodplain
deposits, including indistinct low terrace deposits of clay, silt, sand and/or gravel. Both of these
geological formations coincide with the arrival of the first humans into the Americas. Hence, the project
area has potential to contain intact and deeply buried cultural deposits.
Soils mapped within the proposed project area include Tinn clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded
(approximately 85 percent of the proposed project area) and Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (15 percent
of project area). The Tinn series is described as clayey alluvium of Holocene age derived from mixed
sources located on and within flood plain settings. These soils are moderately well drained Typic
Hapluderts with a solum thickness that can exceed 200 centimeters in depth. Undisturbed areas often have
gilgai, slickensides and/or wedge-shaped aggregates. These soils crack when dry with cracks often
extending vertically 20-30 centimeters from the ground surface. The Heiden series is described as clayey
residuum weathered from clayey shale derived from the Eagleford or Taylor marl formations located on
plains landforms. Heiden soils are well drained Udic Haplusterts with a solum thickness that can exceed
200 centimeters in depth. Theses soils formed, mainly, in weakly consolidated Upper Cretaceous
formations of calcareous marine sediments, high in montmorillonite clays and most often occupy
erosional upland settings.

Flora and Fauna
The project area is located along an ecotonal crescent on the western extent of the Blackland Prairies at its
interface with the Edwards Plateau just below the Balcones Escarpment. The Blackland Prairies
Ecological Region encompasses approximately 11.5 million acres of nearly-level to rolling prairies and
grasslands interspersed with dense woodlands. The Edwards Plateau Ecological Region is an uplifted and
elevated region now categorized as brush land after continual overgrazing that encompasses nearly 24
million acres throughout Central Texas (TPWD 2011).
Vegetation other than cropland that would be expected in the area according to mapping conducted by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (McMahan et al. 1984) would include little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas grama (Bouteloua
rigidiseta), three-awn (Aristida spp.), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper),
buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), windmillgrass (Chloris spp.), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus
paniculatus), western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae),
Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis), live oak (Quercus virginiana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and
mesquite.
A high diversity of fish and wildlife is known to exist in Central Texas and Hays County. According to
records maintained by Texas A&M University (2009), amphibians and reptiles in the county are
represented by five species of salamanders, 21 species of frogs and toads, eight species of turtles, eleven
different kinds of skinks and lizards, 27 different snakes and the American alligator. Texas Tech

University (2008) has documented at least 60 species of mammals in this region, while 471 bird species
have been documented within the oaks and prairies region that includes Hays County (TPWD 2003).
Commonly occurring mammal species that would be expected in the project area include but are not
limited to: coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),
eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Common reptile species include
the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), collared lizard
(Crotaphytus collaris), checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and water snake (Nerodia
erythrogaster). Frequent bird species would include northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern
cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), house sparrow (Passer domesticus),
house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), redshouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter cooperii), great horned owl (Bubo
virginianus), gray phase of the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), barred owl (Strix varia), common grackle
(Quiscalus quiscula), great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), and
black vulture (Coragyps atratus).

Climate
Presently, the local climate of Hays County is marked by long, hot summers with high temperature
averages of 35-degrees Celsius (95-degrees Fahrenheit) and short, dry, mild winters with a low
temperature average of 12-degrees Celsius (54-degrees Fahrenheit) (Larkin and Bomar 1983). From
spring to fall, the area’s climate is primarily influenced by marine climatological variations from the Gulf
of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean (Slade 1986). During the winter months, the agents of climate variation
are Arctic currents and Pacific air masses (Bomar 1985).
Annual precipitation averages 85 centimeters (cms), which falls mostly during two distinct periods
occurring in the early summer and in the fall. During the months of May, June, and September, prevailing
warm moisture-carrying winds from the Gulf front with cooler and drier northern winds. When they
interface above the Balcones Escarpment, often heavy thunder storms result (Carr 1967). During these
wetter months, rainfall averages about 9 cms. Between November and March precipitation is at its lowest,
dropping to an average of approximately 5.3 inches a month (Larkin and Bomar 1983).
It is reported that the potential incidence of high-magnitude flooding is greater for the Balcones
Escarpment area of Central Texas than for any other region of the United States (Caran and Baker 1986).
In part, this is due to the climatic provenance of Central Texas; the area lies within a convergence zone of
high and low pressure air masses. Additionally, tropical storms and hurricanes penetrate into the area
from the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, producing some of the areas heaviest rainfalls (Patton and
Baker 1976). Once rainfall hits the ground, runoff absorption rates become a function of an area’s
physiography. Along the Balcones Escarpment, valleys are narrow, slopes are sparsely covered by
vegetation, and the surface is variably exposed bedrock or overlain by thin upland soils. Below the
Escarpment, on the Blackland Prairie, soils with low-infiltration capacity severely limit absorption rates
(Caran and Baker 1986; Patton and Baker 1976). Interacting together, these factors greatly increase runoff
and drainage discharge.

Hydrology
Along the Balcones Escarpment, there are numerous springs and artesian water sources distributed fairly
evenly along the fault zone. Some of the largest and historically significant of these springs originate from

the highly prolific Edwards Aquifer (Brune 1975). This underground reservoir is essentially a series of
interconnected caverns formed in Edwards limestone, Austin Chalk and Taylor Marl. This karstic system
discharges as springs and seeps, and recharges as surface precipitation and overland flow enter the
recharge zone.
With approximately 200 springs and an average discharge of 4,300 liters per second (lps), the San Marcos
Springs (also known as Aquarena Springs) is the second largest spring system in Texas, second only to
Comal Springs (Brune 1985:10). Since 1892, when records began to be kept, the largest recorded
discharge from San Marcos Springs was recorded on June 12, 1975 at 8,490 liters per second (lps). The
lowest recorded discharge was 1,300 lps on August 15, 1956 (Brune 1985:224). The discharge from these
springs headwaters the San Marcos River, one of the more prominent waterways of the Guadalupe River
drainage system. The San Marcos flows in a general southeasterly direction. Approximately 8-9
kilometers downstream of the spring head, the San Marcos intersects with the Blanco River, its primary
tributary. Sixty-four kilometers further downstream the San Marcos merges with the waters of the
Guadalupe River west of the city of Gonzalez. Other local tributaries of the San Marcos River include
Sink Creek, Sessoms Creek, Purgatory Creek, and Willow Springs Creek.

Land Use
The requested survey area for the proposed project is in San Marcos at the northeast corner of CM Allen
Parkway and Hutchison Street in a city park adjacent to the San Marcos River and encompasses
approximately 1.11 acres (Figure 4). Within the proposed project area, the existing drainage collects
along E. Hutchison Street and outfalls into the San Marcos River east of CM Allen Parkway through a 24­
inch corrugated metal pipe (CMP). The existing drainage system is no longer functioning adequately,
which creates flooding in the project area, hence the need for the new drainage system. Predominately,
the proposed project area is covered by parking lot which services the adjacent park (Figures 5 and 6)
that lies approximately five feet below grade of CM Allen Parkway (Figure 7). Just southeast of the
proposed project area, is the Texas Historical Landmark listed Old Fish Hatchery Office Building
(Figures 8 and 9). This structure was constructed in 1894-95 and originally served as the office for the
San Marcos National Fish Hatchery, established in 1893 near the headwaters of the San Marcos River.
This facility was closed in 1965, and the site was given to Southwest Texas State University. For a brief
time the building served as the main offices for the school’s Aquatic Biological Center until it was moved
to its present location. Historic resources for this proposed project were previously coordinated between
HNTB’s senior historian and the Texas Historical Commission (letter Barker to Victor, September 30,
2011: Appendix A).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Archeological Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas Archeological Region (Figure 10). Most of the
recent chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct time periods, roughly representing a
12,000 year sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the culture-historical sequences provided by Collins
(2004) and Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800-5800 BP),
Middle Archaic (5800-4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000-1400 BP), Post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric (AD
600-1600), and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions represent convenient temporal
categories, they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence and are reflected in
changes in lithic and other technologies.

Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in South and Central Texas is believed to be related to the well-known biggame hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the well-documented early Paleoindian
sites in Texas that are associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of Central Texas on
the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In general, early Paleoindian sites are
scarce in Central Texas, or at least less visible than later sites. Conversely, later Paleoindian sites are
much more numerous, although both are usually identified from only surface-collected artifacts (Black
and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several late Paleoindian sites does suggest that small game
was exploited rather than extinct megafauna. This data supports the idea that a hunting and gathering
lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of Southwest and Central Texas prior to the Early
Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas have typically been associated with lanceolate projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, and Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff
(Turner and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235) (Collins 2004)
equate three styles of projectiles -Golondrina/Barber, St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson- to the Late Paleoindian
period. The Wilson component is dated at 10000 to 9650 BP and is associated with features, artifacts,
and a burial that are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from this site
further suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continued during the ensuing Golondrina/Barber
and St. Mary’s Hall components. These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.

Early Archaic (ca. 8800 - 5800 BP)
The Early Archaic period is subdivided into three projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split
Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to 6000 BP (Collins 2004). Generally, the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in technology focused on the use of
burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods. This shift is traced back as early as 8800 BP at the WilsonLeonard Site and at roughly comparable ages at several other Central Texas sites (Decker et al. 1999;
Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, evidence for the use of earth ovens and burned rock technologies for
processing plant foods is associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points. Hence, the use of
Angostura and late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the Early Archaic period
for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base split-stem and Martindale/Uvalde styles. The
Early Archaic period marks a shift to the use of multiple tons of burned limestone and other rocks in the
form of scatters, hearths, middens and other features for the heated processing of plant foods. This

Cultural Background

represents the start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition, lasting from roughly 8800 to 1400 BP. This
tradition was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the resulting creation of burned
rock middens at strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence practices began with a
distinctive cooking technology using layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens, allowing for
exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic plants like sotol and other
species such as Lily family onion bulbs, which grow in wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool late Pleistocene
environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most pronounced during
the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000-7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests
that the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene and early
Holocene/Paleoindian period underwent a brief dry interval during Late Paleoindian times, later returning
to more mesic conditions during the ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the
Early Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994) or a more mesic interval
within an overall, long-lived trend toward aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the
use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related processing
began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests that the Early Archaic occupations
were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations
for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations. Broad spectrum, well-adapted, highly
mobile subsistence strategies are theorized.

Middle Archaic (ca. 5800 - 4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to process plants and
other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a
pronounced mid-Holocene drying event from 7000 to 5000 BP, though it may have lasted longer.
Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval along the eastern Edwards Plateau from
roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this is seen in the cessation of significant overbank sediment
aggradation at a number of Central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions catalyzed extensive
downcutting and erosion along many Central Texas streams. Hypothetically, dry conditions would have
promoted the spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the increased use of burned rock
middens. Weather conditions may also have engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the
Middle and Late Archaic periods. Furthermore, the proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile
point styles at the beginning of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return of bison to the
Edwards Plateau and the adjacent Blackland Prairie; these broad-bladed points have been associated with
the exploitation of. Additional Middle Archaic projectile point styles include Early Triangular, La Jita,
Nolan, and Travis.

Late Archaic (ca. 4000 - 1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic interval into two different
subperiods (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile points, which
along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell), were used to hunt bison and other
large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late Archaic I interval. The
resources processed via burned rock technology may have included yucca, sotol, and perhaps agave
lechuguilla. Other middens may simply be dumps for kitchen-type debris, which contain sizeable
quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson 1995). Pedernales

Cultural Background

peoples in particular may have been adept at both hunting and the processing of large volumes of plant
food materials.
The Late Archaic II subperiod (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of increasingly mesic
conditions for all but the western and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The
onset of more mesic conditions may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic plants and
perhaps bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced adjustments in prehistoric subsistence strategies.
There appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can be directly attributable to
the Late Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller and are characterized by
such styles as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. Evidence suggests the large projectiles well-adapted to
bison hunting may have been gradually replaced by smaller point types. Also, it has been posited that the
spread of Eastern Woodland religious cults may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of
Central Texas (Johnson 1995).

Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600 - 1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is initially
marked by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from dart
points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the bow
and arrow, there is strong indication that the broad based hunting-gathering economy of the Late Archaic
persisted into and throughout most of the Late Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is marked
by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem Perdiz
arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives, and drills
or perforators made of flakes and blades. The Post-Archaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid
toward the middle of the Late Prehistoric, during which a dramatic increase in bison exploitation suggests
it became an increasingly important economic activity during the later part of this period.

Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1600-1870)
The Historic Period for Texas is variable by area and dependent on when written accounts were first
generated. Initially, as Europeans and indigenous groups first encountered each other, documentation
concerning Texas was sparse and intermittent (Collins 2004). Generally, Alvarez de Pineda’s journey
down the Gulf Coast from Florida in 1519 is considered the first of the Anglo-European explorations of
Texas (Fox 1989). Pineda’s favorable accounts led to unsuccessful attempts at settlements at the mouth
of the Rio Grande. The first European to explore the Texas interior was likely Nunez Cabeza de Vaca’s
five year trek across Texas beginning in 1528. Coronado crossed into the Texas Panhandle region in
1541, the same year members of the de Soto expedition encountered Caddoan-speaking peoples southeast
of the Panhandle.
Within Central Texas, one of the earliest native peoples to be discussed in literature were the Jumano,
who have been documented in texts dating as far back as 1583 A.D. (Kenmotsu 2001). Although Spanish
colonization and Apache intrusion would eventually displace them across Texas and the Southwest, the
Jumano homeland is considered to stretch from the confluence of the Concho and Colorado Rivers in the
western region of the Edwards Plateau to the Pecos River area in far west Texas, just south of the
southern plains (Kenmotsu 2001).
Once thought to be native to the area, research now suggests the Tonkawa moved into the Blackland
Prairie region from north of the Red River in the seventeenth century, where they persisted until the midnineteenth century (Hester 1989). The Tonkawa were hunter and gatherers who often emphasized the
hunting of bison and were likely pushed out of the Great Plains because of conflict with other Native

Archeological Investigations – Hutchison Street Drainage – December 2011

Cultural Background

Americans, likely Apache aggressors (Prikryl 2001). Encampments along the Blackland Prairie would
have allowed the Tonkawa to simultaneously pursue a plains hunting lifestyle through the exploitation of
bison for food, tools, and hides while utilizing the woodland resources of the Post Oak Savannah.
The Payaya, one of the northernmost groups the Spanish labeled as Coahiltecas, undoubtedly ranged into
and across the Central Texas from their homeland southwest of San Antonio. According to Campbell
(1975) the Payaya were a hunting and gathering group who lived in temporary settlements in natural open
spaces of wooded areas adjacent to springs and/or streams and likely took advantage of the abundant
game, including buffalo that were ubiquitous across the central and south Texas landscape. Historic
accounts by Espinosa dating to 1709 mention a Payaya encampment along the Medina River that gathered
pecans in high quantities, some of which were stored underground.
During the mid-sixteenth century, the Spanish brought horses into North America. By the early
seventeenth century, the Apaches had adopted the horse, using the animal to raid central Texas from the
mountains and plains to the north (Boyd and Peck 1992). In the eighteenth century the Comanches too
raided the central Texas area. Together, these raids forced most of native peoples out of the region; some
fled south, others eastward into the Caddo homelands and a few sought refuge among the Spanish
missions (Black and McGraw 1989). Save for the few who assimilated into the mission communities,
the native peoples of the area were largely extinct by the early nineteenth century.
By the late 1740s the Spanish established three missions along the San Gabriel River, north of presentday Austin, with the intent of missionizing the Tonkawa Indians (Prikryl 2001). This attempt met with
little success as the Tonkawa, at this time, were concentrated further northeast, towards the Trinity River
(Newcomb 1993). By the late 1760s, evidence suggests that the Tonkawa were ranging south, moving
closer to the Brazos. Prikryl (2001) reports an account by the Spanish missionary Solis, dated to 1768,
that has the Tonkawa situated on the Brazos near present-day Bryan along with members of the Mayeye,
and Yojuane, smaller tribes who would later assimilate with the Tonkawa for defense against the Apache.
The first Europeans to visit the San Marcos area were probably members of the 1691 Domingo Teran de
los Rios expedition. This expedition camped at the springs from June 20-25, 1691 and they recorded
seeing numbers of buffalo in the area (Hatcher 1932). On June 23 of the same year, Cantona Indians,
numbering approximately 60 individuals visited the Spanish camp and recorded their name for the San
Marcos Springs as Canocanayestatetlo, or “hot water.” Later, members of the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre
expedition of 1709 visited the San Marcos Springs. In 1755, the Spaniards established the mission San
Xavier on the San Marcos River and the presidio of San Francisco Xavier which quickly succumbed to
Indian attacks. The area remained unsettled for another half-century. In the early nineteenth century, the
Spaniards made a second attempt with the settlement San Marcos de Neve. This settlement lasted until
1812 when unrelenting Comanche raids and floods forced abandonment of the settlement (Greene n.d.).
The springs remained a stop on the Old San Antonio Road that ran between Northern New Mexico and
Nacogdoches. Between the 1830s and 1840s, the first white settlers moved into the area (Greene n.d.).
The San Marcos Springs allowed the settlers to rapidly industrialize their efforts by harnessing its power
to operate mills and gins. Cattle and cotton became the predominant industry in the area. On March 1,
1848, Hays County was organized, and the young community of San Marcos was designated the county
seat. The small town continued to grow up around the springs, and it became a trade center between
Austin and San Antonio (Greene n.d.).

Previously Recorded Sites and Investigations

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES AND INVESTIGATIONS
A background review of the project area utilized the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Online
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) to identify any previously recorded archeological sites or previously
conducted surveys within the project area. In addition, the review identified any archeological sites
within 500 meters of the project area. While there are no sites recorded within the project area, numerous
sites and surveys have been documented within the vicinity. A linear archeological survey was conducted
in June, 1987 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approximately 150 meters north of the
currently proposed project area. Another linear survey was conducted in 2002 by Southwest Texas State
University directly across the San Marcos River, west of the project area. Aerial surveys were conducted
in April 2007 by Hicks & Company, under TAC permit 4443, and in April, 2008, 2009, December, 2010
and in February, 2011, by the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) under TAC permits 4871, 5416,
5509, and 5869, respectively.
Five sites have been recorded within 500 meters of the proposed project area: 41HY133, 41HY135,
41HY161, 41HY319, and 41HY432 (Appendix B: Plate I). Site 41HY133 was recorded in February
1972 by J. Warren and is described as an open campsite with cultural deposits that extend from surface to
a depth of 80 cmbgs located on a small elevated knoll on a bank of the San Marcos River. Artifacts noted
from a surface sampling include debitage, cores, flake tools, a scraper, an Ensor projectile point, burnt
faunal bone and burned rock.
Site 41HY135, located near the confluence of Purgatory Creek and the San Marcos River was also
recorded by J. Warren in 1977. This site, of unknown age, consists of a surficial lithic scatter and, during
recordation, it was noted that Site 41HY135 had been disturbed by natural erosion and the installation of a
sewer line and gravel path. Testing of this site to ascertain its vertical and horizontal extents was
recommended.
Initially investigated by Shiner in 1978, Site 41HY161 is listed as an SAL. Beginning in 1982, a series of
field schools directed by Dr. James Garber investigated archeological sites in San Marcos and included
Site 41HY161 (Bousman 2001). In 1992, two human burials were discovered at this site, although, due to
disturbance were only partially exhumed (Garber and Glassman 1992). Site 41HY161 was again
investigated in 1997 and in 1998 by the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) (Ford and Lyle 1998;
Lyle et al. 2000). Although no diagnostic artifacts were recovered during the limited undertaking in 1997,
the investigators noted that the upper 40 centimeters of deposition was substantially disturbed during
historic times, resulting in a mixing of artifacts from different temporal periods (Ford and Lyle 1998).
The 1998 investigations recovered Early Archaic split stemmed projectile points in association with
highly oxidized reddish-brown alluvial sediment just above what may be a buried paleosol (Ringstaff
2000, personal communication). Additionally, during the 1998 investigations, a Late Archaic component
was discovered in stratigraphical context just above a Late Paleoindian component.
Site 41HY319 was discovered during a CAS survey conducted on behalf of the City of San Marcos in
2001. This site is described as a prehistoric site of unknown age with disturbed sediment capping a
potentially undisturbed cultural deposit at approximately 50 cmbgs (Barrera 2002). During the 2007
survey conducted by Hicks & Company for the City of San Marcos, Site 41HY432, a prehistoric site of
undetermined type was encountered. This site is potentially an extension of 41HY319.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
The field methodology was tailored to provide the broadest possible evaluation of cultural resources
within the project area. This section provides an overview of the field methodology and a discussion of
the manner in which the prehistoric archeological resources found within the proposed project area were
evaluated for significance. Since the proposed project area is within such close proximity to the San
Marcos River, the area to be impacted was noted to potentially contain significant, possibly deeply-buried
archeological sites. The scope of the archeological investigations involved pedestrian inspection of the
entire proposed project area supplemented with mechanical backhoe trenches. During pedestrian survey,
it was noted that a large portion of the project area is below the existing concrete paved parking lot that
serves the San Marcos City Park, thus limiting the area in which sub-surface testing was feasible to the
north and east of the parking lot.
Backhoe trench excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in order to locate and
expose cultural features or occupation levels within areas exhibiting the potential for site burial. Backhoe
trenches were excavated to the extent allowed by the length of the machine’s bucket arm, typically
terminating at depths approaching 300 centimeters below the surface. Backhoe excavations were directed
and monitored by an archeologist certified as a competent person trained in Occupational Safety and
Health Association (OSHA) trench safety standards. Sediment from representative bucket sweeps was
screened through ¼-inch wire mesh and both the back dirt piles and open trenches were simultaneously
monitored during trenching by separate archeologists. Each backhoe trench was recorded on a
standardized form with notes made regarding stratigraphy, features, and cultural artifacts. A soil profile,
plan view map, and photographs were recorded for each trench as warranted. After these data were
recorded, the backhoe trenches were backfilled.
Investigators used handheld GPS units and detailed maps to locate and record excavations within the
proposed project area. GPS positions were recorded for all backhoe trenches. All GPS positions were
downloaded and plotted on 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs by Hicks &
Company GIS personnel.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
At the time of investigations, it was noted that the proposed survey area had been previously disturbed not
only by the construction of a concrete parking lot for the city park, but also by the installation of
underground utilities, including water lines and sewer lines (Figures 11-14). Specifically, areas beyond
pavement that were noted as being within the immediate vicinity of these utilities were identified in the
northern and southwestern extents of the project boundary. As a result, subsurface testing at these
locations was not conducted. It should be noted, however, that, while within the proposed project area as
depicted in Figure 2, there are no modifications planned in these areas. In total five backhoe trenches
(BHTs 1-5) were excavated during current investigations, resulting in the discovery of buried
archeological deposits in BHT 2, BHT 3 and BHT 4 (Appendix B: Plate II). Detailed descriptions of
individual trench excavations follow below.

Backhoe Trench Excavations
Backhoe Trench 1
Within the San Marcos City Park, five backhoe trenches were placed within the proposed project area.
All trenches were excavated within the northern half of the project area, northeast and west of the paved
parking lot. Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT1) was excavated just northeast of the intersection of CM Allen
Parkway and Hutchison Street and oriented west to east. Four distinct strata were documented for BHT1
(Figure 15). Stratum 1 was noted as extending to a depth of 12 centimeters below ground surface
(cmbgs) and was a dry, loose, crumbly dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) topsoil with inclusions of
caliche and gravels mottled with red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay. Stratum 2 extended from 12-60 cmbgs and
was observed to be a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam. This stratum is disturbed loose
construction fill with many inclusions of modern trash, such as miscellaneous metal, can lids, bottle glass
(green, brown and clear), and a concrete cylinder (Figure 16), which are probably associated with home
sites that were known to be situated within the project area before it became a city park (personal
communication; Haefner and City of San Marcos Parks staff, October 14, 2011. At Stratum 3,
approximately 60 cmbgs, the observed sediment began to gradually become more compact, changing to a
very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry clay with inclusions of rootlets, caliche flecking, and sparse small
gravels. At 180 cmbgs, the beginning of Stratum 4 was noted and was recorded as a very dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) dense clay loam with a clay content that increased with depth. Stratum 4 terminated at

approximately 240 cmbgs at a gradual boundary with Stratum 5, a compact brown (10YR 4/3) clay with
inclusions of calcium carbonate flecking. Excavation of BHT1 was terminated at 300 cmbgs in sterile
clay sediment.

Results of Field Investigations

Backhoe Trench 2
Located approximately 20 meters north of BHT1, Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT2), oriented north to south, was
noted as having a similar stratigraphy to BHT1 (Figure 17). Stratum 1 was observed to be a dry dark
yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sandy clay loam that descended to a depth of 20 cmbgs, terminating at an
abrupt and smooth boundary. Stratum 2 extended from a depth of 20 cmbgs to 55 cmbgs and was noted
as a brown (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam. This stratum is largely comprised of construction fill with
numerous gravels that decrease in density and size with depth. During screening of back dirt from
Stratum 2, two chert flakes were recovered. Stratum 3 extended from 55 cmbgs to a depth of 130 cmbgs
and was observed to be a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay. Within this stratum two
additional chert flakes were recovered during screening of back dirt from an approximate depth of 90
cmbgs to 120 cmbgs. Following the recovery of flakes from the non-fill context, mechanical trenching
was temporarily halted while archeologists trowelled and shovel scraped the east and west walls for intact
cultural deposits and for profiling. No additional artifacts were noted. Stratum 4 of BHT2, a dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) compact sandy clay, was observed to extend from approximately 130 cmbgs to 190
cmbgs. At 190 cmbgs a gradual and smooth boundary was noted as demarcating Stratum 5, a brown
(10YR 4/3) dense compact clay. A total of four artifacts were recovered from this trench during
excavation, though two of these flakes were recovered from the disturbed fill zone and BHT2 was
terminated at 230 cmbgs in sterile clay sediment (Figure 18).

Figure 18: BHT2, East Wall Profile.
Spanning the width of BHT2, an electrical copper wire was uncovered at approximately 120-130 cmbgs
(Figures 19 and 20). This wire was determined to no longer be active. Previous to excavation all proper
inquiries were placed with the companies who may have had lines going through the proposed project
area as per protocol. Hicks & Company archeologists were informed that there were no underground
lines within the immediate areas of BHT2 before excavation began. A City Parks representative visited
the site and the location of the wire and informed the crew that before this was a city park, there were
many home sites within this area. It was determined that it is possible the underground line uncovered
was associated with those houses. After documentation, backhoe excavation continued to termination at a
depth of 230 cmbgs.

Backhoe Trench 3
Backhoe Trench 3 (BHT3), oriented west to east, was placed adjacent and perpendicular to the northern
extent of BHT2. Stratum 1 was noted as being a dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/1) shallow sandy loam
topsoil that extended to a depth of 10 cmbgs, terminating at a clear and smooth boundary. A very dark
gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam, homogenous to the disturbed fill noted as Stratum 2 of BHT2
comprised Stratum 2 from 10 to 50 cmbgs. A chert flake was recovered from just below this disturbed
fill (30-32 cmbgs) in the north wall. Stratum 3 was recorded as a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
sandy clay loam and extended to a depth of 230 cmbgs. The electrical wire that was noted in BHT2 was
also observed near the same elevation within BHT3, at approximately 100 cmbgs (Figure 21). Also
within Stratum 3, a marked brick fragment and a plain brick were discovered. Both of these bricks were
yellowish tan in color. The brick fragment (3.3” x 2.7”) had a maker’s mark that was only partially intact,
ending with the letters “ISH” and had a light glaze on its surface (Figure 22). The other brick (8.4” x
4.3”) was rough and porous. Also recovered was a large blocky slab of limestone (12.1” x 7.4”) which is
similar in aspect to an old house footing or a foundation stone (Figure 23). These bricks and the
limestone may be associated with the houses that were situated at this location before it became a city
park. At a gradual boundary with Stratum 3, Stratum 4, a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay begins and
extends to a depth of 370 cmbgs, where BHT3 was terminated in sterile clay sediment. Trenches were
not placed to the immediate north and east of BHT3 due to the presence of marked buried utilities.

Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated approximately 20 meters northeast of BHT3 at the far northeast corner
of the project area (Appendix B: Plate II). Stratum 1 of BHT3 was observed to be a loose, sandy loam
topsoil with gravel inclusions that was recorded as dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) in color and was
noted as terminating at an abrupt and smooth boundary 10 cmbgs. This stratum was dense with modern
trash, mostly modern bottle glass (brown, green, and clear). Stratum 2, a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)
sandy clay loam was observed as initiating at 10cmbgs and extending to a depth of 150 cmbgs.
Inclusions recorded for Stratum 2 include roots, rootlets, and gravels. This stratum increased in
compaction with depth. During screening of back dirt from Stratum 2, a chert biface fragment was
recovered at an approximate depth of 20-25 cmbgs. Additionally, at approximately 40 cmbgs, four chert
flakes were recovered just below a large root that emanated from the north wall of BHT4 (Figure 24).
Finally, a small cluster (n=3) of burned rock was observed at a depth of 70 cmbgs in the south wall
(Figure 25). While screening the back dirt, six more chert flakes were recovered from approximately 80
to 120 cmbgs, which is the same artifact recovery zone within BHT2. Stratum 3 was noted and recorded
as a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay with calcium carbonate flecking throughout. BHT4 was terminated at
230 cmbgs in ancient sterile clay sediment (Figure 26).

Results of Field Investigations

Backhoe Trench 5
Backhoe Trench 5 (BHT5) was excavated as an exploratory trench, perpendicular to BHT4 extending
south from the south wall of BHT4 at the location of the small cluster of burned rock with the intention of
further exposing this potential burned rock feature (Figure 27). Sediment was carefully removed in even
layers approximately 10 centimeters in thickness by mechanical trenching to a depth of 60 cmbgs. At this
depth, mechanical trenching was halted and sediment immediately and adjacently over the burned rock in
the south wall of BHT4 was removed diligently, first with shovel, and then with trowel. At 70 cmbgs, the
small burned rock cluster was pedestaled, with the intent of exposing any additional artifacts in situ for
documentation. Other than the three burned rocks encountered during excavation of BHT4, no other
burned rock was encountered. One very small chert flake was recovered from just above the small burned
rock cluster at 65 cmbgs in the east wall. At 80 cmbgs, due to the dearth of cultural materials, mechanical
trenching was resumed and, prior to backfilling, was profiled by Hicks & Company archeologists. The
stratigraphy of BHT5 was noted as being nearly homogenous to BHT4. Stratum 1 was recorded as a
loose dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) topsoil with inclusions of gravels and modern trash that
terminated at 10 cmbgs at an abrupt and smooth boundary. Stratum 2, recorded as being a dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, extended from this boundary to a depth of 130 cmbgs. From a
gradual and wavy lower boundary, Stratum 3 was excavated to 260 cmbgs. Stratum 3 was recorded as a
brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay with inclusions of calcium carbonate flecking throughout. BHT5 was
terminated at 260 cmbgs in sterile clay sediment.

Site 41HY485
Due to their proximity to each other, the cultural materials recovered in backhoe trenches 2-5 during the
current investigation were recorded collectively as prehistoric Site 41HY485. As currently mapped this
site measures approximately 25 by 30 meters in size (Appendix B: Plate III). As recorded, the cultural
remains associated with Site 41HY485 includes 17 flakes, a biface fragment, and three burned rocks
recovered intermittently from depths of 20-100 cmbgs. No surface artifacts were noted during
investigations and no diagnostic artifacts were recovered. As discussed above, most of the project area
exhibits a high degree of disturbance due to the installation of underground utilities, road and parking lot
construction, landform modification, and park maintenance. Due to the low density of artifacts, lack of
temporal diagnostics and discernible features, the known segment of Site 41HY485 that lies within the
proposed project area has minimal research potential. As a result, Hicks & Company concludes that no
prehistoric or historic deposits that can be construed as potentially significant to the history of the City of
San Marcos or the State of Texas under any criteria of the Texas Antiquities Code. However, the
delineation of Site 41HY485’s horizontal boundaries was hampered by the boundaries of the survey area
and it is more than likely that cultural deposits exist outside of the surveyed area to the north and west,
along the same terrace landform. Further, these areas may exhibit fewer disturbances than have been
documented for the APE of this current project. Any future work conducted in these areas should
consider the potential presence of subsurface intact cultural deposits and coordinate accordingly. In the
case that such deposits are discovered, the eligibility status for Site 41HY485 may need to be
reconsidered.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of HNTB and the City of San Marcos, Hicks & Company archeologists have completed a 100­
percent pedestrian survey along approximately 1.02 acres. The survey consisted of pedestrian inspection
supplemented by mechanical trench excavations (n=5) within THC’s requested survey area of the
proposed project’s footprint. The survey area was found to be manicured city park property that had
largely been disturbed by road and parking lot construction and the installation of underground utilities.
During the current investigation, Site 41HY485 was recorded. The cultural remains associated with Site
41HY485 included flakes, a biface fragment, and three burned rocks recovered intermittently from depths
of 20-100 cmbgs. No surface artifacts were noted during investigations and no diagnostic artifacts were
recovered. Due to the low density of artifacts, lack of temporal diagnostics and discernable features, the
known segment of the site 41HY485 that lies within the proposed project area has minimal research
potential. As a result, Hicks & Company concludes that no prehistoric or historic deposits that can be
construed as potentially significant to the City of San Marcos’ or the State of Texas’ history under any
criteria of the ACT.
Based on the results of the investigations, Hicks & Company recommended that no additional
investigation or coordination be required for this project relative to the ACT and received THC
concurrence on December 9, 2011(Appendix A). In the event that unrecorded cultural resources are
encountered during construction, all ground disturbing activities in the project area will cease pending
