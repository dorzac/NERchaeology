Abstract
Between June 28 and 30, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates)
conducted an intensive Class III, non-collection archeological field inventory at two proposed well pads
(ACIR Wells #9 and #10) and other associated infrastructure at the request of Comstock Oil and Gas, Inc.
(Comstock) on portions of the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation (ACIR) in east-central Polk
County, Texas. To comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act this inventory was
conducted to identify historic properties that might be affected by the construction of the two well pads
and related infrastructure (i.e., flowlines and an access road). Permits were issued under case number
SPRO-BA-06-027 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Cultural Resource Use Permit #209-292006-A for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Approximately 8.8 acres were surveyed. The
pedestrian survey of the project area, augmented by shovel testing, resulted in the identification of a
single buried Category 2 prehistoric site (41PK248) at the proposed ACIR #9 well pad location. At the
current level of investigations, the site’s eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) could not be determined.
Investigations at proposed well pad ACIR Well #10 revealed no surface or subsurface cultural materials.
Similarly, the survey found no surface or subsurface cultural deposits in the areas proposed for the
construction of associated infrastructure. Blanton & Associates recommends that the proposed
construction of well pad ACIR #10 be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations.
However, an alternative location for proposed well pad ACIR #9 should be found to avoid impacting site
41PK248. If avoidance is not possible, then an archeological testing program should be developed and
implemented to determine if site 41PK248 is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places.

Introduction
Between June 28 and 30, 2006 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates), at the request of the
project sponsor Comstock Oil and Gas, Inc. (Comstock), conducted a cultural resources survey at two
proposed well pads (ACIR #9 and ACIR #10) on the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation (ACIR) in
Polk County, Texas (Figures 1 through 3). The intent of the cultural resource survey was to identify and
describe any cultural resources within the proposed well pads. The survey was designed to comply with
archeological survey methods as defined in the Procedures for Performing Cultural Resource Fieldwork
on Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico BLM Responsibilities (BLM 2005), 36 CFR Section 60.4,
U.S. Department of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (National Park Service 1983), the Guidelines
of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)(THC n.d.). This
report was written in accordance with the small-scale cultural resource inventory guidelines set forth in
BLM Manual Supplement H-8100-1 New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (BLM 2005). Mark Willis
served as principal investigator for the project and Joe Sanchez served as crew archeologist.

Proposed Action
The project area falls within the Great Plains permit area as described in Procedures for Performing
Cultural Resource Fieldwork on Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico BLM Responsibilities (BLM
2005).
The proposed pre-construction and construction activities will include the removal of all timber and brush
within the two proposed well pads, as well as along proposed flowline and road infrastructure.
Additionally, the locations for each well pad would be graded and leveled, thereby leaving little, if any, of
the original ground surface intact.
Prior to field survey for cultural resources, land surveyors for Comstock clearly marked the center and
limits of each proposed well pad with wooden lathes and orange flagging tape. The centerlines of the
proposed flowlines and roads were similarly delineated.

ACIR #9
This exploratory petroleum well would be vertically drilled approximately 14,400 feet deep into the
Woodbine geologic formation. A 2.81 acre well site would be cleared, leveled, and developed using
heavy machinery to provide the work space necessary to drill and operate the well (Figure 4). The well
site would consist of a 350 by 350-foot crushed rock well pad to accommodate the drilling rig and
associated infrastructure. The well pad components will include a mud pit, a washout/emergency pit, a
ring levee and ditch, a water well, and a freshwater pit.
If the well is productive, a 20-foot wide by 2,539 foot long pipeline (1.17 acres) would be constructed to
connect the well to an existing sales pipeline. The pipeline right-of-way (ROW) would be maintained by
mowing or mechanical removal of woody species during the use of the pipeline (Figure 5). The total area
directly impacted by the project would be approximately 3.98 acres.

Access to the proposed well site would be via public and tribal roads. Vehicle access to the pad will
utilize a portion of U.S. 190, then south onto Bear Creek Road for approximately 0.1 mile to the pad site
east of the road.

ACIR #10
This well would also be an exploratory petroleum well that would be vertically drilled, approximately
14,300 feet deep, into the Woodbine formation. A 3.67-acre area would be cleared, leveled, and
developed using heavy machinery to provide the work space necessary to drill and operate the well. To
accommodate the drilling rig and infrastructure, the well site would consist of a 400 by 400-foot crushed
rock well pad with a 15-foot wide by 1,214-foot long new access road (0.42 acre) (Figure 6). Individual
components of the well pad will include a mud pit, a washout/emergency pit, a ring levee and ditch, a
water well, and a freshwater pit.
If the well is productive, a 30-foot wide by 1,179-foot long pipeline (0.81 acre) would be constructed to
connect the well to an existing sales pipeline (Figure 7). The pipeline ROW would be maintained by
mowing or mechanical removal of woody species over the life of the pipeline. The total area directly
impacted by the project would be approximately 4.9 acres.
Access to the proposed well site would be via public and tribal roads. Vehicle access to the pad will
utilize a portion of U.S. 190, before turning north on Farm to Market (FM) Road 2500 for approximately
1.8 miles. The proposed project site is east of FM 2500 and accessible through a Comstock lease gate.
The well pad will be approximately 0.2 miles east of FM 2500.

Project Location
The two proposed well pads and associated infrastructure are located in east-central Polk County, Texas.
The proposed construction is entirely within the modern boundaries of the Alabama-Coushatta Indian
Reservation and regulated by the BLM through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Tulsa, Oklahoma Field Office of the New Mexico BLM provides
oversight for this project.
The project area, as is most of Texas, is not formally platted within the “Town and Range” system that is
suggested for description by the BLM (BLM 2005). The USGS 7.5-minute Dallardsville, Texas
topographic quadrangle map, on which the projects are located, is provisional. However, professionally
surveyed plats of the project area were provided to Blanton & Associates by Comstock (see Figures 4
through 7).
Proposed well pad ACIR #9 is located within the flood plain of Bear Creek in a densely forested area just
southeast of the intersection of US Highway 190 and Bear Creek Loop. Additional construction
associated with ACIR #9 is a flowline. No new access roads are needed. The flowline would extend
approximately 2,539 feet north-northwest of the well across US Highway 190 and terminating at the
existing Comstock Alabama #6 well. Proposed ACIR #10 is located about 0.2 miles east of FM 2500

within a pine plantation on an east sloping hill roughly 1.9 miles north of the intersection of
US Highway 190 and FM 2500. Construction would include approximately 1,214 feet of new access road
to connect the well pad to FM 2500 and a flowline that would extend about 1,179 feet to the northwest
from the well pad to the northern boundary of the reservation.

Environmental Setting
The proposed well pad sites occupy portions of the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal Plain
physiographic province (Fenneman 1946) and are underlain by the Pleistocene-age Willis Formation
(Barnes 1992). The coastward belt of the Willis Formation is a fluviatile deposit described as clay, silt,
sand, and siliceous gravel of granule to pebble size, including some petrified wood and sand that is
coarser than in younger rocks, noncalcareous, mostly deeply weathered and lateritic, indurated by clay,
locally cemented by iron oxide and abundant with iron oxide concretions, and used as road material in
coastward belt of outcrop (Barnes 1992). The altitude range for ACIR #9 and its flowline is
approximately 213 to 258 feet above mean sea level (amsl) with a slope of less than 5 percent to the east
toward Bear Creek. At ACIR #10 the elevation range is 305 to 332 feet amsl and the location has a
northeast trending 5 to 10 percent slope.
Soils at the two proposed well pad sites consist of deposits of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand. Well
Pad #9 pad location contains both Pinetucky and Pluck Kian soils (McEwan et al. 1983). Pinetucky is a
fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, formed on upland landforms from loamy Pleistocene sediments
(McEwan et al. 1983:92–93). Pluck Kian soils are very deep, poorly drained, and stratified loamy and
sandy alluvial sediments on nearly level to gently sloping terrain in floodplains. Previous research in the
area indicates that Pinetucky and Kian soils have a good potential for containing buried archeological
sites. The proposed Well Pad #10 occupies an area of Bienville loamy fine sand and Doucette loamy fine
sand. The Bienville loamy fine sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes, is on ridges and side slopes of convex terraces
(McEwan et al. 1983:17 and 75). Doucette loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slope, is an upland soil formed
from sandy and loamy sediments of the Pleistocene-age Willis Formation with (McEwan et al. 1983:25).
Average rainfall in the area is about 48 inches a year with most showers arriving in the summer (McEwan
et al. 1983). Normal temperatures range from the upper 30s in January to the mid-90s in August. These
warm temperatures allow the lush vegetation of the area to thrive. The project areas are in the southern
portion of the Pineywoods Vegetational Area, as described by Gould (1975). This area was later
characterized by Hatch et al. (1990) as a Coastal Plain Forest on level to undulating hilly terrain.
Dominant vegetation types include upland mixed pine-hardwood forest and bottomland mixed hardwood.
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has mapped the project area as a Loblolly Pine (Pinus
taeda)-Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) Forest (McMahan et al. 1984). The common canopy
associates of this vegetation type include water oak (Quercus nigra), southern red oak (Q. falcata), white
oak (Q. alba), winged elm (Ulmus alata), and southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Dominant
understory species include yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria), southern wax myrtle (Morella cerifera),
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and various
vines.

The project area is situated in a transitional zone where tropical, temperate, and arid environments
converge. The biogeography of the region includes relatively recent historic periods where tropical faunal
groups dominated the area. The project area is situated in the Austroriparian Biotic Province, as described
by Blair (1950). Currently, the wildlife consists of typical forest and grassland species assemblages,
although many tropical affiliates survive, including some which are quite common, such as the ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). A few temperate species which were previously common
have been extirpated from the region. Prior to the period around 1850, black bears were found in higher
concentrations in the transition zone between pine dominated upland woods - mixed deciduous
bottomland complex, and the coastal prairies east of Houston, than anywhere else in east Texas (Weniger
1997). Today they are absent from the forests. Muskrats were also found in high concentrations in the
project area. In 1936, muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) accounted for 54% of fur-produced income for Polk,
Chambers, and Orange Counties. Principal furbearers of earlier times included river otter (Lutra
canadensis), beaver (Castor canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Weniger 1997). Furbearers of the
project area today include raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), nutria (Myocastor coypus), mink, beaver, bobcat (Felis rufus), coyote (Canis
latrans), and gray fox (Urocyon cinereargenteus) (Schmidly 1984).

Culture History
The proposed well pads lie within the Coastal Culture Area as defined by Suhm et al. (1954). Aten (1983)
has summarized the archeological and ethnohistoric data for the upper Texas coast region. Polk County
lies within the upper territory of the Akokisa as mapped by Aten (1983:31). Story et al.’s (1990)
compendium on the Native American cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain also provides a wealth of data on
the area. Patterson (1995) has also summarized the archeology of the upper Texas coastal region.
The earliest documented human occupation of the region dates to the Paleoindian era, which probably
began around 11,000 years ago and continued to around 7,000 to 8,000 years ago. Paleoindian groups
have long been described as big game hunters who specialized in hunting large mammals, some of which
were becoming extinct at the end of the Pleistocene when these hunters first made their appearance on the
scene. Recent investigations suggest that big game hunting was only a part of the broader adaptive
strategy that characterized the Paleoindians; this may be especially true of Paleoindian peoples from the
forested areas of the eastern US. The long period from the end of Paleoindian times to the introduction of
ceramics about 2,100 years ago, collectively described at the Archaic period, shows the development of
regional variations in stylistic traits and economic pursuits.
The nomadic hunters and gatherers of the Archaic (8,000 to 2,100 BP) used a wide variety of stone tool
styles. In east and southeast Texas, the suspected sequence of stone tools has often been used to subdivide
this long period, but little data is available on cultural changes that may have been associated with such
stylistic changes. The introduction of ceramics to the region may not have immediately resulted in
cultural changes, but it certainly indicated contact with emerging complex cultures to the east and north of
the area where horticulture, and later perhaps full-blown agriculture, was replacing hunting and gathering
as a way of life. This cultural complexity is reflected in the presence of burial mounds and possible early
ceremonial center sites—sites that suggest a high degree of cultural similarity and interconnectedness

among peoples of the region as well as an incipient complex political organization described in
anthropological literature as a chiefdom type of political system. To the north of the project area, the
Caddo people represented such a development perhaps as early as 1,200 BP. As with many of the native
peoples of the southeastern U.S., the Caddo were decimated by European diseases. The remnants of the
Caddo, as well as historic immigrants such as the Alabama and Coushatta, occupied the project area in the
historic period. While the Caddo and many other native Texas tribes were removed through the policies
of Mirabeau B. Lamar, the Alabama-Coushatta managed to remain.

Previous Research
Prior to fieldwork, files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC were
reviewed for previously recorded sites and research areas in or near the project area. As per BLM
guidelines for small-scale inventories, only those previously recorded sites and projects within one mile
(if none are located within 0.25 mile of the project area) are discussed here.
No previously recorded archeological sites or Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) are within 0.25 miles
of either of the two project areas. However, seven archeological sites and five TCPs are located just over
one mile from the well pads (Figure 8). All of the sites and TCPs were recorded during two cultural
resource surveys (Johnson and Lintz 1999, Pritchard 2001).
In late 1998 and early 1999, an archeological survey was conducted on select seismic shot holes within
the ACIR. The project discovered nine archeological sites in “high probability” Holocene alluvial
deposits within the ACIR. Seven of these sites are near the current project areas and are described below
(Johnson and Lintz 1999).
Site 41PK138 is located approximately 0.40 mile southeast of ACIR #10. The site measures 40 by 50
meters and occupies the first terrace above Bear Creek. It was described as a habitation site based on the
recovery of lithic debitage, a hammerstone, and a grog-tempered ceramic sherd (Johnson and Lintz 1999).
Site 41PK164 occupies a knoll 1.10 miles southwest of ACIR #9 and measures 50 meters in diameter.
Shovel testing recovered seven flakes, 1 chipped rock, and a fleck of charcoal. A lack of diagnostic
artifacts precluded determination of any time period or cultural group. Based on the low artifact yield and
lack of feature evidence, the site was not recommended for avoidance or testing.
Site 41PK209 is located on the upland divide separating Bear and Big Sandy Creeks about 1 mile eastnortheast of proposed ACIR #9. Only a single chert flake was recovered from this site.
Another low-yield site, 41PK210, is located on the bank of an unnamed tributary of Bear Creek, about
0.70 miles southeast of proposed ACIR #10. A solitary shovel test found one piece of charcoal, one piece
of fired clay, and two pieces of large mammal vertebrae. No cultural affiliation was assigned to this site.
Site 41PK211 consists of four natural mounds located west of Big Sandy Creek on a low hillock about
two meters above the adjacent terrace. The site is about one mile southwest of proposed ACIR #10.

Shovel testing of the mounds recovered prehistoric lithic debitage. The debitage may have been
manufactured from gravel layers observed in a cutbank of the nearby creek. Evidence of possible stone
boiling or roasting activities was suggested by the recovery of two pieces of fire-cracked rock found. The
site was documented as a lithic procurement site.
Buried site 41PK212 is 1.10 miles southwest of proposed ACIR #10. Shovel testing found one Gary dart
point and six pieces of lithic debitage. Johnson and Lintz (1999) determined the site to represent a brief
activity or limited-use campsite.
Site 41PK213 is 1.14 miles southwest of proposed ACIR #10. The site is approximately 70 meters in
diameter and situated on the lower slopes of a hill adjacent to Big Sandy Creek. Thirteen pieces of lithic
debitage were recovered during shovel testing. It was suggested that the site was likely a short-term tool
manufacturing location. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered so no time period is associated with this
site.
Pritchard’s 2001 report on the proposed widening of Chief Kina Loop, Bear Creek Loop, and Colabe
Roads within the reservation documents the location of five TCPs. The TCPs were identified by Debbie
Thomas, the Cultural Resource Officer for the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. Four of the TCPs are
described as pine needle nests associated with the Little People, who are important figures in the
Alabama-Coushatta cultural tradition. The fifth TCP is described as a cedar tree possibly marking a grave.
The Little People are important beings to the Alabama-Coushatta cultural tradition. All of the TCPs are
reportedly within one mile of the proposed well pads, with two less than half a mile away. Ms. Thomas
conducted a TCP inspection at the two proposed well pads and connecting pipelines and roads. No TCPs
were discovered at either well pad location.

Survey Methods
The intent of the cultural resources investigations was to identify and inventory all archeological
resources that might be impacted by construction of the two proposed well pads. Investigations were
completed in accordance with archeological survey methods as defined in the Procedures for Performing
Cultural Resource Fieldwork on Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico BLM Responsibilities (BLM
2005), Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council
of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
CTA (THC n.d.).
Field conditions during the survey were very pleasant, with fair and dry conditions. Temperatures ranged
from the mid-70s in the mornings to the mid-90s in the afternoons. The pedestrian survey was
accomplished by two archeologists walking 15 meter interval transects along the proposed project
infrastructure and impact areas. Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical
extent of any previously unidentified prehistoric and/or historic sites within the project area and
evaluating them with respect to their eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP.
In accordance with THC survey standards, the surface survey was augmented by systematic shovel testing
in areas where surface visibility was below 30 percent and in areas where sediment accumulation may
A CLASS III ARCHEOLOGICAL INVENTORY OF TWO PROPOSED WELL PADS ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN
RESERVATION
PAGE 14

have contained buried cultural materials. High surface visibility is not common in the project area so
shovel tests were excavated to prospect for buried cultural deposits and to define the boundaries of
discovered archeological sites.
Shovel tests were 30–40 centimeters in diameter and excavated in arbitrary 20 centimeter levels with all
removed soil screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of
138 centimeters below ground surface or until soil characteristics (i.e., shallow basal clay) prohibited
deeper excavation. All shovel test locations were plotted with a differentially corrected Trimble GeoXT
Global Positioning System (GPS) unit and documented on appropriate Blanton & Associate shovel test
forms. A total of 36 shovel tests were excavated during the survey (Figures 9 and 10 and Appendix B).
When artifacts were encountered during the survey, extra scrutiny was given to the area surrounding it.
The site definition criteria used for these investigations consisted of:
1) One or more cultural features with features defined as ten or more pieces of fire-cracked rock (FCR),
or any other material, within a 1 x 1meter area,
2) One formal tool if associated with other cultural material (i.e., FCR, debitage, etc),
3) A concentration of artifacts (i.e., pottery sherds, chipped-stone, or historic items) comprising:
a) Three or more types of artifacts,
b) Two types of artifacts with a minimum density of one hundred items per 100 square meters,
c) A single type of artifact or material in a density of at least one hundred items per 100 square
meters
When a cultural resource was identified, the site was mapped with the GPS utilizing a data dictionary.
The data dictionary was created by the archeologists and contained menus of artifacts and cultural
features anticipated for the project area. These menus identified artifact type (i.e., debitage, projectile
point, biface, etc.), raw material (sandstone, chert, etc.), and other details. The data dictionary was
designed to be flexible to accommodate new or unexpected artifacts or feature types. The digital
recording of cultural resources augmented, but did not replace, traditional hand written notes, site
descriptions, and sketches of the site. Details on the GPS unit and the quality of the data collected are
provided in Appendix A.
All aspects of investigations were thoroughly photographed with digital cameras. Photodocumentation
included two general site overviews and several photographs of artifacts discovered during shovel testing.
Photographs were taken at a minimum resolution of 7.1 megapixels, with a photo log maintained to
account for each picture. As this was a non-collection survey, all diagnostic and/or unusual artifacts were
analyzed in the field, photographed, and returned to their place of origin.

At the end of each field day, all of the digital data gathered from the GPS and digital camera were
downloaded to a laptop computer. The data was then differentially corrected via the internet with a Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) base station located in Livingston, Texas.

Cultural Resource and Paleontological Findings
A single prehistoric archeological site (41PK248) was found during investigation at proposed well pad
ACIR #9. From the inventory of 36 shovel tests excavated during the survey, five found evidence of
prehistoric habitation of the area. No sites or artifacts were discovered in association with ACIR #10. No
isolated manifestations were found.
The BLM requested that any paleontological finds be documented. The only such finds were in the form
of petrified wood that had been used to manufacture stone artifacts (i.e., a Gary projectile point and
several pieces of debitage). These items were found in a secondary context and are not believed to be
from the immediate area. Petrified wood is common in the Willis Formation which under lies most of the
region (Barnes 1992).

Site Description
Site 41PK248 (Field Identification ACIR-1) is a Category 2 (BLM nomenclature) buried prehistoric site
located on a low natural rise on the edge of the Bear Creek flood plain (Figures 11 through 14). Dominant
vegetation at the site includes Loblolly pine, water oak, hickory, red maple, yaupon, and Eastern hop horn
beam. As the vegetation was fairly dense and verdant, the majority of the hummocky ground surface was
obscured by a mat of forest litter resulting in about 10 percent or less ground surface visibility.
In total, fifteen shovel tests were excavated in and around the site. Generally, shovel tests encountered a
humic zone from 0 to 20 centimeters below surface (bs) overlying fine sandy loam to a depth as shallow
as 50 centimeters bs to as deep as 135 centimeters bs. The deepest zone was ancient subsoil consisting of
sandy clay loam with iron concretions that was not reached in all shovel tests. Artifactual recovery
occurred from the two uppermost zones or at the interface of the fine sandy loam and the sandy clay loam.
The site boundaries are 67 meters east-west by 61 meters north-south and were delineated by landform
(such as swale banks and minor drainages) and the shovel tests, with an area of at least 20 meters of
culturally sterile deposits on all sides of the positive shovel tests. Site boundaries were not physically
marked in the field with flagging tape or other markers. All shovel tests and topographic features were
mapped with a hand-held GPS unit, as well as by tape and compass (where feasible around the dense
vegetation) from the site datum. The staked center point of the proposed well pad served as the site
datum. Of the 15 excavated shovel tests, five yielded prehistoric cultural materials. The results of shovel
testing are described below and tabulated in Appendix B.
Shovel Test 1 was excavated in the southwestern portion of the proposed well pad approximately 39
meters from its staked center point. Artifact recovery included one primary quartzite flake, one secondary
chert flake, two tertiary chert flakes, and one Goose Creek ceramic sherd (ca. 2,100 to 1,100 BP) (Story et

approximately 112 centimeters bs, the interface of the sandy loam with the heavily mottled yellowish
brown sandy clay loam, a tested chert cobble was also found. The cobble was likely resting on the ancient
sandy clay loam substrate that predates known human occupation of the area.
Shovel Test 5 was excavated to a depth of 134 centimeters bs 6.5 meters west of the proposed well pad
center stake. Excavation of this unit recovered five artifacts, with two tertiary chert flakes in the humic
zone (0 to 5 centimeters bs). At 30 to 40 centimeters, bs within fine friable yellowish brown sandy loam,
one chert chunk, and one tertiary chert flake were found. A complete Gary projectile point manufactured
from petrified wood was recovered from the same zone between 40 and 50 centimeters bs (Figure 15).
The projectile point dates from the Middle to Transitional Archaic (ca. 4,500 to 1,200 BP) (Turner and
Hester 1985).
Figure 15. Gary projectile point from Shovel Test 5. The artifact was not collected.

Shovel Test 27 was excavated approximately
12 meters north of the center of the proposed well pad
near the topographically highest point of the site. This
test extended to a maximum depth of 138 centimeters
bs, and the previously identified subsoil was
unreachable given the extreme depth of the shovel test.
Between 0 and 90 centimeters bs, this shovel test
yielded 18 tertiary chert flakes. Between 60 and
90 centimeters bs, two red-slipped, sand-tempered
ceramic sherds were recovered.

Test 5. The artifact was not
collected.
Shovel Test 32 was also placed east of the center of the site datum where the elevation tapers down
toward a small swale. This test was located 36 meters southeast of Shovel Test 27. This test was
shallower than many of the others, extending to a maximum depth of 47 centimeters bs, before reaching
the sandy clay loam subsoil. One secondary and one tertiary chert flake were recovered from
approximately 40 centimeters bs.
Shovel Test 36 was positioned near the center of the highest portion of the site about 11 meters east of
Shovel Test 27. Excavations extended to a maximum depth of 136 centimeters bs and failed to encounter
the ancient subsoil. This test contained the densest concentration of artifacts, including 1 one fire-cracked
quartzite cobble, two quartzite chunks, three quartzite primary flakes, 10 quartzite secondary flakes, one
quartzite tertiary flake, one petrified wood secondary flake, six petrified wood tertiary flakes, six tertiary
chert flakes, and one burned, fingernail-punctate, and decorated, bone-tempered ceramic rim sherd.
Currently, the cultural affiliation of the ceramic is uncertain, though it may be Caddoan. The artifacts
occurred in the friable sandy loam from near the ground surface to a depth of about 90 centimeters bs.

The site lacked any identifiable impacts from modern heavy machinery despite its proximity to US 190
and Bear Creek Loop. Although impacts were not obvious, tribe members described the area as having
been previously harvested for lumber. Based on a review of recent USDA aerial photographs of the area,
the site area does not exhibit the visual characteristics of a pine plantation. The large size of several of the
trees on site suggests the logging occurred decades before modern plantation methods were adopted.
Other possible impacts to the site may be related to Grant Geophysical Inc.’s 1999 3D seismic project
(Johnson and Lintz 1999). One shovel test, number 60852273, was placed approximately 35 meters
southeast of the boundaries of 41PK248. Since no artifacts were reported for that shovel test, it is
assumed that an explosive charge was later detonated there.
Ms. Debbie Thomas was immediately notified of the identification of site 41PK248. She informed
members of the tribe’s cultural committee, four of which visited the location of the site with Blanton &
Associates archeologists. Shovel Test 5 was re-excavated at their request to see the projectile point. After
examination, the point was reburied in the shovel test.

Recommendations
Investigations at the proposed ACIR #10 revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources within the
400 by 400-foot well pad or along the proposed flowlines and access road. Blanton & Associates
recommends, therefore, that the construction of ACIR #10 proceed as planned without additional
archeological survey, as no cultural resources or historic properties will be affected.
During shovel testing of ACIR #9, prehistoric site 41PK248 was discovered. The site probably represents
the remains of a series of open campsites established on the low rise west of Bear Creek. The site is
buried and contains diagnostic artifacts from at least two prehistoric periods. Compared to other sites
discovered in the region, 41PK248 exhibited a high artifact density (n=64), higher than any other site
recorded within the bounds of the ACIR. The presence of buried cultural deposits in conjunction with the
likelihood that the site area has experienced few impacts or disturbances, suggests that it could contain
cultural deposits eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and/or for formal SAL designation. Unfortunately,
shovel testing is insufficient to make an eligibility recommendation and, as such, the site’s NRHP and
SAL eligibility status is currently unknown.
As currently proposed, the undertaking at ACIR #9 would likely destroy 41PK248. If regulators concur
that the NRHP and/or SAL eligibility status is uncertain, Blanton & Associates recommends that the
proposed well pad be relocated to completely avoid the site. If the site cannot be avoided, a systematic
archeological testing program would be necessary to determine the eligibility status. If the site can be
avoided with the placement of a new well pad near the site, fencing or some other barrier to prevent
encroachment on to the site during construction of ACIR #9 would be necessary avoid accidental site
impacts.
