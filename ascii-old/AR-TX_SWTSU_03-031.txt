Management Summary
This report presents the results of archaeological investigations and subsequent analyses of
archaeological site 41HY165, located along the banks of Spring Lake in Hays County, Texas. Excavations
were conducted at 41HY165 during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 Southwest Texas State University (now
Texas State University-San Marcos [Texas State]) field schools. As site 41HY165 was and still is
located on property owned by Texas State (formerly Southwest Texas State University), investigations
during the 1996–1998 field schools were subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas. Therefore, a Texas
Antiquities Permit (Permit No. 1700) was issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on May
30, 1996, with Dr. James Garber serving as Principal Investigator. The permit has since defaulted, and
it is the goal of this report to close this permit.
Investigations into the site subsequent to the field school have been limited to analyses of the
collections curated at the university, and later with the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at
Texas State. These investigations included an analysis of the faunal materials conducted by Jennifer
Giesecke in May of 1998, and processing of flotation samples in 2002 by undergraduate students at
Southwest Texas State. The only substantive research conducted on the site was the thesis prepared by
Christopher Ringstaff as part of his graduate studies at Southwest Texas State University (Ringstaff
2000). While Ringstaff’s thesis offers a relatively comprehensive study of the three field school seasons,
the focus of his research is on the geoarchaeological properties of the site, and thus the attention given
to the artifact assemblage and features at the site is limited to that scope of his research.
As part of the Spring Lake Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project (SLAERP) being
conducted in conjunction with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Texas State, CAS conducted
additional analyses and syntheses of the collected materials from 41HY165. The goals were to
assess the collections at 41HY165 and synthesize that information within the broader research goals
of the SLAERP, as well as to finalize the existing defaulted permit with the THC. This was began
by assessing the curated collection and resorting and cataloging the artifacts. After the catalog was
compiled, a research design for the analysis of the artifacts was developed. The collections from the
1996–1998 field schools include unit level forms for all units, unit level plan maps, artifact inventory
sheets, and collected artifacts. Additionally, student field journals from the 1997 field school and Chris
Ringstaff’s thesis were also referenced. Ringstaff (2000) provides the only maps showing the general
layout of excavation units and shovel tests. Based on the available data, it was possible to reconstruct
the distribution of artifacts and features at the site; these reconstructions, supplemented with new
radiometric dates, provide the basis for the present analysis. This report, therefore, presents a summary
the results of the investigations conducted by Southwest Texas State University from the 1996, 1997,
and 1998 field school seasons, and the subsequent analysis and synthesis conducted by CAS at Texas
State between 2010 and 2011.

the campus of Texas State University-San Marcos
(Texas State) in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas
(Figure 1-1). The site is situated at the confluence
of Sink Creek and Spring Lake. Based on the

Site 41HY165 is a deeply buried, multicomponent assemblage of artifacts and features
spanning the last 10,000 years of human

into the eastern half of the lake, and also extends
around the south and west lake margins.

used as the basis for Christopher Ringstaff’s
(2000) Masters’ thesis.
The 1996–1998 field schools appear to have
been attended primarily by SWT students, with
22 students attending in 1996, 25 in 1997, and nine
in 1998. Additionally, seven other individuals
have been noted on the field recording forms;
presumably, they were volunteers working on
the site during non-field school sessions, most
likely in support of Ringstaff’s data collection
for his thesis. Garber served as the Principal
Investigator for the field school, with Brown as
the field director and Ringstaff as a teaching
assistant. In addition to the field excavations, the
students also conducted limited laboratory work
during inclement weather and attended lectures
related to Texas prehistory.

Both
terrestrial
and
underwater
archaeological investigations have been
conducted on various sites in the Spring Lake
area since the late 1970s. The first investigations
at 41HY165 were conducted in 1984 by Dr. James
Garber as part of a field school for Southwest
Texas State University (SWT, now Texas State).
A second field school was conducted on the site
in 1988 by David Driver, along with Garber,
and focused on testing and recording the site.
Finally, three field schools were conducted on
the site in 1996, 1997, and 1998 by Garber and
Mary Kathryn Brown. During these three field
schools, 11 test units were excavated over the
eastern portion of the site. The results of the field
investigations during these field schools were

Investigations into the site subsequent to
the field school have been limited to analyses
of the collections housed at the university and

now curated with the Center for Archaeological
Studies (CAS) at Texas State. The first analysis was
conducted in May of 1998 by Jennifer Giesecke,
who examined the faunal materials identified at
the site in the 1996 and 1997 field seasons. This
investigation was part of an independent study
by Giesecke for Garber, with the assistance of
Mike Quigg of TRC Mariah Associates, Inc. In
a short paper summarizing her results, Giesecke
stated that the analysis was only preliminary,
and recommended additional analysis of the
faunal materials from the site (Giesecke 1998).
In 2002, undergraduate students processed
flotation samples as part of a directed study.
However, there is no documentation related to
this study, and the only evidence that it occurred
is limited to the inventory forms and bag labels
of the processed samples. The only substantive
reporting of the site was in the thesis prepared by
Ringstaff as part of his graduate studies at SWT
(Ringstaff 2000). While Ringstaff’s thesis offers
a relatively comprehensive study of the three field
school seasons, the focus of his research is on the
geoarchaeological properties of the site, and thus
the attention given to the artifact assemblage and
features is limited to that scope of his research.

(SLAERP) being conducted in conjunction with
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and
Texas State, CAS conducted additional analyses
and syntheses of the materials collected from
41HY165. The goals of this exercise were to
assess the collections, synthesize that information
within the broader research goals of the SLAERP,
and finalize the existing defaulted permit with
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The
current efforts began in February of 2010 by
assessing the curated collection and resorting and
cataloging the artifacts. After the catalog was
compiled, a research design for the analysis of the
artifacts and completion of the final report was
compiled. This report summarizes the results of
the investigations conducted by SWT during the
1996, 1997, and 1998 field school seasons, and
the subsequent analysis and synthesis by CAS
between 2010 and 2011.

Summary of Work
While two field schools were conducted
prior to the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons, there
is no formal accounting of those investigations
aside from the recording of the site with the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at
The University of Texas at Austin. From the
1984 field season, there exist the unit level forms
from two excavation units at the site, and some
of the original laboratory inventory forms. No
field forms or maps appear to exist from this
season. In addition, the artifacts collected from
the 1984 field season were added to the later
collected artifacts from the late 1990s. As part
of the current investigation into these collections,
the 1984 assemblage has been separated from
the later materials and curated at CAS. Nothing
remains of the 1988 investigations, and there are
no field notes, photos, maps, or drawings from
either of the previous two field schools. Due to the
uncertain provenience of the 1984 assemblage,

Currently, there are no site maps, photos, or
official field notes that exist for 41HY165. The
only remaining materials for the site consist of
the recovered artifact assemblage, level and
feature forms, sketch maps, lab inventory forms,
and student field journals from the 1997 field
school. While these data are useful, the majority
of the information was filled out by students, and
is sometimes incomplete; furthermore, accuracy
of the data is questionable. Given these existing
data, the thesis prepared by Ringstaff currently
serves as the best source of information regarding
the investigations during 1996, 1997, and 1998.

the permit for the SLAERP. Dr. James Garber is
the Principal Investigator listed on the permit.

The collections from the 1996–1998 field
schools include unit level forms for all units,
unit level plan maps, artifact inventory sheets,
and collected artifacts. Additionally, there are
student field journals from the 1997 field school
and Ringstaff’s thesis. There are no site maps
or photos in the collection from these field
schools. However, Ringstaff (2000) provides
maps in his thesis showing the general layout
of excavation units and shovel tests. Based on
the available data, it is possible to reconstruct
the distribution of artifacts and features at the
site; these reconstructions, supplemented with
new radiometric dates, provide the basis for the
present analysis.

Currently, a portion of the area of potential
effect (APE) for the SLAERP includes 41HY165.
The SLAERP is subject to Section 206 of the
Water Resources Development Act of 1996 and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended. Archaeological
investigations for the SLAERP are also being
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
5582, as the property is still owned by Texas
State. The analysis and reporting of the 1996–
1998 field school investigations are primarily
being conducted as part of the mitigation
measures outlined in the SLAERP Historic
Properties Treatment Plan. As a result, the current
investigations of the field school collection are also
subject to the federal regulations outlined above.
All of the investigations outlined in this report
were conducted in accordance with the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for
Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR
44716-44742), the Secretary’s Standards for
Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), the SLAERP
Historic Properties Treatment Plan, and Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 1700 and No. 5582.

Regulatory Concerns
The excavations conducted at 41HY165
during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 field schools
were for educational purposes only, and not
related to cultural resource management. At
that time, there was no federal involvement
with the investigations related to funding or
regulation. However, site 41HY165 was and still
is located on property owned by Texas State,
and investigations during the 1996–1998 field
schools were subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural
Resource Code of 1977, as revised). Therefore,
Texas State was required under 13 TAC 26.3b to
apply for a Texas Antiquities Permit, issued by
the THC. The permit was issued to Texas State
as Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1700 on May
30, 1996, prior to initiating field investigations
at the site. The term of the permit was for one
year from the initiation date; it was renewed prior
to its expiration for an additional year, to expire
on December 1, 1998. The permit has since
defaulted, and it is the goal of this report to close

Organization of this Report and
Personnel
The report is organized into 12 chapters,
including this introduction. The second chapter
of the report deals with the site’s environmental
context and the land use history. The third chapter
examines the site within the cultural context
of Central Texas, and summarizes the previous
investigations at 41HY165 and relevant sites in the
Spring Lake area. The research design, including
the general research goals of the SLAERP, defined
analytical units, and the analytical approach
to the assemblage, is provided in the fourth
chapter. Chapter 5 discusses the analytical units

and analytical approaches employed. Chapter
6 presents the lithic analysis conducted, while
analysis of prehistoric ceramics is presented in
Chapter 7. The Historic Assemblage is discussed
in Chapter 8, and analysis of botanical and
micofossil remains are presented in Chapter 9.
Burned rock technology is discussed in Chapter
10, and zooarchaeology is discussed in Chapter

identified as to the type of plant material by Dr.
Kandace D. Hollenbach at the Archaeological
Research Laboratory (ARL) at The University
of Tennessee, Knoxville, and dates from charred
plant material and bison bone were obtained
from the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator
Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University
of California-Irvine, in collaboration with Dr.
Douglas Kennett at the University of Oregon.
The microfossil analysis of the burned rocks
was conducted by Dr. Timothy E. Riley at the
Archaeological Ecology Laboratory (AEL) at
Texas A&M University. Our thanks also go to
Christopher Ringstaff for providing additional
information regarding the field schools.

Dr. James Garber served as the Principal
Investigator for this project from its inception, and
Carole Leezer, Associate Director of CAS, served
as the Principal Investigator for the SLAERP.
The report was edited by Carole A. Leezer, with
sections authored by John A. Campbell, Kandace
D. Hollenbach, Carole A. Leezer, Jon C. Lohse,
Lori B. Love, Amy E. Reid, Timothy E. Riley,
Cinda Timperley, Steve Tomka, Kristi Ulrich,
and David M. Yelacic. Dr. Jon C. Lohse, Director
of CAS, and Ms. Leezer served as the supervising
archaeologists throughout the current analysis
and report writing. The laboratory work related to
sorting, cataloging, and analysis of the collection
was conducted by graduate and undergraduate
student employees of CAS under the supervision
of Ms. Leezer, Dr. Lohse, and Mr. Campbell. The
laboratory workers include Jacob Hooge, Josh
Hamilton, Veronica Suarez, Sarah Scoggins,
Amy Reid, Brooke Boyer, Patricia Christmas,
Stephanie Williams, and Katherine Pratt. The
analysis of the faunal remains was conducted
by Cinda Timperley with CAS. Prehistoric
ceramics identified within the collection were
analyzed by The University of Texas at San
Antonio’s (UTSA) Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR). Radiocarbon samples were

Goals
The primary goal of the current research was
to finalize the defaulted Texas Antiquities Permit
that was obtained for the three field school seasons
in 1996, 1997, and 1998. A secondary goal was
to assess the collections from 41HY165 within
the broader research framework established
for the SLAERP, as well as for the previously
investigated sites surrounding Spring Lake. As
stated previously, the results of the current study
are to be used as part of the mitigation efforts for
the SLAERP. To accomplish this, the collected
data were analyzed and synthesized with regard
to the methodologies and research questions
established during previous investigations of
nearby sites. By using a similar methodology
to previous investigations, it is hoped that the
similarity in processes will allow for greater
intra- and inter- site comparability and analysis
at Spring Lake and Central Texas.

Environmental Setting
By John A. Campbell and David M. Yelacic
Site 41HY165 is located in San Marcos along
Spring Lake, a unique and somewhat dynamic
environment near the center of the Balcones
Escarpment (Figure 2-1). Here, cool, fresh water
issues forth from numerous artesian springs
in lower Cretaceous limestone bedrock, and
confluences with another springfed stream that also drains a
portion of the EscarpmentCanyonlands ecotone, Sink
Creek. These sources of
water that draw and support
vegetation, wildlife, and culture
also serve as a mode to preserve
the signatures of each. That is,
this alluvial system is capable
of encapsulating former ground
surfaces that contain remnants
of past lifeways. Understanding
how this landscape changes
through time, then, is an
important part of understanding
the archaeological record.
First, from Nordt (2010),
who compiled geological data
from across the Spring Lake
peninsula and beyond, it is
necessary to get an idea of the
broad patterns and processes
in landscape formation at
this location. What Nordt
found through the analysis of
22 geological cores was that
the earliest extant phase of

sedimentation in the valley begins around 11,470
± 100 radiocarbon years before present (RCYBP).
From a series of cores recently removed from
sediments composing the lake bottom (Leezer
et al. 2011), two other late Pleistocene dates (i.e.,
13,155±65 [wood] and 19,160±140 [bulk humate]

Figure 2-1. Natural regions of Texas with Hays County inset.

RCYBP) were recovered, which suggest that
there are at least patches of sediment predating
the late Pleistocene entrenchment and sediment
aggradation observed by Nordt. In any event,
late Pleistocene to early Holocene sediment
accumulation in a wet, marshy environment
was terminated by channel entrenchment and
subsequent overbank sediment accumulation
by approximately 7365 RCYBP. Rapid
sedimentation persists through a period of time
from approximately 5900 to 3300 RCYBP, and
likely represents a relatively dramatic change
in the nature of the fluvial system. After 3300
RCYBP, depositional rates diminish, and
geomorphology slowly develops into the present
landscape.

is highest in the months of May and June (9.6–
8.0 cm) and also in the month of September (9.2
cm) (Anaya 2004; Carr 1967; Larkin and Bomar
1983). This is due to the direction of prevailing
winds coming from the southeast off the Gulf of
Mexico during these times (Slade 1986). During
these months, these southerly, moisture-laden
winds generally clash with cooler, dryer air from
the north, causing a release of moisture over the
Edwards Plateau. In addition, the warm, moist air
from the Gulf of Mexico rises along the Balcones
Escarpment and cools, causing precipitation, and
oftentimes heavy storms (Carr 1967; Slade 1986).
During the winter months, between November
and March, precipitation drops to around 4.4–6.4
cm as colder, dryer air moves in from the plains
(Larkin and Bomar 1983).

From a series of excavation units near the
confluence of Sink Creek and the San Marcos
Springs, Ringstaff (2000) notes the particularities
of landform development and site formation
of 41HY165. At this location, early Holocene
sediments are truncated by mid-Holocene
erosion, which creates an unconformity or
a period of missing time between 6500 and
4500 RCYBP. This period of sediment loss is
followed by slow aggradation of sediments and
soil formation during the late Holocene. In this
final phase of landscape development, Ringstaff
(2000) notes that there is a possible period of
erosion, marked by an unconformity, between
2400 and 1400 RCYBP.

Average temperatures in Hays County
typically reach up to 35º C during the summer
months, with average low temperatures reaching
to just above freezing during the winter (Bomar
1983). The average annual temperature of the
region is 21.1ºC (Carr 1967). January is typically
the coldest month, with average low/high
temperatures of 2.2º/16ºC, while July and August
are generally the hottest months, with average
low/high temperatures of 21.7º/35.1ºC degrees
(Bomar 1983).

Physiography and Geology
The Balcones Escarpment represents the
remains of the Ouachita Mountains that formed
during a tectonic event at the end of the Paleozoic
Era (Anaya 2004; Edwards Aquifer Authority
2004). The Ouachita Mountains extended
from Mexico to Arkansas and allowed for the
formation of shallow seas to the northwest.
During the Early Cretaceous, shallow seas
advanced across this area, depositing sediments
that formed the Glen Rose formation and began
formation of the Stuart City Reef Trend (Anaya

Climate
Site 41HY165 is located within the
Subtropical Humid climate region of Texas. This
region extends from north to south across the
eastern portion of the state, and is characterized
by warm summers (Larkin and Bomar 1983). The
average annual precipitation within the region is
about 81.3 centimeters (cm), which falls mostly
as rain in the early summer and fall. Precipitation

2004). In the Cenozoic Era, faulting along
the buried Ouachita Mountains range caused
regional uplift, forming the Balcones Fault Zone
and displacing Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary
sediments (Anaya 2004; Edwards Aquifer
Authority 2004). The current landscape has been
formed by the continual downcutting of streams
and rivers through the Balcones Escarpment as
they make their way to the Gulf of Mexico.

Holocene. These deposits consist of quartz sand,
chert, quartzite, and petrified wood gravels, and
limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1974).
Northwest of the site, the uplands overlooking
Sink Creek consist of the undivided Del Rio clay
and Georgetown Formation, which are made up
of calcareous and gypsiferous clays and finegrained, nodular limestone (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1974).

Site 41HY165 is situated at the base of the
Balcones Escarpment on a deep, frequently
flooded alluvial terrace at the confluence of the
headwaters of the San Marcos River and adjacent
intermittent tributary, Sink Creek. Clear artesian
waters emanate from approximately 200 small
springs and three large fissures along the Balcones
Fault. Fluvial terrace deposits (Qal) composed
of eroded gravel, sand, silt, and clay from the
Edwards Plateau formed along the upper San
Marcos River from the Late Pleistocene to Late

Soils
The soils at site 41HY165 consist of mollisols
that formed under hot conditions in primarily
grassland with sparse trees. In some areas, these
soils formed under wet conditions with vertic
qualities and a high salt content (Batte 1984).
Specifically, the soils are mapped as Oakalla
clay loam (Ok), with Tinn clay (Tn) (Figure 2-2)
occurring along the southeastern portion of the
site (Batte 1984). Oakalla clay loam (Ok) soils are

Figure 2-2. Soils mapped at Spring Lake and 41HY165.

generally dark grayish brown in color, moderately
alkaline and calcareous throughout, with
approximately 60 percent calcium carbonate, and
contain an extremely firm to very hard, moderate,
fine subangular blocky clay structure (Batte
1984:34, 75). This compact structure allows for
less cracking and movement than other clays.
This means that archaeological investigations
within these soils should be less hampered by
the movement of artifacts as a result of cracking
dynamics. Tinn clay (Tn) is generally dark gray to
grayish brown in color, and like Oakalla soils, is

moderately alkaline and calcareous. Its structure,
however, ranges from moderate, medium and
subangular to weak, medium, blocky. As a result
of its structure and higher clay content, it is more
likely to crack, thus allowing for possible vertical
movement of artifacts.
As a result of the 1996–1998 field
schools, Ringstaff (2000) identified three
locally defined soil horizons (Figure 2-3)
from three excavation units at the site, which
he designated Units I–III. Unit III is the

uppermost A horizon, and occurs between 15 and
50 cm below the ground surface (cmbs). This unit
is described as a very dark brown silty clay loam
with granular structure. Ringstaff (2000:50)
identified an Ap horizon (Unit IIIa) in the upper
15 cm of this horizon as a thin, gravelly, humic
zone. Unit II is an ABb horizon between 50 and
90 cmbs, and Ringstaff (2000:50) describes
the boundary between Unit III and Unit II as
clear and smooth. This horizon consists of
dark yellowish brown silty clay with moderate
subangular blocky structure due to its higher clay
content. Ringstaff (2000:51) noted little evidence
of bioturbation in this horizon. The final horizon
consists of two soil units occurring from 95 to 110
cmbs to a depth of 280 cmbs, where excavation
was deepest. The upper portion of this horizon
(Unit Ia) ranges from a Bw2b to Bwk2b dark
reddish brown silty loam with weak subangular
blocky structure. Ringstaff (2000:52) notes some

krotovina in this horizon filled with artifacts
and sediments from Unit II. Underlying Unit Ia
is a C2b horizon (Unit 1b) consisting of reddish
brown silty clay with moderate subangular block
structure. Ringstaff (2000:53) also notes that the
soil is friable with little evidence of bioturbation,
and may extend to a depth of 6–9 meters (m)
below ground surface (mbs).
Lee Nordt (2010) identified six major
depositional units of the Aquarena Center during
the 2001 investigations of 41HY160. Units A
through F were defined as reflecting changes in
the course of Sink Creek, periods of increased
and decreased stream flow, and changes in the
resulting depositional regimes. These units were
deposited in chronological order, from oldest to
most recent, and range from Paleoindian (A) to
Late Prehistoric and Historic periods (F) (Figure
2-4).

Cultural and Historic Context
By John A. Campbell and Carole A. Leezer

Cultural Periods

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian stage marks the earliest
human occupation of North America and extends
until approximately 8000 BP. According to
Hester (1995:433–436, 2004), the Paleoindian
period occurred between 11,200 and 7950 BP
in South Texas. Collins (1995:381–385, 2004)
dates it to 11,500–8800 BP in Central Texas.
Diagnostic Paleoindian artifacts include Clovis,
Folsom, and a variety of later types (Bousman
et al. 2004). Early Paleoindian peoples are
thought of as highly nomadic cultures that relied
heavily on hunting large game animals such as
mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse
(Black 1989). Of these, all but bison were extinct
by the end of Clovis times. Research has shown
that Paleoindians utilized a wide variety of plants
and animals, such as raccoons, badgers, mice,
alligators, turtles, and tortoises (Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and Brown 2000;
Hester 1983; Lemke and Timperley 2008).

Human presence within the region is
divided into three periods: Prehistoric (including
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric),
Protohistoric, and Historic. Evidence for
prehistoric occupation in and around the San
Marcos Springs extends from the Clovis period,
approximately 11,500 years before present (BP),
up until the arrival of Spanish explorers about
400 years ago. Historic documents record the use
of the springs by Spanish and Native American
groups in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
nineteenth centuries, and as early as the midnineteenth century by Anglo settlers such as
General Edward Burleson.
Spring Lake is in a transitional zone in terms
of cultural influences, with traits present from
Central Texas, South Texas, and, to a lesser degree,
the Upper Coast of Texas (Goode 1989). Patterson
(1995) has synthesized the chronological evidence
for Southeast Texas, including the Upper Coastal
Region. Black (1995), Hester (1995, 2004),
and Collins (1995, 2004) have provided recent
syntheses of the cultural chronologies for Central
and South Texas. Dates for prehistoric periods
and parts of the Protohistoric that are derived
from archaeological contexts are presented in
radiocarbon years BP (or 1950). Dates in the
historic period are based on written accounts and
are given in calendar years.

A large distribution of Clovis points across
North and Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of their makers (Wenke 1990:201).
These points are lanceolate in shape, have a
thinned base resulting from “fluting,” or the
removal of one or more channel flakes, and are
often found associated with remains of large,
now-extinct herbivores. Site types include open
camp sites, quarries, and caches, though kill sites
are the best known. Other artifacts associated
with Clovis are specialized bifaces, prismatic
blades and blade cores, engraved stones, bone
points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
13

Clovis is followed by Folsom and Midland
point styles; these latter types overlap slightly
(Holliday 1997). Folsom points are fluted and are
found in association with ancient bison remains,
while Midland points are manufactured through
pressure collateral flaking, but lack fluted
channels. Very thin bifaces, called ultrathin
bifaces, are also found at some Folsom sites
(Stanford and Broilo 1981). Folsom peoples
are considered to be specialized bison hunters.
Most Folsom sites occur as surface scatters,
although deeply buried deposits have been
uncovered. Artifacts associated with this interval
are common throughout Texas (Bousman et al.
2004).

and variety of lithic tools for wood working;
greater population stability and less residential
mobility; and systematic burial of the dead. This
stage is also distinguished by environmental and
climatic changes and oscillations.
The beginning of the Holocene, a significant
climate change associated with the extinction of
megafauna, stimulated a behavioral change in
land use. Groups focused more intensively on
the exploitation of local resources such as deer,
fish, and plant bulbs. This dietary adjustment
is evidenced by the increased number of
groundstone artifacts, burned-rock middens, and
tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe
bifaces (Turner and Hester 1999). Early Archaic
sites are thinly dispersed, and are seen across a
wide area of Texas and northern Mexico (Weir
1976). Hester (1995:436–438; 2004) dates the
Early Archaic, characterized by Early Basal
Notched and Early Corner Notched dart points,
to 7950–4450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004)
argues that the Early Archaic spans from 8800
to 6000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types.

Archaeological evidence suggests that, with
the exception of bison, large game animals were
extinct in Texas after 10,000 BP. Hunters instead
concentrated on deer, antelope, and other game
(Bousman et al. 2002, 2004). Between 10,000 and
8000 BP, Central Texas is characterized by a series
of cultural groups based on changing projectile
point styles that transform from stemmed to
lanceolate, and then back to stemmed. Changes
in the subsistence base eventually required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a
new cultural period known as the Archaic.

The Middle Archaic in Central Texas dates
from 6000 to 4000 BP (Collins 1995, 2004).
Collins divides the Middle Archaic into three
projectile point style intervals: Bell-AndiceCalf Creek; Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. The
beginning of the Middle Archaic (Bell-AndiceCalf Creek) was a mesic period when grasslands
expanded southwards into Central and South
Texas; this expanding habitat attracted bison
herds from the Plains. People associated with
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek styles were specialized
bison hunters and who maintained a tool kit
specifically adapted to killing and processing
bison. Points were extremely thin and broad, and
made differently from the proceeding period.
The Middle Archaic in general is associated
with the Altithermal, a prolonged period of

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Archaic in
Central Texas from approximately 8800 to
1200/1300 BP (other archaeologists suggest
that the Archaic began at 8000 BP). Following
Weir (1976), this period is divided into Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic periods. The Archaic
marks several important transitions: a shift from
large game hunting to hunting smaller animals;
an apparent increase in the use of plant food
resources and the use of groundstone in food
processing; implementation of stone cooking
technology; increased use of organic materials in
tool technologies and an increase in the number
14

warmer temperatures and increasing aridity. As
the Altithermal progressed through the Middle
Archaic, conditions in South and Central Texas
became ever warmer and drier, and both bison
and bison hunters may have retreated northwards.
Taylor bifaces were manufactured during this
period; these bifaces are similar to the earlier
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek point styles, but lack the
deep basal notches that characterize the earlier
types. By the latter part of the Middle Archaic,
Nolan and Travis points predominate; both are
technologically and stylistically dissimilar to
the preceding styles (Collins 1995, 2004). The
Nolan-Travis interval was also a period when
temperature and aridity were at their peaks,
and there is evidence of increased utilization of
xerophytes such as sotol (Johnson and Goode
1994). These plants were typically baked in earth
ovens, associated with middens of burned and
fire-cracked rock. During drier episodes of this
period, the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich
environments of Central Texas were extensively
utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).

short, triangular points with side notches. The
Frio point also has a notched base (Turner and
Hester 1999).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late Prehistoric
at 1300/1200–260 BP, and follows Kelley (1947)
in dividing it into the Austin and Toyah phases.
This stage is marked by the shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow, and by
the incorporation of pottery in the central and
northern parts of the South Texas Plains (Black
1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Emphasis on bison
hunting during the Toyah phase was a significant
factor in determining settlement and mobility
patterns.
The Austin phase is characterized by small
arrow points, including Edwards, Scallorn,
and other types, indicating a shift from the use
of atlatls to bows. Burned rock middens are
sometimes associated with these types (e.g.,
Houk and Lohse 1993). Ground and pecked stone
tools for processing plant food are increasingly
common, and burials from this time reveal a high
proportion of arrow-wound deaths (Black 1989;
Prewitt 1974), perhaps suggesting some disputes
over resource availability.

The Late Archaic dates to approximately
4,000–1300/1200 BP (Collins 1995:384, 2004).
Bison herds began returning to the southern
Great Plains (Dillehay 1974), again influencing
subsistence. Cemeteries at sites such as Ernest
Witte (Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski
1988) provide some evidence that populations
increased and that groups were becoming
territorial (Story 1985:44–45), though this
pattern may have begun in South Texas as early
as ca. 6500–7000 BP (Ricklis 2005). Pottery,
which often accompanies increased sedentism,
territoriality, and population growth, began
appearing in limited areas of the South Texas
Plains during the Late Archaic (Story 1985).
However, most regions remained “pre-ceramic”
for another thousand years (Story 1985:45–47).
Common projectile points are Ensor and Frio
(Turner and Hester 1999), both of which are

The beginning of the Toyah period (750
BP) in Central Texas is marked by contracting
stem points and flaring, barbed shouldered
points. Perdiz is the most common example
(Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346), and this
type occasionally occurs on glass in mission
contexts (e.g., Lohse 1999:268). This period is
also characterized by prismatic blades, blade
cores, and scrapers-on-blades, all considered part
of a specialized bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994). The wide variety of ceramic
styles and materials seen in Toyah pottery
provides information on the social composition
15

of these groups (Arnn 2005), with assemblages
displaying Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada
Mogollon influences. Johnson (1994) contends
Toyah culture represents a constellation of traits
shared by a limited number of groups sprawled
across a very large area of Texas. Ricklis (1994)
describes it as a collection of traits that moved
through relatively stable regional populations.
Recently Arnn (2007) has argued that a large
number of cultural groups, many of which were
documented by European explorers, interacted
with each other over a large area, resulting in the
spread of shared styles and technologies.

Spanish settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas
(McGraw et al. 1991).
Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided most of the available information on
indigenous cultures of early Texas. The few
surviving accounts of native groups in Texas reveal
a dynamic cultural environment where numerous
tribes passed through or inhabited Central Texas
at different periods. Little is known about the
majority of these tribes, but those documented
around the springs at San Marcos include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane.
Other tribes encountered at San Marcos included
mobile hunting parties from villages in South
and West Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya,
Chalome, Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading
for bison hunting grounds in the Blackland
Prairies (Foster 1995:265–289; Johnson and
Campbell 1992; Newcomb 1993). Later groups
migrated into the region, displacing the former
groups or tribes. These included the Tonkawa
from Oklahoma and Lipan and Comanche from
the Plains (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Dunn
1911; Newcomb 1961, 1993). Archaeological sites
dated to this period typically contain a mix of
both European imported goods, such as metal
objects and glass beads, and chipped stone tools.

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada) Period
The Protohistoric period was marked by
Spanish entradas, formal expeditions into Texas
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. Hester defines the period as “the
transition period between the Prehistoric and
Historic period denoting a phase for which few
written records are available, and for which
most evidence is derived from archaeology”
(1995:449–450, 2004). This period began with
the venture by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de
Vaca and the Narvaez expedition in AD 1528, and
extends to the establishment of the Mission San
Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in San Antonio,
in AD 1718.

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero, and the later
founding of San Antonio de Béxar (Bolton
1970 [1915]; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1977). Most
knowledge of this period is gained through the
written records of the early Spanish missionaries.
Between AD 1746 and 1755, three missions, San
Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, San Ildefonso,
and Nuestra Señora de la Canderlaria were
located somewhere along the San Gabriel (known
at the time as the San Xavier) River in presentday Milam County. The three missions were

When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, entradas began
to travel regularly through Central Texas. These
expeditions provide the first detailed observations
on the original Native American inhabitants of
the region. With Alonso de León’s expedition of
AD 1680, El Camino Real (the King’s Road) was
established from Villa Santiago de la Monclova
in Mexico to East Texas. This roadway followed
established Native American trade routes and
trails, and became a vital link between Mission
San Juan Bautista in Northern Mexico and the

16

eventually coalesced into one, the San Xavier
Mission, and moved to the San Marcos River
in AD 1755. A petition to permanently establish
a mission in Apache territory resulted in the
founding of the San Sabá Mission, near presentday Menard, in AD 1757. Neophytes from the
San Xavier Mission were transferred to the San
Antonio missions and the mission property and
presidio were reassigned to the San Sabá Mission.
A small group of local San Xavier Indians, the
Mayeyes, persuaded the missionaries to set up
a new mission for them on the Guadalupe, the
San Francisco Xavier Mission, but it only lasted
until AD 1758 (Bolton 1970 [1915]). The precise
location of the San Francisco Xavier Mission
along the San Marcos River has not yet been
determined, but it has been speculated that it may
have been located on or near the Aquarena Center
peninsula (Bousman, personal communication
2004).

1836. Settlement in the region increased until AD
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in AD 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
There are three archaeological sites that have
been previously recorded adjacent to 41HY165.
These include 41HY147, 41HY160, and 41HY161.
These sites, along with 41HY165, are discussed
below (Figure 3-1).
In 1979, Joel Shiner (1983) began underwater
excavations at archaeological site 41HY147.
This site, a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL),
was recorded by John W. Clark in 1979 and is
composed of several areas of archaeological
debris located along a large terrace under Spring
Lake, adjacent to the western bank of the lake.
Primary excavations uncovered lithic materials
of various ages and faunal remains, mainly
consisting of mammoth, mastodon, and bison
tooth fragments (Shiner 1983).

Besides the mission town of San Antonio, the
only other Spanish settlement in the region was
San Marcos de Neve, established in AD 1808,
four miles south of present-day San Marcos. San
Marcos de Neve was abandoned in AD 1812 as
a result of constant raids by local tribes (Dobie
1932). During this time, massive depopulation
occurred among Native Americans due to
diseases to which indigenous people had little
resistance. Those few remaining were gradually
displaced to reservations beginning in the mid1850s (Fisher 1998).

Archaeological site 41HY160, an SAL, was
originally recorded by James Garber in 1983
during archaeological field school investigations
of Tee Box 6 of the Aquarena Golf Course
(Garber et al. 1983). These investigations
encountered Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
deposits that extended to a depth of 2.4 mbs.
Encountered artifacts and features included lithic
tools, lithic projectile points, faunal remains,
stone alignments, a posthole, a trash pit, hearths,
small burned rock middens, and an area possibly
associated with ceramic production. Additional
field school investigations took place across the
peninsula during the following years, and the
encountered cultural deposits in this area were
attributed to archaeological site 41HY160.

Mexico achieved independence from Spain
in AD 1827, opening settlements in what is
known today as South Texas. European presence
increased as settlers received land grants
from the Mexican government until AD 1835.
Settlement was difficult, however, due to raids
by Native American groups. The Texas Rangers
provided protection from these conflicts after
Texas secured independence from Mexico in AD
17

characterized this SAL as
consisting of Middle Archaic
lithic deposits occurring in
the sand and gravel at the foot
of the Ice House Dam Falls
(Shiner 1979). As further
archaeological investigations
were conducted adjacent to this
location, the site boundaries
of 41HY161 were expanded
to include the locations of
additionally
encountered
archaeological
deposits.
These deposits included Late
Paleoindian and Late Archaic
lithic materials, in addition to
two human burials.

Figure 3-1. Previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to
41HY165. Dashed line boundaries are recent updates resulting from
the SLAERP survey and testing project.

In 1840, the settlers of San Marcos had
constructed a large log and earth dam across the
San Marcos River to impound the waters for a
flour mill. This dam resulted in the creation of
Spring Lake, 3–4 m above the natural river
edge (Shiner 1981). In 1979, Dr. Joel B. Shiner
of Southern Methodist University began
investigations immediately below the falls of this
dam, known as the Ice House Falls, and recorded
archaeological site 41HY161. Shiner originally

Recorded
by
James
Garber in 1984 (Garber 1984),
SAL 41HY165 was the site
of field school investigations
conducted briefly in 1984, and
then was investigated more
thoroughly in 1996, 1997, and
1998 (Ringstaff 2000). Field
school investigations conducted
in 1996 and 1997 recorded
18 features (hearths, basins,
burned limestone scatters) and
collected numerous projectile
points, lithic tools, and faunal
remains.

Work has been conducted off and on at these
sites for a number of years, and brief summaries
of these investigations are presented below (Table
3-1).
Based on the results of these previous
investigations, cultural materials in good contexts
are undeniably present. Remains encountered
at the base of the Balcones Escarpment are in

colluvial deposits with questionable contexts.
However, materials in alluvial deposits, such
as on the peninsula and along Sink Creek
are potentially in intact contexts and contain
isolable components. Assemblages encountered
here have dated from the Paleoindian or Early
Archaic periods continuously to the Archaic and
Late Prehistoric periods and even the Colonial
and Historical eras. They have demonstrable
potential for providing high-quality data that
would unquestionably contribute to a better
understanding of prehistoric occupations within
the APE.

ages within a mixed, deflated, 20-cm stratum
(Shiner 1983); Clovis, Plainview, Angostura,
and Golondrina points were mixed with Archaic
points. Additionally, faunal remains, mainly
consisting of mammoth, mastodon, and bison
tooth fragments were also recovered (Shiner
1983). Subsequent excavations revealed three
distinct strata levels. The uppermost gray clay
matrix level varied from 20 to 30 cm in depth,
and contained Archaic shouldered and notched
projectile points. The second layer, red sand,
varied from 10 to 20 cm in thickness, and artifacts
recovered consisted of shouldered projectile
points and lanceolate points. The last layer,
consisting of red clay, contained the majority
of the megafauna remains in addition to Clovis,
Plainview, and other lanceolate points (Shiner
1983). Among the artifacts collected were a few
“exotic” or non-local materials consisting of redcolored quartzite and quartz crystals and chert
from 50 to 75 miles away. In addition several
scales of alligator gar were recovered, a species
far different from the local spotted gar (Shiner
1981). Shiner (1983) postulates that the presence

Investigations at the Spring Lake Site
(Shiner 1984) or Terrace Site (Takac 1990)
were carried out by Shiner intermittently from
1979 until his death in 1988. The site consists
of several areas of archaeological debris located
along a large underwater terrace of Spring Lake
adjacent to the western bank of the lake. Initial
excavations uncovered lithic materials of various

of scrapers, large amounts of lithic “chipping”
debris, preforms, and the broken bones of many
animal species indicates that the site was a
Paleoindian base camp supporting an almost
sedentary hunting and gathering existence. In
rebuttal, Johnson and Holliday (1984) postulate
that the large numbers of lithic artifacts were a
direct result of the availability of localized chert
outcrops in the area.

Site 41HY160 was initially investigated
during a field school by Garber (Garber 1983) in
1982. 41HY160 occupies the peninsula between
Spring Lake and Sink Creek upon which Aquarena
Center and a portion of the Texas State University
Golf Course are situated. As described by Garber
(1983), the site is located near Tee Box 6 of the
Texas State University Golf Course, adjacent to
Spring Lake. Prehistoric materials were noted on
the surface of an area approximately 300 x 200
m. In total, 34 m2 of soil were excavated to
varying depths, with the deepest unit excavated
to 2.4 mbs. Intact Late Prehistoric through Early
Archaic occupations were exposed (Garber et
al. 1983). The terminus of cultural deposits was
not determined due to the nature of the water
table. Garber et al. (1983) speculate that cultural
remains are present beneath the water table level
based on Shiner’s recovery of artifacts from
approximately 10 feet below the water surface of
Spring Lake. Excavations indicated that only the
upper 15 cm of soil were disturbed by historic
processes, and that the remaining deposits were
intact.

In October of 1989, following Shiner’s death,
Paul R. Takac, a graduate student at Southern
Methodist University, attempted to complete
the analysis of Shiner’s collection, conducted
additional excavations in 1990 and 1991, and
sought to publish these results (Takac 1990).
Takac (1990), like Shiner, contends that the
paleoenvironment of the Spring Lake area,
the abundance of raw lithic materials, and a
permanent and reliable water source may have
supported limited mobility hunter-gatherer
groups in the past. Takac compared the Spring
Lake material to the Early Archaic and Late
Prehistoric remains recovered by Garber et
al. (1983) at the Tee Box 6 area of 41HY160.
There, Garber noted a high incidence of usable
flakes that were not utilized or modified. Takac’s
primary analysis of the Spring Lake materials
indicated a similar occurrence. Also similar to
Tee Box 6, 41HY147 contained a wide range of
tool types, including projectile points, scrapers,
knives, drills, perforators, burins, and gouges in
addition to bifacial and discoidal cores at various
stages of reduction (Takac 1990). Takac’s project
was eventually abandoned due to the difficulty
of doing careful underwater investigations.
Combined, Takac’s and Shiner’s excavations
recovered a total of 46 Paleoindian projectile
points, most dating to the Late Paleoindian
period. Site 41HY147 was designated an SAL
on July 23, 1999 (Texas Historical Commission
[THC] 1999a).

Seventy-five projectile points (53 of which
were identifiable) were recovered and can be
placed in the Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic to
Late Prehistoric transition, the Archaic, and the
Paleoindian periods. Late Prehistoric projectile
points such as Perdiz, Scallorn, Cliffton, and
Alba were found between 0 and 20 cmbs. Points
characteristic of the Transitional Archaic Period
(Darl, Fairland, and Edgewood) were recovered
between 20 and 40 cmbs. Late Archaic projectile
points (Ensor, Frio, Marshall, and Castroville)
were excavated between 30 and 50 cmbs, while
early Late Archaic points (Pedernales) occurred
primarily between 50 and 70 cmbs. Nolan and
Early Stemmed points representing the Middle
and Early Archaic intervals were found between
70 and 190 cmbs. No projectile points that are
20

characteristic of the Paleoindian to Archaic
transition phase were noted (Garber et al. 1983). In
addition, 429 stone tools representing choppers,
scrapers, cores, fine bifaces, moderately worked
bifaces, crude bifaces, used-retouched flakes,
and intentionally retouched flakes were also
collected. Garber et al. (1983) stated that the
source of the chert cobbles is a limestone chert
outcrop approximately one kilometer to the north
of the site. It appears that tool finishing was an
important activity at the site, due to the presence
of over 35,000 pieces of lithic debitage (Garber
et al. 1983). The majority of the lithic debitage
has been classified as interior flakes representing
the final stages of reduction. In addition to the
above, three bone tools were also recovered,
consisting of two bone awls and one flesher.
Three sandstone grinding slabs were recovered
from the Late Prehistoric zone and the Late
Archaic to Late Prehistoric transition zone.
Twenty-six ceramic sherds were also recovered
from this zone, representing Leon Plain ware and
Caddoan type vessels (Garber et al. 1983). Faunal
remains consisted of bison, deer, and antelope.
Thirteen features were encountered and included:
five hearths, three stone alignments, two small
burned rock middens, a posthole, a trash pit, and
an area containing charcoal and pieces of fired,
shell-tempered clay possibly indicating ceramic
production (Garber et al. 1983).

SWT field school participants returned to the
41HY160 area under the direction of David Driver
in 1991. During this field school, three additional
units were excavated in the Tee Box 6 area, three
in the vicinity of the swimming pool in front of
the Spring Lake Hotel (now the Meadows Center
for Water and the Environment), and a seventh
unit northeast of the previous anthropology field
laboratory building (now biology field laboratory
building) on the edge of the golf course. Units
in the Tee Box 6 area were excavated to a depth
of 70 cmbs. Units in the area of the swimming
pool were excavated to a depth between 50 and
160 cmbs. Most of the upper deposits near the
swimming pool were believed to be mixed (James
Garber, personal communication 1999), but some
of the lower deposits appeared to be intact. The
unit next to the anthropology lab was excavated
to a depth of 100 cmbs. While field notes report
the recovery of cultural remains from these units,
excavations have not been cataloged, analyzed,
or reported.
A 1993 SWT field school was conducted at
Tee Box 6 area of 41HY160 under the direction
of David Driver. During this field school, an
additional six units were excavated and varied in
depth from 80 to 160 cmbs. Collected artifacts
include ceramic fragments, shell, lithic cores,
bone, lithic debitage, points, and point fragments.
These excavations have also not been fully
catalogued, analyzed, or reported.

Garber et al. (1983) summarized their report
by stating that preliminary analysis indicates
cultural occupations exist at the site from the
Early Archaic through to the Late Prehistoric. The
presence of Paleoindian projectile points suggests
earlier occupations; however, the nature of these
deposits is not yet fully understood. Garber et al.
(1983) recommended additional investigations at
the site to better understand the nature of these
earlier deposits. The field school returned to
41HY160 in 1983, but these excavations have not
been analyzed or reported.

In 1997, Dawn Ramsey (1997) conducted a
pedestrian and shovel-testing survey at Aquarena
Center. She excavated 10 shovel tests on the
east side (left bank) of Sink Creek and northeast
of the entrance road immediately east of the
escarpment. All but one shovel test produced
prehistoric artifacts.
In 1998, under the direction of Mary
Kathryn Brown, participants in the SWT field
21

school excavated six units at 41HY160 in the
vicinity of the Aquarena Center offices. Units
were excavated to depths between 20 and 148
cmbs. Excavations were halted in most of the
units due to invasion of the water table. Intact
deposits were found immediately below the
present surface in two of the units. Artifacts
collected included bifaces, shell, bone, lithic
debitage, and points. This collection has also
not been fully catalogued, analyzed, or reported.
Archaeological site 41HY160 was designated an
SAL on July 23, 1999 (THC 1999b).

2010). The purposes of this project were 1) to
determine the presence or absence of cultural
remains in the areas to be impacted; and 2) to
evaluate the integrity of any discovered cultural
materials and determine their potential for
providing significant archaeological information.
Additional geological coring was conducted
by the Bureau of Economic Geology of The
University of Texas at Austin in order to document
the Late Pleistocene and Holocene depositional
history of the valley. This produced another set of
22 cores that were extracted in two valley crosssections from east to west. Six 1 x 1-m test units
were also excavated to an average depth of 1.7 m
before reaching the water table. Two units were
placed in the footprint of a proposed pavilion and
restrooms, and four units were placed in the area
of the Spring Lake Hotel swimming pool and
surrounding parking lot. A number of special
samples were collected from the test excavations,
including radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic samples
of burned rock from features, and macrobotanical
samples. During the excavations, over 18,380
pieces of lithic material were collected including:
18 projectile points, 82 bifaces, 19 cores, two
groundstones, one hammerstone, 213 unifaces,
and 18,046 pieces of lithic debitage (Nickels and
Bousman 2010). In addition, 2,650 fire-cracked
rocks from 12 thermal features were analyzed
in the field, and 4,388 faunal remains and 37,672
snail shells were collected. No ceramic remains
were encountered. The testing investigation
documented the presence of intact and wellstratified archaeological deposits within the upper
1.7 m. Nickels and Bousman (2010) contented
that based on geological core samples and results
from previous investigations in addition to their
testing investigations, intact alluvial deposits
in the floodplain adjacent to the San Marcos
Springs contain evidence of human occupations
extending from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric.

In 1999 Prewitt & Associates conducted a
geological assessment of the Aquarena Center
peninsula through the extraction of 17 30-foot
(9-m), 3-inch-diameter cores in preparation for
potential limited development by Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD) (Goelz 1999).
The cores were drilled by Trinity Engineering
Testing Corporation and interpreted by Melinda
Goelz (1999). The primary result of this work
was to provide an outline of the late Quaternary
geological history of the valley and the potential
for prehistoric occupations. Goelz’s (1999)
geological assessment indicated that soil deposits
are shallow near the escarpment, but quickly
thicken to an average depth of 8.4 m in the central
portion of the peninsula. The recovery of cultural
materials in such small cores is not common,
and recovery usually indicates reasonably dense
occupation. The majority of the core samples
produced prehistoric artifacts, indicating a dense
concentration of artifacts in the area. Cultural
materials were recovered up to a depth of 6.5 m.
The estimated age for cultural materials at 6.5
mbs is 10,000 BP (Nickels and Bousman 2010).
In 2001 an archaeological testing project
was conducted as part of a master plan and
partnership between TPWD and Texas State to
develop a public interpretive and educational
center on the peninsula (Nickels and Bousman

More recent investigations at 41HY160
include Texas State field schools conducted in
2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006; these results have
been partially reported by Aery (2007), and a
detailed analysis is currently underway by CAS.
Data recovery excavations at 41HY160 began
after the 2001 testing project determined the
potential for stratified and intact buried deposits
at the site in the pecan grove area adjacent
to the Texas River Center Parking lot (Aery
2007). Excavations conducted during the field
schools were a result of mitigation measures
to compensate for the loss of information from
proposed construction in the area. The fieldwork
was conducted in June of 2001, 2002, 2003, and
2006.

Unit 11 at 73 cmbd, Unit 12 at 82 cmbd, Unit 13
at 69 cmbd, and Unit 15 at 55 cmbd. At the end
of the field season, the units were protected by
backfilling with sediment and covered by tarps
and plywood (Aery 2007).
During the 2003 field school, also supervised
by Bousman, an additional two units (Units
16 and 17) were opened. During this season,
archaeomagnetic samples were taken from
some of the fire-cracked rocks in identified
thermal features (Aery 2007). At the end of
the field season, the eastern six blocks were at
approximately 110 cmbd, and the western six
blocks were a 120 cmbd (Aery 2007).
The 2006 field school, supervised by Bousman
and Deidra Aery Black, continued excavations
throughout the whole block. The entire block
was excavated to a depth of 150 cmbd (Aery
2007). During the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006
field schools, 31 fire-cracked rock features were
identified. Recovered lithic material included
groundstone, modified flakes, bifaces, cores,
core tools, unifaces, and projectile points. Based
on the recovery of chronologically diagnostic
materials, the earliest deposits occurred during
the Early Archaic period. This period appears
to roughly correspond with the B-2 soil horizon,
and is found below 135–140 cmbs. The depth
of this cultural period is unknown because it
is located below the termination of excavation.
The transition between the Early and Middle
Archaic occurs between 120 and 140 cmbs, and is
generally situated around 130 cmbs. The Middle
Archaic is by far the best represented cultural
period in the block, and the greatest concentration
occurs between 70 and 130 cmbs, though in some
units this can be as shallow as 50 cmbs. The Late
Archaic occurs primarily between 60 and 80
cmbs. However, the Late Archaic cultural period
is not as well represented as the Middle Archaic,
and there is not a noticeable boundary between the

In 2001, the field school crew was supervised
by Brown and Dr. C. Britt Bousman. A 3 x 4-m
block was established and excavated in the area
of Test Unit 6 (excavated during the Texas River
Center Testing Project) within the pecan grove
adjacent to the Texas River Center parking
lot (Aery 2007). Unit 6 had been excavated to
approximately 150 cmbs and yielded several
diagnostic artifacts before excavations were
halted upon encountering the water table.
Four additional units (Units 7, 8, 9, and 10)
were excavated adjacent to Unit 6. Units were
excavated in 10-cm levels, and features and
diagnostic artifacts were point-provenienced.
Unit 7 was excavated to a depth of 80 cm below
datum (cmbd), Unit 8 to 80 cmbd, Unit 9 to
100 cmbd, and Unit 10 to 80 cmbd. The entire
excavated matrix was water screened through
¼-inch hardware cloth (Aery 2007).
During the 2002 field school, supervised by
Bousman, students continued excavation on the
previously opened units and opened additional
units 11, 12, 13, and 15. At the end of the field
season, Unit 7 was at 123 cmbd, Unit 8 at 119
cmbd, Unit 9 at 114 cmbd, Unit 10 at 103 cmbd,

end of Middle Archaic and the beginning of Late
Archaic deposits. The Late Prehistoric cultural
period is not represented by diagnostic artifacts
in the middle four units, but occurs between
30 and 40 cmbs in the northern four units, and
between 40 and 50 cmbs in the southern four
units. A Late Historic gravel parking lot, between
15 and 30 cmbs depending on the location, caps
the prehistoric deposits and marks the use of the
area as a tourist destination. This gravel parking
lot is covered by modern soils and detritus. Over
19,000 fragments of faunal remains, 121 pieces of
shell, and 29 ceramic sherds were also collected.
A detailed analysis of the artifact assemblage
collected during the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006
field schools is currently underway by CAS.

documented the presence of stone artifacts,
mostly from the Middle Archaic, occurring in the
sand and gravel among large cobbles at the foot
of the Ice House dam falls (Shiner 1979). A clay
stratum approximately 1 m below the water level
was identified on the west bank that appears to be
a relict portion of a prehistoric site (Shiner 1979).
Approximately 40 man hours of underwater
diving resulted in the random collection of 2,513
artifacts. Collected artifacts consisted of 1,762
pieces of lithic chips, 29 lithic cores, 201 biface
thinning flakes, 141 cortex fragments, 234 flakes,
and 146 tools that included: seven endscrapers,
six side scrapers, two scrapers, six notched tools,
an arrow point, 31 dart points, 51 preforms, five
burins, six gravers, four borers, a drill, three
scaled pieces, six gouges, 12 retouched flakes, a
chopper, three hand axes, and a hammer (Shiner
1979). Projectile points included 10 Pedernales,
five Bulverdes, six Nolan, three unidentified
notched points, and four unidentified triangular
points. Almost half of the collected tools consist
of broken or incomplete bifaces (Shiner 1979).
Shiner contends that the assemblage is reflective
of hunter-gatherer groups between 2950 and 5450
BP that occupied the site for a lengthy period of
time. The amount of lithic manufacturing debris
and the presence of tools, in addition to a lush
environment, support the contention of a lengthy
occupation (Shiner 1979).

In August of 2006, CAS conducted
monitoring and trench inspection of 1,600 linear
feet of proposed fiber optic line conduit to be
placed through the Aquarena Springs Golf Course
(Oksanen 2006). A segment of the line passed
through the area of Tee Box 6. The remains of
three small thermal features were recorded within
the localized area of Tee Box 6. The impacts to
the archaeological deposits were minimal, and no
significant cultural deposits were encountered or
disturbed. CAS recommended clearance for the
conduit installation to the THC, and the THC
concurred.

In the fall of 1982, SWT maintenance
operations uncovered two burials in the area of
the Fish Ponds on the university campus, across
Sessoms Drive from the Ice House Falls; the
boundaries of 41HY161 were extended to include
these deposits. Garber conducted an emergency
recovery project (Garber and Glassman 1992).
Burial 1 was encountered in the sidewall of a
narrow water pipeline trench at 65 cmbs. The
burial consisted of a small sample of fragmentary
remains that prohibited the assessment of a basic
osteobiographical profile. Five nonhuman bone

41HY161 Investigations
In 1840, the settlers of San Marcos constructed
a large log and earth dam across the San Marcos
River to impound the waters for a flour mill.
This dam resulted in the creation of Spring
Lake, three to four meters above the natural
river edge (Shiner 1981). In 1979, Shiner began
investigations immediately below the falls of this
dam, known as the Ice House Falls. Spring Lake
is fed by five to six major springs that flow from
the Edwards Plateau Limestone approximately
600 m north of the Ice House Dam. Shiner

fragments, one burned nonhuman bone fragment
and one nonhuman tooth were recovered
in association with the burial. No skeletal
pathologies or cause of death were identifiable
(Garber and Glassman 1992). Burial 2 consisted
of 45 percent of the skeletal remains of a single
individual. The cranium was not represented
except for four cranial fragments and the left
petrous portion of the temporal bone (Garber and
Glassman 1992). Nine nonhuman bone fragments,
four nonhuman teeth, and one metal bolt were
recovered in association with the burial. Two of
the recovered bones had been burned, including
the right humeral fragment. The individual was
identified as an adult female between 64 and 66
inches in height. No skeletal pathologies or cause
of death were noted (Garber and Glassman 1992).
Archaeological site 41HY161 was designated an
SAL on March 13, 1987 (THC 1987).

during excavation. The remains of Individual 2,
specifically, provided limited biological profile
information. A metric analysis of the recovered
skeletal elements indicate that Individual 1 was
a female, aged between 25 to 45 years, and stood
between 61 and 66 inches tall (Stull and Hamilton
2011). These remains were dated to 515±20 BP.
Due to the condition of the remains from burial
two, it can only be determined that Individual 2
was an adult of indeterminate sex and stature.
These remains, however, were dated to 3510±20
BP (Stull and Hamilton 2011).
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of
bone collagen collected from the 41HY161 burials
were also conducted as part for the 41HY163
data recovery program (Lohse 2011). This
analysis was conducted in order to reconstruct
paleodietary histories of the individuals in an
attempt to determine their point of origin and
possible cultural affiliation (Munoz et al. 2011).
The dietary values from Individual 2 indicated
a subsistence strategy focused on terrestrial
plants and animals, with a minor contribution
from riverine resources. In contrast, Individual
1 displayed dietary values suggesting a marinebased diet. This suggests that Individual 1 may
have migrated inland from a coastal region
(Munoz et al. 2011).

Additional analyses of the burials recovered
from 41HY161 were conducted as a part of the
data recovery program of archaeological site
41HY163. These remains were included to enlarge
the bioarchaeological population of the San
Marcos area for comparative analyses. Analyses
consisted of descriptive and isotopic analysis.
These recent analyses confirmed and slightly
revised the prior stature and age estimates for
these individuals, and should be considered the
most accurate and current reconstruction.

In August of 1997, CAR conducted an
intensive archaeological survey within 41HY161
for cultural resources at the proposed location of a
parking lot at the current location of the Saltgrass
Steak House (the Ice House building adjacent
to the Ice House Falls; Ford and Lyle 1998).
Investigations consisted of pedestrian survey,
backhoe trenching, and shovel test excavations
to determine the presence of prehistoric and
historic cultural remains and the amount, if any,
of possible contextual disturbance. Two backhoe
trenches were excavated to depths of 1.2 m and
1.8 m. Eleven shovel tests were excavated; six

Archaeological data collected with the
41HY161 burials, in addition to biological
indicators and overall taphonomic conditions,
indicate that the remains are culturally and
biologically affiliated with prehistoric Native
American populations. Individual 1 displayed
premolar wear consistent with prehistoric huntergatherer populations. Less than 25 percent of the
skeletal remains were recovered, and the remains
displayed significant postmortem trauma,
most likely the result of heavy equipment used
25

shovel tests were excavated at 13-m intervals in
the area of the proposed parking lot, two were
placed along the river bank, and three shovel
tests were excavated to define the boundaries
of a lithic material deposit. Shovel tests were
excavated to a depth of 50 cm whenever possible
(Ford and Lyle 1998). The majority of the shovel
tests encountered modern construction remains
or were terminated due to natural disturbances.
A large number of prehistoric materials in a
disturbed context were encountered in ST 2 and
included lithic flakes and faunal remains. Three
shovel tests were excavated in order to define
the boundaries of this deposit; only one, ST 9
produced similar materials. CAR determined that
modern and historic construction has disturbed
this portion of 41HY161, and that the construction
of a parking lot would not critically impact
undisturbed cultural remains. Concurrence with
this finding was sought from the THC and was
granted, resulting in clearance for the proposed
parking lot construction (Ford and Lyle 1998).

(Lyle et al. 2000). Backhoe trenches in Section 1
and Section 2 also revealed disturbed soils. The
Section 1 trench revealed an area highly disturbed
by construction and the demolition of historic
buildings, while the Section 2 trench displayed
disturbed soils over intact soils encountered at 100
to 120 cmbs. Backhoe trenches were excavated to
a depth of 140–170 cmbs. As Section 3, the west
lawn of the Aquatic Biology Building, possessed
a high potential for intact prehistoric cultural
remains, three test units were excavated in this
location. The three test units were excavated to
a depth between 70 and 100 cmbs. Investigations
indicated that the upper 30 cm of deposits were
disturbed and contained a mixture of modern,
historic, and prehistoric cultural remains.
Deposits located between 30 and 80 cm appeared
to contain intact Early Archaic remains. While
Paleoindian remains were encountered below
80 cmbs, the nature of the deposits was not
determined. CAR recommended to the THC
that construction proceed, as impacts would be
contained to the upper disturbed 30-cm levels.
The THC concurred with this recommendation,
and construction proceeded (Lyle et al. 2000).

In the spring and early summer of 1998,
CAR returned to 41HY161 to conduct subsurface
testing for cultural resources along the proposed
route of a water pipeline for SWT. The proposed
pipeline included a tract along the banks of
the San Marcos River and tracts adjacent to
the Aquatic Biology Building. Investigations
included the excavation of 27 shovel tests, two
backhoe trenches, and three test units, and
monitoring of the pipeline installation (Lyle et
al. 2000). Twenty-six shovel tests were excavated
in three sections; Section 1 (the lawn area south
of the Aquatic Biology Building), Section 2 (the
breezeway of the Aquatic Biology Building), and
Section 3 (the west lawn of the Aquatic Biology
Building). The richest artifact recovery was from
Section 3, the west lawn of the Aquatic Biology
Building. Shovel tests in this location indicated
an upper layer of disturbed soils over lower intact
soils containing prehistoric material remains

In the spring of 2000, CAS conducted
archaeological monitoring of a 200-m-long
irrigation trench located adjacent to 41HY161
(Jones 2002). The area was once the location of a
U.S. Federal Fish Hatchery that was established
in 1893. Monitoring was conducted to ascertain
if intact deposits were present, and if so, if
they would be impacted by the construction
of an irrigation trench. Evidence of extensive
disturbance that possibly dated from the time of
the U.S. Federal Fish Hatchery in 1893 was noted
during the monitoring of trench excavations. CAS
recommended to the THC that no intact deposits
would be impacted, and that the project be given
clearance to proceed; THC concurred with these
recommendations (Jones 2002).

26

Between May and September of 2004, CAS
conducted data recovery excavations at 41HY161.
The excavations were conducted as partial
mitigation for the installation of flood control
measures on Sessom Creek on property owned by
Texas State (Oksanen 2008). Investigations began
with the excavation of three backhoe trenches to
the depth of expected impact within the footprint
of the proposed construction (Oksanen 2008).
The excavation of Backhoe Trench 3 revealed
potential intact soil deposits at 180 to 190 cmbs.
A 3 x 4-m excavation block was then established
incorporating Backhoe Trench 3. Eight 1 x 1-m
units were excavated by hand to a depth of 260
cmbs. Unit profiles indicate the development of
a terrace in a slowly aggrading environment. A
series of occupation zones dating from 7700 BP
were identified during investigations, consisting
of three distinct Early Archaic occupation zones
and a fourth zone containing a mixture of Early
and Late Archaic materials (Oksanen 2008).
The lithic assemblages indicates the use of
locally available chert sources from stream beds,
eroded upland nodules, and weathered nodules
on upland terraces to the west of the site. Based
on lithic totals, the dense occupations occurred

procured, possibly from nearby chert outcrops
(e.g., 41HY37; THC 1999c). The third occupation
zone, ca. 6650 BP, indicated a shift away from
large game coupled with a decline in projectile
points and other big game processing tools
(Oksanen 2008). The decline in locally available
large game may be indicative of increasing
population pressures and climate changes that
resulted in depleted local resources.
In spring of 2008, CAS again conducted
archaeological monitoring of a shallow trench
excavation to the southwest of 41HY161 (Yelacic
et al. 2008a). The trench was excavated in
order to bury waterlines supplying water to the
decorative ponds around the University’s Theatre
Center. The trench was approximately 50 m long,
20 cm wide and 50 cm at its deepest point. No
cultural remains or features were noted during
excavations. The soil appeared to be disturbed
by construction of the U.S. Federal Fish
Hatchery Ponds in 1893 (Yelacic et al. 2008a).
CAS recommended regulatory clearance for the
project, as no intact cultural remains were noted
or would be impacted. THC concurred, and the
construction was allowed to proceed.
CAS conducted additional investigations
in the area of 41HY161 in 2008 (Yelacic et al.
2008b). Investigations consisted of the monitoring
of the excavation of a shallow trench as part of
construction of a new fence and visual barrier
fronting the University-owned Clear Spring
Apartments. Monitoring of the trench excavation
revealed recent sediments overlying an old
paved surface. No archaeological deposits were
present or were impacted. Based on these results,
CAS concluded that no intact and/or significant
cultural properties would be impacted, and
requested that permission be granted to proceed
with the proposed development. THC concurred,
and the construction project advanced.

The project was significant in that it provided
information about the little-known Early Archaic
period in Central Texas. Only one style of
projectile point, Gower, was recovered. This
point type has been rarely dated and is usually
recovered from mixed deposits. The estimated
age of deposits span 1,000 years, from ca. 7700
BP to 6650 BP, and three distinct occupational
zones were identified. The site was most
intensively used during the earliest occupation.
The assemblages from the earliest occupation,
ca. 7700 BP, indicated that the area was utilized
for processing large game animals, projectile
points refitting, and new lithic supplies were

investigations during September 2009, in
advance of the construction of a boiler station to
be placed adjacent to the Jowers Center on the
campus of Texas State. Investigations consisted of
excavation of two test units within the proposed
foot print of the building. While excavations
encountered mixed historic and prehistoric
deposits, these deposits were perceived as
a continuation of nearby archaeological site
41HY161, and the boundaries of this site were
extended to encompass these newly uncovered
cultural remains (Leezer et al. 2010).

Cultural materials recovered from the
1996 and 1997 field school were also used in a
preliminary faunal analysis by Giesecke (1998).
Though she clearly states that her report is only
a preliminary analysis, Giesecke identified
changes in bison concentrations through time,
with the greatest concentration occurring during
the Middle Archaic. These findings should be
verified.
Between 2000 and 2001, CAS conducted
archaeological monitoring of a tree-planting
project undertaken by the Department of
Biology and archaeological monitoring of the
construction of the Campus Map Board along
Aquarena Springs Drive for Texas State. While
numerous prehistoric and historic artifacts were
uncovered during these projects, the majority of
the encountered deposits appeared in a mixed
context. Despite these findings, discrete areas
of intact prehistoric deposits were noted. It
was recommended that the site boundaries of
41HY165 be extended to incorporate the areas
of these projects, as the newly encountered
prehistoric deposits may be part of this wellstratified, prehistoric open campsite (Soucie and
Nickels 2003). While the recommendation for
the extension of the site boundary of 41HY165
was made, no site update form or redrafting of
the site boundaries were submitted to the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas.

41HY165 Investigations
Site 41HY165 is located at the confluence of
Sink Creek and Spring Lake on a small peninsula
that extends out into the eastern half of the lake,
and also extends around the lake margins to the
southwest. The first investigations at 41HY165
were conducted in 1984 by Dr. James Garber as
part of a field school for SWT (now Texas State
University). A second field school was conducted
on the site in 1988 by David Driver, along with
Garber, and focused on testing and recording the
site. Finally, three field schools were conducted
on the site between 1996 and 1998 by Garber and
Mary Kathryn Brown that involved intensive
testing of the site. During the 1996, 1997, and
1998 field schools, 11 test units were excavated
over the eastern portion of the site.

Additional prehistoric deposits associated
with site 41HY165 were encountered again in
2003 during trench excavations conducted in
advance of the installation of a new irrigation
system on the Texas State University Golf Course.
A dense deposit of lithic artifacts were recovered
from an area that extends from the boundary of
site 41HY165 established during the Front Door
Project through the eighth green and fairwary.
It was recommended again that the boundaries
of site 41HY165 be extended to encompass

The results of the 1996, 1997, and 1998
field investigations were used as the basis for
Christopher Ringstaff’s masters’ thesis dated
2000. While Ringstaff’s thesis offers a relatively
comprehensive study of the three field school
seasons, the focus of his research is on the
geoarchaeological properties of the site and thus
the attention given to the artifact assemblage and
features at the site is limited to that scope of his
research.

pit excavation, and backhoe trench excavation.
Underwater investigations included a limited
reconnaissance survey, test unit excavation, and
extraction of sediment cores. Investigations were
conducted within or adjacent to SALs 41HY160
and 41HY165. As a result of these investigations,
six areas were identified as “Archaeologically
Sensitive” as they contained or possessed a
high probability to contain cultural deposits
that would be negatively impacted by proposed
demolition, modifications, and construction (see
Figure 6-1). These investigations are reported in
detail in Results of Cultural Resources Survey for
the Spring Lake Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem
Restoration Project (Leezer et al. 2011). CAS
recommended the development of mitigation
efforts to offset the loss of important information
from areas to be negatively impacted.

Research Design
By John A. Campbell, Jon C. Lohse, and Carole A. Leezer
The Spring Lake sites (41HY160, 41HY161,
41HY165, 41HY147, 41HY37, and 41HY306),
although recorded and described as distinct
properties, together reflect an integrated
complex representing the long history of human
occupation in Central Texas. As discussed in
Chapter 3, this history begins with Clovis and
is virtually uninterrupted all the way through
to the Historical period. Importantly, Native
Americans who gathered at Spring Lake were
described by early Spanish missionaries and
explorers; these accounts provide researchers
with an unparalleled opportunity to examine
and understand prehistoric cultural practices and
adaptations. Through a direct historical approach,
the latest portion of the prehistoric record, the
Toyah phase, can be contextualized by reference
to early written accounts. In turn, the Toyah
record helps inform archaeological interpretation
of Austin deposits. Working backward in time
in this fashion, cultural phase by cultural phase,
researchers may be able to discern cultural
continuity, or to recognize important moments
or events of disjuncture. While Spanish Colonial
and historical accounts found elsewhere in the
state afford the same opportunity to contextualize
preceding periods, very few if any other sites have
an occupation record lasting the entire Holocene
and extending into the Terminal Pleistocene.
In this sense, the Spring Lake archaeological
complex affords opportunities to develop new
understandings of Native American occupation
and cultural patterns in Central Texas.

With this interpretive potential in mind,
the current analysis focuses on five generalized
research domains established for Spring Lake
(Lohse and Leezer 2011; see below). Some
reflect the constant concerns of ongoing research
in Central Texas. Others derive partly from
historical information, and are viewed as a way
to expand the scientific understanding of Texas
history and prehistory. Domains include: (1)
filling in the chronology of human occupation at
Spring Lake; (2) understanding how aggregation
shaped hunter-gatherer settlement mobility
systems; (3) defining periods during which bison
were important in local and regional economies,
and exploring how other resources and their
associated technological adaptations increased
or decreased in prominence during these periods;
(4) reconstructing trade and clarifying its effect
on local economic production and subsistence;
and (5) examining the status or role of different
kinds of individuals on the basis of sex, age,
and/or skill/aptitude. These domains overlap
considerably and should be considered in
conjunction with each other. Additionally, each
is approached using different kinds of data and
perspectives, and may not necessarily be applied
evenly to all archaeological contexts. Not all are
equally addressed in the current analysis.
In this study, we employ an inductive
approach to evaluate much of the securely
contextualized data. We then develop testable
hypotheses that are informed in some way by the
five research domains. At the core of this analysis
is constructing the site’s occupation chronology
31

based on time-diagnostic artifacts and accelerator
mass spectrometry (AMS) dates from charred
plant material and select bone samples. Following
this, we address the importance of bison within
the economy and technology of the site, and
consider how these may have changed over time.
Using XAD purification of collagen extracted
from bison bone, CAS has amassed a series of
44 AMS assays from three sites, two of which
(41HY160 and HY165) are part of the Spring
Lake complex, and one of which (41HY188) is
located within 2 km of Spring Lake upstream in
the Sink Creek Valley. An additional 11 assays
(standard pretreatment) are available from
41HY163, located at the base of the Balcones
Escarpment at the mouth of Purgatory Creek,
approximately 3.75 km southwest of Spring Lake
(Yelacic and Lohse 2011). Using these dates, CAS
has established periods of bison exploitation for
the general San Marcos-Hays County region as
far back in time as the Calf Creek horizon at
the beginning of the Middle Archaic, extending
through Late Archaic and Toyah intervals to the
early Historic period. This chronology not only
defines bison exploitation with greater precision
than found in previous bison studies, it also
provides a baseline against which technological
adaptations can be compared, establishing an
interpretive framework for assessing shifts in
emphasis on other subsistence resources as well.
Analyses of other (non-bison) zooarchaeological
remains provide some data for assessing these
shifts. These analyses are complemented by
an examination of the total burned rock at the
site, including both features and discarded
rock, as a proxy for examining resource-based
adaptation and technological variations. Once
these variations in economy and technology are
established between discrete periods, conclusions
regarding settlement mobility, aggregation and
dispersion, trade, and (possibly) individual
agency can be formulated.

Below, each research domain is discussed
in general terms. Specific information is also
provided concerning how these are addressed in
the current analysis.

Culture Historical Reconstruction
A significant amount of attention has been
given in past decades to reconstructing the culture
history of Central Texas, and all of the major
periods that have been defined through these
efforts are present at Spring Lake. Of syntheses
available for this region, the one by Prewitt (1981,
1983) is the most detailed, consisting of 14 phases
representing the Early Archaic through Late
Prehistoric (Table 4-1). Johnson (1987) argues
that not all these phases are valid, and indeed
material remains from at least one of Prewitt’s
phases, Jarrell, have yet to be recovered in
unmixed contexts in Central Texas suggesting
that Calf Creek should be considered a horizon
(e.g., Wyckoff 1994). In spite of the potential
usefulness of regional master sequences, it is
important for local projects to develop their own
localized chronologies.
In spite of the fact that all, or nearly all
of the major periods comprising the regional
chronology are present, how each was expressed
at Spring Lake remains somewhat unclear. No
synthetic treatment of the Spring Lake area has
yet been carried out, and no comprehensive
analysis of sizeable collections from the area has
been performed. Moreover, the specific timing of
important transitions, for example from Austin to
Toyah, or how Jarrell phase (Calf Creek) deposits
are represented, varies from region to region.
This means that while dates presented for these
phases are shown as general ranges, the specific
adaptations representing each period need to
be established specifically as they occurred at
Spring Lake.

As an anthropological problem in American
archaeology, culture history has fallen out of
favor over the past few decades. Over this time,
the perceived utility of this objective has become
minimized as new paradigms, agendas, and
topics have been introduced. Elsewhere, however,
efforts at fine-tuning chronologies have persisted
at the expense of other possible lines of inquiry,
though without realizing the full potential benefits
from well-constructed regional sequences. This
is especially true of archaeological work in Texas,
where many research designs have emphasized
chronology-building at the expense of other
possible topics (see Arnn 2005; Black 1993). In
our view, this issue reflects an underappreciation
of the utility of well-made chronologies for
facilitating additional, deeper understandings

of the full range of human adaptive behavior.
Culture-historical reconstructions, then, reflect a
two-part problem. One is accurately describing
and reconstructing local to regional sequences
of events; the other involves examining those
events in a comparative way to understand how
people responded to external (or internal) stimuli
to effect culture change.
An important critique of culture historical
reconstructions was what some saw as the
primarily descriptive focus on material
similarities. Binford (1962; also Taylor 1948)
was among the first to bring attention to this
issue. Binford (1962:205), in advocating a new
approach for archaeology, described culture as
“not necessarily shared; (but rather) participated
33

in. And it is participated in differentially.”
A basic characteristic of cultural systems is
“the integration of individuals and social units
performing different tasks, frequently at different
locations.” He further urged that “we should
partition our observation… so that we may
emphasize the nature of variability in artifact
populations and facilitate the isolation of causally
relevant factors” (1962:205). This critique has two
(at least) related implications for chronological
reconstructions. First, the stress on variation
provides a complementary structuring principle
to similarity in local and regional assemblages,
and is important in defining archaeological
periods by distinctions or differences rather than
long periods of apparent continuity. Second,
different kinds of driving forces behind cultural
changes can occur at a range of temporal and
organizational scales, from large-scale climatic
regimes and shifts down to localized resource
abundance, or from group-level technological
behaviors to individual-level decision making.
Binford’s recognition that individuals participate
in cultural systems in different ways remained
underdeveloped in most of his research following
this statement. Yet individual-scale practices can
be important sources of socio-cultural changes
that are visible in the archaeological record, and
that may result in chronological sequences that
have a very high degree of resolution.

41HY165’s cultural sequence in the context of
provisional phases (Prewitt 1981, 1983) defined
for the region. As a result of this exercise,
analytical units are established based on timediagnostic artifacts recovered during earlier
field work and supplemented with absolute dates
from selected contexts. Each of these analytical
units
represents
stratigraphically-ordered
temporal sequences that are correlated with the
cultural/chronological periods of Central Texas.
These analytical units are discussed in detail in
Chapter 5.

These objectives, reconstructing cultural
historical events in order to contextualize
social and cultural change (sensu Willey
and Phillips 2001) while emphasizing scaled
variation that extends through group dynamics
to individual-level decision making, are not
incompatible. Indeed, they ought to be pursued
as complementary approaches, leaving the
recognition and definition of analytical timespace units the necessary first step in pursuing
additional lines of inquiry at Spring Lake.
The current report focuses on reconstructing

One of the central issues addressed
throughout this analysis is, for periods defined by
a subsistence focus utilizing the largest available
game animals on the landscape, how were
other subsistence and technological decisions
affected? According to optimal foraging theory,
hunter-gatherers target the highest-ranked
resources in terms of caloric yield compared to
the energetic costs of procuring and processing
(handling) those resources when they are
available (Bettinger 1991; Smith 1981; Smith and
Winterhalder 1982). In this model, sources of

Subsistence Economy and
Technological Variation
As described above and presented in detail
in Chapter 5, a relatively precise regional
chronology of bison exploitation exists for San
Marcos based on 55 directly-dated remains
from four sites, including two (HY160 and
HY165) at Spring Lake. In addition to defining
periods of bison exploitation that are visible in
the archaeological record, we use these data
to establish a comparative baseline against
which other subsistence-related decisions were
made. Bison hold particular value in this effort,
considering that they would have been one of the,
if not the most, highly prized source for protein
available during periods of abundance.

34

protein routinely outrank plants, herbs, and nuts
because of the relatively lower processing costs
for animals compared with these other items.
While the largest game animals available in any
environment are not always the highest ranked
(Hawkes et al. 1982), resource ranking in terms
of return-versus-handling costs strongly shape
hunters’ choices about which game animals
to pursue (Hawkes et al. 1982). In response to
this focus, attention on lesser-ranked resources
diminishes, or adjustments are made by foragers
to accommodate labor scheduling or to ensure
minimally adequate nutritional needs. Bison were
the largest game animal on the post-Pleistocene
North American landscape (Waguespack and
Surovell 2003), and would routinely have been
among the highest-ranked food resources during
periods of availability throughout the Holocene,
based on their caloric returns alone.

indicating or signaling an underlying genotypic
or phenotypic quality which will later yield some
advantage in mating or social deference (Gurven
and Hill 2009).
In the current analysis, we do not favor any
particular explanation for why the largest game
animals like bison would have been pursued.
We only expect that prehistoric hunter-gatherers
living close to Spring Lake were probably
motivated for several reasons to select bison
during periods when they were available. Potential
reasons include anticipated social payoffs through
security network, access to mating opportunities,
the simple ability to provision one’s family and
dependents that come with larger prey, and even
prestige and imbalanced reciprocal obligations
that come with providing access to more meat
shares available from larger prey (Gurven and
Hill 2009). Still, because this resource would have
been preferentially taken when it was available,
one can also expect these periods to have been
defined by additional adjustments to diet choices,
by technological innovation for procuring and
processing key resources, and by altered balances
in sexual divisions of labor.

Optimal foraging theory predicts that diet
optimality will consist of the combination of
resources that have the highest returns and lowest
handling costs. The model simply predicts that,
when available, bison will be pursued by hunters
at a higher rate than other sources of protein.
However, another important motivating factor
for targeting large game has been provided in
the show-off hunting hypothesis (Hawkes 1991;
also called costly signaling theory; Hawkes and
Bliege Bird 2002). This theory explains that,
in addition to the nutritional payoffs that come
with big game hunting, hunters enjoy and are
motivated by social benefits they derive from
success in activities that come with higher
failure rates or greater physical risks. According
to this model, certain males are inclined to
undertake riskier food-getting strategies in order
to gain access to the social benefits that come
with sharing larger portions of meat among the
forager band, including opportunities for mating
and social prestige. Biological fitness comes from
the fact that potential mates see this behavior as

In order to examine dietary responses as well
as technological changes during and between
periods of big-game focus, we use data on earth
oven use as a general proxy for reconstructing
other aspects of a group’s subsistence economy
and for observing changes in food-related
technology over time. As subsistence economies
underwent changes to accommodate highlyranked and socially significant resources like
bison, we ask: are related adjustments such as
increases or decreases in plant processing visible
in the record?
In the current analysis, following
reconstruction of the site’s occupation sequence,
our central research focus considers (1) what
35

changes can be seen in periods of bison
exploitation; (2) what technological adaptations
to the tool kit(s) occurred during these intervals;
(3) can changes in earth oven use be seen that
correlate with the bison exploitation chronology;
(4) what technological changes can be seen in the
site’s tool assemblage that correspond with earth
oven usage; and (5) whether these changes, if they
can be seen, represent dramatic or fundamental
shifts in economy, or merely reflect the addition
of these activities to the overall economy
during periods of bison abundance. While bison
occurrence and earth oven use may not co-vary
in a way that represents specific economic shifts,
the relative emphasis on these resources (bison
and the plant resources presumed to have been
processed in earth ovens) may change sharply
over time (as bison do, see below) and therefore
be useful for constructing precise occupation
chronologies for the site, and also represent
general behavioral patterns that should be
reflected in the tool assemblage. Below, the role
of bison in local and regional economies and the
current state of thought on the use and technology
of earth ovens are discussed in detail.

most of North America; while deer, antelope, and
other artiodactyls were widely hunted throughout
the Holocene, bison appear to have filled a unique
niche in Plains society.
The importance of bison in Central Texas
in the early Historic was well documented by
Europeans. Bison were first recorded here by
Henri Joutel, a member of the La Salle expedition
of 1684 to 1687. While Joutel documents over
5,000 bison near La Salle’s Fort St. Louis on
Garcita Creek in South Texas in 1684, La Salle’s
expedition also encountered bison near La
Grange during their trek to and from the Texas
coast to the Mississippi River in 1687. According
to Joutel, bison were present along the southern
Guadalupe River throughout most of the year.
The largest number of bison recorded by early
explorers was by Terán on August 30, 1691,
who sighted over 30,000 animals in Burleson
County. Based on the early reports of European
expeditions through Texas, bison were present
and often in large numbers especially in Central
Texas. Several early historical documents
describe the hostile relationships between Native
groups over bison hunting rights (Wade 2002).
These accounts make it clear that bison were
common in and around Spring Lake in historic
times. Archaeological data pertaining to their
presence and abundance in prehistoric periods
are limited to faunal remains.

Bison in Local and Regional Economies
In addition to the theoretical value of bison for
hunter-gatherer economies, bison are understood
by archaeologists to have been one of the most
significant components of prehistoric subsistence
economies in Central Texas, providing meat
and fat for food, hide for clothing and cover,
and bone for tools. In addition to food, tools,
and clothing, bison appear to have held ritual
significance among Plains societies from at least
the Terminal Pleistocene (Bement 1999) through
the Archaic (e.g., Frison 1998) and into the
Historic period. After the arrival of Europeans
in the seventeenth century onwards, bison were
also extensively hunted for trade (see below).
After the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna,
bison remained the focus of big game hunting in

Reconstructing bison frequency in the
study area is a complex undertaking. Based on
previous archaeological findings, bison were
abundant during the Paleoindian period; during
certain intervals throughout the Early and
Middle Archaic, including Calf Creek; during the
middle-Late Archaic, particularly Castroville,
Montell, and Marcos style intervals; and during
the Toyah horizon of the Late Prehistoric (Baugh
1986; Creel 1990; Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991;
Lynott 1979; Mauldin et al. 2012). While early
36

models of bison availability (Dillehay 1974;
Huebner 1991) focused on periods of presenceabsence, recent considerations (e.g., Mauldin et
al. 2012), acknowledging that bison visibility
in the archaeological record is affected by
many factors, considered periods of “relative
abundance.” Recent studies note that bison are
indicated to varying degrees on sites throughout
South and Central Texas during the entire Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric, including during
some periods described in previous studies
(e.g., Dillehay 1974) as periods of absence.
Reasons that potentially affect how bison are
recognized on sites include regional climatic
trends, localized weather patterns, as well as
archaeological visibility (Dillehay 1974; Huebner
1991:345–346).

Calf Creek (7 assays), Late Archaic (17 assays),
Toyah (26 assays), and post-Toyah historic bison
exploitation (5 assays). Within this sample,
greater overlap of probabilities for multiple
assays is expressed in the vertical axis, and can
be taken as a general indication of the relative
intensity of focus on bison, within the existing
sample of assays. In some instances however,
particularly the Toyah horizon, the shape of the
probability curves result from the shape of the
radiocarbon calibration curve for those periods;
these should not be interpreted as indicating
distinct and narrowly defined periods of bison
exploitation. Although not discussed in detail
in this report, all the Calf Creek assays come
from a single limited component at HY160; it is
possible that multiple specimens from the same
individual were submitted in this process, and
the probability density for this period should
also be viewed cautiously. Nevertheless, beyond
the temporal precision indicated by these data,
some intriguing patterns are clear. First, no bison
dates are available for the long Middle Archaic.
Assuming that other important differences can be
identified as corresponding with this fact, it may
be that Calf Creek can be used to distinguish the

Based on 55 AMS assays of bison remains
from four sites around San Marcos (41HY160,
HY163, HY165, and HY188), precise and distinct
periods of bison visibility can be recognized for
the study area (Figure 4-1). Periods of visibility are
based on the summed probabilities of calibrated
AMS dates from these four sites, and include the
samples from HY165. Cultural periods include

end of the Early Archaic from the beginning of the
Middle Archaic. Also, no dates are available for
the Austin phase; future studies should continue
to look into the possibility of Austin-period bison
exploitation. Finally, there appear to be as many
as three periods within the Late Archaic where
bison were hunted, at approximately 3050–3300,
2700–2450, and 2350–2050 cal BP. This pattern
suggests that at least some dietary decisions
made by prehistoric hunter-gatherers can be
reconstructed for this period with a relatively
high degree of resolution.

technological sophistication and focus on bison
are suggested for at least some periods. The
Calf Creek horizon, with its specialized, deeply
notched triangular points (here including both
Bell and Andice types), is seen as a widespread
focus on bison exploitation (Bement et al. 2005;
Wyckoff 1994, 1995). These points are complex
and exceedingly difficult to make, involved
specialized tool kits (Collins 1994:93), and may
have required as many as 13 discrete steps in their
processes of manufacture and finishing (Weber
1994). Creating the deep basal notches required
precise workmanship and was associated with
high failure rates; so-called practices pieces,
showing repeated deep notching but no other
standardized form, are common on Archaic
sites with Calf Creek components (Turner and
Hester 1999). Folsom points, strongly associated
with Plains bison hunting, are comparably
sophisticated and may have required as many as
14 discrete reduction steps (Lohse 2012). Creel
(1991) argues that the thick beveled knives found
on Late Prehistoric and early Historic sites in
Texas also reflect a technological innovation for
processing bison hides. Many Late Prehistoric
(Toyah) sites are also characterized by distinctive
end scrapers that do not appear in earlier times.
Many of these tool forms required specifically
developed knowledge and skill sets (Bamforth
1991); involved great attention to manufacturing
details, including elaborate reduction sequences
that do not characterize other tool forms;
communicated stylistic information about
their makers in new and meaningful ways;
and are likely to have been associated with the
emergence of part-time specialization among
certain knappers (Lohse et al. 2010).

Clearly, bison were more plentiful during
certain periods than others. Still, during periods
when they were relatively abundant, prehistoric
peoples appear to have responded not only by
centralizing them into their diet and, perhaps,
economies and labor schedules. Additionally,
in some cases people may have responded by
altering settlement and mobility patterns as
well. For example, Mauldin et al. (2012:Table
3) hypothesize that bison distribution patterns
during Toyah times, when bison are present at 83
percent of 141 components in Central Texas, are
a reflection of increased logistical hunting, when
bison hunters undertook long-distance treks in
pursuit of bison across increasingly large areas.
Changes such as this are quite possibly one of the
primary factors in the nearly state-wide spread of
Toyah traits, furthermore signaling a significant
shift in the ways sites were used and occupied
in relation to earlier periods. For example, based
on radiocarbon assays from the Zatopec site,
41HY163, researchers propose shifts in site
occupation histories from approximately once
every hundred years for Late Archaic 2-throughAustin times, while Toyah occupation events
occurred once every fifty years (Yelacic and
Lohse 2011).

To understand the role of bison among the
inhabitants of 41HY165, the current analysis
examines changes in lithic technology evident at
the site during periods that correspond with bison
frequencies. These periods are reconstructed not

periods and others.

animals to aquatic resources to, finally,
terrestrial plants in settings in which each
of these options is feasible. In settings in
which some constraint renders impossible
one or more options, other trajectories may
be expected.
While plant cultivation and animal
domestication are often discussed as forms of
intensification, Central Texas lacks archaeological
or ethnographic evidence of these practices
(Johnson and Hard 2008).

Burned Rock Technology

The intensification of resources, specifically
plants, by hunter-gatherers can be seen in the
archaeological record by the presence of plant
processing tools and facilities, such as grinding
or pounding stones, mortars, and earth oven
features. These types of tools and facilities,
specifically earth ovens, are used to render
plants more digestible and to increase their
nutritional value (Wandsnider 1997). Obviously,
charred plant remains associated with cooking
facilities are another indication of plant
exploitation; however, these remains are not
always visible in the archaeological record due
to poor preservation. The process of cooking
food results in increased nutrient density,
removal of pathogens and detoxification, and
increased storage life (Wandsnider 1997:3). As
intensification would require the utilization
of a broader range of plant species, the ability
to render otherwise inedible plants edible
through cooking, as well as transform them into
storable units, would have been a key aspect of
intensification.

While the utilization of bison by the
inhabitants of 41HY165 represents a shift
in subsistence economy, the increasing use
of hot rock cooking facilities may represent
a shift towards subsistence intensification.
Subsistence intensification is often viewed as
a cultural response to increasing population
or environmental pressure within a group’s
occupational range. These pressures require
groups to adopt new strategies, primarily
increased labor, to increase the food production
of a given area, usually resulting in the
exploitation of lower ranked or more highly
concentrated resources (Binford 2001:188).
In general, this means that groups that rely
on hunting as a primary subsistence strategy
will invest more labor into acquiring aquatic
resources and plant foods (Johnson and Hard
2008:138). This process was suggested by
Binford (2001:222):
It is reasonable to suggest that if selective
forces (such as a reduction in the area
needed to sustain a group) are favoring
intensification of production, there may be
a progression in resource exploitation down
the trophic scale in the direction of lower
level resources. In such a successional
sequence, other things being equal, huntergatherers would shift from terrestrial

Earth ovens are one of the most visible
features on Central Texas archaeological sites.
In her review of the ethnographic literature
describing earth oven technology, Yu (2006:78)
defined some generalized tactics that surround this
technology that include the procurement of highly
39

seasonal foods, use of otherwise inedible foods,
aggregation of population and labor, specialized
processing technology, and the repeated use of
earth oven locations. The most common plants
associated with earth oven use in Central Texas
are geophytes, prickly pear, and plants of the
Agavaceae family (lechuguilla, sotol, and yucca)
that require prolonged cooking times to render
them digestible and more nutritious (Dering
2008; Wandsnider 1997). Geophytes, such as
wild hyacinth (Camassia sp.) and wild onion/
garlic (Allium sp.) would have been seasonally
harvested in the spring and early summer (Boyd
et al. 2006), whereas prickly pear and Agavaceae
plants would have been available year round.
These plants generally require prolonged cooking
for 36–48 hours to eliminate toxins in the plants
and to convert complex chains of carbohydrates
into more simple sugars that are easier to digest
(Dering 1999:661; Wandsnider 1997). While the
degree to which these plants contributed to the
prehistoric diet is still unknown, closed pits or
ovens are an efficient way to cook these plants in
that heat can be stored in rocks and once buried,
will continue to release heat for more than 24
hours (Dering 1999:661; Thoms 2009:576).

the entire Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods
in Central Texas.
Burned rock middens represent the
accumulation of waste rock material from these
earth oven cooking episodes. Black and Creel
(1997:295) argue that burned rock middens result
from repeated use of center-focused cooking
facilities. The defining characteristic of these
midden features is the presence of a primary
structural element, such as a centrally located
rock-lined pit, which marks the locus of activity
(Black and Creel 1997:295). The morphology of
the typical Central Texas midden is the result of
repeated rearrangement of the waste material
around the center; often times manifesting
archaeologically as a mounded ring or cone
(Black 1997:84–85). Thus, the amount of burned
rock waste material will reflect the frequency of
use of a particular facility, either during a specific
episode of use or repeated uses over time.
The use of earth ovens requires an increased
investment of labor to collect the necessary
resources, including food, fuel, and rock, for
processing plant foods in this way. An increase in
the investment of labor most likely required more
social organization of foraging and processing
activities. Yu (2006) notes that ethnographically,
groups in the Pacific Northwest tend to aggregate
seasonally in organized foraging groups to collect
and process wild hyacinth in earth ovens. This
process is normally carried out by the women
in the group. However, in the southwest United
States, plant processing in earth ovens is more
often associated with small, multi-family groups
and less gender division of labor (Yu 2006).
Additionally, earth ovens may have been employed
to cook mass quantities of food to take advantage
of seasonally available plants and to prevent
spoilage after harvest (Wandsnider 1997:23).
This short period of resource availability may

Although several methods can be utilized
to create an earth oven, the general process
involves a layered arrangement of heated rocks,
packing material (such as prickly pear, grasses,
or other plant material), food, and a cap of
sediment to retain heat (Ellis 1997:66–76). The
packing material acts as both insulation and a
source of moisture for steaming, and in some
cases additional water may be added to intensify
steaming (Ellis 1997:66–76). Once the food has
been cooked, overlying sediments are removed
and the food is removed for consumption or
additional processing, leaving behind the rocks
making up the “oven bed” (Black 1997:259).
Use of hot rocks appears to have been the most
common means for cooking plants throughout

have necessitated the aggregation of
labor and subsequent organization.
Although earth ovens were
used to process meat, their primary
utility is mostly attributed to the
processing of inulin-rich geophytes
that require extended cooking
times. Meat, in general, requires
substantially less or no cooking
time.
Ethnographic
accounts
reported by Wandsnider (2007:22,

determinations of the number of firing episodes
of a burned rock feature can ever be estimated
with much accuracy. However, assuming that
earth oven features on a site are approximately
similar to those used in experiments, overall
rock weight is a fairly accurate indication of how
intensively these features were used. Studies such
as Johnson’s (2009) will not yield results accurate
enough to determine the use firing history of any
specific earth oven or feature. However, when the
same criteria are applied across a site, it should
be possible to calculate the relative use intensity
of these features over time, and to thereby
hypothesize changes in the importance of these
features to food processing behaviors, such as
intensification.

To understand the process of intensification as
it relates to hot rock cooking, it is important to also
understand the degree to which individual features
were utilized, both spatially and temporally.
Dering (1999) conducted experimental studies
on earth oven cooking in the Lower Pecos using
lechuguilla and sotol plants in five experimental
earth ovens comparable to Archaic-age features.
These experiments found that a single oven firing
using 224 kg of wood fuel and 250 kg of rock
would yield 5.1 person-days of calories and 0.13
m3 of rock waste (Dering 1999:665). Dering’s
study not only shows how rapidly plant and rock
refuse can accumulate in a short period of time,
it also indicates how quickly resources may be
depleted across the landscape. Leach et al. (1998)
also conducted investigations on an experimental
earth oven using thermocouples to monitor
temperature changes in the oven and the rate of
rock reuse and discard. Their experiment utilized
only 63 kg of wood fuel and 91 kg of limestone
rock, estimating that rocks could be reused as
many as four times before discard.

Data from burned rocks will be used in two
ways to understand possible shifts in subsistence
economies over time at 41HY165. First,
qualitative estimates of the relative use intensity
of fire-cracked rock features will be generated
by standardizing the total rock weight across all
analytical units. Burned rock occurrence within
these analytical units is then calculated by total
burned rock weight, including both from intact or
discrete features as well as from more dispersed
contexts. Results will approximately indicate the
relative degree to which burned rock features
were important in the subsistence economies of
these different periods. Based on these results,
the investigators can then address certain specific
research questions, including:

Dering’s quantitative data with regard to
use intensity can be applied to burned rock
features in archaeological contexts to determine
the relative frequency of these activities. For
example, Johnson (2009) used Dering’s (1999)
experiments to estimate the total number of firing
episodes for the extensive burned rock midden at
the Barnett Site (41MI77) in Mills County to be
between 150 and 1,000 times. The wide range
between these figures is the result of the fact that
limestone rock fractures randomly when heated,
and fractures even more when used repeatedly;
these factors make it unlikely that accurate

• How does earth oven use-intensity change
over time?
• How does earth oven use-intensity correlate
with periods of bison presence /absence?
• Can subsistence economy and technology
at 41HY165 be explained through these
correlations?

42

In order to supplement the frequency data of
burned rock, certain residue and plant microfossil
analyses are also presented. These studies focus
on identifying microfossil (phytolith, starch
grains, and other fossil remains) that may adhere
to rocks that were part of features used to process

important plant resources. These data, while
not useful for addressing the use of features
for cooking plants versus animals, provide an
important additional level of detail concerning
how burned rock cooking technology was used
in the processing of plant resources.

some cases this interval was reduced to 5 cm
to increase resolution in areas of relatively high
artifact density. Artifacts collected from shovel
tests are not included in this analysis due to
their unreliable context. It should be noted that
a previous field school was conducted at the site
in 1984, and several artifacts are present in this
collection. Unfortunately, the location of the
1984 excavation units is unknown, and therefore
the materials collected during that field season
are not included in this analysis. Unless stated

Site 41HY165 was excavated during the
summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998 by SWT field
schools. Eleven units ranging in size from 1 x 1 m
to 2 x 2 m were excavated on the site, as well as
nine shovel tests (Figure 5-1). The depths of the
units varied from 25 cm to as deep as 280 cmbs.
In addition, the 2 x 2-m units were excavated in
1-m quandrants, and the depth of these quadrants
varied across the unit as well. In general, units
were excavated in 10-cm levels; however in

and 75 cm depth. The context of this point is
questionable due to the presence of Pedernales
points in the overlying and underlying levels.
However, the Pedernales points in this instance
appear to have been reused, and there is no other
indication that this area of the site is not intact.
Therefore, the AU at this location is associated
with the Fairland point. The second exception
is an Ensor point (Specimen 68-2) found in
the northeast quadrangle of Unit 2 that occurs
deeper than all other points, at a depth of 129 cm.
However, a review of the field documentation
and student journals indicates a series of former
rodent burrows across the unit level where
this point occurs. In addition, the point was
found only one level below where the unit was
terminated at the end of the 1996 field season,
suggesting a potential for mixing from overlying
levels between the 1996 and 1997 field seasons.

The material collection of site 41HY165
consists of over 92,000 artifacts that include
projectile points, formal and informal stone
tools, debitage, prehistoric and historic ceramics,
bone, shell, burned rock, and various historic
artifacts. These artifacts represent continuous,
multiple episodes of occupation dating from the
Late Paleoindian period to the Historic period. In
preparing for the analysis of the prehistoric and
historic Native American artifacts, analytical
units (AUs) were established based on temporally
diagnostic projectile points and radiometric dates,
including those run on dated bison bone as well
as charred plant material. Projectile point types
were typed according to definitions of regionally
occurring styles presented by Turner and Hester
(1999), Prewitt (1995), Bell (1993, 1996), and
Perino (1996a, 1996b).

Other evidence of mixing occurs in the
upper 50 cm of deposits. This zone consists of
the A Horizon as defined by Ringstaff (2000),
and contains an array of points ranging from
the Middle Archaic into the Late Prehistoric.
This mixing may represent disturbance, curation
of older tools by subsequent occupations,
overprinting of occupational episodes, or all of
these factors. (Records from the field school do
not indicate any disturbance within this zone.)
Finally, areas where prehistoric artifacts are
associated with historic items are considered
to be a poor context for isolating prehistoric
components. Consequently, prehistoric remains
from these levels will not be attributed to any AU
and will not be analyzed. This includes the upper
20–40 cm across virtually the entire site (Figure
5-2).

AUs were established based on the contexts
of diagnostic artifacts within unmixed and
undisturbed deposits, to the extent that this
could be determined. Deposits are considered
to be mixed or disturbed if younger points or
absolute dates occur below older points or dates.
Older temporal markers occurring above or in
association with younger ones are not necessarily
considered indicative of disturbed contexts given
the potential for postdepositional collection and
curation by subsequent occupations.
Overall, the distribution of projectile points
at the site does not indicate highly mixed
deposits, with two exceptions. The first of these
points is a Fairland point (Specimen 124-1) from
the southeast quadrangle of Unit 8 between 65

Following these principles, seven AUs were
identified based on an analysis of diagnostic
projectile points (Table 5-1) and radiocarbon
dates of bison bone (Table 5-2) and charcoal

(Table 5-3). These AUs are: AU 1, Historic EuroAmerican; AU 2, Historic Native American;
AU 3a, Late Prehistoric–Toyah; AU 3b, Late
Prehistoric–Austin; AU 4a, Late Archaic II; AU
4b, Late Archaic I; AU 5, Middle Archaic; AU
6, Early Archaic; and AU 7, Late Paleoindian.
While all temporal periods are represented
within the collection, some AUs, specifically
AU 1 and AU 2, will be analyzed in a more
general fashion due to the imprecise nature of
these contexts. Additionally, several diagnostic
projectile points, as well five additional bison
bone dates were identified at depths associated
with historic artifacts. While the projectile points
in these contexts hold little utility for analysis,
the bison dates are still useful for establishing a
time frame for the presence or absence of bison

around Aquarena Springs. A list of the artifacts
recovered from the AUs is provided in Appendix
A at the end of this report. All radiocarbon
data from this site are presented by context in
Appendix B.

A Note about Radiocarbon Dating
In total, 24 absolute dates are available from
this small area of 41HY165. Twenty two of these
were submitted during the present analysis of
the extant collection from the site. One (Beta117967) had been processed by Ringstaff and
is reported in his 2000 Master’s thesis. The
final date (ISGS-A1966) was submitted from a
controlled excavation that was carried out during
the survey and assessment phase of the SLAERP

present during the Middle Archaic. Clearly, the
temporal accuracy of this conclusion depends on
the precision with which deposits at the site are
dated. The absence of any bison from excavated
Middle Archaic contexts elsewhere at Spring
Lake (Lohse and Cholak 2011) casts doubt on
this conclusion. Consequently, providing a more
robust sample of directly-dated bison remains
was a second priority for the current analysis.

Samples of bison remains were selected for
dating based on the general distribution of this
taxon. Twelve samples of bison were selected
from across the stratigraphic column at 41HY165
(see results by provenience in Appendix B). The
results of these assays, when determined to be
in proper stratigraphic order, were used to help
define AUs. These results supplemented a total
of 12 radiocarbon assays on carbon, wood, or
carbonized wood in providing absolute dates for
49

this deposit. All but two samples (Beta-117967 and
ISGS-A1966) were pretreated at the University
of Oregon Radiocarbon laboratory, with the
prepared targets submitted to the Accelerator
Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University
of California at Irvine. Bone samples were
pretreated using the XAD purification technique
developed by Thomas Stafford (Stafford et al.
1988, 1991). The result is highly reliable, highprecision AMS dates with standard deviations of
as little as 15 years in some cases, and 20 years
for most samples. Regional chronologies of bison
exploitation, based in part on the record from
41HY165, are presented in Chapter 4.

small, lanceolate arrow point that is commonly
found in association with occupations at Spanish
missions (Tomka and Fox 1999:34). The point
was found in the northwest quadrangle of Unit
3 between 5 and 15 cmbs, within the A Horizon.
Due to their association with Spanish missions in
Texas, these points generally date from the late
seventeenth century into the eighteenth century.
A single ceramic sherd found at the site resembles
Goliad ware (Figueroa and Mauldin 2005:53).
Goliad ware is bone tempered with a red-brown
exterior and black interior, and it originated
with Native American groups in South Texas
(Tomka and Fox 1998:20). This ceramic type is
common among Spanish Colonial assemblages
(Tomka and Fox 1998:20) but is also occasionally
found outside of mission contexts, such as this
one. The single piece of Goliad ware was found
in the southeast quadrangle of Unit 7 between 5
and 15 cmbs. Unfortunately, due to the amount
of historic material found in this site’s upper
levels, it is not possible to identify specific lots
that can be included in this AU. However, this
AU presents some information regarding Native
American presence and occupation at Spring
Lake during the Spanish Colonial era.

AU 1: Historic Euro-American
This AU represents the undefined Historic
debris that was recovered primarily from the A
Horizon. These artifacts include ceramics, glass,
metal, building materials, and a variety of other
debris typically associated with Euro-American
occupations in the region during the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. This debris occurs in
the upper levels of all units and is likely to be
mixed given the presence of prehistoric projectile
points, some as early as the Middle Archaic,
and artifacts in these levels. An analysis of this
assemblage may allow for this unit to be further
divided (Spanish Colonial, Texas Revolution,
post-Civil War, etc.) if distinct spatio-temporal
units can be isolated. Therefore, analysis will rely
more heavily on diagnostic artifacts with the goal
of establishing general periods of settlement with
less consideration for spatial context.

AU 3: Late Prehistoric
This AU represents the Late Prehistoric
assemblage at 41HY165 and includes all arrow
points and ceramics overlying the earlier Archaic
components. This unit has been divided into AU
3a and AU 3b. The first, AU 3a, denotes the Toyah
phase of the Late Prehistoric, distinguished by
the Perdiz arrow point style. The Toyah phase
extends from around 800 BP to as late as 350
BP in Central Texas (Johnson 1994:257–258;
Johnson and Goode 1994:41). Perdiz points were
noted between 10 and 35 cmbs, all within the A
Horizon. However, these points occur in the same
context as later historic material, and are not
considered as contributing to the AU. Due to the
uncertain context of the Perdiz points at the site,

AU 2: Protohistoric Native American
AU 2 consists of a single Guerrero (Mission)
point and a single sherd of Goliad ware pottery.
These artifacts are characteristic Native
American styles from the time of the Spanish
entradas and the establishment of missions during
the Protohistoric period. The Guerrero point is a
50

a single fragment of bison bone (Specimen 79-5),
dating to 536–640 cal BP, was used to establish
this AU within the southwest quadrangle of Unit
2 between 23 and 33 cmbs.

otherwise poorly resolved. Much of this has to
do with climatic processes that are unfavorable to
stratigraphic resolution and clarity; Johnson and
Goode (1994), for example, define the very dry
Edwards Interval as beginning at this time. This
xeric period would have been associated with
soil erosion or reduced rates of sedimentation.
Coupled with cultural processes involving
digging shallow pits for earth ovens, strata from
this period are commonly mixed or altogether
absent. Still, given long enough spans of time,
the Late Archaic can be subdivided into finer
chronological units.

AU 3b represents the Austin phase,
characterized by the Scallorn and Edwards arrow
point styles. The Austin phase extends from 1200
BP up to the onset of Toyah (Collins 2004:122). At
41HY165, Scallorn and Edwards points are found
between 33 and 43 cmbs in the southwest and
southeast quadrangles of Unit 2. This AU is also
entirely within the A Horizon and may include a
reused Darl type projectile point at the lower end
of the level. A piece of charred wood (Specimen
65-7) was also submitted for radiocarbon dating
from the southeast quadrangle in Unit 2, where it
is associated with an Edwards/Scallorn projectile
point. The date returned from this sample was
between 793 and 915 cal BP, well within the age
range of the Austin interval.

AU 4a: Late Archaic II

As mentioned, some Archaic projectile point
styles occur within Late Prehistoric components.
The Late Archaic II period, as defined by Johnson
and Goode (1994), is represented by Ensor, Darl,
Frio, Fairland, and Marcos points. Late Archaic I
points (Montell and Lange) and a Middle Archaic
(Travis) point are also found in this zone. These
older points were likely used and then deposited
by subsequent inhabitants of the area, considering
that no evidence of disturbance was reported.

The Late Archaic II subperiod is represented
at the site by two Ensor style points, two Fairland
style points, a Marcos style point, a bison bone
date, and a radiocarbon date of charcoal. This
is the largest AU at the site, with over 2,400
associated artifacts identified across different
units and at different elevations (Table 5-4). This
AU also occurs in both the A and ABb horizons
defined by Ringstaff (2000). Two Pedernales
points (Specimens 125-1 and 124-2), dating
to Late Archaic I times, were found above and
among this AU in the southeast quadrangle of
Unit 8. Both were recycled and then redeposited
in these levels and there is no indication that these
levels are disturbed or mixed in any way. It is
therefore assumed that the Fairland point in this
context represents the occupation at this level.

AU 4: Late Archaic

AU 4b: Late Archaic I

The Late Archaic is an enormously long
period that almost certainly incorporates a
large volume of otherwise meaningful cultural
variation in terms of adaptive behaviors.
Problems with recognizing this variation and,
consequently, implementing more refined
chronological schemes have to do with the degree
to which remains from different Late Archaic
intervals are often found compressed, mixed, or

AU 4b represents the Late Archaic I
component at the site, which dates from 4300
BP to 2550 BP (Johnson and Goode 1994:34).
This AU consists of a Pedernales point, a single
Morhiss point, and two dates obtained from bison
bone. This AU occurs within the ABb horizon at
the site. Turner and Hester (1999) date Pedernales
points to the Middle Archaic between 4000 BP and
3200 BP, while Prewitt (1981) places Pedernales

points within his Middle Archaic Round Rock
phase between 3400 BP and 2600 BP. However,
Johnson and Goode (1994:29) argue that due
to stylistic, technological, and economical
similarities between Pedernales and Montell, the
onset of the Late Archaic should be pushed back
to include Pedernales around 4300 BP. Collins
(2004:121) also puts the start of the Late Archaic
around this same time (4000 BP). Morhiss points,
while more common in South Texas, also date to
the Late Archaic I period, and chronologically
precede Castroville and Marshall points (Brown
1983:89). There is no indication that Pedernales
and Morhiss points at 41HY165 represent the
same occupation. The Pedernales point was
found in the northwest quadrangle of Unit 10
between 45 and 55 cmbs, while the Morhiss point
was found in the northeast quadrangle of Unit 2
between 80 and 90 cmbs. The bison bone dates
come from the northeast quadrangle of Unit 3
between 55 and 65 cmbs and in the northwest
quadrangle of Unit 8 between 80 and 85 cmbs.

and are generally associated with Nolan points
stylistically and temporally (Collins 2004:120).
Collins (2004) dates the Middle Archaic period
to around 6000–4000 BP. Johnson and Goode
(1994) suggest a narrower range, from 5600 to
4300 BP. Recent radiocarbon dating from the
Gatlin Site (Houk et al. 2009) seems to confirm
Johnson and Goode’s timeline for the Middle
Archaic. The Travis point at 41HY165 was found
in the southeast quadrangle of Unit 1 between 90
and 100 cmbs. Although Ringstaff (2000) did not
define the soils in Unit 1, this unit is close to Unit
10, and the depth of this Travis point corresponds
to the ABb Horizon.

AU 6: Early Archaic and Late
Paleoindian
These two periods at 41HY165 are
represented by five projectile points. However,
these artifacts derive from questionable contexts
and were not included in this analysis. The Early
Archaic period is represented by three projectile
points, an Early Archaic Stemmed, an Early
Archaic Split-Stemmed, and a Gower point.
Recent investigations have identified Gower
points in deposits dating to between 8600 cal BP
and 7440 cal BP at the Icehouse site (Oksanen
2008) and between 7150 cal BP and 6860 cal

AU 5: Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic at 41HY165 is
categorized as AU 5, which is represented by a
single Travis point. Travis points are considered
part of the latter part of the Middle Archaic
52

BP at the Gatlin Site (Houk et al. 2009). Clearly,
this type was not in use for almost two thousand
years, and further refinement in associated ages
is necessary. We consider the Gower deposits
at the Icehouse site to be more relevant for the
current analysis, since this site is located less
than 200 m to the west of 41HY165. In addition,
Gower points at Icehouse were the only projectile
points from the Early Archaic occupations at that
site. The Gower point at 41HY165 was found in
the southwest quadrant of Unit 3 between 75 and
85 cmbs. Unfortunately, wood charcoal from this
level was dated to 2356–2694 cal BP (Specimen
126-9), leaving the context of this Gower point
highly problematic.

Tennessee and parts of Kentucky and Alabama.
However, Justice (1987:60) notes the presence
of this point in Late Paleoindian occupations in
Alabama and Illinois. In northwestern Louisiana,
Webb et al. (1971:41) noted early side-notched
projectile points in association with San Patrice
points at the John Pearce Site, and in Texas, early
side-notched points were found in association
with San Patrice at the Wolfshead Site in San
Augustine County (Duffield 1963). A Big Sandy
point was also found along Cibolo Creek at site
41CM96 (Gerstle et al. 1978:84).
The problematic (late) date from the Gower
level above also indicates a poor context for
these lower points. Additional dates from the
underlying levels also confirm a poor context for
the Late Paleoindian projectile points. A charcoal
sample from the same level as the Golondrina
point dates from 1608 to 1724 cal BP (Specimen
120-26). Below this level and directly above the
Big Sandy point, a charcoal sample from 90 to 95
cmbs was dated to 1871–1985 cal BP (Specimen
146-8). Finally, the Early Stemmed point was
found between 125 and 130 cmbs in Unit 8 in
the northwest quadrant. A charcoal sample from
the level below this (130–135 cmbs) came back
at 4162–4409 cal BP. The range of dates from
the Gower point level to the level below the
Early Stemmed point brackets these levels, and
these Late Paleoindian points, within the Late
Archaic and possibly as early as the late Middle
Archaic. Therefore, the contexts of these points
are all problematic and this disparity cannot be
explained. Although the field notes from the
excavations and Ringstaff’s thesis do not indicate
that there has been any disturbance within these
units, the charcoal dates do not support the earlier
dates indicated by the points. While it is possible
that the charcoal dates are inaccurate, there is
no indication that these have been contaminated
during collection or curation. Therefore, AUs for
the Early Archaic and the Late Paleoindian periods

Two projectile points date to the Late
Paleoindian period, including a Golondrina
point and a Big Sandy (early side-notched)
point. The Late Paleoindian period dates from
between approximately 10,000 BP and 8000 BP
and is divided into three subperiods: Wilson,
Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall (Collins
2004:118). Wilson components date to between
10,000 and 9650 BP, while the other two
components date from 9500 to 8000 BP. While
all of these points occur within Ringstaff’s
(2000) Bw2b Horizon, they are distributed
vertically, with the Golondrina point occurring
between 85 and 90 cmbs and the Big Sandy point
between 95 and 100 cmbs. The Early Stemmed
point was found between 125 and 130 cmbs.
The Golondrina and Big Sandy points are both
found in the southwest quadrant of Unit 3 and the
Early Stemmed point is found in the northwest
quadrant of Unit 8. Turner and Hester (1999:106)
equate the Early Stemmed variety with both
Wilson points as well as with Golondrina
components. The Big Sandy point, also referred
to as early side-notched, is uncommon in Texas
and generally dates to the Archaic period in the
southeast (Perino 1985:36). Perino (1985:36)
argues that Big Sandy points only occur in central

have not been established for 41HY165. Presently,
no strata containing intact Early Archaic or Late
Paleoindian remains are recognized at the site.
Perhaps future investigations may clarify the
nature of these deposits.

Materials that were not counted included
microdebitage, miniscule objects recovered from
flotation samples, and small fragments of shell.
Detailed analytical approaches for each of
these categories are discussed in the appropriate
chapters. They are briefly summarized here,
however, for ease of reference. Lithics included
all chipped stone and groundstone artifacts
recovered during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 field
schools. In addition to being counted and weighed,
all of the lithics in the assemblage were sorted
into categories based on artifact form, function,
and material type. Only lithics recovered from
AUs were carefully analyzed with the overall
research design for this project kept closely in
mind. Specific approaches used in this analysis,
and the results are presented in Chapter 6.

Analytical Approaches
The focus of the analysis for 41HY165 is on
material contained within the AUs described
above. These AUs represent only a portion of
the overall collection; however, they are the only
samples of the assemblage that can be confidently
described as being from non-disturbed deposits
based on the spatial distribution of diagnostic
projectile points or radiocarbon dates. The
remainder of the collection, items not recovered
from within these AUs, has been sorted and
cataloged, but are not subjected to analysis.

Ceramics in the collection were initially
sorted according to prehistoric or historic origin.
The historic ceramics were further subdivided
according to type (see Table 5-5). All of the
prehistoric ceramics were submitted to CAR at
UTSA, and the results are presented in Chapter
7. The Spanish Colonial ceramics recovered
from the collection were also submitted with the
prehistoric specimens. Carole Leezer conducted
the analysis of the historic ceramics, and the
result of this analysis is presented in Chapter 8.

The first task prior to the current analysis
involved reorganizing the entire collection by
provenience. Lot numbers were assigned to the
smallest definable unit of excavation. In most
cases, lot numbers represent a single level of one
quadrant of an excavation unit. Artifacts from
a specific lot were assigned specimen numbers
based on the class and type of the artifact.
Although artifacts from the 1984 field school
were not included in the current analysis, the
artifacts were sorted out of the main collection
and given lot and specimen numbers as well.

Collected faunal remains were identified to
taxon and element, and were weighed, tagged,
and bagged individually. Within a given lot,
individual specimens identifiable by element and
taxon were also assigned specimen numbers. In
total, faunal material from 25 lots in six units
were examined. Lots were selected for study
based on associated temporal data; material not
from AUs was not carefully examined. Material
examined was recovered from Units 1, 2, 2E, 3,
8, 10, and 11, comprising a temporally controlled
subassemblage of 1,290 whole or partial elements

All of the artifacts were sorted and bagged
according to the class and type of artifact. Artifact
class is a general category such as lithic, ceramic,
metal, etc., and type is more specific description
such as biface, stoneware, nail, etc. Table 5-5
lists the artifact classes and types used for this
project. In some cases, a description was given
that related the specific species, raw material, or
function of the object. During the sorting, most
artifact categories were counted and weighed.

with a combined mass of approximately 538
grams (g). The relative frequencies of faunal
material, standardized across AU for consistency
in occurrence, were compared. Comparisons
were conducted: (1) within each AU in order to
understand prey choice as represented by taxon
list; and (2) across all AUs in order to understand
shifts in prey choice through time. Patterns of
taxonomic occurrence through time at 41HY165
were examined for clues to resource distribution,
subsistence base intensification, prey choice
with respect to bison procurement, and trends in
gender-governed labor division. Special attention
was given to the occurrence pattern of bison, and
its abundance relative to other prominent game
species through time such as pronghorn, deer, and
rabbit. Results were compared with such patterns

found at other sites in Central Texas. Results of
the faunal analysis are presented in Chapter 11.
The analysis of plant remains is one
avenue of research into a group’s foodways—
the procurement, production, preparation,
consumption, display, storage, and discard of
food. These practices vary by economic, social,
and political situation, and, hence, cultural
traditions of a group (Johannessen 1993). As no
botanical specimens or soil samples exist from
the original field school excavations conducted at
41HY165, this investigation took advantage of a
1 x 1-m excavation unit (XU3), excavated during
the SLAERP directly adjacent to Unit 3 excavated
during the 1996–1998 SWT archaeological field
schools (Figure 5-3). Data from this test unit was
used during the SLAERP to develop detailed
55

information regarding the nature of deposits in
this areas not previously subjected to extensive
excavation. XU 3 was excavated to 150 cmbs.
A 4-liter bulk soil sample was collected from
each unit level. These samples were processed
by flotation for the recovery of small fauna, plant
remains, and lithic debris that would pass through
the ⅛-inch screen. These flotation samples
were submitted to Dr. Kandace Hollenbach for
analysis. Results are presented in Chapter 9.

these were sorted out of the main collection,
counted, and weighed. In total, 6,754 burned rocks
weighing 316.5 kg were recovered. The weight of
burned rock from each AU was standardized so
that the frequency of burned rock cooking could
be compared across all of the AUs. Additionally,
a select sample of 18 burned rocks was submitted
to AEL at Texas A&M University to extract
phytoliths and starch granules. Twelve of these
rocks were taken from feature contexts and four
were taken from Zone 1/97; the remaining rocks
were taken from a level with dated bison bone
in Unit 11. All of the rocks are from AUs. The
results of the burned rock and feature analysis are
in Chapter 10, and the report from Texas A&M is
included in Chapter 9.

All features discussed in the present report
were identified during the three field school
seasons; the present analysis was limited to a
review of the original paperwork. Burned rocks
making up these features had been saved, and

Lithic Analysis
By Amy E. Reid

Introduction

and exploring patterns of curated technologies
and tool systems that emphasize expediency
at 41HY165. It is typically believed that if an
assemblage is characterized by a majority of
expedient tools, then it could be said that the
people associated with that assemblage lived
in a resource-rich environment (Andrefsky
2005; Binford 1979; Weinstein 2005). It is also
hypothesized that expedient tools characterize
a “forager” society that is somewhat mobile
and extracts foods from a variety of resources
(Binford 1979, 1980; Lohse 2011; Weinstein
2005). Conversely, if an assemblage is made
up of mostly curated and highly specialized
tools, then the society occupied sites for longer
periods, made relatively fewer residential moves,
and commonly sent out task groups on logistical
forays to procure a small number of predictable
resources (Binford 1980; Lohse 2011). This type of
economic activity is believed to be characteristic
of “collector” societies and would require
reliable and maintainable tools (Binford 1979,
1980; Lohse 2011). It is our understanding that
the concepts of expediency and curation cannot
be truly understood by studying associated tool
types. Rather, in the present study, we explore
how these processes may have influenced tool
use.

This chapter describes the culturally altered
lithic material (chipped stone tools and debris)
recovered from investigations at 41HY165. Lithic
materials from 41HY165 were organized into the
following categories: projectile points, bifaces,
unifaces, flake tools, cores, and debitage. AU
lots were further separated into the following:
complete flakes, proximal flakes, broken flakes,
r-flakes, distinctive expanding billet (DEB)
flakes, notching flakes, and burned non-flaked
debitage. The analysis of each of these categories
is described in the methodology of each section.
Lithic analyses were designed to address four
of the interrelated research domains outlined in
Chapter 4: (1) filling in the chronology of human
occupation at Spring Lake; (2) understanding how
aggregation shaped hunter-gatherer settlement
mobility systems; (3) defining periods during
which bison were important in local and regional
economies, and exploring how other resources
and their associated technological adaptations
increased or decreased in prominence during
these periods; and (4) reconstructing trade and
clarifying its effect on local economic production
and subsistence.
The theoretical perspective behind these
analyses assumes that the tool assemblage
can provide the foundation for differentiating
between foraging and collecting strategies. In
other words, the work presented below attempts
to reconstruct the contexts within which tools
were made, used, and discarded by identifying

The result of each analysis is presented
below, followed by a brief discussion of their
implications. Temporal patterns of lithic
technological changes, along with their
significance pertaining to earth oven usage and
bison exploitation, are discussed in Chapter 10.

Projectile Points

Condition and Breakage: This specimen is a
proximal fragment with random flake patterning
and a stem that has squared corners. At least
two episodes of impact damage have caused the
entire distal tip to snap off and most of one lateral
edge to be removed. The missing lateral edge
may have been the result of intentional burination
after the distal tip broke off.

Time-diagnostic projectile points help
to address research domain (1) filling in the
chronology of human occupation at Spring Lake.
The current analysis focuses on reconstructing
41HY165’s cultural sequence in the context of
provisional phases (Prewitt 1981, 1983) defined
for the region. Point count data are also analyzed
in order to explore site visitation intensity.

Methodology
In total, 58 projectile points and point
fragments were recovered during the 1996–1998
field school excavations at 41HY165. Of these, 41
(70.7 percent) are dart points and 17 (29.3 percent)
are arrow points. Seventeen different types were
found including: Big Sandy and Golondrina for
the Late Paleoindian (n = 2); Gower for the Early
Archaic (n = 1); Travis for the Middle Archaic
(n = 3); Pedernales and Morhiss for Late Archaic
I (n = 5); Montell, Marcos, Ellis, Frio, Ensor,
Fairland and Darl for the Late Archaic II (n = 18);
Scallorn, and Edwards for the Austin phase of
the Late Prehistoric (n = 3); Perdiz for the Toyah
phase of the Late Prehistoric (n = 6); and Guerrero
for the Historic (n = 1). In addition, 10 untypable
arrow points and eight untypable dart points were
recovered. Two of the untyped dart points are
stemmed variations from the Early Archaic and
are described below. Metric and observed data
for each point (typed and untyped) are provided
in Appendix C (Tables C-1 through C-4).

Discussion
Of the 58 projectile points and
point fragments, 39 (67.2%) can
be identified by type. The most
common types recovered include
Ensor (n = 6) and Perdiz (n = 6).
Resharpening projectile points does
seem to be an important task at
41HY165, as evidenced by retouch
on 40 of the 55 specimens (72.7%).
Looking at the raw frequencies
of point types by period, we see a
peak in the Late Archaic II (Figure
6-13). In all, 18 projectile points
were recovered from intact and
undisturbed contexts, 12 of which
could be typed (Table 6-1). The
highest frequency of projectile points from these
AUs occurs during the Late Archaic II. However,

these raw counts represent the totals over each AU,
which represents various volumes of excavated
samples and different durations of time, making
them inadequate for an accurate comparison.
To account for this disparity, projectile point
recoveries were standardized using the equation:

by looking at the frequency with which all points,
including those not found in AUs, were discarded
(LeDoux and Lohse 2011a). This is calculated
by dividing the raw counts by the duration of
each period and then multiplying the results by
100 (Table 6-2). According to these figures, the
Late Archaic II seems to be the most heavily
occupied period (Figure 6-14). A sharp incline in
site visitation occurs between Late Archaic I and
Late Archaic II, and then visitation declines to 0.6
points discarded per century in the Austin phase
of the Late Prehistoric period. Site occupation
increases again during Toyah times and then
decreases in the Historic period. However, even
these results have ambiguous implications.
LeDoux and Lohse (2011a:220) reason that
this approach probably underrepresents Late
Prehistoric occupations, since arrow points were
produced and used as the tips for weapons and
were part of a tool kit consisting of other types of
bifaces with various functions. In earlier periods,
dart points were produced and used for a wide
variety of tasks, including weaponry.

FS = ((FR/T)/V) × 100
In this equation, FR represents the number of
points found in the AU, which is divided by the
duration of the AU (T). This value is then divided
by the total volume (V) of excavated soil within
the AU. Finally, the result is then multiplied by
100 to provide a standardized frequency (FS) of
projectile points for every 100 years.
After standardizing the raw counts, the rate
of recovery is highest during the Austin phase
of the Late Prehistoric (see Table 6-1). However,
neither the total nor standardized projectile point
counts should be interpreted as representative of
regional population trends. Instead, simple site
visitation intensity can be examined temporally

Results
Early-Stage Bifaces (n = 0)
No early-stage bifaces were recovered from
AUs at 41HY165.

Bifaces

Intermediate-Stage Bifaces (n = 6)
The intermediate-stage includes bifaces
that have a more established form than earlystage bifaces and have proximal, medial, and
distal sections. In addition, intermediate-stage
bifaces usually retain a small amount of cortex.
Six bifaces were classified as intermediate-stage
bifaces, three of which were complete. Specimen
152-7 (Figure 6-15E) is a short, triangular
biface with a square proximal end. It is fairly
symmetrical in plan view, but has sinuous lateral
edges and pronounced bulb scars. Abrupt hinge
and step terminations are evident on both faces,
as well as cortex. Specimen 279-5 (Figure 6-15 F)
is a good example of a large, thick, ovate biface
with a convex proximal end. The lateral edges are
sinuous with pronounced bulb scars and retouch
with step and hinge terminations. Cortex is
present on one face as well as a stack formation.
There is evidence of crushing on the proximal
end and use wear on the lateral edges and distal
end. The last complete biface, Specimen 256-2
(Figure 6-15B), is a smaller, thick, ovate biface
that also exhibits cortex, sinuous lateral edges,
and pronounced bulb scars. There is evidence
of crushing on the lateral edges and distal end.
Both faces exhibit step terminations. There are
three broken biface fragments in this category,
two of which have cortex and perverse breaks.
Specimen 238-5 (Figure 6-15A) is a corner

In total, 172 bifaces and biface fragments
were recovered during the 1996–1998 field
school excavations at 41HY165. Of those, 24
(15.1%) are associated with the established AUs.
This analysis focused on examining the various
reduction stages of the blanks and preforms that
were discarded within AUs in order to elucidate
technological trends.

Methodology
Within the AUs, 14 bifaces were recovered
and recognized as preforms, four of which were
complete. All AU preforms were sorted into
one of four reduction stages: early-stage (n = 0),
intermediate-stage (n = 6), late intermediatestage (n = 4), and late-stage preforms (n = 4).
Two bifacial tools that do not fit into any of
these four categories are also described below.
Measurements of length, width, and thickness to
the nearest 0.1 millimeter (mm) as well as weight
to the nearest 0.1 g were recorded for each of
the reduction-stage bifaces. Incomplete bifaces
were identified as corner fragments, medial
fragments, end missing, end only (proximal
or distal), or edge missing. The breakage type
and raw material characteristics such as cortex,
patina, or heat treatment were recorded when
present. These fragments were also weighed
and inspected for use wear. No measurements

generally shorter and/or narrower than earlier
stages within the reduction sequence. Four
bifaces exhibit these characteristics. Specimen
310-13 (Figure 6-16C) is a complete biface with
slightly sinuous lateral edges. Although multiple
step and hinge terminations exist, the specimen is
symmetrical in plan view and has a large, fluted
flake scar on the proximal end from attempting

Late Intermediate-Stage Bifaces (n = 4)
This category includes bifaces that have
a more clearly established outline. They are

71

to thin the base. This is a good example of a
low-skill, late intermediate-stage biface. The
remaining bifaces within this category are
all well thinned, triangular, distal fragments
representing reduction failures. Specimen 256-3
(Figure 6-16B) exhibits a perverse fracture, while
Specimen 238-6 (Figure 6-16A) has a horizontal
break; both show evidence of use wear. Specimen
310-17 (Figure 6-16D) has two transverse
fractures forming a point on the proximal end. It

is difficult to determine if this was intentional or
caused by heat fracturing. There is also evidence
of light retouch and use wear along the lateral
edges.

Late-Stage Bifaces (n = 4)
Late-stage preforms have established
forms, low edge angles, and an absence of
retouched lateral margins. They are also thinner
and shorter than all other bifaces within the

reduction sequence, and are usually made of
higher-quality chert. This category contains four
specimens. Specimens 238-8 (Figure 6-17B) and
256-16 (Figure 6-17A) are distal fragments with
horizontal fractures. Specimen 291-5 (Figure
6-17C) is a corner fragment, and Specimen 31016 (Figure 6-17D) is a medial fragment with
perverse and horizontal fractures. Three of the
specimens (291-5, 238-8, 310-16) in this category
exhibit heat spalling and use wear.

In general, biface production at 41HY165
can be described as relatively low-intensity, midto late-stage production. No early-stage bifaces
were found within reliable contexts at 41HY165.
Intermediate-stage bifaces seem to have been
preferred over other stages at this site (Table
6-3). Six bifaces were associated with the Middle
Archaic, one with the Late Archaic I, and seven
with the Late Archaic II (Figure 6-18). However,
this small sample precludes any discussion of
trends over time.

Drills/Perforators (n = 2)
Two bifaces were recovered from two
different AUs that do not fit into one of the four
categories described above. Both specimens
are distal fragments of a perforator or drill.
Specimen 152-28 (Figure 6-19A) is triangular
in cross section and plan view, and has a sharp
point. Specimen 310-15 (Figure 6-19B) has more
pronounced bulb scars, making the lateral edges
beveled and sinuous. It also has a blunt tip and
exhibits a bending fracture.

unifaces by the ability to identify the original
morphology of the flake.
Nickels and Bousman (2010) refer to four
subcategories of unifaces: expedient, minimal,
formal, and indeterminate. Expedient unifaces
are flakes that have been modified through use,
but not by intentional flaking or shaping. The
minimal category includes minimally retouched
unifaces (MRUs) that have not been drastically
altered from their original form, but one or more
of its edges has been modified through intentional
flaking. Formal unifaces have one or more
significantly shaped edges through deliberate
patterning of flake removals. Nickels and
Bousman (2010) also describe formal unifaces
as “artifacts functionally classified as scrapers,
gouges, or unifacial knives.” However, the present
study avoids a functional classification system
since inferences made regarding prehistoric use
are best supported with microwear analysis.

Flake Tools and Formal Unifaces
In total, 177 flake tools and formal unifaces
are present in 41HY165’s AUs. Of those, two were
classified as formal unifaces. According to Hall et
al. (1982:348), formal unifaces contain flake scars
over the majority of their dorsal face, assume a
standard form, and have unmodified ventral
surfaces. In addition, extensive modification
completely alters the original morphology of the
flake to the extent that its original size and shape
cannot be determined. Flake tools, on the other
hand, include any flake that is unifacially edgemodified or used, and has little to no modification
on its dorsal face. Flake tools are generally
thought of as expedient tools that can be easily
prepared, but have low reliability. Expedient
flake tools (EFTs) are infrequently maintained
and often discarded and replaced with a new tool
when they attain an undesirable amount of wear.
Flake tools can be distinguished from formal

The above-described system, with a few
modifications, was used to analyze the flake tools
and unifaces found within AUs at 41HY165. The
term “expedient uniface” is not used in this study
for these types of tools since some uses could
75

modify the flake bifacially (slicing, chopping,
etc.). Therefore flakes that were not intentionally
flaked, shaped, or modified and exhibited
macroscopic use wear were categorized as EFTs.
This category was then further separated into
unifacial or bifacial EFT categories. The same
criteria Nickels and Bousman (2010) used for
MRUs was used in our study. In some cases,
flake edges that have been prepared or ground
(similar to the way a platform is prepared) could
be mistaken for use wear. Experimental studies
combined with microwear confirmation would
be a valuable effort to differentiate between
prepared/ground flake tool edges and utilized
edges. It is also important to note that unidentified
postdepositional damage can cause single-flake
random and irregular detachments on a flake
edge. This type of edge morphology could also
represent accretional chipping acquired during
use. However, microscopic examination would
be necessary to confirm this. Because of these
subjective and complex issues, the total number
of EFTs is unknown for this assemblage.

Presented below are descriptions and
preliminary interpretations of the 41HY165
AU flake tools and unifaces. Unfortunately, the
sample size for flake tools and unifaces recovered
from reliable AUs is relatively small and does not
allow for detailed statistical analyses. Although
the interpretive potential of this group of artifacts
is limited by its small sample size, artifact
descriptions and descriptive statistics help to
document general trends in how flake tools and
unifaces might have been designed and procured,
and how intensively they were used over different
periods at 41HY165.

Methodology
All 4,237 pieces of chipped stone (broken
and complete) from the AUs were scanned for
EFTs. Specimens were classified as an EFT if
the original morphology of the flake remained
and contained evidence of macroscopic edge
modification (unifacial or bifacial) acquired
through tool utilization, but lacked regular and
intentional flaking or shaping. A specimen was
classified as an MRU if regular and intentional
flaking (retouch) was evident on one or more
of its edges, but its original flake form was still
distinguishable. A uniface was designated as
formal if it exhibited significant shaping and
deliberate patterning of unifacial flake removals
on one or more edge.

In general, this study realizes that MRUs are
less expedient and more curated than the EFT
category. Furthermore, “curated” tools are often
associated with collectors and “expedient” tools
are often associated with foragers. However, it is
our understanding that the concept of curation
cannot be truly understood by relating it with any
type of tool. Alternatively, we understand curation
as a process associated with tool use. Therefore,
we wanted to look at degrees of curation within
both categories of tools by looking at the Total
Edge Modification (TEM) and the Potential
Edge Modification (PEM). This method (detailed
below in the Methodology section) allows us to
note changes in expediency in different parts of
the tool kits at 41HY165 over time (LeDoux and
Lohse 2011b).

All specimens were weighed to the nearest
0.1 g. Using the method developed by Prilliman
and Bousman (1998) for flake tool analysis at
the Wilson-Leonard site in Williamson County,
metric measurements were taken for the MRUs
as well as the formal unifaces. First, maximum
length, width, and thickness of each artifact
were measured with calipers to the nearest 0.1
mm. Then, a nylon string was used to measure
the circumference. The string was wrapped
around the circumference of the artifact as near

76

as possible to the ventral face. Once marked,
the string was laid out along a ruler and the
circumference was measured to the nearest
millimeter and recorded.

All Expedient Flake Tools (n = 88)
In total, 88 EFTs were identified within the
AUs at 41HY165. The majority (n = 78) exhibited
unifacial modification from use wear, while 10
exhibited bifacial modification due to utilization.
Although raw counts show that AU 4a (Late
Archaic I) contained the most EFTs, the adjusted
numbers suggest that they were most frequent
during Austin times (Table 6-4, Figure 6-20).
TEM:PEM ratios for EFTs suggest that they
were most heavily used during the Late Archaic I
(Figure 6-21). Interestingly, EFTs seem to be used

TEM and PEM were measured for all flake
tools and unifaces using the string in the same
method. TEM is defined as any edge that shows
continuous flake scaring for at least 2 mm along its
length. PEM is the modified edge combined with
any unmodified edge that could have been flaked,
not including the platform nor any fractured
edges. Last, a TEM:PEM ratio was calculated by
dividing the TEM by the PEM. The TEM:PEM
ratio, when multiplied by
100, indicates the intensity of

EFTs as well as MRUs during this time than
any other period. According to the TEM:PEM
ratios, EFTs were used significantly less during
the Austin period than in any other. This means
that while there were many EFTs being produced
during the Austin period, they were only lightly
used, making them truly expedient tools. The
data presented above also established that while

Overall, the limited number of EFTs
and unifaces recovered from dated contexts
prevents detailed temporal analysis. However,
the available data elucidate a few important
trends. One is that both EFTs and MRUs are
most numerous in Austin times. This suggests
that more people were producing and using
81

TEM:PEM ratios for EFTs are highest during
the Late Archaic I, TEM:PEM ratios for MRUs
are highest during the Middle Archaic. This
would suggest that informally fashioned flake
tools were more heavily used during the Late
Archaic I, making them less expedient. This
observation, combined with higher TEM:PEM
ratios for Middle Archaic MRUs, indicates a
more maintainable and curated tool kit, which
suggests that people visiting 41HY165 during
the Middle Archaic and the onset of the Late
Archaic may have practiced collector strategies.
Interestingly, the only two formal unifaces
recovered from reliable contexts were associated
with the Middle Archaic. To better understand
the hunter-gatherer technological organization at
41HY165, this information should be considered
along with relative changes in the frequencies of
different tool types over time and related to bison
exploitation and earth oven use.

C). Multidirectional cores are characterized
by flake removals from multiple directions and
from more than one platform. Ad Hoc cores are
a subcategory of multidirectional flake cores that
show some rotation, but no patterned faces or
platforms have been developed. They also have
little to no platform maintenance and some flake
removals appear exploratory in nature. Specimen
65-6 is a broken flake core that has been recycled
into a uniface. Two edges have been unifacially
modified, forming a point. There is evidence of
use wear along the modified edges on both the
ventral and dorsal faces. Specimen 74-5 is a thin
flake core with cortex covering the dorsal face
(Figure 6-28 B). The flaking platform probably
alternated between the dorsal face and a number
of resulting platforms until the core became too
thin to utilize.

Debitage can also be analyzed to classify the
type of load application used in its production.
Some researchers believe that soft-hammer
percussion flakes can be recognized by difuse or
no bulbs of force and pronounced lips. Although
size is a difficult and unreliable measure for
determining load application, pressure flakes
are sometimes defined as being smaller, thinner
and lighter in weight than percussion flakes.
Flakes produced by hard-hammer percussion
have “pronounced bulbs of force, no lipping
and slightly crushed striking platform areas”
(Crabtree 1972:44).

removed to thin or trim a biface. They can vary
in sizes and attribute values depending upon
the size and shape of the biface as well as the
trimming method. This flake type usually has
complex or faceted striking platforms, indicating
platform preparation. Also, since the flake is
removed from a biface, it will usually have ridges
between flake scars on the dorsal surface. These
flakes can be associated with both the production
of and the resharpening of biface tools. Flakes
produced from retouching or resharpening end
scrapers are created by using the ventral surface
as a striking platform. Therefore, they usually
have flat striking platforms and rarely have dorsal
cortex (Andrefsky 2008:123).

The method of creating a technological
typology based on debitage can be important
in making behavioral interpretations and has
its own theories. For example, debitage types
are often used to infer the use of specific tool
types at a site. Bifacial thinning flakes are flakes

Overall, the different attributes associated
with bifacial thinning flakes and striking
platforms can be used to differentiate between
biface production and core reduction as well as
83

determine the relative amount of time invested in
production. Flakes with single facets (flat striking
platforms) are usually the result of detaching
flakes from non-bifacial tools like unidirectional
cores. Since bifacial thinning flakes usually have
complex striking platforms and pronounced lips,
which are produced by soft-hammer percussion
on a prepared platform, a more time consuming
process can be associated with the production
of biface tools. Additionally, some researchers
believe that platform preparation is indicative of
the knapper being more careful when removing
flakes from an objective piece that is close to being
finished or has had a large amount of investment
put in its production (Andrefsky 2005). Some
researchers have observed that a “trend with
decreasing relative amounts of bifacial thinning
flakes suggests that bifacial technology decreases
with increased amounts of relative sedentism”
(Andrefsky 2005). Thus, the relative amount of
bifacial thinning flakes at a site could be used
to infer the degree of sedentism at that site
(Parry and Kelly 1987). Through consideration
of the theoretical perspectives described above,
debitage types and attributes were analyzed from
the data recovered from site 41HY165 and are
presented below.

flakes, broken flakes, and burned non-flake
debitage were counted and weighed and then
excluded from further analysis. A complete
listing of debitage counts and weights for each
AU is provided in Appendix C (Table C-9).
Complete flakes were the focal point of
this analysis, as they were believed to be most
informative. Therefore, complete flakes were
sorted into thinning and non-thinning flakes.
Non-thinning flakes are typically thick, have a
relatively large amount of cortex, and smooth,
unprepared platforms. Their ventral faces have
little to no concave curvature and can sometimes
be convex. Thinner flakes with concave ventral
surfaces are characteristic of biface thinning.
Biface thinning flakes also often lack cortex and
have prepared (faceted) platforms.
Subcategories of biface thinning flakes
include r-flakes and distinctive expanding billet
flakes (DEBs). R-flakes result from a manufacture
error where the knapper strikes too deeply on the
platform, removing a wider section of the biface
edge than intended. The platforms on r-flakes are
large and are usually the widest area of the flake.
The ventral surfaces of r-flakes are characterized
by a bending fracture that often creates a profile
resembling the shape of the letter “r.” DEBs are
very thin, curved flakes that have extremely
narrow platforms and lateral edges that expand
for more than half the length of the flake. Both
r-flakes and DEBs can be reliably associated
with a billet percussion method of flake removal
(Hayden and Hutchings 1989).

Methodology
The present study includes only debitage
that has not been modified through utilization
or retouch. Debitage from the AUs was sorted
into the following categories: complete flakes,
proximal flakes, broken flakes, burned nonflaked debitage, and angular debris (shatter).
Total counts are presented in Table 6-8. Proximal

Austin times. However, the billet to complete
flake ratio is highest during Austin times.

Several trends can be established from
the analysis of debitage at 41HY165. Biface
thinning via billet technology was the least
common during the Late Archaic. The Austin
phase contained the highest frequency of biface

Conclusion

thinning flakes. This period also represents
an increase in non-thinning flakes. These two
trends contribute to a comparatively low ratio of
thinning flakes to complete flakes. Compared to
the other periods, the Austin phase of the Late
Prehistoric is characterized by an increase in
on-site core reduction as well as an increase in
later stages of tool production evidenced by billet
flaking technology. There was only a 5 percent
difference between the percentages of complete
flakes that are general thinning and complete
flakes that are non-thinning. Therefore, the data
suggest that an almost equal amount of bifacial
thinning and core reduction techniques took
place at 41HY165 during Austin times. Also,
if biface thinning flakes can also be associated
with biface resharpening, then this must have
been an important activity during this period as
well. From the data, it is clear that tool production
techniques were the most diverse during Austin
times.

The lithic assemblage from 41HY165 consists
of reliable, maintainable tools such as projectile
points and bifaces as well as EFTs and MRUs.
Temporally, these assemblages vary and are
shaped by population changes as well as changes
in subsistence that required technological shifts.
The frequency of discarded projectile points
suggests that there was a significant population
increase at 41HY165 from the Late Archaic I to
Late Archaic II. It has also been established that
EFT use intensified during the Late Archaic I and
MRU use intensified during the Middle Archaic.
In other words, informally fashioned flake tools
were used more heavily during the Late Archaic
I, making them less expedient. Interestingly, the
Late Archaic I has the fewest MRUs. MRUs seem
to be used more heavily in the Middle Archaic.
These observations point towards a more
maintainable and curated tool kit, which suggests
that people visiting 41HY165 during the Middle
Archaic and Late Archaic I may have practiced
collector strategies. What caused people to curate
and maintain their flake tools and unifaces more

during these occupations? The demand for these
tools must have increased to a point where the
effort required to produce new ones outweighed
the effort required to recycle them.

was recovered from a unit and level dating to the
Austin phase, adding to the evidence supporting
on-site core reduction.
The organization of tool production and
effort reflected in the analyzed flake tools,
unifaces, and debitage shows that a variety of
economic activities and available resources
necessitated a relatively generalized tool kit of
highly versatile and efficient formal and informal
tools at 41HY165. In particular, this diversity is
most significant in the Austin tool kit. From these
data, we can conclude that visitation was more
common at 41HY165 during the Austin period.
This visitation is evidenced by more projectile
points (standardized), more EFTs, and more
MRUs than in any other period. Additionally,
knappers were participating in more biface
thinning, billet flaking, and flaking associated
with core reduction during Austin occupation
than in any other. Whatever cultural shifts that
occurred with the transition from dart and atlatl
to bow and arrow may have caused or can be
associated with a fundamental shift in how
41HY165 was occupied and used during Austin
times. Furthermore, from their sample of 46
AMS dates, Lohse and Cholak (2011) suggest
that bison were absent from Central Texas for
approximately 1,500 years prior to the Toyah
phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Changes in
the availability of key species, like bison, may
have resulted in new technological approaches
to ensure sustainability. Another factor which
likely affected the archaeological record at
41HY165 is climate. Around AD 1200, there
was a drought that affected parts of the Edwards
Plateau (Johnson and Goode 1994). During this
drought, streams and rivers would have dried
up causing people to aggregate around the everpresent springs that currently form Spring Lake.
Although conditions did not support bison in
Central Texas during this time, the springs were
capable of supporting smaller-bodied game like

Unfortunately, the sample sizes for some of
our analytical categories recovered from reliable
AUs are too small to allow for detailed statistical
analyses, nor any discussion of temporal trends.
Only 24 bifaces were recovered from reliable
proveniences, so what looks like a meaningful
paucity of bifaces during certain periods may
actually just be a reflection of fundamentally
flawed data due to the small sample size. Our
small sample of formal unifaces (n = 2) results
in similar difficulties. Furthermore, the lack of
prismatic blades and blade cores at 41HY165
(especially during Toyah times) is surprising
considering their supposed association with a
specialized bison hunting and processing tool
kit. However, there is evidence that blade- like
flakes were often used as scrapers, perhaps for
processing bison.
Overall, tool production was highest in
Austin times. Both EFTs and MRUs are most
numerous during the Austin phase. Biface
thinning via billet technology was most prevalent
during the Austin phase. The Austin phase is also
represented by an increase in non-thinning flakes
contributing to a comparatively low ratio of
thinning flakes to complete flakes. Compared
to the other periods, the Austin phase of the
Late Prehistoric is characterized by an increase
in on-site core reduction as well as an increase
in later stages of tool production evidenced by
billet flaking technology. The small difference
between the percentages of complete flakes
that are general thinning and complete flakes
that are non-thinning suggests that an almost
equal amount of bifacial thinning/resharpening
and core reduction techniques took place at
41HY165 during Austin times. One flake core

human populations during times when water
was scarce elsewhere. Chert resources were
also readily available to 41HY165 occupants.
This site was high in aggregate resources even
when bison were absent and the climate was
dryer. Therefore, foragers would have returned
to 41HY165 year after year, increasing their

archaeological visibility. The Austin tool kit
seems to reflect a forager society exploiting
nearby available resources. All of these lines of
evidence, considered together, help to explain the
significant increase in tool production as well as
the diverse tool kit during the Austin period at
41HY165.

In June 2011, CAR obtained 24 ceramic
sherds from CAS for petrographic analysis. The
sherds were from archaeological site 41HY165 on
the Texas State campus, adjacent to Spring Lake.
Tasks and analyses performed by CAR on the
samples included the following:
(1)

focused on attributes that could be seen under
low magnification (10-20x) or without the aid
of magnification. The analytical methods used
were derived from previous analyses as well
as guidelines provided by the Council of Texas
Archaeologists (CTA).

macroscopic ceramic analysis of each
sherd prior to subsampling;

Macroscopic findings were to be compared
with findings derived from the petrographic
analysis which typically is able to quantify
more precisely the technological aspects of
paste preparation and clay sources employed
in fabrication. The original sample of sherds
provided to CAR was tagged and some tags
indicated that the sherds were preliminarily
categorized into prehistoric and Spanish Colonial
wares. In addition, some of the prehistoric wares
were classified as Leon Plain, Doss Redwares,
or unknown prehistoric. Thin-sections for
petrographic analysis were created from all 24
original sherds submitted. Table 7-1 provides the
original list of sherd samples.

(2) subsampling of sherds for petrographic
analysis;
(3) creation of petrographic thin-sections; and
(4) petrographic analysis and reporting.
The first task was to inspect the large
original sample, determine how many vessels
the sherd fragments represent, and within each
sherd cluster that represents a single vessel,
select a sufficiently large sherd that could be
used in the production of a petrographic slide.
Once the samples were identified, and prior to
their subdivision, the fragments were to undergo
macroscopic ceramic analysis.

Macroscopic Analysis

The goal of the macroscopic analysis was
to define the surface treatment attributes of the
vessels represented in the sample and also define
the technological attributes associated with
their manufacture. Specifically, we wanted to
characterize the steps taken by the prehistoric/
historic potters in manufacturing the vessel from
the clays used, the a-plastic (tempers) additives
in the raw clays, and the firing conditions
employed. All of these sherds are unglazed,
native made wares. This “macro” analysis

Methodology
For each of the 24 sherds, the following
attributes were examined and recorded: sherd
paste color (interior and exterior), visible
inclusions, inclusion size, paste texture (fine
or coarse), surface treatments (interior and
exterior), decoration (interior and exterior), size
measurements (length, width, and thickness),
sherd segment (i.e., body, base, or rim), orifice
diameter, vessel form, rim profile, rim form,

lip profile, lip form, lip decoration, and firing
atmosphere. The attributes were noted with the
naked eye and recorded in an Excel database.
Fresh breaks were made on sherds large enough
to be broken. On small sherds, paste color was
observed on the exterior and interior surfaces.

just before the vessel was allowed to dry. Rough
surfaces are characteristic of poor smoothing or
no smoothing at all. Also, rough surfaces may
be a result of the erosion of the sherd. Slipping
is similar to the floating technique, although the
main difference is that a floated surface is selfslipped, whereas a slipped surface usually utilizes
a different clay slurry. The use of a different clay
produces a distinct difference between the sherd
paste and the color of the surface. A brushed
surface exhibits strations that are likely the result
of using a brush-like tool to smooth the surface.
This process is done when the clay is still wet.

The recording of color was precipitated
by one of the author’s experiments with clay
sources from various locations, and the colors
that different clay formations fire. It appears
that distinct clays fire different colors, thereby
providing clues to the origins/formations of clays
employed in pottery manufacture. The inclusions
noted within the fabric were closely examined
to determine what was being used to temper the
clay prior to firing. Typically bone was found
within the sherd paste, but evidence of grog and
quartzite were noted in a couple of sherds. The
size of inclusions was noted as small, moderate
to large, and large. In addition to the inclusion
characteristics, the paste texture was recorded.
The texture was determined by observation and
feel. The speciemens either had coarse or fine
paste.

The sherds were examined to determine if
evidence of decoration was present. Typically,
decoration consists of the application of a
substance, such as asphaltum, to produce designs
on the surface of the vessel. Also, incising is
another technique used to apply decoration to the
vessel.
The length, width, and thickness of the
sherds were measured in millimeters using a
pair of digital calipers. In most analyses, the
ceramic assemblage is subject to minimum
measurement criteria for a sherd to be part of
the sample. However, due to the small nature of
the assemblage in this study, all 24 sherds were
included.

Surface treatments of the vessels were
recorded as smooth, polished, floated, rough,
slipped, or brushed. Both surfaces of the sherd’s
interior and exterior were examined, and the
characteristic recorded. A smooth surface was
one that was smooth to the touch, but did not
show signs of polishing that produced sheen.
Smoothing usually was done with the fingers
to produce an even surface. Polished surfaces
exhibited a slight to high gloss. These were
purposefully smoothed to an extent that is near
burnishing. Floated surfaces are a result of using
water or clay slurry and a polishing technique that
would bring the finer clay particles to the surface.
This action would mask most of the temper
particles and produce a thin layer that is evident
to the naked eye. This process was typically done

The sherd segment was recorded as base,
body, or rim during this analysis. The description
identified what part of the vessel that the sherd
originated. In this case, the majority of the sherds
were body, with only two sherds identified as a
rim fragments. Rim sherds typically provide
much more information than body sherds, but
due to the small sample size, all sherd types were
utilized in the analysis.
When analyzing rim sherds, the orifice
diameter is obtained by placing the rim of the
sherd on a concentric circle chart. The arc that it
93

lines up with will give the diameter of the opening
of the vessel. This is useful in determining the
vessel form. In addition to the orifice diameter,
rim sherds are examined for rim form, rim
profile, lip form, and lip decorations. The rim
form and rim profile are also helpful tools when
determining the vessel form. The orientation
of the rim profile aids in determining between
bowls and jars. Very little information was
gathered during the analysis of this assemblage
concerning rim and lip attributes, as there were
only two rim sherds in the collection.

unknown. The Doss Red Ware classification
originated in the 1940s. The type was described
as a native bone-tempered ware that appeared to
have a red slip. The majority of bone tempered
wares recovered from Central Texas prehistoric
sites, however, are usually identified as Leon
Plain wares. Doss Red ware is virtually identical
to Leon Plain except in coloration and surface
finish, which is almost always burnished/slipped/
polished. It has been recently suggested that what
is now recognized as Leon Plain may have begun
as Doss Red ware and simply weathered to a buff
or pale orange color. This may be the case, as
Doss Red wares occur less frequently than Leon
Plain, suggesting Leon Plain wares may be a
result of poor preservation, a problem endemic
to much of Central Texas. Both pottery types are
associated with the Toyah phase.

The firing atmospheres of the sherds were
recorded according to the color that the sherds
exhibited. A reduced atmosphere would produce
colors from black to light grey. The dark color
derives from the presence of organic carbon that
is retained within the fabric because the firing
temperature is not sufficiently high to burn off
the organic matter. An oxidizing atmosphere
produces sherds that have buff to red colors. It
is indicative of firing temperatures that were
sufficiently high to burn off the organic carbon
present in the clay fabric. It is important to note,
however, that in the typical open-air bonfire
type ceramic firing that is assumed to have
been conducted by prehistoric potters, fires
rarely reach high enough temperatures to fully
oxidize the vessel walls. Even within the same
vessel, some portions of the vessel may have
fully oxidized, while other, thicker portions that
were located away from the flames may retain
a reduced core. The firing atmosphere was
recorded for the interior, exterior, and core of the
presented sherds.

Goliad wares are defined by a study of a large
sample of sherds obtained in the 1950s from the
third location of Mission Espíritu Santo de Zuñiga
on the bank of the San Antonio River in Goliad.
This manifestation of the mission was occupied
between 1749 and 1830. It is further classified into
Goliad Plain, Goliad Red-on-buff, and Goliad
Black-on-buff. Goliad Plain is the dominant
type in most collections from the inland coastal
plains and San Antonio missions. While many
researchers argue that Goliad ware is a historic
descendent of prehistoric Leon Plain ware, there
is of yet no direct evidence linking the two types.
The two types are now primarily distinguished
on the basis of their archaeological context; when
found in Spanish Colonial missions, the wares are
identified as Goliad, while in apparent prehistoric
contexts, and often in association with Toyah
phase cultural materials, they are identified as
Leon Plain wares.

Results
Twenty-four sherds from 41HY165 were
examined. These sherds had been provisionally
classified into ceramic types prior to arriving
at CAR. Five sherds were labeled as Doss Red,
eight as Leon Plain, one as Goliad, and 10 as

Grog is ground-up pieces of
previously fired ceramics. The
grog particles are distinctive
because they have a bright brick red color within
the paste. A third sherd fabric contains quartzite
particles in addition to grog and bone. It is possible
that the quartzite was unintentionally added, but
its presence differs from the remainder of the
collection. The bone tempering in the fabrics
observed tended to consist of moderate and
moderate to large particles. This suggests that
when preparing the temper, the potters were not
overly concerned with producing
finely ground bone.

Paste Texture
The sherd paste textures were
split evenly between the fine and
coarse categories (Table 7-3).
Coarse-textured sherds primarily
contained large (n = 2) to moderate
to large (n = 8) inclusions. The
fine-textured sherds contained
mainly moderate-sized inclusions
(n = 11).

*The surfaces of a single sherd were heavily worn and surface treatment
could not be determined.

The surface treatments were
examined on both the interior
and the exterior of the sherds (Table 7-4). The
majority of the sherds had either smoothed or
burnished inner and outer surfaces (smoothed
n = 7, polished n = 8). Only five specimens had

a surface that appeared to be floated. Of these,
three had floated inner and outer surfaces, and
two had polished outer surfaces. It is possible,
however, that the wear erosion of the inner surface

may have removed any surface treatment present
there. One sherd exhibited a rough surface, and
only one sherd appeared to have both its interior
and exterior surfaces slipped.

(Tables 7-5 and 7-6). Specimens with reduced
interior and exterior surface are, however, nearly
as common (n = 9). Only two specimens have
oxidized exteriors and reduced interiors, and only
one has a reduced exterior but oxidized interior.

When examining the surface treatment in
relation to the paste texture, it appears that the
fine-pasted sherds were more often burnished
(n = 8) and smoothed (n = 3). Coarse-pasted sherds
tended to be smoothed (n = 4) or floated (n = 4).

Not surprisingly, given the bonfire-type firing
conditions for most of the sherds in this sample,
only 14 (58%) of the specimens have an oxidized
core. Experiments by the senior author indicate
that, depending on the thickness of the wares
and the amount of temper present in the fabric,
temperatures in excess of 900° C may be needed
for extended times to create a oxidized core on
ceramics measuring 6–7 mm in wall thickness.
The mean thickness of the sherds with oxidized
cores is 6.01 mm, while the mean thickness of the
sherds with reduced cores is 5.9 mm. However,
this mean is affected by the two fragments
tempered by bone and grog and also bone, grog,
and quartzite, which are each less than 4 mm
in thickness (3.32 and 3.42 mm, respectively).
Removing these two specimens results in a mean
of 6.2 mm for reduced core sherds. This pattern
does suggest that the oxidation of the sherds may
be affected by the thickness of the vessel wall.
In general, vessels with thicker walls have more
crumbly, easily eroded surfaces compared to
sherds from higher-fired vessels.

Decoration
Only one sherd exhibited evidence of
decoration, which was in the form of incising.
This sherd was recovered in Level 3 of Quad 6.
The decoration was noted on the exterior surface
of the sherd. The remaining sherds did not exhibit
any form of decoration.

Size Measurements
The average length of the sherds examined
was 18.75 mm. The length of the sherds ranged
from 9.2 mm to 31.7 mm. Fifteen of the sherds
are smaller than 20.0 mm in maximum length.
The average width of the assemblage was 14.2
mm. The minimum measurement was 7.7 mm,
and the maximum was 20.8 mm. The average
thickness of the sherds was 5.9 mm. The
minimum thickness recorded was 3.42 mm, and
the maximum recorded was 7.6 mm.

Half of the sample consists of specimens
with oxidized interior and exterior surfaces

Paste color also was recorded on sherds
because the color of the fired clay is in part
conditioned by the constituent elements present
within the clay, and this in turn may vary by clay

formation. Therefore, to gauge the number of
possible clay sources that may have been used to
fabricate the vessels present in the analysis, we
also recorded the color of the ceramic fabric as
exhibited on both surfaces and the core. Clearly,
fabric color was not useful on sherds with reduced
surfaces given their typically uniformly black or
dark gray surfaces.

represent measured 12 and 19 mm, respectively,
in mouth diameter.
The overlapping of the coils once built up
along the body of the vessel is typically done
through finger pressure. However, even once
the coils overlap they do not present a smooth
surface. The smoothing is accomplished using
a tool such as a smooth pebble that is pulled
tangentially across the horizontal coils to blend
them into each other more completely. Once this
blending is achieved, and the vessel is dried to a
leather-hard state, the same tool may be used to
burnish the surface of the vessel. This burnishing
smooths the surface of the fabric and provides
a sheen to the clay, which in part results from
fine particles of clay being concentrated onto the
surface of the fabric. When these fine particles
form a consistent and continuous surface on the
vessel wall, the surface is described as floated.
The typical horizontal rubbing of the fabric
through which this burnishing is accomplished
leaves track marks on the surface of the vessel
that are easily visible during the process and even
after firing.

Three general color groupings were noted
in the sherd samples analyzed. The majority
of the sherds had a reddish color. The senior
author has replicated the reddish color of vessels
using Navarro Formation clays from the upper
San Antonio River Basin. Navarro Formation
clays tempered with bone regularly produced a
reddish outer and inner surface under oxidized
firing conditions. Their cores typically remained
reduced, except in rare conditions when firing
temperatures were maintained above 900° C for
extended time. A second group of colors noted
in the archaeological specimens were light gray.
The author has not been able to reproduce this
fabric color in experimental firings using locally
available clays. Finally, the third color group,
exhibited by a smaller number of sherds, was
tan. This color was reminiscent of vessel colors
attained by firing Houston Black clay mixed with
the Navarro Formation clay. By itself, Houston
Black clay has a very high shrink rate that makes
it very difficult to construct vessels and have
them dry without cracking. However, the mixing
of Houston Black clay with Navarro Formation
clays reduces the shrinkage rate and results in a
fired clay color that is similar to the latter group
of clay colors noted in the ceramic sample.

In the senior author’s experience, such
burnishing has increased the rates of firing
failures because it impeded the escape of the
moisture through the ceramic fabric during firing,
often resulting in extensive pot-liding of the
vessel’s outer surface. To lessen this likelihood,
experimentally constructed vessels were allowed
to dry for up to six weeks, yet the same failures
recurred during the subsequent firing. How the
high rates of this failure were dealt with and
reduced by prehistoric potters is unclear.

As mentioned earlier, two sherds are rim
fragments. Both have everted rim profiles; one
has a rounded rim while the other has a flattened
rim form. They are 5.73 and 5.88 mm in wall
thickness, and it is estimated that the vessels they

Petrographic Analysis
The sherds were sent to the National
Petrographic Services in Houston, Texas, for the
creation of thin sections. The thin sections were
97

created following industry standard procedures.
A small piece of the sample was removed
and placed in blue-dyed epoxy and vacuum
impregnated. In most cases, the initial cut was
transverse to the plane of the sherd so that a slip
could be identified, if present. A slice of the cured
specimen was then removed and mounted on a
1 x 2-inch microscope slide and ground down to
0.03 mm in thickness. A permanent cover slip
was not used on the thin sections. A blue-dyed
epoxy was chosen over clear epoxy to allow for
easier identification of voids and bone.

point encountered in the crosshairs (Galehouse
1971:389–390). For the point counting sampling,
the microscope was set at 10x magnification
and the stage was set so that the vertical and
horizontal increments were both 0.4 mm. For
each point encountered in the crosshairs, the
point was identified as paste matrix, void, or
nonplastic inclusion. Paste matrix, voids, and all
nonplastic inclusions except bone were recorded
by tally. For all bone inclusions, estimated size,
based on ocular scale, bone color, and if space
was present around the bone were recorded. The
Petrographic Analysis Coding Sheet provides a
description and codes used for the point counting.
Nonplastic inclusions were only counted once,
even if they were encountered more than once
in the crosshairs; however, voids were counted
more than once if they were encountered more
than once on the horizontal transect, but not on
the vertical transect. The maximum size that the
ocular scale could record was 1.2 mm; therefore,
even if the bone inclusions were greater than 1.2
mm they were recorded as 1.2 mm. In addition
to the point counting, mineral/temper present but
not encountered in the crosshairs was noted.

The thin sections were examined with a Leica
petrographic microscope with a mechanical
stage attached. A two-stage process was used to
examine the thin sections. Given that a permanent
cover slip was not used on the thin sections, a drop
of distilled water and a temporary glass cover slip
was placed on the thin section to aid in viewing.
The first step involved recording the general
characteristics and taking photomicrographs
of the thin section. The general characteristics
recorded included paste matrix description, paste
color, b-fabric (Stoops 2003:95), estimated size
of quartz inclusions (based on Wentworth scale),
slip, and description of edges. The Petrographic
Analysis Coding Sheet (Appendix D) provides
a description and codes used for the general
characteristics. For the photomicrographs, at least
one set (plane light and cross-polar light) were
taken of each thin section at 4x magnification. At
least one additional set of photomicrographs were
taken of the edges, inclusions, or paste at 4x, 10x,
or 40x magnification for each thin section.

Although the goal was 300 points, 300 points
could only be reached on 54.17 percent of the thin
sections due to the size of the sherd piece. The
minimum number of points reached was 99 on
sample 253-a-15. Another problem encountered
with the point counting was that the quality of the
thin sections was generally poor. Several of the
thin sections had spots that were ground too thick
and/or inclusions had been plucked out, leaving a
clear void. The decision was made to only include
voids filled with the blue epoxy. Although it is
possible that a weak vacuum process could also
cause weak voids; however, given the overall
poor quality of the thin sections, clear voids were
skipped in order to not inflate the void percentage
on the thin section.

The second step involved point counting,
using the Glagolev-Chayes method. The GlagolevChayes method involves using the mechanical
stage, which allows one to move the thin section
at a given interval beneath the crosshairs in
the ocular, and identifying and recording each

Paste Groups

quartz ranged from 0.65 to 5.93 percent of the
total points. The quartz is uniformly fine silt size.
Calcium carbonate, calcite, shell and/or fossils are
common in all samples. This was the only paste
group in which secondary calcite on the bone was
found. Chert, chalcedony, and polycrystalline
quartz was not present in this group.

The petrographic analysis of the 24 sherds
identified six past groups based on the proportions
of constituent elements present in the paste fabric.

Paste Group 1: Light Sandy, CalciumRich Paste (n = 9)

Paste Group 2: Grog Temper—Caddoan

Nine specimens (38%) were classified as part
of this paste group (Thin Section Nos. 86-9, 229A 12, 315-18, 316-19, 339-20, 347-21, 381-22, 49223, and 493-24). The group is defined on the basis
of the percentage of bone, quartize, and calcium
carbonate inclusions. The amount of bone ranged
from 12.2 to 26.3 percent of the total points.
The mean bone size for this group is 0.37 mm
and ranged from 0.02 to 1.2 mm. The amount of

One sherd (4%) was classified into this paste
group (Thin Section No. 253-A 15). The primary
distinguishing characteristic of the paste group is
the presence of grog temper (8.08 percent of the
total points). The mean percentage of quartz is
17.04 of the total points counted, and ranges from
13.13 to 21.67 percent. The paste is in general a

118

fine, silty paste with numerous small muscovite
rods.

In this group the percentage of quartz ranged
from 3.88 to 4.39 percent. The quartz was
generally silt size. The paste was very dense with
few other mineral or lithic inclusions found. The
percentage of bone ranged from 10.08 to 23.41
percent. The size of the bone ranged from 0.04 to
1.2 mm, with a mean bone size of 0.29 mm.

Paste Group 3: Sandy Paste (n = 5);
(Sand 14–24%; Bone 5–20%)
Five specimens (21%) are part of this paste
group (Thin Section Nos. 18-5, 26-6, 62-B 8, 12210, and 235-14). The ceramic fabric contains both
bone and quartz aplastic inclusions. The mean
bone temper percentage is similar to Paste Group
1 (16.05%), as is the range (5.65–23.71%). The
size of the bone ranged from 0.04 to 1.2 mm, with
a mean bone size of 0.36 mm. However, what
sets this group apart from Paste Group 1 is the
high mean quartz percentage (17.29%) and range
(12.10–23.85%). The quartz was generally fine
sand size. Chert, feldspars, and muscovite were
common in all samples. Calcium components
were absent. All samples had an active, striated
b-fabric.

Paste Group 6: Sandy, Chert, and
Feldspar-Rich Paste—Unknown No
Bone
One specimen (4%) was included in this
paste group (Thin Section No. 253-B 16). In this
group, the amount of quartz ranged from 11.62 to
41.4 percent. The quartz was generally silt size.
The paste was very dense, with few other mineral
or lithic inclusions found. No bone temper was
noted in any of the thin sections.

Discussion
Macroscopic analyses of sherd samples
provide information that is complimentary to
fine-grained data obtained from petrographic
analysis. For instance, observations regarding
paste color, firing temperature, and metric data
on thickness have significant relationships to
clay sources, ceramic manufacture practices,
and vessel function. Petrographic analyses do not
address these aspects of pottery manufacture and
use.

Paste Group 4: Slightly Sandy, CalciumRich Paste (n = 6); (Sand 6–12%; Bone
6–12%)
Six sherds (25%) fall into this paste group
(Thin Section Nos. 10-A 1, 10-B 2, 11-A 3, 11-B 4,
62-A 7, and 229-B 13). In this group, the amount
of quartz ranged from 5.11 to 12.62 percent of the
total points. The quartz was generally silt size.
Calcite and/or calcium carbonate was common in
all samples. Shell and chert were also found in all
samples. The amount of bone ranged from 6.16 to
20.97 percent. The size of the bone ranged from
0.02 to 1.2 mm, with a mean bone size of 0.42
mm.

The analysis of sherd color coupled with
experimental work in ceramic manufacture
using locally available clay sources indicates
that Navarro Formation clays that are yellow in
color and rich in iron-oxides fire a brick red color
that easily replicates the Doss Red ware type.
A similar red surface effect can be achieved
by adding a slip made of the Navarro clay onto
a fabric made of another clay formation. Given
that the Doss Redware is defined primarily on the
basis of the color, and this color has been shown

Paste Group 5: Light Sandy, Dense
Paste—No Calcite (Sand 3–4.5%; Bone
10–23%)
Two sherds (8%) were classified as Paste
Group 5 (Thin Section Nos. 133-11 and 296-17).
119

to correlate with the iron content of the clay
employed, it may be necessary to more critically
evaluate the validity of the Doss Redware type.

chert. Quartz is present in six groups, but given
its size, it is likely indicative of its presence in the
parent clay rather than its purposeful inclusion as
temper. The Group 3 specimens have quartz that
is generally of fine sand size, suggesting perhaps
that the clay source is different from the others in
the sample. Group 1 and 4 specimens have similar
percentages of bone and also contain shell, but
the latter group has no chert in the fabric. This
difference between the two groups may be
indicative of different manufacture traditions
or more likely differences in clay sources. The
presence of grog in one of the sherd fragments
(Group 3) is likely indicative of a Caddoan vessel
fragment. Caddoan sherds often contain both
bone in small proportions as well as ground
sherd fragments as temper. Finally, three very
dense sherds stand out and are classified into
different groups based on the presence/absence
of bone within the fabric. The Group 5 specimens
have moderate amounts of bone temper, while
the Group 6 specimen is devoid of bone, and the
fabric contains moderate amounts of quartz. The
dense fabric is definitely suggestive of a very
different technological tradition from the other
four groups, and while it shares affinities with
the Group 6 sherd, it may be a technological or
idiosyncratic variant of this tradition.

Experimental ceramic production using local
clays has also shown that bonfires using mesquite
and/or oak can reach and maintain sufficiently
high temperatures (850–950° C) to vitrify the
clay body even when the vessel walls are 7–9 mm
thick, as are many of the bone-tempered wares
noted in this collection. Upon breakage, the cores
of these sherds do retain a dark reduced center
similar to the prehistoric and/or historic wares.
Only experimental vessels with wall thicknesses
measuring less than 5 mm in thickness could
be fired consistently in bonfires to result in
fully oxidized cores. The fact that some of the
sherds from the 41HY165 collection measured at
least 7 mm in thickness and had oxidized cores
indicates that prehistoric potters could produce
and maintain temperatures in the vicinity of 900°
C for sufficient time to fully oxidize the walls of
the vessels they constructed.
Vessel form, let alone function, could not
be defined from the small sherd fragments that
were the subject of this analysis. Nonetheless,
the breakdown of ceramic sherd thickness
suggests some variability in either construction
techniques or function. Four specimens range in
thickness from 3.42 to 4.53 mm, 11 specimens
fall between 5.08 to 6.27 mm, and the remaining
nine range from 6.96 to 7.64 mm in maximum
thickness. If vessel wall thickness correlates with
functional requirements of the pottery, the above
three groups suggest three distinct functional
groups or potentially, three distinct manufacture
traditions.

The comparison of the results of the
macroscopic analysis with the petrographic
work indicates major discrepancies in terms
of the identification of inclusions and temper
types. It is difficult to correctly identify temper
macroscopically, and when feasible, only the
larger inclusions can be identified with any degree
of certainty. Smaller inclusions such as shell
may be missed or misidentified as can be grog
and burned calcite, which are often a constituent
elements of the raw clays of the region. Therefore,
it is suggested that future macroscopic analyses
should exclude the identification of inclusions to

The six paste groups identified during
the petrographic analysis vary based on the
percentage of quartz and bone present in the
fabric as well as the presence/absence of shell and

and South-Central Texas specifically. A number
of intriguing sherd mineralogical groupings are
emerging from these analyses that appear to
correlate to manufacture traditions and/or clay
formations and procurement localities. These
new results may help establish or connect the
specimens analyzed here with other technological
traditions, and may relate the clays employed
in their manufacture to regionally specific clay
formations.

Finally, it is proposed that the fragments of
the samples from 41HY165 analyzed for this study
be submitted for Neutron Activation Analysis
to the Missouri University Research Reactor
(MURR). Since the receipt of these samples and
their analysis, a number of samples of ceramic
cherds and raw clays have been submitted to
and analyzed by MURR from the state of Texas

Historic Assemblage
By Carole A. Leezer

Historic Ceramics

end product of highly fired, refined clays with
vitreous glazes and wide-ranging decoration
styles (Stothert et al. 1992). This ceramic
classification is characterized as thin, hardfired, cream or pale yellow earthenware that was
dipped into a clear glaze following a preliminary
firing (Noël Hume 1969:125). Creamware glaze
is a thin, watery, glass-based compound applied
to ceramic vessels prior to firing. The glaze melts
during firing and provides an impervious glassy
layer with decorative qualities.

Analysis of historic ceramics is often based
on typologies established by the examination of
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century artifacts.
These typologies rely on ware classifications.
While these classifications are reflective of
the classification systems in use during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, they
are, however, not reflective of the classification
systems employed by individuals in the
nineteenth century. By the nineteenth century,
the success of the English ceramic industry
resulted in the reduction of the range of wares
available. Fine ware types such as tin-glazed
earthenware and white salt-glazed stoneware
were replaced with English white earthenware
(Miller 1980:3–4). Classification of this ware
by nineteenth-century manufactures and
consumers shifted to a reliance on decoration
type (Miller 1980).

The development of creamware is considered
to be the most important ceramic development
of the eighteenth century (Noël Hume 1969:123).
England’s conquest of the world ceramic market
was greatly enhanced by the production of
creamwares beginning in the late eighteenth
century (Miller 1980:4). By 1762, Josiah
Wedgewood had perfected its appearance (Noël
Hume 1969:124). It is from creamware that bluetinted pearlware evolved in the 1780s, then white
earthenwares in the 1830s, and finally ironstone
in the 1850s. Five sherds of creamware were
recovered during the 1996–1998 field school
excavations at 41HY165.

In total, 24 historic-era ceramic pieces were
examined for this project. Ceramic sherds were
classified into creamware (n = 5), undecorated
white earthenware (n = 12), decorated white
earthenware (n = 2), milk glass (n = 2), pearlware
(n = 1), and porcelain (n = 2). This classification
system was utilized as it appeared to be most
reflective of the classification system employed
by the users of these examined ceramic sherds.

Pearlware
Pearlware evolved from the development
of creamwares in the late eighteenth century.
Its development was influenced by a decline
in the demand for creamwares and the ability
of potters to incorporate Cornish china clays
into ceramic production. This allowed potters
to develop a ceramic product that was very

Creamware
Creamware is a hard paste/refined
earthenware. Hard-paste earthenwares are the
123

similar to high-end, hard-paste porcelain. The
success of pearlware was further enhanced by
the establishment of English tariffs against the
importation of porcelain; in 1799, the tax rate
on Chinese porcelain was over 100 percent.
Pearlware is distinguishable from its creamware
predecessor by the incorporation of a bluish tint
in the glaze that produced a whiter, porcelainlike appearance (Miller 1980:14). Only one sherd
was recovered from the 1996–1998 field school
excavations at 41HY165.

earthenwares, which were commonly known as
“Hotel China.”

Porcelain
Porcelain ceramics result from the high firing
of fine-grained clays containing the mineral
kaolin (Tennis 1997:15). These translucent,
vitrified ceramics were first developed by the
Chinese and later copied by Europeans and
Americans (Husfloen 2000:3). English porcelain
was first manufactured at Chelsea, England, by
Nicholas Sprimmons in 1744 (Mackay 2002:13–
14). Decorated porcelain is often relied upon as an
economic marker because it was more expensive
than similarly decorated white earthenwares
(Miller 1991:15). Only one sherd of plain,
undecorated porcelain was recovered during the
1996–1998 field school excavations of 41HY165.

White Earthenware
The majority of recovered historic ceramics
from the 1996–1998 field school excavations at
41HY165 are white earthenwares (n = 14); 12 are
undecorated, while two exhibit some type of
decoration. White earthenware was first produced
in England in the 1830s (Tennis 1997:2). When
placed next to creamware, it appears dull white
due to a lack of lead in the glaze (Moir 1987a:98).
White earthenware generally has a whiter paste
than its creamware predecessor (Moir 1987a:98),
and is often lighter and more porous than its
ironstone successor (Miller 1980:14). While
white earthenware most commonly appears
undecorated, it also occurs in molded forms and
with transfer prints (Moir 1987a:98).

Milk Glass
Two sherds of milk glass were recovered
during the 1996–1998 field school excavations
of 41HY165. While milk glass is considered
to be glass and not a ceramic, it is included
here as the two recovered sherds are clearly
dinnerware pieces, and dinnerware milk glass
is often confused with tableware ceramics to the
untrained eye.

Two of the recovered white earthenware
pieces exhibit decoration. One piece has portions
of two brown-colored, circular designs, while
the second has a brown band along its rim. The
former piece is currently unknown, but the latter
can be further classified as banded- or hotel ware.
Prior to 1900, English ceramics were considered
to be the finest available, with American products
considered to be second-class imitations. In
1898, the American Potters Guild was formed
to promote American-made tableware. By the
early 1900s, American potters became famous
for their sturdy and simply decorated vitreous

Milk glass originated in Venice, Italy, in the
sixteenth-century. At this time, it was produced
in various colors including yellow, brown, black,
pink, and blue. While some of these colors
still exist, the opaque, or milky color, remains
the most popular. Although originating in the
sixteenth century, the term “milk glass” was not
used until relatively recently. Milk glass became
very popular at the end of the nineteenth and
the beginning of the twentieth century. During
this time, the American Gilded Age, milk glass
was synonymous with prosperity and wealth.

124

However, this quickly changed, as milk glass
manufactured during the Depression (1930s) was
considered to be less elegant and delicate and
seen as a product of the harsh time. As a result,
milk glass manufactured during the 1930s and
1940s is considered to be of an inferior quality.

Table 8-1. Ingredients Added to Glass to
Produce Color (after Munsey 1970:37).

Historic Glass
In total, 798 pieces of historic-aged glass
were recovered from 41HY165. These pieces
were sorted into two major categories: shaped
glass and window glass. Shaped glass includes
all pieces of glass that can be attributed to bottles,
jars, and vessels.

brown are natural colors that were produced
during the early stages of glass manufacture
in the United States and Europe. Most bottles
produced prior to 1900 were aqua with varying
hues of green and blue. Glass color is dependent
upon the compounds present in the glass mixture
(Munsey 1970:37). Glass compound ingredients
and their resulting colors are present in Table 8-1.

Shaped Glass—Bottles, Jars, and Vessels
The most reliable method of identifying
historic bottle, jar, and vessel glass is by the
dating of maker’s marks. These marks provide
information on approximate date and place of
manufacture. In the absence of maker’s marks,
the manufacturing technique, labeling, and
the color of the glass can provide clues to the
approximate date of manufacture.

Up until the mid-nineteenth century, dark
glass, or black glass, was the preferred type of glass
container. This was based on the discovery that
wines and spirits kept better in darker containers.
By 1880, a demand for clear containers was
spurred by the development of food preservation
in glass containers (Munsey 1970:37). In answer
to this demand, American manufacturers began
adding manganese to their base glass mixtures
in 1880 to produce a colorless, clearer glass. This
manufacturing process continued until 1915,
when the German source of manganese was
cut off due to World War I. By 1916, American
glass manufactures shifted to selenium, which
was a more expensive decolorizing compound.
Selenium was eventually replaced by arsenic
around 1930 (Munsey 1970:55).

The shapes of bottles, jars, and vessels also
provide information on its inferred use and
possible contents. While the intended use of
bottles and jars are fairly evident, vessel glass
can be a little tricky. Vessel glass consists of
tableware glass associated with the consumption
of food and beverages and includes serving
dishes, drinking glasses, but it also consists
of decorative vessels such as vases (Jones and
Sullivan 1989:127).
Glass color is often relied upon to provide
approximate dates of manufacture and or use.
Glass bottles most commonly appear in varying
hues of green and aqua. Amber, olive green, and

125

Unknown to American glass manufacturers
at the time, the use of manganese and selenium in
glass compounds caused the glass to change color
when it was exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. Glass
that contains manganese turns an amethyst color
when exposed to sunlight, while glass containing
selenium turns a light amber color. How much
the glass changes color depends on the amounts
of manganese and selenium and how long the
glass is exposed to sunlight (Munsey 1970:55).

photochemical reactions. Too much light (natural
or artificial) causes beer to become “light struck,”
which results in a distinctive “skunky” off-flavor.
The amber-colored glass sherds collected during
excavations most likely represent beer bottles of
an indeterminate age.
Only 21 fragments of aqua glass were
collected. Aqua color in glass is a “natural”
result of the iron impurities found in most sands.
Aqua was a very common color in all types of
American-made bottles prior to the 1920s and
as far back as the early nineteenth century. No
specific type or class of bottles was made with
aqua glass, so this color type does not provide
much utility in determining vessel types. One of
the collected aqua glass fragments is of an old
Coke bottle and displays the familiar hobble-skirt
shape that is still used today. The first hobbleskirts bottles were patented on November 16,
1915, and came in a variety of colors that included
aqua.

Shaped Glass Recovered from 41HY165
In total, 427 fragments of bottle glass, 27
fragments of vessel glass, and 47 fragments of
unknown glass types were collected during
excavations at 41HY165. Of the collected shaped
glass fragments, 27 were of an olive or brown
(dark olive amber) color. These colors can be
found in a lot of different types of bottles from
different eras, however, were more commonly
used in the nineteenth century. Olive amber is
a very uncommon color in any type of bottle
after about 1890, and almost unknown after
about 1900. After 1900 it is primarily found in
wine/champagne bottles. Olive greens are very
uncommon after about 1900 in most all types of
American-made bottles except some liquor bottles
(e.g., scotch) and wine and champagne bottles
that still are made in olive colors (McKearin and
Wilson 1978; Wilson 1972; Zumwalt 1980). The
fragments therefore may be representative of the
oldest glass types recovered from the site.

Sixty-two fragments of green bottle glass
were collected. A wide variety of green colors
and shades of green can be found in just about
any type or age of bottle, resulting in a poor
diagnostic utility for this category of colors. The
collected green-colored shaped glass fragments
possessed no additional qualities, other than
their determination as bottles, that would provide
additional diagnostic clues. Very bright green is
almost exclusively a twentieth-century feature
and is not seen on bottles that date before this
period. The collected green bottle fragments
most likely represent green beer or soda bottles
from the twentieth century.

Of the total collected shaped glass fragments,
201 were of an amber color. Amber-colored
bottles were very common during both the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As such,
these fragment types provide little dating or
typing utility. Amber was and still is the most
common color for beer bottles. This glass color
provides the best light protection from the
light wavelengths that are responsible for most

Only one fragment of unknown red glass
was recovered. Red-colored glass is highly
uncommon, as true red glass is a result of the
use of oxide of gold (Hunter 1950). True redcolored bottle glass can be primarily dated to the
126

era between the 1840s and early 1880s; they are
rarely seen before or after this date range. The
collected red glass fragment is most likely from a
bottle dating between 1840 and 1880.

reliability for bottles with manganese dioxide.
Upon exposure to sunlight, glass with manganese
dioxide will turn a light pink or lavender to
moderately dark amethyst or purple color. As
manganese was used as an additive to glass prior
to 1915, solarized glass with this color-hue can
be dated to this period. Colorless glass bottles
were relatively uncommon prior to the 1870s
but became quite common after the widespread
use of automatic bottle machines in the mid- to
late 1910s (Fike 1987; Kendrick 1968; Toulouse
1969). The majority of clear glass fragments are
bottles, and noted among them is the bottom half
of a Dr. Pepper bottle. Dr. Pepper was created in
the 1880s by Charles Alderton of Waco, Texas,
and first served around 1885, and was nationally
marketed in the United States in 1904. The
collected bottle fragment is characterized by
embossed lettering stating “Good for Life” and
a clock featuring hands pointing to 10, 2, and 4
o’clock. The “Good for Life” slogan was one used
by the company during the 1940s. “Dr. Pepper
Time,” according to one promotion, was at 10, 2,
and 4 o’clock. During World War II, a syndicated
radio program, The 10-2-4 Ranch (later titled
10-2-4 Time), aired in the South and other areas
where Dr. Pepper was distributed. Based on the
bottle fragment’s characteristics, the bottle can
be generally dated to the 1940s–1950s (Wright
2006)

Only one fragment of white or “milk glass”
attributed to non-dinner ware was collected
during excavations (with the exception of those
classified under ceramic/table ware). Milk glass,
sometimes referred to as opal or white glass,
was typically produced by the addition of tin or
zinc oxide, fluorides (fluorspar), and phosphates
(Dillon 1958; Kendrick 1968). Milk glass was
used in the production of cosmetic and toiletry
bottles, but is most commonly seen in the form
of jar lid liners. John Mason patented the “Mason
Jar” in 1858. These glass jars had a zinc lid
with a rubber ring that effectively made the jar
airtight. One problem facing canners, however,
was keeping the food from touching the metal
lid, which would spoil the food’s taste. In 1859,
Mason sold his Mason Jar patent to Lewis R.
Boyd of the Sheet Metal Screw Company, who
invented milk glass liners for the metal lids.
The liners, when placed over the top of the glass
bottle before the lid was put on, formed a barrier
between the jar’s contents and the metal lid. The
collected milk glass fragment is a piece of one of
these jar lid liners.
A total of 181 clear-colored shaped glass
fragments were recovered during excavations at
41HY165. This color is the actually the absence
of any color. Colorless glass was a goal of glass
manufacturers for centuries, and was difficult to
produce because it required the use of virtually
impurity-free materials. It wasn’t until the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that
through the use of improved chemistry and glassmaking methods that colorless glass became
easier and much cheaper to produce. Colorless
glass has more utility in dating and typing than
most other colored glasses, with the best dating

Window Glass
While the measurement of window glass
collected from archaeological contexts has been
used in the past to provide valuable cultural and
architectural information (Moir 1987b, 1988),
the amount of window glass collected from
excavations at 41HY165 was determined not
to meet the criteria establish by Moir for this
type of artifact analysis. In total, 399 window
glass sherds were collected from four different
proveniences. Moir (1987b, 1988) contends

127

that window pane thickness increased during
the nineteenth century, and that important
information concerning house construction
can be derived from the study of window pane
thickness. He developed an equation that dates
the manufacture of window glass based on the
mean thickness in millimeters:

1987:15). Sand, water, oil, lard, or even soap
is then used as a lubricant to allow the molded
brick to slip free of its mold. Handmade bricks
require up to three weeks for drying, depending
upon the water content of the clay and the
weather and humidity levels (Gurcke 1987:26).
Bricks were predominately made by hand until
the late eighteenth century. By the mid-nineteen
century, bricks were increasingly being made via
machine, and by the beginning of the twentieth
century the entire process had been mechanized
(Gurcke 1987:84).

Manufacture date (±7 yrs) =
84.22 x (glass thickness in mm) + 1712.7
Moir asserts that this method would work best
for sites that were occupied for short durations
(Moir 1987b, 1988), providing information
on initial construction dates. As there was no
visible evidence of a historic structure that could
have been located at one time in the area of the
excavations associated with 41HY165, no effort
was put forth to date the window glass and thus
establish a date of initial construction. In total,
399 shards of window glass were collected
during the 1996–1998 field school excavations
at 41HY165. The window glass recovered from
the excavation at the site may be the result of
dumping window glass trash, and not from the
construction of a historic structure at the site.

Besides the brick fragments described above,
110 fragments of concrete were also collected
during excavations. Concrete is a versatile
building material composed of a mixture of sand,
gravel, crushed stone, or other coarse materials,
that are bound together with lime or cement.
This mixture undergoes a chemical reaction
and hardens when water is added. Concrete
was first introduced to the New World by the
Spanish in the first decades of the sixteenth
century (Gaudette and Slaton 2007). It did not
gain popularity in US building construction until
the late nineteenth century (Gaudette and Slaton
2007). Unfortunately, the collected concrete
fragments did not possess enough characteristic
to provide time-diagnostic information. The
collected samples most like date to the early
twentieth century, when this type of building
material gained greater popularity.

Historic Building Materials
In total, 228 artifacts classified as Building
Materials were collected during excavations
at 41HY165. This classification includes brick,
concrete, mortar, asphalt plaster, and wattle
and daub. The collected brick (n = 95) primarily
consisted of small fragments less than 1 cm
in size. While bricks are often overlooked by
archaeologists as a diagnostic artifact class, bricks
do possess several diagnostic characteristics.
Despite the small size of the recovered brick
fragments, 25 fragments were identified as
being manufactured by hand. Handmade bricks
are manufactured from clay with water content
between 20 and 30 percent. The clay is then
molded in a wooden or iron clad mold (Gurcke

In addition to the above-described building
materials, insignificant amounts of mortar,
asphalt, and plaster were collected. While the
recovery of these types of artifacts is usually
indicative of a structure, no foundation or other
types of building material (roofing shingles,
wooden clapboard, etc.) were collected. The
small amount of building material supports the
contention that a structure was once located in
this area. The collected material, therefore, may
128

be the result of a trash dump in modern or recent
historic times.

opening of the can top, which folds underneath
the top of the can and out of the way of the
resulting opening. Mountain Dew introduced a
“wide mouth” version of this stay-on-tab in the
late 1990s (Keen 1982).

Historic Metal
Bottle Caps

In total, 147 bottle caps (whole or fragments)
were collected during excavations at 41HY165.
Of these, two were identified as pull tabs, one as a
stay on tab, and one as a twist-off crown cap. As
the vast majority of the bottle caps were highly
eroded, determining additional twist of crown
caps was not possible. The collected bottle caps
most likely date to the early to mid-twentieth
century. The pull tabs can be dated to the 1960s,
and the stay-on-tab to the 1970s until present.

Bottle caps are a type of metal closure
originally designed to be pressed over and
around the top of a glass bottle, grabbing a small
flange on the bottleneck. They are usually made
of steel with plastic backing. The crown cork
was patented by William Painter on February 2,
1892 (U.S. Patent 468,258). Originally the cap
had 24 teeth and a cork seal with a paper backing
that would prevent contact between the contents
and the metal cap. The version that is currently
utilized has 21 teeth and a plastic backing. To
open these bottle tops, a bottle opener is generally
required; however, a “twist-off” version is also
currently used. The twist-off version is pressed
around screw threads instead of a flange located
on the bottleneck. This bottle cap can be taken
off by merely twisting the cap, eliminating the
need for an opener (Lief 1965).

Nails
Nails are used in the construction of
dwellings, buildings, barns, fences, and
outbuildings, and therefore, are often relied upon
in the interpretation of historic sites. They enter
the archaeological record through various means,
such as unintentional discard during construction
and reuse, discard resulting from loosening, and
intentional discard occurring during demolitions
(Jurney 1988). As part of the archaeological
record, they provide valuable information on
building chronology, dating of additions, and
changes and maintenance to structures. There are
three main classifications of nails: hand-wrought,
square-cut, and round (wire) nails (Nelson 1968).

In 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze of Dayton, Ohio,
invented an integral rivet pull tab opener for can
beverage containers. This pull tab opener, also
known as a ring pull, utilized an attached ring
at a rivet that was used for pulling, enabling a
portion of the can top to be completely removed
and discarded. He received U.S. Patent No.
3,349,949 for his design in 1963, and the design
was introduced on Iron City Beer cans. The
first soft drinks to be sold in all-aluminum
cans were RC Cola and Diet Rite Cola, made
by Royal Crown Cola in 1964. A stay-on-tab
was designed by Daniel F. Cudzik for Reynolds
Metals Co. aluminum cans in 1975. This design
reduced injures from open edge cans and reduced
litter from disposable pull-tabs. The redesigned
mechanism uses a lever to depress a scored

The only nails available in the United States
throughout the seventeenth and most of the
eighteenth century were hand-wrought nails;
however, they continued to be used into the
nineteenth century. The heads of hand-wrought
nails varied depending upon their intended use
with the rose-head the most commonly used
variety. L-headed nails were generally used as
flooring and trim nails, while T-headed nails,

129

Hardware—Wire

consisting of a flat disc head, were generally used
for flooring (Noël Hume 1969:252–254). Handwrought nails were in common use in the United
States until the 1880s. Square-cut nails were
introduced in the 1830s and gradually replaced
hand-wrought nails in popularity (Nelson 1968).
Square-cut nails were mass-produced cheaply,
and it soon became more cost effective to buy
these mass-produced nails in nearby centers of
commerce than to make them by hand.

Seven pieces of wire were collected during
excavations at 41HY165. Of these pieces, four
were classified as plain wire, while three were
classified as barbed wire. No single item has made
a greater impact on the history of the American
West than the invention and implementation of
the barbed wire. A man named Michael Kelly
is credited with the invention of barbed wire in
1868 (Clifton 1970); however, the idea of using
wire and barbed wire for fencing livestock had
been around for several years. In 1874, Joseph
Gliddens, an Illinois farmer, improved Kelly’s
invention creating a simple wire barb locked on
to a double-strand wire. This design was cheap,
easy to mass produce, and it soon spread across
the Plains, forever changing its landscape (Glover
1969; Hagemeir 2001). The identified barbed wire
appear to be of the hanging-bar variety (Clifton
1970:30).

The square-cut nail was an American
invention that was first produced around 1790.
These types of nails were sliced from sheet iron
by machine, and their heads were individually
shaped by the hand hammering. Square-cut nails
with hand-hammered heads were popular in the
United States between 1790 and 1825. By 1815
the heads of square-cut nails were also made by
machine. The machine-made headed squarecut nail eventually replaced the previous handhammer headed nail in popularity by 1825, and
the use of this type of nail continues to the present
(Nelson 1968).

Hardware—Builder’s Hardware
Three pieces of metal hardware were
collected during excavations. These pieces were
classified as builder’s hardware, and include a
door hinge, a door key/knob plate, and a cabinet
hinge.

A round-shafted, steel-wire nail was perfected
in Europe in the mid-nineteenth century. By the
1850s, round-wire nails were manufactured in
New York (Noël Hume 1969:252–254). While
manufacturing began in the early 1850s, roundwire nails did not become popular until the 1890s.
While the wire nail is the most popular type of
nail used today, square-cut nails continue to be
used for flooring, boat carpentry, and masonry
needs (Nelson 1968).

Munitions
While no firearm pieces were recovered
during excavations at 41HY165, a number of
munitions remains were recovered. Expended
firearm cartridges (metallic cartridge cases) are
common components of many post-1850s sites
and are very useful as temporal markers. The
self-contained metallic cartridge is a relatively
recent invention, having been perfected only
within the last 125 years. In total, 26 collected
metal pieces were classified as munitions. Of
these, three pieces were identified as .22-caliber
bullet tips, one piece was identified as a hand-

In total, 2,249 nails were collected during
excavations at 41HY165. Of these, 2,163 were
identified as round (wire) nails and 86 as square
nails. Of the collected square nails, only one
could be classified as hand wrought; 68 were
classified as machine-cut square nails, and 18
were classified as unknown square nail types.
130

wrought lead bullet, and four were identified as
16-gauge shotgun cartridge shells. Two of the
shotgun cartridges were identified as Winchester
Repeating No. 16 gauge shot, manufactured
between 1896 and 1938 (Logan 1959).

Of the six buttons recovered during
excavations, three were plastic, two were made of
shell, and one was made of bone. The nineteenth
century marked a technological change in the
manufacturing of buttons that allowed for the
inclusion of more varieties of materials, and more
variation of styles (Epstein and Safro 1991:76).
Shell buttons, which were once made by hand,
were now machine made. By 1870, synthetic
plastic and celluloid buttons were introduced,
replacing those manufactured with bone, ivory,
tortoiseshell, and marble (Epstein and Safro
1991:78). The rich and colorful buttons of the
eighteenth century were replaced by small glass
or jeweled buttons on men’s fashions. Buttons
for women, however, became more ostentatious,
resembling brooches and decorative jewels. These
button types were manufactured from porcelain,
pearls, and silver (Epstein and Safro 1991:80).
Most buttons, however, were of a utilitarian
nature. While the Sears Roebuck catalog for
1897 included two styles of fancy dress buttons,
most of their buttons were intended for practical
use. These included plain metal buttons for pant
flies and bone buttons for underwear, and plain
shell buttons that were sold by the gross (Israel
1968:319–320). The collected plastic buttons most
likely represent those used on either men’s or
women’s garments. The larger embossed creamcolored plastic button most likely was used on
a women’s outer garment. The collected small
bone button was most likely used on a women’s
undergarment. Shell buttons are non-iridescent
buttons manufactured from freshwater shells.
The freshwater pearl industry was introduced to
America by John Boepple, a German immigrant,
who discovered freshwater mussels near
Muscatine, Iowa. By 1890, high import taxes
forced reliance upon domestic sources of shell
buttons, and Iowa became the main producer,
with over 200 button factories emerging in the
state by the turn of the century. Shell buttons in
the United States were manufactured for use as

Household
Two metal items collected during excavations
were classified as Metal—Household. These
items were a large serving spoon and a straight
pin.

Tools
Three collected items were classified as
Metal—Tools. These pieces were a large metal
file and two fish hooks.

Other
Items that were collected and classified as
Metal-Other include pieces of aluminum foil,
which was introduced in 1947 (Panati 1987:113).
Four of the collected pieces appear to be foil
bottle cap liners. Objects identified as Scrap or
Unknown are artifacts that cannot be identified
as to type or function. Many of these artifacts
may be fragments of decomposed nails or other
metals.

Personal Items
Twenty-two objects were collected during
excavations of 41HY165 that were classified as
Personal Items. These items were further divided
into: buttons, clothing related, and other items.
Clothing-related items included one metal buckle
and metal grommets and snaps. Items designated
as other included an eyeglass ear stem, the
wooden handle of a steak knife, a simulated
wood grain plastic handle of a fishing spinning
reel, and a fragment of basket fiber.

131

Additional items collected but classified as
Other and not included within the Personal Item
classification included one piece of string, and 37
pieces of plastic that included fragments of fishing
line, vinyl, a whisky bottle cap, a sprinkler head,
a seal, and several unknown plastic types.

fasteners for shirts, underwear, and children’s
clothing (Pool 1987:283). The two shell buttons
collected during excavations at 41HY165 were
most likely used in this capacity. Several metal
grommets and snaps were also collected (n = 10),
and most likely represent items typically found
on work clothing.

Botanical and Microfossil Analysis
Editor’s Note

starch granules and phytoliths. Dr. Timothy E.
Riley conducted the analysis.

A single 1 x 1-m test unit (XU 3) was
excavated at 41HY165 in association with the
intensive archaeological survey and subsurface
testing investigations of the APE of the SLAERP
(Leezer et al. 2011). This test unit was excavated
in an attempt to identify intact, stratified, and/
or clearly definable cultural components. Data
from this test unit is used to develop detailed
information regarding the nature of deposits
in areas not previously subjected to extensive
excavation. XU 3 was excavated to a depth of
150 cmbs. A 5-gallon bucket of soil was collected
from each excavated level. The matrix was water
screened through nested ¼-inch and ⅛-inch
screens in order to recover fine-sized cultural
materials and faunal remains. A 4-liter bulk soil
sample was also collected from each unit level.
These samples were processed by flotation for the
recovery of small fauna, plant remains, and lithic
debris that would pass through the ⅛-inch screen.
These flotation samples were then turned over to
Kandace Hollenbach for botanical analysis.

Four of the burned rocks submitted for
analysis were from archaeological Zone 1/97.
This occupational zone was encountered across
Units 3 and 8 between 125 and 135 cmbs, and
four burned rocks were selected from this zone
for analysis by AEL. Two of the four rocks
contained starch granules, one from Unit 3 and
one from Unit 8. The rock from Unit 3 had
three starch granules, two of which resemble
geophytes, while the remaining one resembles
grass. The rock from Unit 8 had one granule
that is consistent with yucca. Two rocks were
also submitted from Unit 11, Level 7, and both of
these contained starch granules. Starch granules
from these rocks were consistent with Araceae
family plants, while three of the granules could
not be identified as to type.

Plant Remains from 41HY165, a
Prehistoric Site in Hays County,
Texas

Eighteen burned rock samples were submitted
to AEL at Texas A&M University to recover
and identify plant microfossil remains from the
surfaces of the rocks. These rocks were selected
from five features, Ringstaff’s archaeological
Zone 1/97, and a level in Unit 11 with dated bison
bone. All of the rocks were chosen from levels
that correspond to AUs. Out of the 18 samples,
only 12 contained plant microfossils that included

Introduction
The analysis of plant remains is one
avenue of research into a group’s foodways—
the procurement, production, preparation,
consumption, display, storage, and discard of
food. These practices vary by economic, social,
and political situation, and thus give us an

133

entry to study the cultural traditions of a group
(Johannessen 1993).

from the Late Paleoindian through the Historic
period.

This report details the analysis of carbonized
plant remains from site 41HY165, a Late
Paleoindian through Historic period site in
Hays County, Texas. The site is located below
the Balcones Escarpment, placing it in a prime
ecotonal position between the Edwards Plateau
to the west and the Blackland Prairies to the east.
The former is characterized by oak (Quercus
spp.) and juniper (Juniperus sp.) savannah with
an understory of grasses. The Blackland Prairie
is dominated by tall grass species, with oaks
and mesquite (Prosopis sp.) on uplands and
slopes, and denser forests of oak, pecan (Carya
illinoinensis), walnut (Juglans sp.), hackberry
(Celtis sp.), sumac (Rhus sp.), bald cypress
(Taxodium distichum), and cottonwood (Populus
sp.) in rich stream valleys (Ricklis and Collins
1994:33).

Over the three field seasons, 11 test units
were excavated, ranging in size from 1 m2 to
4 m2, and ranging in depth from 25 cm to 280
cmbs. The plant remains analyzed here derive
from XU 3 excavated adjacent to the previously
excavated field school test units. The samples
include a column of 4-liter flotation samples
collected from 15 levels of the unit, as well as
corresponding waterscreen samples from those
levels (Table 9-1; Appendix A).
Uncarbonized plant materials are unlikely
to be preserved outside of dry rock shelters and
caves in the relatively moist, acidic soils of eastcentral Texas, even from relatively recent historic
contexts (Reitz and Scarry 1985:10; Yarnell 1982).
Therefore, only carbonized plant remains are
considered here to be part of the archaeological
record, while uncarbonized plant materials are
generally assumed to be modern contaminants
that reflect the present-day local habitat. One
exception is hackberry, the stones of which can
be preserved without carbonization due to their
high calcium carbonate content (Wang et al.
1997).

Perhaps more importantly, 41HY165 is
situated on the shore of Spring Lake, and very
close to the intermittent drainage Sink Creek.
While Sink Creek may have been a seasonal
source of water in the past, the numerous springs
underlying present-day Spring Lake would
have supplied water from the Edwards Aquifer
year-round (Eckhardt 2010). The springs surely
contribute to the long sequence of occupation at
the site.

Methods
The flotation and waterscreen samples were
processed by CAS at Texas State in San Marcos.
Personnel from CAS sorted plant remains and
other materials from the samples, and the plant
remains were sent to the ARL at The University
of Tennessee, Knoxville, for analysis. CAS
personnel divided the flotation samples into
materials captured in nested ¼-inch and ⅛-inch
screens, and “light” fraction materials collected
in fine mesh. The waterscreen samples were
collected in ¼-inch and ⅛-inch mesh.

Previous investigations at Spring Lake, at
sites such as 41HY160, indicate a long sequence
of serial occupations associated with the springs,
beginning at least in Clovis times and extending
to Spanish contact (Jon C. Lohse, personal
communication 2011). Excavations at 41HY165,
performed by SWT field schools in the summers
of 1996, 1997, and 1998, yielded over 92,000
artifacts and similarly demonstrate periodic
occupation of the southern side of Spring Lake

Waterscreen Samples

Table 9-1. Botanical Samples Analyzed from Test Unit 3 at 41HY165.

The size-graded samples were weighed
and examined using a stereoscopic microscope
with 10–40x magnification. Shell, bone, lithics,
burnt clay, and plant remains were sorted from
the larger-sized samples (¼-inch and ⅛-inch
flotation and waterscreen samples). The light
fraction samples were first passed through nested
geologic sieves. Materials greater than 2.00 mm
were sorted into categories such as shell, bone,
and plant remains. Plant remains were further
identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level.
Materials less than 2.00 mm in size were scanned
for seeds and plant remains not represented in the
larger fraction. If present, acorn remains were
pulled from the 1.40-mm sieve to mitigate biases
against their preservation. All materials were
then counted and weighed, although shell was
only weighed. Plant identifications were made
with reference to Martin and Barkley’s (1961)
Seed Identification Manual and the PLANTS
Database (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service [USDA-

NRCS] 2011), as well as modern comparative
specimens housed at the ARL.

Results
The flotation and waterscreen samples from
the 15 unit levels yielded 0.81 g of carbonized
plant remains, only 0.18 g (22 percent) of which
is wood (see Table 9-1). The non-wood plant
materials include nuts, fruits, and miscellaneous
taxa (Table 9-2; see Appendix E for a listing of
plant taxa recovered from each sample).

Nuts
Nut taxa recovered from the samples include
acorn, hickory, pecan, and walnut (see Table 9-2).
None are represented by more than two definitive
fragments, but walnut significantly outweighs
the others, in part because of its robust nature. In
comparison, pecan is thinner shelled, and acorn
even thinner and more fragile. In general, acorn
shell is often underrepresented at archaeological
sites when compared with members of the Walnut

(Yarnell and Black 1985:97–98).

Service, Nutrient Data Laboratory [USDA-NDL]
2004), and were often crushed and boiled down to
make an oil or milk. The resulting liquid could be
drunk as a beverage or used in stews or porridges
(Carr 1895:171, 182–183; Kuhnlein and Turner
1991:209; Swanton 1946:265). Pecans have a
similar nutrient content, but are not likely to have
been crushed and boiled. They have much thinner
and less convoluted shells, making it much easier
to pick the nutmeats directly from the shell than
other species of hickory. In addition, pecans have
a thin, woody septum between the two halves of
the nutmeat that floats in water; fragments of this
bitter, woody septum would effectively spoil the
liquid (Scarry 2003:61). Similarly, walnuts cannot
be boiled and processed in bulk like hickory nuts
because the bitter outer hull remains attached to
the nutshell and spoils the liquid. Instead, walnut
meats must be picked by hand from the shells,
leading to higher processing costs that may have
discouraged greater use of these flavorful nuts
(Gardner 1997; Talalay et al. 1984).

Hickory nuts and acorns are routinely
recovered from sites in the Eastern Woodlands,
as both were important staples in the diets of
prehistoric peoples in the region (Gardner 1997;
Scarry 2003; Yarnell and Black 1985). Acorns
were used widely throughout North America
by prehistoric and historic native groups, as
various oak species enjoy a wide distribution
throughout the continent (Hammett 1997). The
range of hickories is more limited, however.
Central Texas is generally the western limit of
the geographical distribution of most hickories
(Hammett 1997:203; USDA-NCRS 2011), but it
lies in the heartland of the natural distribution
of pecans, which are generally limited to the
Mississippi Valley and its western tributaries
(Hall 2000:Figure 1). Central Texas is also
the western extent of black walnut (Juglans
nigra), but the eastern limit of little walnut (J.
microcarpa) and Arizona walnut (J. major)
(USDA-NCRS 2011).

In contrast to walnuts, hickory nuts, and
pecans, acorns are high in carbohydrates and
therefore served as a starchy component to the
diet (USDA-NDL 2004). They are also high in
tannins, which are often removed by leaching
with successive changes of boiling water.
After leaching the tannins, the nutmeats were
commonly ground into a meal and subsequently
made into a mash or bread (Carr 1895:172;
Densmore 1974:320; Kuhnlein and Turner
1991:200–2001; Palmer 1871:409–410).

All of the trees are masting, producing
significant quantities of nuts every two to
three years. The various nuts would have been
collected in autumn and could be stored and
eaten through winter, until fresh plant foods
became available again in spring. Because of
their high yields, nutritive qualities, and ready
storability, acorns, walnuts, pecans, and hickory
nuts were significant foodstuffs for foragers in
this region and the greater Eastern Woodlands
(Gardner 1997; Hall 2000; Hammett 1997:203–
205; Scarry 2003).

The collection of nuts requires few
implements other than baskets or bags to carry
loads back to camp, but may demand a significant
labor investment, particularly for groups whose
diets include considerable quantities of nuts. This
is certainly true for native groups in California,
for whom acorns were a staple food. “[A]ll
competent family members, male and female,

Despite their similarities, the various nuts
serve very different dietary roles and require
significantly different processing techniques.
Hickory nuts are high in fat and protein (U.S.

and adult and child” (Jackson 1991:303–304)
participated in collecting acorns, primarily to
harvest as many as possible before birds and
animals did. Hickories, pecans, and oaks tend
to grow in stands or groves, but walnuts grow
as solitary trees, making collection of large
quantities of walnuts more difficult (Scarry
2003:64).

interesting interpretative dilemma. Due to their
high calcium carbonate content (Wang et al.
1997), uncarbonized hackberry seeds may be
preserved in archaeological sites. However, the
trees produce significant numbers of fruits that, at
the end of the season, leave significant quantities
of seeds on the ground. Therefore, it is prudent
to consider uncarbonized hackberry seeds to
be modern inclusions. The four uncarbonized
specimens from the flotation samples and 25
from the waterscreen samples (see Appendix A)
are thus treated as modern contaminants.

Gatherers more likely brought collected
nuts back to camp instead of processing them
in the field. While field-processing would allow
gatherers to bring larger quantities of nutmeats
and lesser quantities of low-utility nutshell back
to camp, the time required to process nuts in the
field prohibits this (Metcalfe and Barlow 1992).
Bettinger and colleagues (1997) estimate that
gatherers would have to travel one-way distances
of roughly 50 km to make field-processing of
acorns worthwhile. Since oak, hickory, pecan,
and walnut trees are common in the plant
communities in the vicinity of 41HY165, the
occupants almost certainly would have processed
nuts at the site.

Carbonized hackberry seeds are another
matter. The five fragments recovered from
flotation samples and 12 from waterscreen samples
may have been carbonized by anthropogenic
efforts, rather than natural fires. Hackberry seeds
have also been recovered from other prehistoric
sites in Texas, such as the Vargas site in Edwards
County, the Lower Pecos rockshelters in
southwest Texas (Dering 2006), and the nearby
sites of Zatopec (41HY163; Hollenbach 2011a)
and 41HY160 (Hollenbach 2011b).

While all family members were enlisted to
collect nuts, ethnographic accounts indicate that
processing fell primarily to women (Jackson
1991). Therefore, features and implements used to
process nuts, such as roasting/parching features,
nutting stones, and mortars, were likely the
domain of women. To the extent that processing
stations were fixed loci on the landscape, clusters
of food-processing features and artifacts, as
well as stands of highly productive trees, likely
figured prominently in gatherer’s mental maps of
the landscape (Jackson 1991).

Although small, hackberries are good
sources of nutrients such as sugar and calcium
(Dering 2006). These small berries can be eaten
fresh (Niethammer 1974:72; Peterson 1977:194)
or pounded into a meal. This meal can then be
shaped into cakes and dried for use in the winter
(Niethammer 1974:72), used to flavor meat
(Kindscher 1987:242; Kurz 1997:74; Yanovsky
1936:19), or mixed with parched corn and fat
(Dering 2006; Yanovsky 1936:19).
Hackberries ripen in fall, but often persist
on trees through mid-winter (Kennedy 1990;
Krajicek and Williams 1990). The trees grow in
a variety of settings, but prefer alluvial soils and
disturbed grounds (Radford et al. 1964).

Fruits
Carbonized fruit remains recovered from the
samples are limited to hackberry seed fragments
(see Table 9-2). Hackberry seeds present an

Miscellaneous Taxa

and the lower levels often yielded no carbonized
plants (Table 9-3). This suggests that preservation
decreases to some degree with depth at the
site. However, recovery of plant remains from
general site contexts is often low, particularly
when compared with contexts such as features
and middens. The levels where carbonized plant
remains were recovered, namely Levels 1, 2, 3, 5,
7, 8, 9, 10, and 12, likely correspond to deposits
that reflect more frequent and/or more intensive
use of the site.

The few miscellaneous plant remains
recovered from the samples provide little
information. The one fragment of pitch, or
amorphous vitrified material, may represent
carbonized tree resin, or some other material
high in sugar or starches. The recovered wood
specimens all appear to be hardwoods, although
more detailed identifications were not attempted.

Comparison by Context
The vertical nature of the column samples
allows for some evaluation of possible changes
in plant deposition through time. The standard
volume collected for each flotation sample also
enables us to directly compare the raw data. A
brief review of the materials recovered by level
indicates that the majority of the carbonized
plant remains derive from the uppermost level,

Similarly, the recovery of uncarbonized
plant materials decreases with depth. This is
expected, as the upper humic layers generally
include greater quantities of organic debris, such
as leaf litter, twigs, etc. It is also interesting to
note that uncarbonized chinaberry was recovered
from flotation samples up to a depth of 20 cm

(Level 2), and from waterscreen samples up to 90
cmbs (Level 9). Chinaberry (Melia azedarach)
was introduced to the United States circa 1787
by Andre Michaux, who founded a botanical
garden in Charleston, South Carolina (Gardner
1986:F-3). The tree is very weedy in nature and
quickly naturalized throughout the southern
United States, but is also commonly used as an
ornamental (Bonner 2008; Radford et al. 1964).
Its recovery from the upper two levels of the
flotation column suggests the relatively recent
nature of the uncarbonized remains, and perhaps
the historic nature of the upper deposits. The
presence of chinaberry in deeper levels in the
waterscreen samples most likely simply reflect
the open nature of the test unit, into which
uncarbonized remains may accidentally fall
during the course of excavation.

of the site did not use herbaceous plants, bulbs,
tubers, and other fruits for economic and/or
medicinal purposes; evidence of their use simply
was not recovered from these samples.
Assemblages from other Archaic and Late
Prehistoric sites on the Edwards Plateau and
Central Texas do indicate the use of a range of
plant resources in addition to nuts and hackberries.
Early and Middle Archaic features at nearby
41HY160 similarly reflect use of acorns, hickory
nuts, and hackberries, but also bedstraw (Galium
sp.), cheno/am (Chenopodium/Amaranthus),
Grass family (Poaceae) seeds, and possibly grape
(Vitis sp.), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and
prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) (Hollenbach 2011b). In
addition to acorn, hickory, and hackberries, Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric contexts at 41HY163
yielded chenopod, purslane (Portulaca sp.),
verbena (Verbena sp.), Aster family (Asteraceae),
and Pink family (Caryophyllaceae) seeds, as
well as tentatively identified sumac (Rhus sp.),
Nightshade family (Solanaceae) seeds, and onion
(Allium sp.) bulbs (Hollenbach 2011a). At the
Britton site (41ML37), McMillan site (41ML162),
and Higginbotham site (41ML195), bulbs were
commonly identified from Late Archaic deposits
(3220–1200 BP), including camas (Camassia sp.)
bulbs. In addition, acorns, knotweed (Polygonum
sp.), pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), hawthorn
(Crataegus sp.), prickly pear, stretchberry
(Forestiera sp.), Grape family (Vitacaea),
Spurge family (Euphorbiacaea), Grass family,
and Mallow family (Malvaceae) seeds indicate
use of nuts, weedy plants with edible greens
and seeds, and wild fruits (Bush 2008). Late
Archaic deposits at the Mustang Branch (Bluff)
site (41HY209-M) included hickory nutshell, a
cheno-am seed, and a grape/peppervine (Vitis/
Ampelopsis) seed (Cummings 1994:393). Early
and Late Archaic contexts at the Wilson-Leonard
site (41WM235) yielded wild bulbs, including
wild hyacinth (Camassia scilloides), as well as

Discussion
The plant remains recovered from XU 3 at
41HY165 indicate that, among other activities, the
site’s occupants gathered and processed nuts, such
as acorns, hickory nuts, pecans, and walnuts, and
wild fruits such as hackberries. These foodstuffs
would have been gathered in fall; collection of
nuts in particular would have been an important
activity, as these dietary staples are also quickly
eaten by wildlife. Hackberries, however, often
persist on trees through early winter. These
resources can be readily stored and consumed
throughout the year.
The quantity and range of plant taxa in the
assemblage is relatively limited, with no smaller
seeds recovered from the samples. This low
recovery is not particularly surprising, however,
since the density of plant remains in general
site contexts is often relatively sparse when
compared with feature or midden contexts. The
lack of seeds, bulbs, and other fruit remains in the
assemblage does not suggest that the occupants

Creek site; and mesquite seeds and pods from the
Rush site and Varga site (41ED28), both of which
are located in the western portion of the plateau,
(Dering 2008:Table 9-3; Karbula et al. 2001:27–
28, 31–32).

Dering (2008) has compiled subsistence
data from several sites on the plateau dating to
the Austin (1250–750 BP) and Toyah (750–300
BP) phases of the Late Prehistoric period, and
notes that those in the northern and eastern
portions of the plateau seem to focus on baking
bulbs, roots, and tubers (Dering 2008:68). Large
numbers of wild onion bulbs were recovered at
the Kyle site (41HI1, n = 65), and onion/camas
bulbs were at the Camp Bowie sites (41BR250,
n = 91; and 41BR253, n = 110) (Dering 2008:Table
9-3; Karbula et al. 2001:27–28). In contrast,
assemblages from sites in the western portion
of the plateau regularly include agave leaves and
fibers (Agave spp.) (Dering 2008:68, Table 9-3).
Leaf stalks identified as sotol/yucca (Dasylirion/
Yucca), prickly pear pads and seeds, and hedgehog
cactus (Echinocereus sp.) are additional resources
prepared in earth ovens that have been recovered
from sites in the region (Dering 2008:62, Table
9-3; Karbula et al. 2001:27–28, 31–32). Gourd
roots were also apparently recovered from the
Kyle site (Karbula et al. 2001:27–28).

Seeds of weedy taxa with edible greens and
seeds, as well as medicinal properties, are also
recovered in low numbers at sites in the region.
These include sunflower (Heliathnus sp.), grass
(mostly Poaceae, and Muhlenbergia sp. at the
Kyle site), cheno-am, dock (Rumex sp.), purslane,
plantain (Plantago lanceolata), and dropseed
(Sporobolus sp.) (Dering 2008:Table 9-3; Karbula
et al. 2001:27–28, 31–32, B12-17). Also notable is
evidence for limited use of maize (Zea mays) at
the Kyle site, suggesting some level of agricultural
investment (Dering 2008:Table 9-3; Karbula et al.
2001:27–28).
The plant food remains recovered from
41HY165, limited to durable nutshell and fruit
seeds, are thus relatively narrow compared with
contemporaneous sites in the region. The lack of
smaller and more fragile taxa, such as seeds and
bulbs, likely reflects the nature of the samples
rather than lack of use at the site.

Acorns are also commonly recovered from
Late Prehistoric sites, including the Kyle site
(n = 49) and Honey Creek site (41MS32, n = 58)
(Dering 2008:Table 9-3; Karbula et al. 2001:27–
28, 31–32). Additional nut taxa include walnuts,
hickory nuts, and pecans (Dering 2008:Table
9-3; Karbula et al. 2001:27–28, 31–32). At the
Biesenbach site (41WN88), 254 hickory nutshell
fragments were recovered (Dering 2008:Table
9-3).

Conclusions
The plant assemblage recovered from
41HY165, while limited, provides some
information regarding the foodways of the
site’s occupants. These groups collected wild
food resources, including acorns, hickory nuts,
pecans, walnuts, and hackberries. Because of the
dietary importance of nuts, a highly storable and
nutrient-rich resource, it is likely that most of the
able-bodied members of the group participated in
their collection in autumn. The various nuts and
hackberries are easily stored for use throughout
the year. While evidence for other plant resources
was not recovered from the samples analyzed

Fruit taxa are notably scarce. Wild plum/
cherry (Prunus sp.) was recovered from the
Kyle and Biesenbach sites; grape from Mustang
Branch (41HY206); hackberry from the Kyle and
Rush sites (41TG346); hawthorn from the Honey

site used a variety of plants, including those with
edible greens, seeds, bulbs, tubers, and fruits,

during excavation of a prehistoric archaeological
site (41HY165), Hays County, Texas (Table 9-4).
Starch was recovered from 12 of the 18 FCR
samples submitted for analysis. Each sample
was examined for the presence of diagnostic
phytoliths as well as other microfossils such as
plant epidermal tissue. Phytoliths were rarely
encountered, occurring in only three samples.
This may be due to the preservational context of
the site. The recovery of abundant starch from
these FCR samples demonstrate a novel approach
to understanding past subsistence practices in
Central Texas.

Starch in Archaeology

The recovered starch grains are not identified to
taxa conclusively. Piperno et al. (2004) reported
the earliest evidence of grass seed processing.
They identified starch grains of barley (Hordeum
vulgare) and possibly wheat (Triticum sp.) from
an Upper Paleolithic groundstone found in Israel.

Starch granules have been observed in
archaeological contexts since the late 1970s
(Anderson 1980; Ugent et al. 1981, 1982, 1984),
but this line of evidence has only recently
become a major component of microbotanical
research (Fullager et al. 2006; Loy et al. 1992;
Torrence and Barton 2006). Starch analysis can
provide evidence of the use of plants as food
resources where macrobotanical remains are rare
or uninformative. In some cases, starch granules
have been found that predate other evidence of
domestication (Perry et al. 2007). Piperno and
Holst (1998) examined groundstones and found
maize (Zea mays), cassava (Manihot esculenta),
yam (Dioscorea sp.), and arrowroot (Maranta
arundinacea) starch grains from Central Panama,
providing evidence for the use of tuber crops
since 8000 BP. Loy et al. (1992) studied lithic
flakes from 28,000-year-old cave sediments on
the Solomon Islands and recovered starch grains
from them. Some of the granules were identified
as taro (Colocasia sp).

While Loy had some early publications on
starch recovered from North American artifacts,
only three recently published studies examines
starch recovered from North America (Boyd et
al. 2006; Messner 2008; Zarrillo and Kooyman
2006). The Zarrillo and Kooyman (2006) article
focuses on the recovery of maize and berry
starch on Late Prehistoric groundstone from
the northern Great Plains. In addition, there
have been a handful of studies done for contract
projects, mostly from the Southwest and Great
Basin (Cummings 1992 a–c, 1993 a–b, 1997 a–b).
Only two studies evaluating starch recovered
in Texas has been encountered in the current
literature review (Cummings 1993c; Perry 2008).
The paucity of publications on the recovery of
starch from North American archaeological
sites highlights some of the potential for this line
of research, as well as the dearth of qualified
researchers currently investigating starch with
a regional focus on North America. This is
surprising in light of the fact that much of the
continent has copious artifacts associated with
both incipient horticulture and hunter-gatherer
sites. As Piperno et al. (2004) state, the association
of macroscopic remains from economically
important plants with potential plant processing
tools such as grinding slabs, mortars, and pestles
is rarely evident. Starch analysis of groundstone
and cooking features provides direct evidence of
past human food processing.

To date, most starch research has focused on
tools and soils recovered from the tropics, with
very little focus on the potential of this line of
research in temperate climates (Fullagar and
Field 1997; Fullagar et al. 1996, 1998, 2006;
Horrocks et al. 2002, 2004; Horrocks and Lawlor
2006; Horrocks and Nunn 2007; Horrocks and
Weisler 2006; Irwin et al. 2004; Lentfer et al.
2002; Pearsall et al. 2004; Perry 2004, 2005;
Perry et al. 2007; Piperno 1998; Piperno and
Holst 1998; Piperno et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2001).
A handful of temperate Old World sites have
been investigated. Shibutani (2008) studied anvil
stones, grinding slab, and grinding stones from
four archaeological sites in southern part of Japan,
dating from Japanese Paleolithic to incipient
Jomon period. She recovered intact and damaged
starch grains from grinding surfaces of the tools.

To date, there has been very little research
on the recovery of starch from known cooking
features in the archaeological record. Recent

143

Materials and Methods

experimental studies have shown that earth oven
cookery results in the dispersal of starch granules
and other microfossils throughout the oven
feature, depositing residue related to the cooked
foodstuffs and packing material used in the oven
on many of the rocks used as heating elements
(Messner and Schindler 2010).

All 18 FCR samples in this study were
processed in AEL, Department of Anthropology,
Texas A&M University. Each sample was
subjected to a two-part brushing procedure
to minimize the potential for modern starch
contamination. After initial examination of a
sample, a 3 x 3-cm area was selected for sampling.
This subsampling method was designed to reserve
as much of the artifact as possible for future
corroborative studies while yielding enough
microfossil residue for the current study. This
area was sprayed with a dilute (10%) solution of
HCl to dissolve any calcium carbonate buildup.
Following this, the sampling area was brushed
and washed into a collection beaker until the
water was visibly clear. The same area was then
brushed again with a sonicating brush (Phillips
Sonicare E Series), and the resultant residue was
washed into a second collection beaker. While
this method undoubtedly removes some potential
microfossil residue that is directly associated
with the use of the earth oven feature, it is an
important step in limiting the mis-interpretation
of the feature based on microfossil evidence that
postdates the use of the feature. This removal
of potential contaminants allows for a much
more secure interpretation of the second residue
sample, which contains only those microfossils
that required sonication to remove.

Ecological Background
Hays County is located in the Balcones
Canyonlands (Ecoregion 30c) near the ecotonal
boundary with the Blackland Prairie (Ecoregion
32) (Griffith et al. 2004). The Balcones
Canyonlands from a physiographic barrier
between the mesic prairie to the east and the xeric
woodland to the west (Griffith et al. 2004). This
ecoregion is part of the larger Edwards Plateau
ecoregion, which is primarily distinguished
from the surrounding regions by a distinctive
mollisol soil order. The vegetation of the region
is characterized by oak-juniper savanna and
mesquite-Acacia savanna. A number of known
ethnographic food resources are available within
this ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004).
The Blackland Prairie is a tall grass prairie
characterized by high plant community diversity,
due in part to the variety in soil texture and
pH associated with the different soil orders
represented within this ecoregion (Diamond et
al. 1987; Diamond and Smeins 1985). Despite
the diversity within this prairie, the region can
be characterized by a general pattern of tall grass
prairie on the uplands with riverine woodlands and
forest across much of the bottomland (Diamond
and Smeins 1993). This characterization of the
modern vegetation provides a known set of wild
food resources that would have been accessible to
the site’s prehistoric inhabitants.

The resultant residue samples were
transferred to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and placed
in a 5 percent Calgon solution for six hours.
Following this treatment, each sample was
washed in water several times. The samples
were then placed in a heavy density solution of
ZnBr at a specific gravity of 2.38. After thorough
mixing, the samples were centrifuged for five
minutes at low speed, followed by five minutes
at high speed. The light fraction resulting from
this was pipetted off, and the procedure repeated.

144

Following this step, the light fraction was washed
several times in water and transferred to a dram
vial for storage. The heavy fraction was examined
microscopically to determine that all starch
granules and phytoliths had been recovered in
the light fraction. The heavy fractions consisted
primarily of weathered minerals, and no
microfossils were observed in any of the heavy
fractions. Following this extraction procedure, a
slide was made of the light fraction residue from
each sample. This slide was examined under
brightfield and cross-polarized light for starch
granules and phytoliths.

and Atwell 1999). Since then, many researchers
have shown that starch granules can be
microscopically associated with botanical source
material based on distinguishing morphological
characteristics, the most important being shape
and size (Badenhuizen 1965; Cortella and
Pochettino 1994; Czaja 1978; Evers 1979; Moss
1976; Reichert 1913). This section provides an
overview of some of the techniques used in the
light microscopy of starch. Many of the diagnostic
features of starch used by paleoethnobotanists,
such as differences in the lamellae and hilum
location, have been observed and described under
brightfield light. Transmitted brightfield light can
be used to observe starch granules, but it can be
very difficult to observe the features necessary to
distinguish individual differences between starch
grains (Barton and Fullagar 2006). Additionally,
because starch grains generally exhibit very low
contrast in most mounting media, it can be very
difficult to observe granules from an unknown
specimen with other microscopic components.
For these reasons, much of the initial microscopy
used to identify the presence of starch in an
archaeological sample relies on polarized light
microscopy.

Starch Reference Collection
Archaeological starch research has seen
little application to hunter-gatherer sites in North
America (Messner 2008; Zarrillo and Kooyman
2006). This is partly due to the need for a reference
collection of major potential food resources for
each region. The development of this collection
is hindered by the rare recovery of geophytes
and small seeds from the archaeological record,
as well as the imprecision of the observations
available in the the ethnohistoric record (Thoms
2008). This section presents an overview of the
starch reference collection developed over the
course of this research following a brief review
of the microscopic methods useful in starch grain
analysis.

All undamaged starch grains have a high
degree of molecular orientation (Evers 1979). This
structured organization of the granule results in a
characteristic birefringence pattern when starch
is viewed in cross-polarized light (Thomas and
Atwell 1999). This uniaxial birefringent pattern
is known variously as an extinction cross or a
maltese cross (Barton and Fullagar 2006; Weaver
2003). Birefringence is a complex optical property
of many ordered compounds. Light entering the
specimen is split into two components which are
plane polarized perpendicular to each other. The
refractive index of a birefringent specimen varies
with the direction of passage, causing one of the
components to be retarded relative to the other

The identification of starch granules
recovered from archaeological contexts has
become one of the more important components
of recent paleoethnobotanical studies over the
last decade (see Torrence and Barton [2006] for
an recent overview). While this is a relatively
new subfield in archaeology, starch microscopy
has long had a place in food science (Flint 1994)
and botany (Cortella and Pochettino 1994). Starch
was first observed and identified microscopically
in 1719 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (Thomas

component. This optical path difference creates
either constructive or destructive interference
when the two component waves recombine
after leaving the specimen. When the resultant
recombined light passes through a second
polarizing filter (the analyzer) set at a right angle
to the original polarizing filter, any light that has
not passed through a birefringent compound will
be prevented from passing the analyzer. This
microscopic method is very useful for the initial
investigation of unknown samples since starch
grains are readily visible and relatively distinct
from other birefringent biological compounds
(Canti 1997, 1998, 1999; Haslam 2006; Loy
2006).

and splitting along the margins of the granule, 3)
abrasions, and 4) a partial loss of granule structure
resulting in a “ghost” granule (Williams 1968).
The current study utilized cross-polarized
light microscopy for the initial identification of
starch granules in the FCR specimens. Granules
identified as starch were further examined under
brightfield light to detect features important for
botanical source identification.
Reference starch granules were examined
for a total of 18 plant taxa known or suspected
to be food resources for Texas hunter-gatherer
populations. These resources include grass seeds
and geophytes. Table 9-5 presents summary data
for the starch granules for these resources. Figures
9-1 through 9-3 provide micrographs of the starch
granules encountered in each taxa examined.
Recovered starch granules were also compared
to the botanical resources presented in Messner
(2008) and Reichert (1913), with particular
emphasis on those resources identified in Thoms
(2008), including arrow-root (Sagittaria sp.),
cattail (Typha sp.), ground nut (Apios americana),
and water-chinquapin (Nelumbo lutea).

While the extinction cross does provide
some distinguishing features and is useful for
the initial indication of starch ubiquity, many
of the attributes used to differentiate between
starch types are obscured in polarized light
microscopy. This method may also not detect
damaged or gelatinized starch grains, which lose
birefringence as the molecular order of native
starch is disrupted (Evers 1979). Starch grains
with very high amylopectin content may also
not exhibit birefringent optical properties (Evers
1979).

Results
Starch granules were encountered in the
discrete sonicated subsample from 12 of the 18
FCR samples submitted for analysis. The metric
data for these granules is presented in Table 9-6.
Due to the limited processing of each sample
necessary to ensure starch recovery, the slides of
these samples contained a great deal of organic
and mineral detritus that was not identifiable.
This did not limit the identification of starch
granules in the samples. The remainder of this
section will present the starch data by feature.
This will be followed by a brief section focused
on the phytolith and other plant microfossils
recovered from these samples.

Under traditional food preparation methods,
starch grain structure can be modified by
mechanical damage from grinding and milling
techniques or gelatinized through wet cooking
methods (Babot 2003). Freezing, dehydration,
roasting, and charring can also cause damage
to starch granules that alters diagnostic features
necessary for the identification of native starch
granules (Babot 2003). Starch grains recovered
in coprolites or latrines may also exhibit
enzymatic damage from partial digestion (Autio
2001; Evers 1979). Mechanical damage can result
in four different types of modification: 1) radial
cracking associated with the hilum, 2) chipping

packing material in the oven.

All three samples taken from FCR specimens
associated with this feature contained starch.
Three separate starch morphotypes were
encountered in the samples (see Table 9-6).
Sample 69-13 contained a single starch grain.
This type (Figure 9-4A) appears similar to
references collected from Hordeum sp., a genus
in the grass family that includes little barley
(Hordeum pusillum) and other perennial and
annual grasses. It seems likely that this starch

The sample taken from specimen 74-7
contained two different starch granules, each
a different morphotype. The first granule is
consistent with reference starch from knotweed

border and overall gross morphology. The other

damage (Figure 9-5D). This specimen also
exhibits a partial loss of birefringence that limits
identification. A large cluster of starch was
encountered in the sample from Specimen 74-8
(see Figure 9-4B). This cluster is also consistent
with reference starch from a Polygonum sp. fruit.

morphotype, Unknown D (see Figure 9-5D), does
not appear to be similar to any reference starch
known at this point. While it has some similarities
with starch granules recovered from mesquite
(Prosopis sp.) seedpods, such as the longitudinal
fissures and wavy crossarms (Giovannetti et al.
2008), the presence of several large facets on each
granule and the overall angularity of the granules
suggest a different, currently unknown botanical
source. This is most likely a geophyte based on
the size, shape, and birefringence characteristics
of the granules.

Feature 2-96
One of the two samples of FCR specimens
from this feature contained starch (see Table 9-6).
The sample from Specimen 79-14 contained two
starch granules of the same morphotype. This

rhizomes of plants in the family Araceae,
specifically arum (Arum sp.) and arrow arum
(Peltandra sp.) (Messner 2008; Reichert 1913).
The starch granule from Specimen 134-11 also
fits this morphotype.

Three of the four samples from FCR
specimens associated with this feature
contained starch granules (see Table 9-6). Three
different morphotypes were recovered from the
specimens associated with this feature. A single
granule, consistent with yucca (Yucca sp.), was
encountered in the sample from Specimen 12329 (see Figure 9-4C). This granule is partially
obscured by detritus. Specimen 134-10 contained
an abundance of starch from two morphotypes.
The majority of these granules (13) are classed
as Unknown D, described above for Feature
2-96. The remaining two granules from this
specimen are similar to granules observed in the

different morphotypes of starch. Two of the types

with a taxonomically distinct reference. The
ovoid form exhibited by the granule in Figure
9-6C is fairly common in a variety of geophytes

(Reichert 1913), but this particular specimen
does not have any taxonomically distinct
features, perhaps due to the damage. The final
granule recovered from this specimen is a small,
rectangular to subangular form designated
Unknown A. This granule appears similar to the
starch encountered in a variety of grasses, but
has a conspicuous vacuole over the hilum. One
granule was recovered from the sample taken
from Specimen 310-24. The granule has some
damage associated with the hilum. The overall
morphology of the granule is consistent with
starch from yucca.

sample from Specimen 256-23 contained a total
of five starch granules. Four of these granules are
of a similar type, designated Unknown B (see
Figure 9-5B). This type is a subangular spherical
shape with radial fissures emanating from the
open hilum. The remaining granule observed
in this sample is an ovoid shape with several
visible lamellae seen in Figure 9-5C. The small
size precludes any secure identification, but the
general morphology is consistent with a number
of known geophytes (Reichert 1913).

specimens associated with this level contained

grasses (Sporobolus sp.). The bilobate or dumbbell
shape is associated with the Panicoideae grasses,
including panic grass (Panicum sp.) as well as big
bluestem (Andropogon sp.) (Twiss et al. 1969).
The remaining elongate form is common across
all the subfamilies. A saddle-shaped phytolith
was also encountered in sample 256-23 (Feature
2-97), and a bilobate shaped phytolith was present
in sample 299-27 (Feature 9-97). It is probable
that these grass phytoliths are remnants of the
packing material used in the construction and
use of these cooking features rather than a direct
indicator of the subsistence resources prepared in
these ovens.

Phytolith and Other Microfossil Recovery
Six phytoliths were encountered in the 18
samples analyzed in this study (Figure 9-7).
Three phytoliths were encountered in sample
134-10 (Feature 3a/96-6/97). All three are
phytolith shapes associated with the grass family
(Poaceae). Interestingly, at least two of the forms
are associated with different subfamilies within
the family. The saddle shape is associated with the
Chloridoideae grasses, which includes dropseed

bilobate shape; B) elongate shape; C) saddle shape; D) calcium oxalate stylus.

155

The remaining phytolith is a calcium oxalate
crystal rather than a silicified plant cell. This
stylus shape is common in Yucca sp., Dasylirion
sp., and Agave sp., but is also encountered in
other botanical resources as well. While it is
non-diagnostic, the association of this crystal
with a probable Yucca sp. starch granule in the
same sample (123-29 [Feature 3a/96-6/97])
suggests that the stylus is most likely from the
same botanical source. Arrow arum rhizome also

contains abundant calcium oxalate crystals,
though only raphide and druse shapes are
reported for the Araceae family in the literature
(Keating 2004; Prychid and Rudall 1999).
Other plant microfossils were encountered
in this study as well (Figure 9-8). Fibers were
relatively common in some of the samples, but were
not documented or recorded, as individual fiber
ultimates have little diagnostic use from such a

context. Several other plant tissues were also
encountered, including unknown parenchymous
tissue in sample 69-13 (Feature 7-96) and two
different types of plant epidermal tissue. Sample
74-8 (Feature 7-96) contained a piece of plant
epidermal tissue consistent with Yucca sp.
(Sobolik 1992). While the lack of visible stomata
on the fragment precludes any strong statement of
identification, this association of yucca as either a
food resource or packing material for the region is
corroborated by the starch granule and phytolith
recovered from sample 123-29. The remaining
epidermal fragment, encountered in sample 7915 (Feature 2-96) remains unidentified.

of yucca in these cooking features is supported
by the presence of a calcium oxalate stylus and
epidermal tissue consistent with yucca.
The other identifiable starch granules
both occur in Feature 7-96 and are most likely
associated with packing material. One large
granule consistent with reference starch from
Hordeum sp. was encountered. As this starch is
associated with a grass seedhead, there is little
reason to infer the purposeful roasting of this
resource, although it is possible that the granule
is associated with stone boiling. Grass phytoliths
were also recovered in small quantities from
several other features, indicating that grass stems
were a common packing material. Approximately
20 granules consistent with a Polygonum sp. fruit
were also recovered from two different FCR
specimens in this feature. Again, this is likely
to be from the use of this botanical resource as
a packing material, although it could also be
associated with stone boiling. Analysis of feature
form and function could inform on this (Black et
al. 1997)

Discussion
Approximately 57 starch granules from at
least eleven distinct starch morphotypes were
recovered from the FCR specimens submitted for
analysis from 41HY165. While several of these are
from unknown botanical sources, the remaining
granules are from a variety of botanical sources
reflecting both the food resources and packing
materials associated with cooking features.
Eleven of the granules exhibited damage
consistent with gelatinization (Table 2). Many
of these were damaged enough that a reliable
identification could not be made. Several of the
FCR samples contained starch granules consistent
with geophytes in the Araceae family. The most
likely source is arrow arum (Peltandra sp.), an
important ethnographic food resource in the
Eastern Woodlands (Messner 2008). While
there is no historic record of this resource
being consumed in Texas, at least one species,
Peltandra virginica, does occur in the state.
There are also several granules morphologically
consistent with the starch encountered in Yucca
sp. throughout the assemblage. This could either
be from the roasting of yucca flower stalks as a
food resource or possibly the use of yucca leaves
as a packing material during roasting. The use

Four unknown morphotypes were also
encountered in this analysis. Unknown A is most
likely from a grass seedhead or other small, hard
fruit. Unknown B could be from either a geophyte
or seed/fruit source, although the radial fissures,
size, and angularity are more suggestive of a
geophyte. Unknown C is a form that is similar
to small starch granules in many geophytes. The
thick lamellae and open hilum may be diagnostic,
but this granule has not been encountered in
reference samples. The final Unknown, D, was
the most common starch granule encountered
in this study. It has some similarities with a
mesquite starch type in Giovannetti et al. (2008),
but the large facets and overall angularity limit a

granules recovered from archaeological contexts.
Expanding this beyond the ethnographic and
ethnohistoric record to encapsulate all potential
geophytes in Central Texas may be necessary.

Clearly there are still large gaps in the
current understanding of prehistoric subsistence
strategies in Central Texas and surrounding
ecoregions. While this study shows the utility
and promise of FCR starch residues, the limited
ethnohistoric and archaeological understanding
of the comprehensive subsistence resource
universe exploited by the human populations
in this region severely limits the interpretation
of this data. A more rigorous examination of
ethnographically known subsistence resources
across the region would further develop the
known starch references and allow for more
secure interpretation of unknown starch

Very few starch granules were encountered
on most of the FCR samples examined in this
study. This is primarily due to the minimal
sampling technique employed, which leaves a
bulk of the sample’s microscopic residue intact
for further studies. In addition to limiting the
overall quantity of starch granules recovered
from each sample, this technique may also limit
the number of types of starch recovered on any
one sample. This could be avoided by a more
complete sampling strategy on each artifact,
but this in turn would limit the replicability
of this study, as well as any attempts at future
biochemical residue studies.

Burned Rock Technology
By John A. Campbell

Burned Rock

each AU. The standardized frequency for burned
rock weight is calculated by first dividing the
recorded frequency (FR) of burned rock weight
by the duration of the AU (T). This value is then
divided by the total volume (V) of the excavated
areas within the AU. Finally, the result is then
multiplied by 100 to provide a standardized
frequency of burned rock in grams (FS) for every
100 years. This application can be expressed in
the following equation:

In total, 6,754 burned rocks and fragments
weighing 316.52 kg were collected during the
1996, 1997, and 1998 field school seasons. Of
this rock, the vast majority consists of limestone
cobbles; however, fragments of burned chert and
burned fossils also occur. The majority of the
burned rock was collected from features identified
during the excavations at the site. Unfortunately,
the provenience of the rock collected from feature
contexts is not included on all bags or in previous
inventories from the field school. As such, the
data are not wholly reliable for ascertaining
the mass of burned rock occurring by feature.
Therefore, estimates on burned rock mass in
feature contexts were derived by correlating the
depth indicated on the field bags with the depth
the features occurred; the depth indicated by the
level from which it was collected. Additionally,
due to the fragmentary nature of burned rock, the
count of burned rocks is not entirely useful and
so only weights of the rocks were used during the
analysis.

FS = ((FR/T)/V) × 100
To apply this formula, the total weight of
burned rock from each AU was determined
from the artifact catalog. The burned rock
weights from quadrants adjacent to AUs and at
the same elevation were also included. Features
were not accounted for in these calculations. The
resulting distribution of standardized frequencies
is provided below in Table 10-1. Figure 10-1
shows the distribution of both the normal and
standardized frequencies for each AU, which
demonstrates the problems with using nonstandardized frequencies in cross comparisons.
Figure 10-2 provides a line graph of the
distribution of the standardized frequencies, also
showing peaks in the Late Archaic II (AU 4a) and
the Toyah phase (AU 3a). However, in contrast to
the normal weight frequencies, the standardized
frequencies show that the Toyah phase has a
much larger increase in burned rock in relation
to the other AUs. The Austin phase (AU 3b) has
the lowest amount of burned rock of all the AUs.

An examination of the burned rock weights
throughout the AUs shows high peaks of burned
rock in the Late Archaic II (AU 4a) and the Toyah
phase (AU 3a). However, these weights represent
the totals over each AU, which have varying
durations and thus do not provide for an accurate
comparison. To account for the disparity in
the duration of AUs, the weight frequencies
were standardized to reflect the total weight of
burned rock per 100 years over the length of

As outlined in Chapter 4, the frequency of
burned rock weights can be used as a proxy for
measuring subsistence intensification within a
local or regional population. The standardized
frequency of burned rock weights at 41HY165
peaks during the Late Archaic II (AU 4a) and
also during the Toyah phase (AU 3a) of the Late

Prehistoric. There is also a notable drop in the
frequency of burned rock between these two
phases, during the Austin phase (AU 3b) of the
Late Prehistoric. The increase of burned rock
in both subperiods of the Late Archaic reflects
an increasing use of the site and may also be
the result of the subsistence economy shifting

towards bison exploitation or the intensification
of plant resources. The drop in the frequency of
burned rock during the Austin phase suggests
more infrequent use of the site, which may be the
result of fewer bison in the area, or the lack of
Austin phase artifacts from as secure context at
the location of excavations. The Toyah phase sees
a dramatic increase in the frequency of burned
rock, and this is likely due to both renewed
exploitation of bison as well as intensification of
plant resources (Thoms 2008). This increase in
burned rock also likely reflects changing mobility
and settlement patterns related to increased
regional population.

features were recorded on unit level or feature
forms. All of the observed features, except
for Features 6 and 3-97, consisted of burned
rock concentrations or “hearths.” Feature 6 is a
postmold feature and Feature 3-97 is a historic
artifact concentration. Ringstaff (2000) also
identifies four “archaeological zones” that consist
of areas with “no discernible shape or form and
are only represented by a sharp increase in
artifact frequency.” Unfortunately, the features
identified at the site could not be evaluated
entirely as part of this investigation. Therefore,
the following descriptions are largely based
on Ringstaff’s descriptions, information from
field forms, assumptions based on burned rock
distribution by unit and level, and additional
analysis of selected samples of burned rock.

Analysis of Recorded Features
During the course of excavations in the
three field schools, 18 features were identified
(Table 10-2). Of these 18 features, eight were
described in detail by Ringstaff (2000) as part
of his analysis of the site, and the remaining 10

It was unclear which artifacts in the
collection were associated with features and,
although some artifacts were labeled with feature
numbers, features were not always completely

defined in the field. Therefore, it was not prudent
to associate artifacts with features for this report
to avoid under- or overrepresenting the number
of artifacts recovered from feature contexts. The
exception to this is projectile points, which were
typically drawn on plan maps in the field and,
given their diagnostic traits, are much easier to
correlate with the feature. The artifacts and their
counts provided in the feature descriptions below

are the data given in Ringstaff’s thesis; they are
presented here for informational purposes. The
reader should also note the nomenclature used for
identifying these features. The feature numbers
listed below are written exactly as they were on
the feature forms and in Ringstaff’s thesis (e.g.,
Features 2/96 and 2-96 are two different features,
2-97 would be a different, third feature). These
numbers were retained to maintain continuity
162

between previous work at the site and the current
investigation.

Burned rock middens represent the
accumulation of waste rock material from these
cooking episodes. Black and Creel (1997:295)
argue that burned rock middens are the result of
repeated use of center-focused cooking facilities.
The defining characteristic of these midden
features is the presence of a primary structural
element, such as a centrally located, rock-lined
pit, which marks the locus of activity (Black and
Creel 1997:295). The morphology of the typical
Central Texas midden is the result of repeated
rearrangement of the waste material around the
center; often times manifesting archaeologically
as a mounded ring or cone (Black 1997:84–85).

Prehistoric cooking technology commonly
consists of open-air hearths (grilling), closed pits
or ovens (roasting and steaming), and open pits for
boiling that use rocks heated in surface hearths
(Thoms 2009:577). The process of cooking food
will result in increased nutrient density, removal
of pathogens and detoxification, and increased
storage life (Wandsnider 1997:3). Prehistoric
subsistence in the region consisted of a broadspectrum diet that included xerophytic plants
such as sotol and yucca as well as other plants
like camas and onion, which require prolonged
cooking for 36–48 hours to increase their
nutritional value and/or eliminate toxins (Dering
1999:661; Thoms 2009:576). While the degree to
which these plants contributed to the prehistoric
diet is still unknown, closed pits or ovens are an
efficient way to cook these plants, as heat can be
stored in rocks that, once buried, will continue
to release heat for more than 24 hours (Dering
1999:661; Thoms 2009:576). In addition, the
storage of heat in buried rocks allows for less fuel
consumption as open fires will rapidly dissipate
heat into the surrounding air or ground, requiring
more fuel for longer cooking times (Thoms
2009:576). Although there are several methods
that can be utilized to create an earth oven, the
general process involves a layered arrangement
of heated rocks, packing material (such as prickly
pear, grasses, or other plant material), food, and a
cap of sediment to retain heat (Ellis 1997:66–76).
While the packing material acts as both insulation
and a source of moisture for steaming, in some
cases water may be added to intensify steaming
(Ellis 1997:66–76). Once the food inside has been
cooked, the overlying sediment is removed, and
the food is removed for consumption or additional
processing, leaving behind the rocks making up
the “oven bed” (Black 1997:259).

Feature 2/96
On the unit level forms and some of the
bags associated with this feature, it is identified
as Feature 1, but Ringstaff (2000) refers to this
feature as Feature 2/96 (Figure 10-3). The feature
consisted of a burned rock scatter that occurred
across the entirety of Levels 3 and 4 in Unit 2,
with a denser concentration of burned rock
occurring in the northeast quadrant. The feature
was observed to be 15 cm thick and contained
two Perdiz points and one Scallorn arrow point.
In addition, lithic tools (n = 35), ceramics (n = 4),
and debitage (n = 1,791) were reported from this
feature by Ringstaff. Ringstaff notes that there
were 139 burned rocks weighing 15.5 kg in this
feature, and the current collection includes 19.40
kg of burned rock from Level 4 Unit 2. The lithics
reported from this feature were found across the
entire unit at these levels, but were concentrated
in the southeast quadrant. Several pieces of
charred wood were also observed within the
feature. Ringstaff identified this feature as a
hearth; however, the amount of burned rock
recovered and the distribution of scattered
burned rocks around a central concentration
suggest that this feature is the remains of an earth
oven. The scattered burned rock on the periphery

163

Feature 5/96
This feature was referred to
as Feature 5b on the field forms
and Feature 5/96 by Ringstaff
(2000), and also occurred in Unit
2 (Figure 10-4). Observed between
Levels 5 and 6 in Unit 2, this
feature consisted of a semicircular
concentration of burned rock in the
northwest quadrant and an ovate
concentration of burned rock in the
southeast and southwest quadrants.
The semicircular concentration
was estimated to be 50 x 70 cm in
size and the ovate concentration
measured 60 x 65 cm. Both of these
concentrations were 8–10 cm in
thickness. Ringstaff (2000) reports
a total of 36 burned rocks weighing
15.5 kg for this feature, and the
Figure 10-3. Plan view of Feature 2/96.

represents the waste rock discarded
from previous uses. Given the small
size of the feature, it may have been
used only a few times.
A date for this feature was
recovered from a bison bone that
was found in the southwest quadrant
of Unit 2, Level 4. The bone dated
from 640 to 536 cal BP and, along
with the Perdiz points, places this
feature in the Late Prehistoric Toyah
phase, AU 3a. Two burned rock
samples, also from the southwest
quadrant of Level 4, were submitted
to the AEL. Only one of these
samples (Specimen 79-14) contained
starch granules, which were not able
to be identified, but resemble starch
granules from mesquite seedpods.

current collection includes 12.03
kg of burned rock from Levels 5
and 6 of Unit 2. Other artifacts
reported from the feature include a
single Darl dart point, lithic tools
(n = 7), debitage (n = 689), and faunal
remains (n = 45). The Darl point
was recovered from the southwest
quadrant on the periphery of the
ovate concentration. Ringstaff
(2000) mentions that only a few
pieces of charcoal were observed
in the feature and he concludes that
these discrete clusters of rock most
likely represent dump piles from
stone boiling. Based on the unit plan
map of this level by Ringstaff (2000),
both of the features are separated
by over 50 cm horizontally, and
may likely represent two different
episodes of activity. Without
additional
information
it
is
impossible to ascertain any other
function for this feature.

Figure 10-5. Plan view of Feature 7/96.

(2000) suggests that this feature likely is a dump
pile from another cooking feature. While this
feature appears fairly discrete, the surrounding
quadrants were not excavated to this depth to
examine the potential of adjacent deposits.

Feature 7/96
Feature 7/96 was observed as an isolated
concentration of burned rock in the northeast
quadrant of Unit 2 in Levels 10 and 11 (Figure
10-5). The feature measured 80 x 55 cm, had an
ovate shape, and was approximately 20 cm thick.
No charcoal was reported from the feature, but
a single nutshell fragment was identified in the
collection from Unit 2, Level 11. A Morhiss
dart point with asphaltum on its stem was also
recovered from the interior of the feature.
Additional artifacts reported in the field included
lithic tools (n = 4), faunal remains (n = 8), and
debitage (n = 381). Ringstaff (2000) reports that
45 burned rocks weighing 5 kg were recovered,
and the current collection has 5.75 kg of burned
rock from these two levels. Due to the lack of
charcoal and thus no in situ burning, Ringstaff

Radiocarbon dating of the charred nutshell
from the feature returned a date of 2962–3142
cal BP. That date, along with the Morhiss point
(Late Archaic I), puts this feature within the
early Late Archaic and in AU 4b. Three burned
rock samples from this feature were submitted
to the AEL, and starch grains were identified on
each sample. One of the samples (Spec. 69-13)
contained a starch grain from the genus Hordeum,
which are grasses. The other two samples (Spec.
74-7 and 74-8) had starch granules from the
knotweed plant (Polygonum sp.). Sample 74-8
also had a fragment of plant epidermal tissue that
is consistent with yucca. Since there is no clear

recorded during the field school totaled 32 rocks
weighing 3.5 kg, and the current collection has
0.15 kg from these two levels. Ringstaff (2000)
concluded that the function of the feature could
not be determined due to its incomplete exposure.
However, given the low density of burned rock
on the periphery of the feature in the northwest,
southwest, and southeast quadrants, and tightly
clustered rock in the northeast quadrant, the
feature may represent the remains of an earth
oven, with the concentration representing a
central cooking element and the surrounding
rock being waste material from this feature.

function to the feature, there is no indication as
to how these plants may have been used. Both
of these plants are common in Texas and both
have been used by Native Americans as food and
medicine (Moerman 1998).

Feature 4/97
This feature was observed in Unit 3, Levels
2 and 3 as a scatter of burned rock across the
majority of the unit (Figure 10-6). The main
portion of this feature is located in the northeast
quadrant and consisted of a concentration of
burned rock approximately 70 x 35 cm that
was amorphous in shape. This concentration
extends into the north wall of the unit, leaving
the feature only partially exposed. Artifacts
reported from the feature include a single Perdiz
arrow point, lithic tools (n = 4), faunal remains
(n = 44), and debitage (n = 361). The burned rock

Feature 3a/96-6/97
This feature consists of a burned rock scatter
that extends across Unit 3 and part of Unit 8 in
Levels 4, 5, and 6 (Figure 10-7). It was identified
as a broad scatter of burned rock across the entire
unit with a denser concentration
of burned rock in the southwest
quadrant. In the plan view, the
feature exhibited an amorphous
shape, measured 115 x 95 cm in size,
and extended into the northwest
quadrant of Unit 8. Artifacts reported
from the feature included a single
Marcos point in Level 4 of Unit 8,
lithic tools (n = 20), faunal remains
(n = 298), and debitage (n = 1,151),
all occurring within a 20-cm zone
between these three levels. Burned
rock recovered during the field
school totaled 81 pieces weighing
5.5 kg, and the current collection
has 10.36 kg burned rock across all
three levels; however, some of the
rocks in the current collection may
be associated with the underlying
Feature 3b/96. Ringstaff (2000) does
not assign a function to this feature,
nor does he note any charcoal in the
feature.

since yucca plants require prolonged
cooking to render them edible.
Plants of the Araceae family are also
cooked in earth ovens, and these
plants may have been common in
the wet environment around Spring
Lake. However, the starch granules
from these plants are more likely to
be destroyed in a rock-heated oven
with more moisture, and may not be
visible in the archaeological record
(Messner and Schindler 2010:334).

Feature 3b/96
Feature 3b/96 was identified
immediately below Feature 3a/966/97 in Levels 7 and 8 of Unit 3. The
feature is a broad scatter of burned
rock across the entire unit with a
central, circular concentration of
rock in the northeast and southeast
quadrants that measures 110 x 95 cm
and is approximately 20 cm thick. In
profile, the concentration exhibits a
basin-shaped morphology, suggesting that this is
the central cooking element of an earth oven with
scattered waste rock around the remainder of the
unit. Artifacts reported from the feature include
lithic tools (n = 23), faunal remains (n = 274),
and debitage (n = 1,046). Burned rock noted by
Ringstaff (2000) totaled 307 weighing 21.25 kg;
the current collection has 27.48 kg. No charcoal
is noted from this feature, but Ringstaff (2000)
concludes that it is a hearth feature. Based on
the amount of rock and the morphology of the
feature, it is likely that this feature is the remains
of an earth oven and associated midden.

Figure 10-7. Plan view of Feature 3a/96-6/97.

In addition to the Marcos projectile point,
an Ensor point was also found in the southwest
quadrant of Unit 3, Level 4. Wood charcoal from
this feature was dated from 1412 to 1524 cal BP
within the Late Archaic II period and AU 4a. This
assignation also is supported by the recovered
projectile points. Four burned rock samples
were submitted to the AEL for starch grain
analysis. Three of these samples contained starch
granules, one similar to yucca (Yucca sp.), two
similar to arum family plants (Araceae), and the
remainder unidentifiable. Four phytoliths were
also recovered from these rocks. Three of the
phytoliths are associated with the Poaceae family
of grasses (e.g., dropseed grasses, panic grass,
and big bluestem) the remaining phytolith is a
calcium oxalate crystal with a stylus shape that is
common in yucca, sotol, or agave. The presence
of yucca in this feature is one line of evidence to
suggest this feature was an earth oven facility,

Feature 3c/96
Feature 3c/96 was identified in Unit 3 in
Levels 8 and 9 as broad burned rock scatter with
associated concentrations of rock. Ringstaff
167

Feature 6

(2000) notes only one concentration of burned
rock in the northwest quadrant, but based on his
map of the feature, there appears to be a second
concentration in the northeast and southeast
quadrants. The concentration identified in the
northwest quadrant measured 75 x 90 cm with
a thickness of 15 cm, was basin shaped, and
contained charcoal, suggesting in situ burning.
The west portion of this concentration extends
into the western wall of the unit. Artifacts
reported from the feature include a single
Pedernales dart point, lithic tools (n = 12), faunal
remains (n = 143), and debitage (n = 693). In total,
328 pieces of burned rock weighing 17.5 kg were
noted during the field school, and the current
collection has 35.54 kg of burned rock from these
two levels. Ringstaff (2000) identifies this feature
as a hearth, but given the amount of burned rock
and the two rock concentrations, this feature
likely represents one or two central cooking
features of earth ovens with associated midden
deposits.

This feature was identified in Unit 5 within
Level 8. Feature 6 was recorded as a possible
postmold. The feature exhibited a circular
shape approximately 23 cm in diameter, with an
interior area approximately 13 cm in diameter.
The interior area of the feature was a darker
stained matrix with charcoal. Surrounding this
interior area is an area of dense, burned clay. In
profile, the feature has approximately vertical
sides and tapers at the base, which terminates
17 cm below the observed surface of the feature.
The presence of the darker matrix and the
surrounding burned clay suggests the in situ
burning of a post. Although it is possible that the
feature may represent the remains of a burned
tap root of a tree, the profile drawing does not
indicate any roots extending from the central
feature. The feature was partially mapped in plan
view and then pedestaled. The pedestaled portion
was then bisected along the middle of the feature
to observe it in profile. While this information
is derived solely from the unit level forms, the
description of the feature and the plan and profile
drawings strongly support the function of this
feature as a postmold. There is no indication that
any other postmolds were identified on the site.

Feature 11/97
This feature was observed in Unit 3 in Levels
10 and 11 as a dense scatter of burned rock
occurring across the entire unit, approximately
20 cm thick. Ringstaff (2000) identifies two
quasi-clusters of burned rock in the northwest and
southwest quadrants; however, these are not very
apparent in his feature map. Two projectile points
were recovered from the feature and included a
Golondrina point and an Angostura-like point.
Additional artifacts include lithic tools (n = 15),
faunal remains (n = 102), and debitage (n = 700).
Burned rock was noted as 503 pieces weighing
35 kg, and the current collection has 38.75 kg
of burned rock from these two levels. Given the
scattered morphology of the feature, Ringstaff
(2000) does not assign a function to the feature
and no additional conclusions are presented here.

Feature 2-96
This feature was identified in the southwest
and southeast quadrants of Unit 4 in Levels 5, 6,
and 7. The majority of this feature consists of a
low-density scatter of burned rocks, bone, and
lithics. However, in Level 6 within the southwest
quadrant, there is a circular concentration
of burned rock with an interior diameter of
approximately 50 cm. This interior area is devoid
of artifacts (at least in the plan view map) and
may represent either a small pit roasting facility
or an area used for stone boiling, either as a pit
or central location to boil water in a skin bag

168

Feature 2-97

or other container. Although there is no strong
indication that this feature was used for stone
boiling, some evidence supports this supposition.
The excavators note that, in general, the burned
rocks are small to medium in size, and there is
also no evidence of charcoal within the feature,
although the absence of charcoal is not explicitly
stated. The density of land snails also increases,
which as a food source that presumably would
have been boiled, but there is no indication as
to whether the collection of snails is a naturally
occurring population or a collected one. While
it is possible that this feature may represent the
remains of stone boiling activities, the evidence
is not strong enough to confirm this, and therefore
the function is unknown.

Feature 2-97 is a low-density scatter of debris
identified in Unit 11, Levels 3 through 5, between
14 and 44 cmbs (Figure 10-8). The debris within
the feature consisted of burned rock, mussel
shell, bone, charcoal, and lithic debitage. A
small concentration of this debris was noted in
the northeast corner of Level 4. The excavators
reported that three projectile points were found
among the debris. One of these points is an Ensor
point (256-6) and another is an untypable point
(256-4); a third point has not been identified
within the current collection. Based on the
arrangement of the debris within the unit, this is
most likely a trash scatter, rather than a cooking
feature. The excavators noted that this feature
may be part of Feature 5-97, discussed below, and

Feature 1-97
Feature 1-97 was identified in
Unit 7 in all four quadrants within
Levels 1–4. The feature consisted of
a dense, circular cluster of burned
rock approximately 130 x 140 cm.
There are about 10 rocks that are over
20 cm in size in the feature, as well as
dozens of other smaller rocks. Based
on the plan map drawn in the field,
the feature most resembles an earth
oven feature, with the rocks from
the last cooking episode occupying
the central portion of the feature.
Several historic artifacts are found
in all four levels of this feature, as
well as prehistoric artifacts. Due to
the uncertain temporal context of
the feature it is not possible to assign
it to an analytic unit. The function
of the feature, given the shape and
large quantity of rock, is most likely
associated with pit roasting either in
prehistoric or historic times.

Figure 10-8. Plan view of Feature 2-97.

169

Feature 7-97

the plan map drawn in the field suggests that this
debris scatter may extend to the north.

This feature was identified in the northwest
quadrant of Unit 7, Level 4, between 25 and 35
cmbs. Feature 7-97 is a dense cluster of burned
rocks arranged in a circular pattern approximately
75 cm across. The excavators report finding
arrowpoints within the feature, but the current
collection does not include any arrowpoints from
this feature. Overall, Unit 7 is poorly documented,
with no clear distinction between Feature 7-97
and Feature 1-97 other than separate plan views.
Moreover, there are numerous historic artifacts
through Unit 7 that are mixed with prehistoric
artifacts. Therefore, no function can be assigned
to this feature.

The only diagnostic artifact from this feature
was an Ensor projectile point from Level 4 of the
feature. This places the feature within the Late
Archaic II and AU 4a. Two burned rocks were
submitted to AEL for analysis and one of the
rocks contained five starch granules. While four
of these granules were all of a similar type, none
of them could be identified specifically. However,
AEL suggest that, based on the morphology
of the granules, they resemble granules from
geophytes. A grass phytolith was also recovered
from this same burned rock.

Feature 5-97

Feature 9-97

This feature is a small concentration of
burned rocks (n = 11) arranged in a semicircular
pattern approximately 40 x 50 cm in size. The
feature was identified in Unit 11, Level 5, between
34 and 44 cmbs. There is little information
available for this feature; however, the excavators
did note charcoal, bone, and debitage within the
surrounding matrix. The excavators also suggest
that this feature may be an extension of Feature
2-97. Due to the paucity of information from the
field notes, the small size, and the low number
of burned rocks, it is not possible to assign a
function to this feature.

Feature 9-97 was identified in the northwest
quadrant of Unit 8, Level 9, between 67 and 77
cmbs. The feature consists of a dense cluster of
burned rocks approximately 1 m across; several
of the rocks are approximately 10 cm in size.
Charcoal, lithic debitage, and moderate to heavy
concentrations of deer bone were reported by
the excavators. It was also noted that the lithics
appear to be mostly later-stage debitage. Two
burned rock samples were submitted to AEL
for analysis, but neither rock contained plant
microfossils. As part of his thesis, Ringstaff
(2000) dated a single piece of charcoal from this
feature, which produced a date of 2300±40
RCYBP. Based on its size and shape, the feature
is likely a small cooking facility associated with
deer processing.

Feature 3-97
Feature 3-97 was identified in the southeast
quadrant of Unit 9, Level 3, between 15 and 25
cmbs. The feature primarily consists of a dense
concentration of window glass. The current
collection has 293 pieces of window glass from
this quadrant and level. Charcoal, lithic debitage,
nails, and a Darl point were also noted within this
feature. There is no other information available
for this feature.

Feature 10-97
Feature 10-97 was identified in the southeast
quadrant of Unit 8, Levels 9 and 10, between
75 and 85 cmbs. This feature is a low-density
scatter of burned rock with a small concentration

170

of burned rock extending into the east wall.
Charcoal, debitage, and deer bone were among
the artifacts reported from this feature. It is likely
that this feature is an extension of Feature 9-97,
discussed above; however, only the northwest and

southeast quadrants of this unit were excavated,
and therefore connecting these two features is
problematic. Due to the low density of material
and the lack of any structure, it is not possible to
assign any function to this feature.

Zooarchaeological Analysis of TimeControlled Material from 41HY165
By Cinda Timperley and Carole A. Leezer

Introduction

Patterns of taxonomic occurrence through
time at 41HY165 were examined for clues
to resource distribution, subsistence base
intensification, and prey choice with respect to
bison procurement. A brief discussion covers
the occurrences and condition of the remains
of various taxa through time at 41HY165. The
occurrence pattern of bison will be highlighted,
as will its abundance relative to other prominent
game species through time such as pronghorn,
deer, and rabbit.

Site 41HY165 is one of several archaeological
sites identified in the vicinity of Spring Lake
in San Marcos, Hays County, Texas. The site
was the subject of several archaeological field
school excavations between 1984 and 1998.
These field schools excavated several test
units that have yielded a significant amount of
cultural material, ranging from Middle Archaic
through Protohistoric periods. Soundness
of archaeological context across these units
varies widely, necessitating a need to limit the
current study to material recovered from secure
stratigraphic context. These determinations
were based on association with diagnostic lithic
artifacts, and/or by association with radiocarbon
dated charcoal or bison bone (see Table 4-9).

Relative frequencies of fauna material,
standardized across AUs for consistency in
occurrence, are compared. These comparisons
are conducted within each AU in order to
understand prey choice as represented by taxon
list, and across all AUs in order to understand
shifts in prey choice through time. Number
of identified specimens (NISP) and minimum
number of individuals (MNI) are calculated as
means of quantifying taxonomic occurrence.
Skeletal element/portion is identified for wellidentified taxa to the genus level in order to
discuss distribution patterns across the site.
Due to the low recovery rate of faunal remains
from AU 6 (Early Archaic/Late Paleoindian) and
AU 7 (Paleoindian), analysis of data from these
AUs has been omitted from this chapter. This
discussion culminates in the interpretation of
resource intensification efforts on the part of the
ancient residents of Spring Lake.

This is a preliminary analysis of faunal
material from Spring Lake site 41HY165. A
more comprehensive study that includes all
the recovered faunal material remains to be
conducted.
The main purpose of this study is to
determine any patterns through time regarding
procurement of bison, its plentitude or scarcity,
other subsistence options, and modes of resource
intensification. Once these patterns are outlined,
an attempt will be made to place them within
the larger context of regional procurement and
subsistence practices.

173

The faunal material from 28 lots in six units
was examined. These lots were selected for study
because they had reliably associated temporal
data. Material in this sample was recovered
from Units 1, 2, 2E, 3, 8, 10, and 11 (see Figure
5-1), comprising a temporally controlled
subassemblage of whole or partial elements from
fine- and coarse-screen fraction.

An important example here derives from the
Artiodactyla material. Numerous specimens are
of dimensions comparable in size to Odocoileus
(white-tailed deer) and Antilocapra (pronghorn).
However, not enough of the individual specimen
is preserved intact to support applying one or the
other generic name. These items are necessarily
assigned simply to Order Artiodactyla (eventoed ungulates), which is the next higher rank
with a high degree of identification confidence.
In this example, assignment skips the familylevel classification because an assignment to
either Cervidae or Antilocapridae would narrow
down the genera to Odocoileus or Antilocapra by
default, as there are no other artiodactyls of this
body size endemic to this region.

Each specimen identified to taxon and
element was weighed, tagged, and bagged
individually. Within a given lot, individual
specimens identifiable by element and taxon were
assigned specimen numbers. The subassemblage
examined here will be curated by taxon,
subdivided by AU. Data are organized in a catalog
spreadsheet by lot, with specimens within the lot
listed taxonomically, then by element.

Since body size is an important consideration
in the discussion of subsistence expansion
and prey choices, a size class is also assigned:
Artiodactyla, medium. The large artiodactyl
in the local fauna would be Bison. Small
artiodactyls in the regional fauna, not necessarily
from this site, include mountain goats. Due to
the fragmentary nature of much of the bone,
classification was often possible only to the class
or ordinal level. Because aspects of the overall
site study focus on the trends in body size of prey
species, bone fragments identifiable to class or
order only were qualified with a body size.

Materials and Methods
In analyzing this assemblage, one lot at a
time was examined. Specimens within a lot were
separated by taxon and element, and by whether
or not the specimen was cut, burned, or otherwise
altered. Each specimen was initially examined
with unaided eye and a 10x Bausch and Lomb
hand lens and strong lighting, and more closely
with a Bausch and Lomb light microscope when
needed. Fine-screen material was sorted with the
aid of the microscope at powers ranging from
7–30x. Observations were made and recorded
for as many taphonomic aspects as possible,
including weathering, scavenging, breakage, cuts,
burns, and use wear/utilization. Identifications
were assigned to the taxonomic level of the
lowest rank possible, ideally genus or species, to
ensure accurate taxon representation (see Murray
2008 for discussion on taxonomic nomenclature
and representation within a collection).

This approach avoids the subjective and
somewhat awkward taxonomic assignment of
the form ?Genus or Genus ?species. As Murray
(2008) documented in his dissertation, those
question marks can get glossed over and lost in
subsequent citations of faunal lists. In following
this method, we hope to avoid, for example,
Artiodactyla:
?Antilocapra
(Artiodactyla,
possibly Antilocapra) becoming in subsequent
citations Artiodactyla: Antilocapra (Artiodactyla,
positively Antilocapra). Avoiding this equivocal
identification is critical to several aspects of site

Specimens were assigned identification to
the taxonomic rank with the most confidence.

assignment of taxon (Antilocapra vs. Odocoileus,
or the pocket gophers Thomomys vs. Geomys)
can dramatically impact the interpretation of a
site’s environmental setting.

large males (Meagher 1986). This size category
is presumed to include Bison only, and so is not
used here.

Mammalia, Medium (18–80 kg)
This category includes deer (average 45–68
kg, female and male, respectively); pronghorn
(47 kg in small females to 70 kg in large males);
and wolf (18–55 kg, female, and 20–80 kg,
male) (Mech 1974; O’Gara 1978; Smith 1991).
The difference in size between Bison and
Odocoileus or Antilocapra is great enough to
warrant distinction on its own and with respect to
approaches to utilization as prey species. Though
wolf (Canis lupus) is included in this category,
it was not recognized in this assemblage. It was
included due to its known historic range and the
occurrence of canids at other sites in the region,
lending to the possibility of its occurrence here
archaeologically (Schmidley and Davis 2004).

As mentioned above, body size of prey
species is an important criterion in interpretation
of subsistence trends. If all zooarchaeological
specimens were identifiable to genus and
species, sorting the faunal assemblage into
body size groups would be straightforward and
interpretations made simple. However, such is not
the case. As the ancient people processed their
quarry to varying degrees of thorough nutrient
extraction by smashing and rendering bone, and
then subsequent taphonomic processes took hold,
zooarchaeologists are often left with fragmentary
material that is not always assignable to genus or
species.
Sichler et al. (2011) similarly faced the
inevitable identification only to class, and
provided size ranges when feasible for analysis
of the Zatopec fauna. Similar practice is followed
here, but we have elected to redefine the size
groupings, opting to simplify classification into
large, medium, small, and microfauna. While
these groups are defined below, some are lumped
in later analyses reported in this chapter. In
addition, some materials in the fauna catalog are
indicated as “medium to large” because they are
fragments that could have come from a large deer
or pronghorn or from a small Bison. Body size
classification is based on modern analogs extant
in the region historically.

Artiodactyla, Medium
This category is restricted to consider only
Odocoileus and Antilocapra-size ungulates; only
these two genera occur locally.

Mammalia, Small (1.5–26 kg)
Small mammals considered here include
coyote (11–20 kg) and beaver (11–26 kg) (Bekoff
1977; Daniel 1973; Jenkins and Busher 1979).

Mammalia, Micro (0.1–1.5 kg)
This category includes cotton rat (0.1–0.2 kg),
wood rat (0.1–0.3 kg), and cottontail rabbit (0.7–
1.5 kg) (Cameron and Spencer 1981; Chapman et
al. 1980; Chapman and Willner 1978; Schmidley
and Davis 2004).

Mammalia, Large (318–907 kg)
Bison is the only taxon observed in this
collection with a body size exceeding that of
Odocoileus/Antilocapra. Body mass for Bison
ranges from 318 kg in small females to 907 kg in

Approach to Systematic Zooarchaeology
The Systematic Zooarchaeology section
(Appendix F) contains taxonomic classification
of the faunal material recovered from the six units
excavated at 41HY165. Vertebrate systematics
follows
several
sources.
Herpetofauna
classification (amphibians, snakes, and turtles)
follows Holman (1995) and Dixon (2000). Avian
terminology follows Peterson (1988). Mammalian
taxonomy generally follows Jones and Manning
(1992), Jones et al. (1985), and Wilson and Reeder
(2005), except where noted. Bovid postcranial
skeletal identifications follow Todd (2001). Some
identification was aided by use of comparative
material held in the Recent Osteology Collection
in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory of the
Texas Natural Science Center, The University of
Texas at Austin.

Taphonomy
General Observations
Preservation of the bone itself is governed
by taphonomic processes, both preburial and
postburial. To say the bone was poorly preserved
is not entirely accurate. Bone of larger animals
is usually in small (often less than 5 cm along
c-axis) pieces, but small-taxon elements are
usually more intact. All the bone is robust
enough to survive analytical handling under
normal laboratory conditions. Overall, the bone
condition preserves the anthropogenic influences
and other preburial mistreatment, with nominal
to moderate diagenetic overprinting.

Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984:20) state that
criteria for identifiability of bone fragments
should be stated as clearly and explicitly as
possible. Also, they suggest noting which
identifications were based on assumptions made
on the population from which the faunal sample
was taken. It would be prudent also to provide the
assumptions on which identifications are based.
As an example, the only large artiodactyl reported
for prehistoric Central Texas post-Pleistocene is
Bison sp. and not any camelid. Therefore, it could
be presumed that large, tall-crowned selenodont
tooth fragments would be assignable to Bison sp.
In later, postcontact deposits, one must consider
that European-introduced cattle may also be
present, given other evidence in the archaeological
assemblage. Since the archaeological assemblage
from 41HY165 includes both pre- and postcontact
deposits, this latter fact must be considered in
the faunal analysis. Table 11-1 lists positively
identified taxa from AUs at site 41HY165. Taxa
with questionable identification are discussed in

There is some bone that exhibits weathering
cracks that run longitudinally on the cortical
surfaces of limb diaphysis fragments. Other
bone appears to have endured more weathering,
with rounding of the crack edges and advanced
cortex degradation. This dichotomy is observed
in the Late Archaic assemblages. Heavier
degradation also is observed in Austin material.
Burned bone comprises roughly one-third of the
assemblage, ranging from charred to calcined.

Breakage Patterns
The majority of the broken bones have green
or spiral breaks. Some specimens look like bone
“shatter,” fragments that spalled upon impact.
Some of the bone fragments that were broken
while fresh exhibit spiral scars overprinted by
weathering or scavenging by carnivores and/or

rodents (see below). Bone breakage does not
appear to vary from AU to AU.

A small number of bones analyzed in this
study appear to have been modified beyond
simple nutrient extraction. The following
specimens exhibit some polish: 79-28, 299-32,
310-28, and 538-4 (possible broken awl tip; see
Figure 11-1). Specimen 311-1 is an Odocoileus
metapodial fragment with numerous grooves
running longitudinally down the midline. It
appears to be a waste fragment from bone tool
production. Other bone fragments exhibit cuts
consistent with dismemberment and butchery.

The large amount of spirally fragmented
bone strongly suggests bone grease extraction
was conducted throughout the prehistory
represented at 41HY165. Outram (2001) provides
photographic descriptions of various ratings on a
fracture freshness index (FFI) that have proven
useful in interpreting some of the breaks observed
on the artiodactyl material from 41HY165.
Especially of note is Figure 4 (Outram 2001:406),
which depicts the proximal and distal ends of
a cattle radius. This specimen was boiled 10
minutes prior to breakage. The figure illustrates
breaks that are both helical and step-like on the
same break surface.
Medium-sized artiodactyl bone in several
lots exhibit helical and step-like fractures that
compare well with those described above,
suggesting that these bones were probably
boiled, then broken. This is a pattern closely
linked with processing bone in order to extract
fat. Specimen 299-44 is a humerus fragment
from a small mammal, possibly beaver or canid,
exhibiting a weak helical fracture alongside a
more angular fracture on the same break surface
(Figure 11-1). It also exhibits cut marks on the
cranio-distal surface. This specimen suggests
that bone-greasing activity was not restricted to
the processing of only artiodactyl bone.
Other damage observed includes scavenging
marks: rodent gnawing, carnivore gnawing
(scalloping), and punctured bone. Rodent gnaw
marks occur mainly on fragments of medium
mammal and medium artiodactyl bone that also
exhibit spiral breaks. Carnivore gnaw marks
were observed at the articular ends of long bone
fragments. Puncture marks occur infrequently
and were observed on turtle shell fragments.

Quantitative Analyses

Analysis of faunal material from 41HY165 would
not benefit from MNI application due to its highly
fragmented nature.

In order to meaningfully discuss trends
through time, the assemblage required a bit of
manipulation. First, we wanted to compare the
relative numbers of identifiable taxa from one
AU to the next. To do so, we had to select the
taxa to be considered “identifiable.” We wanted
to compare Bison to medium-size artiodactyls, to
smaller mammals, and to lower vertebrates.

Both NISP and MNI were initially calculated
for each AU, but per taxon/per AU, MNI = 1 in
most instances. This did not seem to be greatly
informative, other than to say that some taxon
was present or absent/unidentified in a given
period. Several taxa had an MNI greater than one
when taken across the entire assemblage, with a
minimum of one individual per AU. Taxa with
an MNI greater than one within an AU include
Sigmodon (Toyah), Odocoileus (Late Archaic
II), and probably also Osteichthyes, Serpentes,
and Testudines. However, these lower vertebrate
groups were not identified beyond the taxonomic
rank aforementioned. Thus, only NISP and mass
will be considered from here forward.

This list includes specimens classifiable to six
categories: fishes, turtles, other lower vertebrates
(Amphibia, Anura, Rana, Lacertilia, Serpentes,
Aves, Anseriformes), small mammals (Leporidae,
Sylvilagus, Rodentia, Sigmodon, Neotoma,
Geomyidae, Castor canadensis, and Carnivora);
medium-sized Artiodactyla (deer, pronghorn;
Artiodactyla, medium), and Bison. This approach
removed the ambiguous classifications Vertebrata
and Mammalia (including micro, small, medium,
and fetal/juvenile). The criteria were not based
on taxonomic level of identification, but focused
more on associations with habitat, diurnal/
nocturnal habits, and body size. These criteria
affect hunting/procurement methodologies, and
the prey categories probably played important
roles in the content of contributions of various
members of the social unit to the overall
subsistence base. Appendix F details criteria for
classifying specimens in the above categories.

Standardization
In order to accurately compare and discuss
the occurrence of each taxon and the faunal
assemblage as a whole, the amounts of recovered
material per AU must be standardized. This is
a necessary first step because each AU was not
sampled equally. NISP and Mass totals for each
taxon per AU were calculated and are presented
in Appendix F. These raw frequencies were then
used to calculate standardized frequencies of
NISP and Mass by AU presented in Table 11-2.

Number of Identifiable Specimens
Present (NISP) and Minimum Number of
Individuals (MNI)

Standardization of occurrence per 100 years
is achieved by the following equation:
FS = ((FR/T)/V) × 100

Several researchers have proposed methods
to quantify animal and element abundance in
archaeological assemblages (Grayson 1984; Klein
and Cruz-Uribe 1984; Lyman 1994; Marshall and
Pilgram 1993). However, Marshall and Pilgram
(1993) proposed that MNI may be less reliable
an indicator of element frequency than NISP
when applied to highly fragmented assemblages.

Where FS = standardized frequency, FR = raw
frequency (raw number or mass of items),
T = duration of AU in years, and V = excavated
volume of matrix per AU in m3.
Two sets of calculations are run, one to
standardize the bone counts and the other to

of standardized burned rock mass frequency
from Chapter 7 is reprised in Figure 11-2 to be
compared against the NISP standardizations,
as NISP change appears to be a better indicator
of resource intensification than does bone mass
(Marshall and Pilgram 1993; Outram 2001).

Calculations were then run on taxon NISP and
Mass by AU. This table is presented in Appendix
F. The data set presented in Table F-1 was used

Systematic Comparison of Taxonomic
Groups with Burned Rock Proxy

the trends in burned rock occurrence (by
mass). Medium Artiodactyla, Antilocapra, and
Odocoileus are taken together as one group and
compared with Bison. Both curves increase over
time, excepting the dip in Austin phase (see
Figure 11-4). The slope increases more rapidly
for the medium Artiodactyla than for the Bison,
which decreases from Late Archaic I through
Austin. While Bison dips from Late Archaic I
forward, burned rock is increasing through Late
Archaic II and continues to increase with only the
Austin phase dip and the Protohistoric cessation
(see Figure 11-4). This trend suggests an everincreasing reliance on deer and pronghorn as top
prey choice.

In studying 41HY165 subsistence patterns,
we are using the frequency of burned rock per
AU as proxy. Burned rock mass is compared to
bone NISP in this study based on the working
hypothesis that an increase in burned rock mass
indicates an increase in food processing and/or
broadening of the subsistence base (see Figure
10-1 and Figure 11-2). Changes in NISP should
also indicate changes in resource intensification.
Bone mass was rejected as a comparative variable
because it did not stand in well as a resource
intensification proxy (see Figure 11-3). Given
that, the following discussion will compare and
contrast standardized NISP values (presented
in Table F-1) with the standardized burned rock
frequency data (see Chapter 10, this volume).

This peak of burned rock in Late Archaic II
coincides with peaks in small mammal, turtle,
and other non-piscean lower vertebrates (see
Figures 11-5 and 11-6). Both bison and burned
rock swing up again in Toyah. Along with bison,
fish increases in Toyah, but at a higher rate than
the other small-bodied taxa. This suggests a shift
or broadening of the resource base to include fish
where it had only played a minor role previously.

In Figure 11-2, the burned rock mass values
have been divided by 100 in order to fit the scale of
the standardized NISP faunal values. In general
the curve trends for NISP are similar to burned
rock mass except in the Protohistoric period,
where burned rock mass drops dramatically
following the Toyah phase. Generally, there is
an increase in frequency from Middle Archaic
to Late Archaic, then a drop at Austin before
swinging up again at Toyah. This drop can
be explained by the low volume of sediment
recovered for this AU. Omitting the Austin phase,
the curve would continue to climb from Late
Archaic through the Prehistoric, before dropping
again in the Protohistoric . This trend may be
due to a continuing increase in population, or
degradation of habitat as the local environment
continues to dry through time, or a combination
of these factors.

Discussion
Changes in Faunal Composition Through
Time: A Discussion of Fauna by AU
This study focuses on a fraction of the
41HY165 assemblage, that portion to which
temporal and cultural affiliation could be
assigned. Selected levels in Units 1, 2, 3, 8, 10,
and 11 were examined. As noted in Chapter 4,
game focus shifted necessarily at the end of the
Pleistocene when all the megafauna but bison
went extinct in North America, to other large
mammals: bison, deer, pronghorn.

Discussion of Bison and Other Taxa

AU 5: Middle Archaic (5600–4300 BP)

This section begins with a comparison of
Bison with other taxa across time, held against

Taxa
identified
from
this
period
include Vertebrata, Testudines, Mammalia
183

(indeterminate, medium), and Artiodactyla
(medium). Medium-sized mammals, including
medium artiodactyls, are present and appear to be
a more significant take than small mammals. The
bone fragments are spirally broken and minimally
weathered. Three fragments are burned.
Specimen 310-28 has some polish. Specimen
311-1 is a deer metatarsal with numerous cuts
and abrasion running parallel or slightly oblique
to the long axis. Other metapodial fragments
exhibit cuts as well. No bison was recovered from
Middle Archaic sediments.

Two small bone fragments appear to be fetal
material. Five bison specimens are associated
with this AU, two of which provided radiocarbon
dates. One juvenile dentary fragment is burned.
The juvenile/fetal material associated with this
AU suggests some spring/early summer hunting
activities.
Specimen 538-4 is 0.9 cm long, moderately
polished, and appears to be a broken awl tip (see
Figure 11-1).
Overall it appears that the reliance on smallbodied vertebrates has decreased with respect to
the Medium Artiodactyla and bison.

AU 4b: Late Archaic I (4300–2550 BP)
Taxa identified from this period include
Vertebrata, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Serpentes,
Testudines,
Mammalia
(indeterminate,
small, medium, fetal/juvenile), Rodentia, and
Artiodactyla (medium-size, Odocoileus, Bison).

Fish increase in occurrence from the Middle
Archaic along with most other groups. Deer limb
and dental material plus medium artiodactyl limb
fragments indicate that these mammals were
a consistent part of the subsistence base. Fetal/
juvenile material suggests at least one spring
hunt event. Medium-sized artiodactyls appear to
gain significance in Late Archaic I even as bison
material increases in frequency from the Middle
Archaic dearth.

Vertebrata material comprises fragments
less than 1.0 cm long. Weathering is variable,
and fewer than one-half are burned. Osteichthyes
material represents at least two sizes and species
of fish. Less than 10 percent is burned. Two small
specimens are tentatively identified as Amphibia.
The turtle material represents smaller-sized
kinosternids/emydids. One-third of this material
is burned. Snake is poorly represented, burned,
and degraded (digested?). Rodents and small
mammal materials are scant in this AU. Homo
sapiens is represented by one 3rd phalanx.

AU 4a: Late Archaic II (2550–1200 BP)
Taxa identified from this period include
Vertebrata, Osteichthyes, Lepisosteidae, Anura,
Lacertilia, Serpentes, Testudines, Mammalia
(indeterminate, small, medium, fetal), Leporidae,
Rodentia (indeterminate, Sigmodon, Neotoma,
Castor), Carnivora, Artiodactyla (medium,
Antilocapra, Odocoileus, and Bison). Fish
occurrence drops from Late Archaic I to II, and
small mammal occurrences rises with turtles and
other lower vertebrates.

Medium Artiodactyla includes items
identified to Odocoileus and Medium
Artiodactyla. One deer tooth fragment may be a
milk tooth. One specimen is burned black with
calcined patches. Medium Mammal material
may derive from Medium Artiodactyla, but
the fragments are broken and poorly enough
preserved that such a diagnosis is tentative at best.
More than half of these fragments are burned,
ranging from scorched black to calcined white.

Fish material comprises burned and unburned
skull and vertebral elements, and one unburned
gar scale. Amphibia are represented by anuran
postcranial and cranial material mostly from Lot
522, with one ilium identified to Genus Rana, true
184

frogs. More than one individual is represented,
because limb elements are of two sizes. Two
specimens from Lot 299 are also postcranial
material from at least one small individual. The
remainder of the anuran material is skull and
limb elements, possibly also Rana, and none are
burned. Reptile material includes garter snakesized vertebrae, some possibly digested, and
a jaw fragment that could be lizard or snake.
Turtle material comprises primarily fragments
of plastron and carapace from small individuals,
probably kinosternids and/or emydids. The
fragments are heavily comminuted. About a third
are burned black, evidence of having been cooked
(Lemke and Timperley 2008). One Vertebrata
specimen from this AU may be a snake vertebrae
fragment.

of material in this category may in fact derive
from the medium artiodactyls. Specimens are
heavily comminuted, with only two specimens
over 3 cm along the c-axis. Mammalia material
comprises over 50 percent burned fragments,
between 0.4 and 2.3 cm along the c-axis.
Body size was not assigned. Various breakage
patterns are evident, from smooth spiral through
rectilinear fracturing. Variable weathering
is observed as well, especially on very small
fragments, less than 2 cm along c-axis. Cortex
is usually absent, and longitudinal cracks are
common in unburned bone. Burned bone varies
from scorched brown-black to calcined white,
the surface from semiglossy and smooth to matte
and cracked.
A small number of specimens derive from
fetal or very young juvenile mammals, probably
artiodactyls, and provide evidence for springtime
activity at Spring Lake during this AU.

Rodent material represents three genera:
Sigmodon (craniodental), Neotoma (postcranial),
and Castor (postcranial). Additionally, one
Sigmodon-sized maxillary fragment is calcined.
Leporid and canid material are scarce in this AU,
with one specimen each. Two bison specimens
from different units were identified and
subsequently submitted for 14C dating.

AU 3b: Late Prehistoric–Austin (1200–
800 BP)
Taxa identified from this period include:
Osteichthyes,
Mammalia,
and
medium
Mammalia. One lot represents this AU in the
faunal assemblage. The vertebrate recovery,
outside the Osteichthyes, comprises fragments
of cortical bone assigned to Mammalia or
Mammalia, medium. The mammal fragments
conceivably could be assignable to Artiodactyla,
medium. Over two-thirds of the mammal bone is
burned, ranging from black scorched to calcined
white. One unburned fragment is cut. No bison
material was recovered in the Austin phase at
this site. A cautious interpretation would be that
bison was not a significant part of the subsistence
base, but poor recovery for this AU must be kept
in mind. Scant recovery makes speculating on
subsistence patterns difficult.

Medium Artiodactyla are represented by
numerous fragments that exhibit green breaks.
Specimen 291-14 is a limb diaphysis fragment
with an old impact break and three mending
fragments of the resulting bone shatter. This
association suggests very little disturbance for at
least this unit/level. Several specimens are cut.
Deer has been positively identified, tentatively as
white-tailed based on an astragalus and a lateral
malleolus (Gilbert 1990:406; Jacobson 2003:294).
Pronghorn is positively identified from a tooth
fragment. Worked bone is present.
Slightly over half the material assigned to
medium Mammalia is burned. The vast majority

185

AU 3a: Late Prehistoric–Toyah (800–350
BP)

Indeterminate Mammalia material comprises
mostly fragments smaller than 1.0 cm in length.
They exhibit varied weathering, and breakage
patterns reflect comminution at different stages
of bone drying. Medium Mammalia bone is
spirally broken, and the burned bone is variably
broken, with spiral and irregular fractures
observed. Burned material varies from glossy
or semiglossy brown/black scorched to matte
white calcined. The Medium Artiodactyla is
represented largely by axial skeleton and hind
limb fragments of a mature animal: vertebral,
sacral, pelvic, proximal femur. Other isolated
fragments and elements also are present. With
virtually identical preservation, color, and surface
textures, this association suggests use of a portion
of a single animal. This could also possibly be
evidence of resource distribution. Specimen 7928 is a portion of medium Artiodactyla limb
diaphysis with spiral breaks. It tapers to a narrow
end with an unusual side notch. This narrow end
is somewhat smoothed and polished, and the
cortex is flaked off from the narrow end to about
one-third down the length of the bone fragment.

Taxa identified from this period include
Vertebrata, Osteichthyes, Amphibia (possible
Cryptobranchidae, Anura), Reptilia (possible
Eumeces,
Serpentes,
Testudines),
Aves,
Anseriformes, Mammalia (small and medium),
Sigmodon, Geomyidae, and Artiodactyla
(medium, Odocoileus, Bison).
Osteichthyes material consists of cranial
bone, vertebrae, and spines of small- and
medium-sized fish. The non-vertebral material is
broken. At least two taxa are represented based
on vertebrae morphology. Relatively little of the
fish material is burned, only a few spines and
vertebrae. Amphibians are sparsely represented.
At least four individuals are represented by a
humerus, scapula and two ilia, plus limb elements
from small individuals. The ilia and humerus
are anuran, and the scapula is possibly from a
hellbender (Cryptobranchidae). Turtle material
comprises one burned, several unburned, and a
single red-stained fragment (Specimen 79-21).
Snake remains and the suspect lizard jaw all
derive from microsieved material, and are small
bone fragments from small individuals. Less
than 10 percent are burned. More avian material
has been identified in this AU than the others,
including a pelvis, phalanx, and wing elements.
None are burned. Vertebrata material largely
derives from microseived material, one-third of
which is burned. These fragments exhibit varied
weathering and degrees of burning. Rodent
material is represented mostly by Sigmodon
teeth, but also includes some pocket gopher teeth,
Rodentia teeth, and micromammal postcranials
likely assignable to taxa within Rodentia.
Minimum number of individuals for Sigmodon
is four based on one burned left upper second
molar, one unburned left upper second molar, one
unerupted right lower first molar, and one wellworn right lower third molar.

As with other AU where bison is present,
only a few specimens represent the taxon. One
is a tabulate fragment which could be rib, and a
burned fragment which could be juvenile bone.
Vertebrates duck-sized and smaller,
especially the cotton rat, appear to be at least
equally represented when compared to Medium
Artiodactyla and Bison.

AU 2: Protohistoric
Taxa identified from this period include
Osteichthyes, Serpentes, Testudines, Mammalia
(small, medium), Sylvilagus, Artiodactyla
(medium), Odocoileus, and Bison. As noted
previously in this report, Protohistoric period
material was analyzed for more general content
because the context is questionable. This
186

subassemblage list serves to demonstrate that the
same groups of animals continued to be exploited
beyond the time of contact with European
explorers, missionaries, and settlers.

When Bison is held as the baseline taxon, it
appears to increase in importance during Late
Archaic I and decreases until it is not present in
the Austin phase. Bison increases again in Toyah
phase recovery. While bison is on the decline in
Late Archaic II, medium artiodactyls increase, as
do small mammals and turtles. After the Austin
phase drop, all taxa increase again. The smallbodied taxa increase more dramatically, with fish
procurement relatively more prominent in Toyah.
An increase reliance of fish can be perceived as
greater prey resource intensification during this
period. As stated above, however, poor recovery
for the Austin phase AU must be kept in mind.
Inadequate recovery from this AU makes
speculating on subsistence patterns difficult.

Bison Procurement/Utilization and Prey
Choice
Bison does not occur in Middle Archaic,
is present in Late Archaic I, decreases from
Late Archaic II to Austin where it is altogether
absent, and then increases again in Toyah and
the Protohistoric. In contrast, the use patterns of
small mammals, aquatics, and deer/pronghorn
exhibit the following trend. Medium-sized
artiodactyls and small mammals start out in
Middle Archaic in an apparently significant
position in the subsistence regime, supported
decreasingly by turtles, and other lower
vertebrates. Medium artiodactyls continue in
the Late Archaic I and drop significantly to take
second place as bison dominate the assemblage,
supported by small mammals, turtles, and other
lower vertebrates. In Late Archaic II, bison drop
and medium Artiodactyla peak significantly.
Smaller vertebrates continue to increase. The
Austin phase has poor recovery, thus creating in
this author’s opinion a false dip in significance
for each group. If the Austin phase is skipped,
and we move on to Toyah from Late Archaic
II, small mammals do not show an increase,
while turtles, fish, and other lower vertebrates
appear to increase relatively significantly. It is
difficult to interpret the relative occurrences
in the Protohistoric recovery, as European
technology and sociopolitical influences are
likely to have dramatically altered subsistence
strategies. Trend toward more intense utilization
of available resources can be seen in Late
Archaic II and Toyah. This might be attributed
to younger sediments yielding volumetrically
more identifiable material, but the Late Archaic
recovery vastly outnumbers the other AU in both
NISP and number of taxa identified.

Evidence for Resource Distribution
The units excavated at 41HY165 were
scattered over the peninsula and did not
comprise a contiguous block. This distribution
made it possible to get some meaningful spatial
relationship data regarding resource distribution.
Several lots singly represent a portion of
a mammal carcass (medium Artiodactyla,
Odocoileus, Antilocapra, medium Mammal, etc.),
which suggests that such might have been divided
and passed out among the human occupants of
the site; social organization, however, remains
to be determined (family groups/households,
clans, etc). Such resource distribution is noted
in Late Archaic II and Late Prehistoric deposits,
suggesting a practice with significant temporal
endurance.
The medium artiodactyl materials from Late
Archaic II suggest distribution of game resources,
and a spring hunting event. Specific elements per
lot discussed here can be found in Appendix F.
XU 2, Lot 79, is a Toyah lot with fragments of
a medium artiodactyl hind quarter that includes
axial and upper limb material. Lot 79 appears
to comprise fragments from a single element
187

or skeletal section: a portion encompassing
the lower vertebral (sacral) and pelvic region
including the upper femur. XU 11, adjacent to the
north of XU 2, Lot 256, is a Late Archaic II lot
with elements of a medium artiodactyl forelimb.
Craniodental material identified as Odocoileus
also derives from this lot. XU 8 yielded three lots
with such association. Lot 123 and 299 are Late
Archaic II. Lot 123 appears to represent the lower
fore and hind limb elements with corresponding
axial elements. Fetal/juvenile material is also
present, suggesting a spring kill. Lot 299
contains medium artiodactyl hind limb and fetal/
juvenile material. Lot 299 appears to represent
an adult hind limb quarter and one fetal/juvenile
bone, more evidence of a spring kill. Lot 310 is
Protohistoric, and comprises medium artiodactyl
and Odocoileus hind limb elements. Not only
do these lots’ components suggest resource
distribution, Lot 299 material provides seasonal
information.

and Cruz-Uribe are working toward the goal of
cataloging taxonomic abundance, rather than
subsistence activities. For the former activity,
the indeterminate fragments can indeed be of
little value. However, once upon a time, lithic
debitage was treated with the same attitude. Now,
expedient flake-tool utilization is a commonly
addressed component of comprehensive lithic
analyses.
Using diversity of taxa present as an
indication of diet breadth, it appears that resource
intensification also trends along the same pattern
as the standardized data. The following counts
include the broad classifications of Vertebrata
and Mammalia in with the more specifics such as
Leporidae and Odocoileus. These counts are not
standardized. Middle Archaic recovery yielded
six taxa. Late Archaic I yielded 14 taxa. Late
Archaic II increased the count to 23 taxa. Austin
phase yielded three taxa. Toyah phase yielded
18 taxa. Protohistoric yielded 10 taxa. If Austin
phase were not included, again due to poor
recovery, taxon count would only drop slightly
from Late Archaic II to Toyah. From this trend,
it appears that there is a response to decreasing
bison presence in Late Archaic II that involves
increasing hunting pressure on local fauna.

These lots support spring hunting activity in
the Late Archaic II. A single cheek tooth fragment
of Antilocapra was also identified. A relatively
small amount of bison material was recovered.
This suggests a lesser reliance on bison in Late
Archaic II than in Late Archaic I.

Subsistence

Conclusions

Far more of the faunal assemblage is considered
in discussions of subsistence in more recent
studies than in work of even only a few decades
ago (e.g., Outram 2001 in contrast with Klein and
Cruz-Uribe 1984). Outram (2001, and other dates)
has outlined and emphasized the contributions
that “indeterminate” bone fragments can make
to the discussion of subsistence, and in concert
with lithic and other data, in the larger picture,
to interpretation of site function and social
dynamics. We returned to Klein and Cruz-Uribe
(1984) as cited in Outram (2001) to understand the
context of their statements. It appears that Klein

The zooarchaeological remains examined
in this study represent Middle Archaic through
Protohistoric subsistence residue. Twenty-eight
taxa were identified in the time-controlled portion
of the assemblage (see Table 11-1). These include
identified material at order, family, and genus
level, as well as broadly categorized material
such as Vertebrata and size-classed Mammalia
material. Trends in procurement and subsistence
behavior can be seen as reliance on mediumsized artiodactyls supplemented by bison, rather
than supplanted by bison.

Conclusions

41HY165 located on the southeastern banks

Despite problems with stratigraphic integrity,
analysis of the field school excavations, recovered
artifacts, and associated data have been able to,
through the research domains presented at the
beginning of this report in conjunction with
associated methodologies, present a detailed
perspective on prehistoric cultural adaptations in
the Central Texas region. This chapter discusses
the most significant interpretations derived from
these analytical investigations within the context
of these research domains, particularly in terms
of how they contribute to ongoing investigations
into hunter-gatherer adaptations of prehistoric
periods in Central Texas cultural chronology.

of Spring Lake on Texas State property in San
Marcos, Hays County, is a multicomponent site
visited recurrently by mobile hunter-gatherers
over an approximate 10,000-year time span.
The site was subject to several archaeological
investigations conducted as SWT Archaeological
Field Schools in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2010,
the site was revisited as part of archaeological
investigations associated with the SLAERP.
Artifacts and samples collected by the
archaeological field schools have been analyzed
by CAS as part of the SLAERP. Results of these
analyses and excavations are described and
discussed in this report.

The result of this research reflects three
fundamental approaches that shaped all analytical
efforts. First, the record of cultural activity at
41HY165 was viewed as a process; emphasis
was given throughout the analysis to identify
and interpret changes from one period to the
next. Second, and related to the first approach,
this analysis is comparative in nature at a basic
level. Not only are time-controlled components
compared with and contrasted against one
another to detect behavioral shifts from the Late
Paleoindian through to the Historic period, but
aspects of each component are compared to
illustrate key trends and patterns within each
period. Finally, we understand that the causes
that produced many of the changes described
here to be both external to the groups of people
who occupied the site (e.g., climate, environment,
resource availability) and internal to their
sociocultural systems (e.g., individual aptitude

Occupation at 41HY165 has been documented
as beginning near the end of the Late Paleoindian
period, and extending through the Archaic into the
Late Prehistoric, and even into the early Spanish
Colonial period. Peaks in occupation have been
noted for the Late Archaic (Late Archaic I to
Late Archaic II) and the Toyah/Spanish Colonial
period. As a result of erosion and disturbance,
very little can be said about early Spanish
Colonial occupation of the site; Colonial-era and
Historic-era artifacts are found intermixed up to
a depth of 40 cmbs across the site (and as deep as
80 cmbs in one location). In response to potential
problems with stratigraphic integrity, analysts
focused on definable and separate isolable
components, based on all available stratigraphic
and dating information, that were unmixed or
relatively unmixed. The analyses reported here
focused on this small sample.

divided into Spanish Colonial, Texas Revolution,
post-Civil War, etc., was not feasible. Therefore,
analysis relied on diagnostic artifacts with the
goal of establishing general periods of settlement
with less consideration for spatial context.

Nature of Occupation by Analytical
Unit
Seven AUs were identified based on an
analysis of diagnostic projectile points (see Table
5-1) and radiocarbon dates of bison bone (see Table
5-2) and charcoal (see Table 5-3). These AUs are:
AU 1, Historic Euro-American; AU 2, Historic
Native American; AU 3a, Late Prehistoric–
Toyah; AU 3b, Late Prehistoric–Austin; AU 4a,
Late Archaic II; AU 4b, Late Archaic I; AU 5,
Middle Archaic; AU 6, Early Archaic; and AU
7, Late Paleoindian. While all temporal periods
are represented within the collection, some AUs,
specifically AU 1 and AU 2, were analyzed
in a more general fashion due to the imprecise
nature of these contexts (see discussion on this
above). Additionally, several diagnostic projectile
points, as well five additional bison bone dates
were identified at depths associated with historic
artifacts. While the projectile points in these
contexts hold little utility for analysis, the bison
dates are still useful for establishing a time frame
for the presence or absence of bison around
Aquarena Springs.

AU 2: Protohistoric Native American
AU 2 consists of a diagnostic Guerrero
(Mission) point and Goliad ware pottery,
suggesting a Spanish Colonial-era Native
American occupation of the site. These
artifacts are characteristic of Native American
styles from the time of the Spanish entradas
and the establishment of missions during the
Protohistoric period. The Guerrero point is a
small lanceolate arrow point that is commonly
found in association with occupations at Spanish
missions (Tomka and Fox 1999:34). Due to their
association with Spanish missions in Texas, these
points generally date from the late seventeenth
century into the eighteenth century. Goliad ware
is bone tempered with a red-brown exterior
and black interior, and originated with Native
American groups in south Texas (Tomka and Fox
1998:20). This ceramic type is common among
Spanish Colonial assemblages (Tomka and Fox
1998:20), but is also occasionally found outside
of mission contexts. Unfortunately, due to the
amount of mixing with historic material in this
site’s upper levels, it is not possible to identify
specific lots that can be included in this AU.
However, this AU supports a Native American
presence and occupation at Spring Lake during
the Spanish Colonial era.

AU 1: Historic Euro-American
This AU represents the undefined Historic
debris that was recovered primarily from the A
Horizon. Recovered artifacts included ceramics,
glass, metal, building materials, and a variety
of other debris typically associated with EuroAmerican occupations in the region during the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This debris
occurred in the upper levels of all units and often
appeared mixed with prehistoric projectile points,
some as early as the Middle Archaic. As a result
of this mixed stratigraphy, an analysis of this
assemblage allowing for this unit to be further

AU 3: Late Prehistoric (350–1200 BP)
Analyzed AUs representing the Late
Prehistoric assemblage at 41HY165 included
arrow points, faunal remains, and ceramics
overlying earlier Archaic components. This unit
was further divided into AU 3a and AU 3b.

AU 3a: Toyah

technology were most numerous during this
period. In comparison with the other periods,
the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric is
characterized by an increase in on-site core
reduction, as well as an increase in later stages
of tool production evidenced by billet flaking
technology. A flake core recovered from a unit
and level dating to the Austin period adds support
to the evidence of on-site core reduction.

AU 3a denotes the Toyah phase of the Late
Prehistoric and is distinguished by the Perdiz
style arrow point. The Toyah phase extends from
around 800 BP to as late as 350 BP in Central
Texas (Johnson 1994:257–258; Johnson and
Goode 1994:41). As these points were found in
context with later historic material, they were
not considered as contributing to the AU. Due to
the uncertain context of the Perdiz points at the
site, a single fragment of bison bone (Specimen
79-5), dating from 536 to 640 cal BP, was used
to establish AU 3a. Additional artifacts analyzed
that are representative of the Toyah phase, but not
considered to contribute to the AU 3a, include
bone-tempered ceramic sherds. Analyzed faunal
remains attributed to AU 3a included: fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds (including water
fowl), rodents, deer, and bison. More avian
material was identified in this AU than the others.
While bison remains were present, only a few
specimens represent the taxon; deer remains far
outnumbered bison remains.

Based on analyses presented in Chapter 6,
the Austin component at the site seems to stand
out from all other periods in terms of stone tool
production and technology. For instance, this
period is characterized by more expedient flake
tools and more minimally retouched unifaces
than in any other period. Additionally, knappers
were participating in more biface thinning,
billet flaking, and flaking associated with core
reduction during Austin occupation than in any
other period. However, these conclusions should
be viewed as provisional until a larger sample is
available.
Only one lot representing AU 3b was subject
to faunal analysis. This lot consisted of fish and
mammal remains that mostly represent deer.
Notably absent from this AU is the presence of
bison. Whatever cultural shifts that occurred
with the transition from dart and atlatl to bow
and arrow may have caused or can be associated
with a fundamental shift in how 41HY165 was
occupied and used during Austin times. From
their sample of 46 AMS dates, Lohse and Cholak
(2011) suggest that bison were absent from
Central Texas for approximately 1,500 years prior
to the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period.
Changes in the availability of key species, like
bison, may have resulted in new technological
approaches to ensure sustainability.

AU 3b: Austin
AU 3b represents the Austin phase,
characterized by Scallorn and Edwards style
arrow points. The Austin phase extends from
1200 BP up to the onset of Toyah (Collins
2004:122). At 41HY165, Scallorn and Edwards
points are found between depths of 33 and 43
cmbs. This AU is also entirely within the A
Horizon. A piece of charred wood (Specimen
65-7) associated with an Edwards/Scallorn type
projectile point was submitted for radiocarbon
dating. The date returned from this sample was
between 793 and 915 cal BP, well within the age
range of the Austin interval.
Analysis indicated that lithic tool production
was highest at 41HY165 during Austin times.
EFTs, MRUs, and biface thinning via billet

Other factors that may have resulted in
prehistoric occupation of the site during this AU
191

include climate. Around AD 1200, a drought
affected parts of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson
and Goode 1994), causing streams and rivers to
dry up. This may have caused people to aggregate
around the ever-present springs that currently
form Spring Lake. The springs were capable
of supporting smaller-bodied game like deer
and fish, and probably supported larger human
populations during times when water was scarce
elsewhere. Chert resources were also readily
available to 41HY165 occupants.

population increase at 41HY165 from the Late
Archaic I to Late Archaic II. This is further
supported by an increase in burned rock mass
and associated faunal remains. This peak of
burned rock in Late Archaic II coincides with
peaks in small mammal, turtle, and other nonpiscean lower vertebrates. It also correlates with
a decrease in bison and an increase in medium
artiodactyla, suggesting an ever-increasing
reliance on deer and pronghorn as top prey choice
during this period.

AU 4: Late Archaic (1200–4300 BP)

AU 4b: Late Archaic I

The Late Archaic is a long period that
incorporates a large volume of meaningful
cultural variation in terms of adaptive behaviors.
Problems with recognizing this variation and
refining its chronological schemes have to do with
the degree to which remains from different Late
Archaic intervals are often found compressed,
mixed, or otherwise poorly resolved. This is
often the result of climatic processes that are
unfavorable to stratigraphic resolution and
clarity. Coupled with cultural processes that
involve digging shallow pits for earth ovens,
strata from this period are commonly mixed or
altogether absent. Still, given long enough spans
of time, the Late Archaic can be subdivided into
finer chronological units.

AU 4b represents the Late Archaic I
component at the site, dating from 4300 BP to
2550 BP (Johnson and Goode 1994:34). This AU
is defined by a Pedernales point, a Morhiss point,
and two bison bone dates. However, there is no
indication that Pedernales and Morhiss points at
41HY165 represent the same occupation. Lithic
analysis does, however, indicate that fashioned
flake tools were more heavily used during the
Late Archaic I, making them less expedient.
Faunal analysis suggests a reliance on
small-bodied vertebrates has decreased with
respect to the medium-sized Artiodactyla and
bison. A reliance on fish, however, increases
in occurrence from Middle Archaic, along
with most other groups. Deer limb and dental
material plus medium-sized artiodactyl limb
fragments indicate that these mammals were
a consistent part of the subsistence base. The
presence of fetal/juvenile material indicates at
least one spring hunting event occurred during
this period. Medium-sized artiodactyls appear
to gain significance in Late Archaic I even as
bison material increases in frequency from the
previous Middle Archaic scarcity.

AU 4a: Late Archaic II
The Late Archaic II subperiod (2550–1200
BP) has been defined by the presence of Ensor,
Fairland, and Marcos point styles, in addition
to bison bone dates, and charcoal radiocarbon
dates. This is the largest AU at 41HY165, with
over 2,400 associated artifacts identified across
different units and at different elevations (see
Table 5-4).
The frequency of discarded projectile points
in this AU suggests that there was a significant
192

AU 5: Middle Archaic (5600–4300 BP)

directly above the Big Sandy point was dated to
1871 to 1985 cal BP (Specimen 146-8). Finally,
a charcoal sample from the level below the Early
Stemmed point came back at 4162 to 4409 cal
BP. The range of dates from the Gower point
level to the level below the Early Stemmed point
brackets these levels, and these Late Paleoindian
points, within the Late Archaic and possibly as
early as the late Middle Archaic. As such, the
contexts of these points are all problematic, and
this disparity cannot be explained. Although
excavation notes do not indicate that there had
been any disturbance within these units, the
charcoal dates do not support the earlier dates
indicated by the points. Therefore, AUs for the
Early Archaic and the Late Paleoindian periods
have not been established for 41HY165.

The Middle Archaic at 41HY165 is
represented by a single Travis point. The
relative intensity of site occupation as indicated
by discarded point frequency suggests a slight
increase from the proceeding Early Archaic
(AU 6). Biface frequency in comparison to time
is also highest during the Middle Archaic, and
minimally retouched unifaces appear to be used
more heavily. These lithic observations point
towards a more maintainable and curated tool kit,
suggesting that people visiting 41HY165 during
the Middle Archaic may have practiced collector
strategies.
Faunal analysis indicates that mediumsized mammals, including medium artiodactyls,
are present and appear to be a more significant
resource than small mammals during this period.
No bison remains were recovered from Middle
Archaic sediments.

Chronology
Multiple lines of evidence were called
upon to reconstruct the occupational history
at 41HY165. Two dating techniques were used,
cross-dating and radiocarbon dating, both
characterized by various degrees of precision
and certainty. Cross-dating was accomplished
through the use of temporally diagnostic artifacts
or artifact technologies that have been well-dated
elsewhere. Absolute radiocarbon dates were
collected through the use of AMS analysis of
organic remains.

AU 6: Early Archaic and Late
Paleoindian
These two periods are represented at
41HY165 by five projectile points. However,
these artifacts derive from questionable contexts
and were not included in this analysis. The
Early Archaic period is represented by three
projectile points, an Early Archaic Stemmed,
an Early Archaic Split-Stemmed, and a Gower
point. Two projectile points date to the Late
Paleoindian period, and include a Golondrina
point and a Big Sandy (early side-notched) point.
The problematic (late) date from the Gower
level also indicates a poor context for the lower
points. Additional dates from the underlying
levels also confirm a poor context for the Late
Paleoindian projectile points; a charcoal sample
from the same level as the Golondrina point
dates from 1608 to 1724 cal BP (Specimen 12026). A charcoal sample from below this level and

Radiocarbon dates can produce conflicting
results depending on sampling procedures, which
in turn may lead to different interpretations about
site chronology. Of the twenty-four absolute
dates from 41HY165, twenty-two of these were
obtained during the analysis conducted by CAS.
Samples submitted for dating were selected to
simultaneously address several questions, most
importantly those establishing chronological
control. There was also a need to verify
earlier analysis that concluded that intact Late
193

Paleoindian strata were present here. Additionally,
a directed study (Giesecke 1998) identified bison
presence during the Middle Archaic. The absence
of any bison from excavated Middle Archaic
contexts elsewhere at Spring Lake (Lohse and
Cholak 2011) casts doubt on this conclusion.
Consequently, providing a more robust sample
of directly-dated bison remains was a second
priority for the current analysis.

use of the site during Toyah, Spanish Colonial,
and Historic periods.
Through combining all temporal diagnostic
data, the following site chronology appears
(Table 12-1). Note that two absolute dates were
obtained for a Scallorn and a Marcos Point
from organic material recovered from the same
provenience. Earlier analysis concluded that
intact Late Paleoindian strata were present at
41HY165; however, CAS was unable to verify
this through the current project. While projectile
points attributed to this period were recovered,
the associated radiocarbon dates returned from
contexts in which the points were recovered
were problematic, and did not correspond to
currently established radiocarbon years for
Late Paleoindian archaeological periods. The
chronological data do, however, support a robust
prehistoric occupation of the site during the Late
Archaic period (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic
II).

Twelve samples of bison bone were selected
from across the stratigraphic column at 41HY165
(see results by provenience in Appendix B).
The results of these assays, determined to be
in proper stratigraphic order, were used to help
further define AUs. An additional 12 radiocarbon
assays on carbon, wood, or carbonized wood
supplemented the bison dates. All but two samples
(Beta-117967 and ISGS-A1966) were pretreated at the University of Oregon Radiocarbon
Laboratory, with the prepared targets submitted
to the AMS Laboratory at the University of
California at Irvine. Bone samples were pretreated using the XAD purification technique
developed by Thomas Stafford (Stafford et al.
1988, 1991). The result is highly reliable, highprecision AMS dates with standard deviations of
as little as 15 years in some cases, and 20 years
for most samples.

Subsistence Economy and Technological
Variation
Bison in Local and Regional Economies
Mauldin et al. (2012) have observed a marked
increase in a reliance on bison by the beginning of
the Toyah period. This shift in resource utilization
coincided with changing climate and may have
been in partial response to it, as weather patterns
became both drier and more variable. Faunal
evidence recovered from 41HY165 supports an
increase reliance on bison resources during the
Toyah period, placing 41HY165 well within the
regional cultural pattern identified by Mauldin
et al. (2012). A previous study (Giesecke 1998),
however, identified bison present during the
Middle Archaic at 41HY165. This conclusion
contradicted the results of analysis conducted by
CAS on the recovered faunal remains, as no bison

Cross-dating diagnostic artifacts (projectile
points and ceramics known to have been
manufactured at specific times in the past) with
recovered archaeological deposits indicated that
the range of occupation and/or use of 41HY165
extended, at minimum, from the Early Archaic/
Late Paleoindian through Spanish Colonial
and Historic times. In terms of projectile point
chronology, the site is best represented by
those dated to the Late Archaic. This is further
supported by bison and charcoal radiocarbon
dates. Ceramic data support occupation and/or

remains could be unquestionably placed within
Middle Archaic AUs. Bison instead appears to
increase in importance during Late Archaic I,
then to decrease until it becomes absent in the
Austin phase, only to dramatically increase in
importance again during the Toyah phase. These
data lead to the questioning of the importance of
bison resources to the prehistoric occupants of
41HY165.

In contrast to a reliance on bison resources,
the prehistoric occupants of 41HY165 appear
to have focused instead on deer or pronghorn
antelope, small mammals, and aquatics. The
Middle Archaic is characterized by a dependence
on deer and pronghorn antelope and other
small mammals, supported by turtles and lower
vertebrates. By the Late Archaic I, deer and
antelope remains drop significantly as bison

195

dominates the assemblage, which continues to
be supported by small mammals, turtles, and
other lower vertebrates. However, during the
Late Archaic II period, bison is replaced by deer
and antelope, while small vertebrates continue to
increase. While the absence of bison during the
Austin phase can be attributed to poor recovery,
the Toyah phase displays a dramatic increase of
bison remains. Interestingly, the Toyah phase is
also characterized by a significant increase of
turtle, fish, and other lower vertebrates; small
mammals, however, do not show an increase
during this period.

towards bison exploitation or the intensification
of plant resources (Thoms 2008). However, this
increase in burned rock may also reflect changing
mobility and settlement patterns related to
increased regional population.
In regards to 41HY165, there appears to be
a steady increase in the standardized frequency
of burned rock weights from the Middle Archaic
through both phases of the Late Archaic (Late
Archaic I and Late Archaic II), with a peak during
Late Archaic II. This is followed by a significant
decrease during the Austin phase, which may be
indicative of a reduced use of the site or a lack
of archaeological material that can be securely
dated to this analytical period. The Toyah phase,
however, is characterized by a dramatic increase
in frequency of burned rock.

When considered together, these data begin
to sketch a scenario in which the inhabitants
of 41HY165 maintained a relatively stable and
continuous occupation characterized by a reliance
on locally available riverine faunal resources. At
times, this included bison, but as indicated by
the faunal assemblage, this reliance was always
supported by small mammals and aquatics. The
dramatic increase of not only bison remains
but of turtle, fish, and other lower vertebrates
during the Toyah phase may be an indicator of
population increase that resulted in local resource
intensification. Overall, the small amounts of
recovered bison remains suggests that bison did
not play a significant role in the local and regional
economies of prehistoric occupants of 41HY165.

In an exploration of the relationship between
faunal remains and burned rock frequencies,
faunal analysis included a comparison of burned
rock mass with faunal bone NISP based on the
hypothesis that an increase in burned rock mass
indicates an increase in food processing and/or
broadening of the subsistence base. In general,
standardized faunal bone NISP trends followed
that of the standardized burned rock mass in all
periods except for the Protohistoric, where burned
rock mass drops off dramatically following the
Toyah phase. An increase in frequency from the
Middle Archaic to Late Archaic was noted, with a
drop in the Austin prior to the upswing presented
in the Toyah phase. As noted in the faunal
analysis section of this report, the Austin phase
drop may be the result of poor sampling. Contrary
to the belief that increase in burned rock mass
correlates with increase in bison exploitation,
there appears to be a dip in bison remains from
the Late Archaic I forward, as burned rock mass
appears to increase with a peak during the Late
Archaic II. This decrease, however, is replaced

Burned Rock Technology
A review of the standardized frequency of
burned rock weights indicates peaks in the Late
Archaic II (AU 4a) and the Toyah phase (AU 3a)
with the Toyah phase displaying a much larger
increase in burned rock in relation to the other
AUs. The frequency of burned rock weights is
often used as a proxy for measuring subsistence
intensification within a local or regional
population. These increases are often perceived
as indicators of a subsistence economy shifting

196

by an upswing during the Toyah phase, when
burned rock mass reaches its maximum extent
along with a slight increase in bison remains.
There does appear to be a correlation between
medium-sized Artiodactyla (deer and pronghorn
antelope) and burned rock mass frequencies.
Faunal analysis indicated that deer and pronghorn
antelope remains tend to correlate with increase
burned rock mass frequencies, suggesting an
ever-increasing reliance on deer and pronghorn
as top prey choice for the prehistoric occupants
of 41HY165.

Archaic I (AU 4b) AU are most likely associated
with packing material. One such large granule
encountered was consistent with starch from
Hordeum sp. As this starch is associated with a
grass seedhead, there is little reason to infer the
purposeful roasting of this resource, although it is
possible that the granule is associated with stone
boiling. Grass phytoliths were also recovered
in small quantities from several other features,
indicating that grass stems were commonly used
as packing material. Approximately 20 granules
consistent with a Polygonum sp. fruit were also
recovered from a Late Archaic I feature. Again,
this is likely to be from the use of this botanical
resource as a packing material, although it could
also be associated with stone boiling.

Eighteen burned rock samples were submitted
to AEL at Texas A&M University to recover
and identify plant microfossil remains from the
surfaces of the rocks. Samples were chosen from
levels that correspond to AUs. Of the 18 samples
submitted, only 12 contained plant microfossils
that included starch granules and phytoliths.
Analysis was conducted by Dr. Timothy E. Riley,
and is presented in Chapter 9.

In addition to the above-described starch
granules, four unknown morphotypes were also
encountered during the analysis. One, labeled
Unknown D, was the most common starch granule
encountered in the study. It has some similarities
with a mesquite starch type in Giovannetti et al.
(2008), but the large facets and overall angularity
limit a secure identification. Based on the size,
angular shape, and open hilum, the botanical
source for this starch morphotype is probably a
geophyte or aquatic type resource.

Dr. Riley indicated that several of the FCR
samples contained starch granules consistent
with geophytes in the Araceae family, with the
most likely source as arrow arum (Peltandra
sp.). While this was an important ethnographic
food resource in the Eastern Woodlands
(Messner 2008), there is no historic record of
this resource being consumed in Texas. At
least one species, Peltandra virginica, however,
does occur in the state. There were also several
granules morphologically consistent with the
starch encountered in Yucca sp. throughout the
assemblage. This could be the result of roasting
yucca flower stalks as a food resource, or the
use of yucca leaves as a packing material during
roasting.

In consideration of the presented data,
it appears that the prehistoric occupants of
41HY165 utilized burned rock technology as a
means of processing acquired game animals,
most likely deer and pronghorn antelope. Faunal
analysis has indicated the presence of burned
faunal remains, with peaks in frequency during
the Late Archaic I, Late Archaic II, and the
Toyah phase, corresponding to peaks of burned
rock frequency. This evidence, coupled with the
microfossil analysis indicating that plant remains
encountered on submitted burned rock samples
are indicative of packing material and not plant

The other identifiable starch granules

occupants of 41HY165 focused on meat roasting
and not plant processing in the utilization of
burned rock technology.

a rise in small mammals and lower vertebrates.
A slight decrease in bison remains is supplanted
by an increase in deer/antelope, including
juvenile/fetal remains, again suggesting a spring
occupation of the site.

Conclusions

Based on the recovered material, a
cautious interpretation would be that 41HY165
experienced a significant drop in occupation
during the Austin phase. This, however, may be
the result of sampling error due to poor recovery
of material dated to this period. With this in
mind, it is difficult to speculate on the nature of
occupation of 41HY165 during this time. The
site was most likely utilized, as faunal remains,
burned rock, and projectile points dating to this
period have been recovered; nevertheless, there
are insufficient data to infer the nature of this
occupation.

The springs that feed Spring Lake and serve
as the headwaters of the San Marcos River have
attracted human populations for over 11,500
years. Their location within an ecotonal zone
(a transition area between two adjoining largescale environmental provinces) provided a
diversity of fauna and flora resources capable
of supporting dense human occupations. It may
have been these springs in conjunction with the
abundant resources of the area that first attracted
prehistoric inhabitants to 41HY165.
Temporally diagnostic projectile points
suggest that early occupation may have occurred
during the Early Archaic/Paleoindian period.
This is further confirmed by absolute dates,
conclusively placing early occupation of the site
in the Middle Archaic period. During this time,
the inhabitants of 41HY165 utilized burned rock
technology most likely in the roasting of acquired
local game animals, with deer and/or antelope
appearing as the prey of choice.

The low frequency of remains from the
Austin phase is quickly replaced by an abundance
of material recovered from Toyah phase contexts.
A sharp spike in burned rock technology
indicates the greatest use of this technology at
41HY165 during this period. This is coupled with
increases in all faunal remains, including bison.
The presence of limb fragments is suggestive
of resource distribution. Again, the presence of
juvenile bone supports a spring occupation. It is
also during this period that ceramic remains first
appear.

Occupation of 41HY165 continued through
Late Archaic I, with an increase utilization of
burned rock technology and the inclusion of
bison in the diet breadth. Deer/antelope remain
an important component, and fish utilization
increases from the Middle Archaic. The recovery
of juvenile/fetal bison remains from this period
suggests a spring occupation of the site. Increased
burned rock technology continues through
the Late Archaic II, where it peaks. There is a
decreased reliance on fish during this period, but

Spanish Colonial era occupation of the
site continues as supported by the recovery of
a Guerrero projectile point and Goliad style
ceramics. Undefined Historic debris (ceramics,
glass, metal, building materials, etc.) recovered
from the upper levels of 41HY165 support a
continued occupation through the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.

198

In general, it appears that 41HY165 was
actively occupied from at least the Middle Archaic
through to the Historic period. Prehistoric
occupation of the site was characterized by a
utilization of burned rock technology for roasting

locally acquired game animals, which at times
included bison. A strong argument can be made
for the occupations/utilization of this site during
the spring season, due to the recovery of juvenile/
fetal deer and bison remains.

Order Caudata (Oppel, 1811)
Family, Genus, Species Indeterminate
Referred Specimens
106-20, scapula(?), burned.

Archaeological Context
AU 3a: 106-2.

Remarks
A burned bone that resembles a Cryptobranchus (hell-bender) scapula, figured in Holman (1995:Figure
30, 107) has been identified from Lot 106-2. Final identification of this specimen is suspect, as there
currently is no known record of Cryptobranchidae from the Pleistocene of Texas (Holman 1995).

* as cited in Vullo et al. (2011).

Remarks
A relatively large number of frog or toad remains were identified from one lot, with a few specimens
from three other lots in two AUs. Certainly across AU 3a and AU 4a this represents more than one
individual, but may also within AU 4a.

Remarks
Turtle material was found in all AUs except 3b, where very little faunal material was recovered overall.
Much of the turtle assemblage derives from shells that were probably no more than 30 cm, cranialcaudal. Scute lines and sculpting suggest families Kinosternidae and Emydidae, present at Spring Lake
today, are represented. However, the material is heavily comminuted and no diagnostic material was
recognized.

Remarks
A large percentage of this material could probably be assigned to Artiodactyla, medium, but with a low
degree of confidence on the part of the analyst. Some specimens may also be assignable to such taxa as
Canidae, but lack diagnostic features to allow such.

Mammalia, Fetal/Juvenile
Referred Specimens
123-35, fetal burned bone; 152-47, fetal/juvenile bone fragments; 291-11, juvenile(?) bone fragments;
299-40, bone fragment; 299-49, bone fragment, 299-51, burned bone fragment; 299-50, burned fetal

AU 4a: 123-35, 291-11, 299-40, 299-49, 299-51, 299-50, 522-44; AU 4b: 152-47.

Remarks
Specimens described here as fetal mammal exhibit porous cortex, unfused and very spongy epiphyseal
surfaces, and fall into the small mammal size category. They would be comparable in size to a small
house cat. Logically, as a perinate or neonate, skeletal material of this size would probably belong to
a mammal that, upon reaching full growth, would likely fall in to the medium mammal or medium
artiodactyl size category.

Remarks
It is of interest to note that Sigmodon is nearly but not entirely ubiquitous throughout the
archaeostratigraphy at 41HY165. Two species of Sigmodon are reported in Texas. Sigmodon
ochrognathus occurs in the Chisos Mountains, Big Bend area, and S. hispidus occurs widespread
across the state (Schmidley and Davis 2004). Steele (1986) gives a tentative identification of S. hispidus
occurring in nearly all strata sampled at 41LK201. He notes the presence of S. ochrognathus in Texas
also, reviews its western occurrence, and therefore justifies an ecological interpretation of grassland
habitat at the time of deposition at 41LK201.

Genus Neotoma (Say and Ord, 1825)
Referred Specimens
522-38, left humerus.

Archaeological Context
AU 4a: 522-38.

Remarks
Several species of this genus occur in Texas today, but two have records in Hays County. Neotoma
floridana (Eastern wood rat) ranges in the eastern 1/3 of the state up to the edge of the Balcones
Escarpment, and Neotoma albigula (white-throated wood rat) in western Texas down through the
Panhandle and on the Edwards Plateau to include the very western corner of Hays County (Schmidley
and Davis 2004). Specimens of dental and skeletal material from nearby 41HY160 have been compared
with N. floridana and N. albigula, and appear to have traits of both taxa (Timperley, n.d.). N. albigula
prefers cactus, mesquite, forbes, and to lesser extent, grasses. N. floridana prefers wooded, brushy
309

habitat. Given these preferences, it is inferred that the Spring Lake area could conceivably host both
species. Due to the paucity of material in this study, no species designation is provided here, but the
immediate area of the site would be preferable to N. floridana today.
