Chapter 1: Introduction
THE SITE
Berger Bluff is an archeological site located near the city of Victoria, on the Gulf
coastal plain of Texas. Cultural debris is scattered at various levels, possibly throughout
this eight-meter high bluff fronting on Coleto Creek. This is a study of
paleoenvironmental data from the earliest and most deeply buried part of the site — the
"bench" deposits, thought to date from about 8500-11,000 radiocarbon years before
present [a brief discussion of kinds of years (radiocarbon and calendar years) and dating
problems will be found at the head of the next chapter]. From an archeological viewpoint,
the most interesting and significant find in the bench deposits is a small concentration of
animal bone believed to represent human dietary remains (Brown 1996), but the
vertebrates will not be addressed in this study except as environmental indicators; other
kinds of cultural debris will only see brief mention.
The environmental history of this part of Texas is not very well known, especially
for this relatively early time. Most of the emphasis here is on climate as the paramount
driving force behind environmental change. I will begin by briefly reviewing — from a
global perspective — two key concepts of climate change (rapidity or abruptness and
cyclicity) and our prospects for recognizing them in the archeological record. Because
there is clear evidence for cyclic sedimentation in the bench deposits, the key problem
here is to determine whether changes in the sediments are driven by repetitive changes in
regional climate, looking for patterned changes in biota (mollusks, diatoms, and
vertebrates) at stratigraphic boundaries to answer this question.

1

I will also argue that new data and research methods should spur Texas
archeologists to rethink conventional notions of how environments changed at the end of
the last ice age. The main purpose of this first chapter is to give the reader an overview of
environmental changes at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition from a global viewpoint,
and in the second part of this chapter I will review the history of site excavation and the
contemporary climate, vegetation, and hydrology of the study area. In Chapter 2, I will
narrow the focus both chronologically (looking at the 8500-11,000 BP period) and
geographically (looking at environments in the Guadalupe and San Antonio River
drainage basins and at changes in the adjacent Gulf of Mexico). Matters such as
radiocarbon calibration, changing sea level, and comparable paleoenvironmental sites
will be discussed there.
Paleoclimates and paleoenvironments
The term "paleoenvironment" refers to past environmental conditions: plants,
animals, climate, soils, and depositional processes. The term "paleoclimates" refers to
past atmospheric conditions, and although climate is only one part of the environment, it
is generally thought to be a prime mover affecting not only depositional processes, but
the distributions of plants and animals as well. Other kinds of paleoenvironmental forces
have been identified (plant or animal pathogens, for example, or fires set by people), but
none seem to be as important as climate for modifying the environment, which is why
many of the following pages will be devoted to looking for a climatic signal in the
environmental data from Berger Bluff.

THE PROBLEM: ABRUPT OR GRADUAL CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE DAWN OF THE
HOLOCENE?
Human occupation of Texas spans the frontier between two geologic epochs: the
Pleistocene (which begins at least 1.8 million years ago, before human entry of the New
World, and lasts until about 10,000 radiocarbon years before the present) and the
Holocene (from the end of the Pleistocene to the present). These two geologic epochs
have climatic meaning as well, and the climatic transition between the two was perhaps
the greatest environmental challenge ever faced by the native occupants of North
America until the advent of European exploration.

This transition in Texas has been viewed (based chiefly on fossil pollen evidence
acquired during the 1960s and 1970s) as one of gradual, non-episodic warming and
drying (Bryant 1969:145; Bryant and Holloway 1985:56). Bryant and Shafer (1977: 19)
go so far as to assert that "...the changes were demonstrably gradual, occurred over
several thousand years and probably went completely unnoticed by successive
generations of aborigines." This model of climatic transition has now probably taken on
the status of received wisdom among most Texas archeologists, and is still accepted by
other archeologists elsewhere, like Michael Jochim, who asserts "...that seemingly
discrete environmental stages are a product of poor chronological resolution. In reality,
environmental changes were generally slow relative to human lifetimes and would have
been perceived as gradual changes in relative proportions of habitats and resources, not
abrupt replacements" (Jochim 1996:358). Some Texas archeologists and paleontologists,
however (cf. Bousman 1994; Collins 1995; Holliday 1995; Toomey, Blum, and Valastro
1993), have called attention to empirical evidence for alternating wetter and drier periods
3

in the late Pleistocene and Holocene, although none have explicitly addressed the
question of abruptness. As Thompson (1981) has shown in an interesting review of
American cultural attitudes toward climatic stability, the view of climate as immutable or
imperceptibly changing actually originates in the late nineteenth century.

Holloway and Bryant (1985:xii) maintain that "in Texas there does not appear to
be a sudden vegetational shift marking the traditional end of the late-glacial and the
beginning of the Holocene. Instead, what seems to be evident is that by 10,000 yrs. B.P.
the Holocene character of the vegetation in that region of North America is firmly
established. In another region of North America, the Great Lakes...the close proximity of
that geographical area to the retreating ice sheets created a much quicker climate shift
which is expressed vegetationally as a rapid change over the relatively short period
of...1,000 years."

Climatologists Reid Bryson and Wayne Wendland are two of the chief American
critics of this model of gradual, monotonic change. Referring to Holocene climates,
Bryson explains,

Prior to the introduction and widespread use of dating methods such as
radiocarbon, and the availability of detailed time-profiles of climatic proxies, the
concept of Holocene climatic variation was one of slow "warming" to some
optimum followed by a similarly slow monotonic "cooling". Warming and
cooling were ill-defined and, by context, could be referred to as regional to
global.... As the volume of evidence grew, it became clear that the idea of a
smooth simple variation was untenable. With detailed analyses, especially by
European palynologists, distinct times of more rapid change were recognized, as
well as details that suggested moisture variations that did not parallel the
temperature inferences. The concept arose of distinct episodes, internally fairly
homogeneous but with rather rapid transitions at their termini. This concept is
now associated with the work of Blytt and Sernander, two palynologists. On the
4

basis of qualitative evaluation of the European pollen record, they divided the
Holocene into a series of episodes identified as being warm and wet, cold and
wet, warm and dry, and cold and dry (Bryson 1987:1).

Wendland and Bryson have likewise adapted the Blytt-Sernander scheme for
North America (Wendland 1978). Notwithstanding their periodization, we now know
that, contrasted with the rest of the Quaternary, the Holocene has been a period of
comparative stability (Ditlevsen, Svensmark, and Johnsen 1996) although climatic
changes, including some abrupt ones, have occurred. Our own Holocene climatic
experience has probably influenced our perception of how much abruptness is plausible.
But as paleoclimatologists know, the Holocene is not representative of the Quaternary as
a whole.

Paleontologists and archeozoologists have been far more willing than
palynologists to interpret their data in terms of episodic climatic change, at least for the
Holocene. An early example is Dillehay's (1974) postulated bison presence-absence
periods,

which

he

suggested

were

climatically

driven.

Paleontologists

and

archeozoologists working with Holocene data in the northern Midwest and adjacent
Plains (cf. Semken and Falk 1987) frequently use Wendland and Bryson's framework of
climatic episodes (Wendland 1978:Table 3), which is an expansion (with age
modifications) of the European Blytt-Sernander scheme.

Another problem arises from periodic disruptions of thermohaline circulation in
the world's oceans. Global circulation of seawater (varying in density according to
salinity) not only redistributes heat from equatorial to polar regions, it also redistributes
14

C between the ocean deep, the surface, and the atmosphere (Broecker 1995). When
5

circulation is interrupted, or replaced by intermediate water formation (a shallower
circulation mode that can drop sea surface temperatures by 5° in less than 10 years;
Rahmstorf 1994), both climate and oceanic-atmospheric radiocarbon equilibrium are
changed (Stocker and Wright 1996). The result is what is known as a "radiocarbon
plateau," an extended period of ambiguity in radiocarbon dating, signaled in calibration
programs like CALIB or OXCAL by multiple crossing points. The calibration programs
can only quantify the ambiguity, not remove it; instead, we must turn to other methods
like varve counts for precise dating. Ironically, then, it is at these very critical periods of
climatic reorganization, the transitional periods of great interest to archeologists and
paleoclimatologists alike, that the radiocarbon dating method breaks down and yields
less precise age estimates (plateau effects can also be produced by variations in the rate
of

14

C production in the atmosphere; Taylor 1987:24-33). Since cosmic ray flux is also

positively correlated with cloud cover, at least on a short-term basis (Svensmark and
Friis-Christensen 1997), there may be other linkages between climate and radiocarbon
production rates as well. I will identify and discuss the radiocarbon plateaux relevant to
Berger Bluff in more detail in the next chapter. For the time being, I suggest that this is
one of the factors that have impeded recognition of abrupt climatic changes in the past.
Ironically, at some of the climatic thresholds of greatest interest, where we particularly
need precision in order to identify abrupt climatic events, radiocarbon assays can only
provide reduced precision instead. One of these thresholds, unfortunately, is the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary.

The bench deposits at Berger Bluff bridge this transition between the Pleistocene
and Holocene. Somewhere, about midway through the section, is a buried surface
representing this time boundary, yet it is not visible, nor does it appear to be marked by
6

any abrupt changes in biotic content. This might be taken as an argument in favor of the
Bryant-Shafer model of gradual change, but as we will see, there is some evidence of
abrupt change that lags at least 1500 years behind the onset of the Holocene elsewhere.
When discussing the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, most archeologists have focused on
1) megafaunal extinctions, 2) the creation of new estuarine habitats, or 3) the evolution of
conditions favorable for agriculture. I will instead examine the evidence for habitat
deletion on the Texas Gulf coastal plain.

New data suggest abrupt climate change
Meanwhile, new data and methods have arrived to challenge the prevailing view of
gradual climatic change. Much of the new research is motivated (and funded) by concern
with global warming. The first generation of analytical results from deep cores drilled
more than three kilometers through the ice pack at the summit of Greenland by the
Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP, a multinational European Science Foundation project,
with drilling in 1990-1992) and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2, a US
project drilled in 1989-1993) are now available (Alley 2000a, b; Johnsen et al. 2001).
Unlike the Antarctic ice cores obtained earlier (Vostok, Byrd, and others), the Greenland
cores can be dated with almost annual precision down to about 50,000 calendar years BP,
and the results suggest that at the end of the Pleistocene, the ice accumulation rate
doubled in just three years, with most of the change occurring in a single year (Alley et
al. 1993:529; Fig. 2). Likewise, the

18

O signal in the ice jumped by about 4 ‰ in 20

years (Stuiver, Grootes, and Braziunas 1995:350, Figs. 10, 11, 13). The δ 18O content is
a proxy measure of temperature, with about 0.25 ‰ corresponding to a one-degree
Celsius change in temperature (Stuiver and Grootes 2000:278). Insoluble dust
concentrations decrease from Pleistocene to Holocene levels in about 10 years (Zielinski
7

and Mershon 1997:550); alkaline dust concentrations fluctuate abruptly over periods less
than 10 years long (Taylor et al. 1993:435, Fig. 2). Stuiver and Grootes (2000) studied 13
of the cold-to-warm transitions in the late Pleistocene-early Holocene and found that the
onset is typically very fast (the midpoint is reached in only two years), peaking in about
50 years. Figure 1.0 shows a couple of examples of abrupt climatic change at the onset
of the Holocene. Fig. 1.0, panel "a" shows a very abrupt decrease in calcium content in
the GISP2 ice core at the end of the Younger Dryas (11,640 calendar years BP).

A recent summary statement by Taylor et al. (1997) is based on several years of
study of all the various climate proxies from the GISP2 core. They conclude that
...the transition between the Younger Dryas and Holocene climate periods
occurred over a 40-year period.... most of the transition occurred in a series of
steps with durations of about 5 years. Some climate proxies associated with midlatitude sources appear to have changed about 15 years before climate proxies
associated with more northern regions (Taylor et al. 1997:825).
Ice accumulation rates increase as the temperature rises, and this was initially
interpreted as a 7° C (12.6° F) warming (Dansgaard, White, and Johnsen 1989), later
revised with isotope and borehole temperature data to a 15° (27° F) warming from
"average glacial conditions" to the Holocene and a 20° (36° F) warming from the Late
Glacial to the Holocene (Cuffey et al. 1995; Cuffey and Clow 1997). Johnsen et al.
(1995) have derived an even more extreme estimate of 22° C (about 40° F), but note that
these last estimates of 15° to 22° C pertain to much longer (unspecified) timespans than
three years. A similar event appears in Scandinavian marine cores as a rapid (about 80
years) warming of surface water (about 9° C) at about 10,200 radiocarbon years BP
(Jiang and Klingberg 1996; Karpuz and Jansen 1992: Fig. 9, 510, reproduced here as Fig.
1.0, panel "b").

Modeling of nitrogen and argon fractionation in the GISP2 core suggests a 5-10° C step
increase over a matter of decades, with a 15° increase after about 1500 years
(Severinghaus et al. 1998:145). In boreal or littoral areas, at least, abrupt changes of
climate like these would presumably have posed a severe environmental challenge for
human populations — a survival problem perhaps not covered by the existing cultural
repertoire. If the most rapid flux occurred in less than a single human generation, could
the direct impact of such an event be recognized somewhere in the archeological record?
The abrupt warming event seen in the GISP2 core occurs about 160 years after the most
recent securely dated Folsom component (Taylor, Stuiver, and Reimer 1996:665) and
perhaps midway during the accumulation of the bench sediments at Berger Bluff.

Cuffey et al. (1995) point out that estimates of the same transition in low midlatitude areas are about 4° to 6° C, but global temperature changes are magnified in the
Arctic. This evidence of dramatically abrupt change has led to a new model of climatic
"mode-switching" involving changes in atmospheric and North Atlantic Deep Water
circulation (Fairbanks 1993) and episodic dust loading (Overpeck et al. 1996). A new
Antarctic ice core to be drilled by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica
(EPICA) is planned for the years 1996-2000 and may eventually provide southern
hemisphere data comparable in quality and extent to that of the Greenland cores.
What happened in continental interiors?
If Arctic temperatures jumped dramatically by 22° C, or even a more conservative
7° in just a few years at the threshold of the Holocene, what happened in the continental
interior of North America, particularly in lower latitudes? Temperature departure or
"anomaly" maps (maps of the calculated difference between modern and glacial
10

conditions) produced by climatic modeling suggest that the most extreme temperature
differences between present and full-glacial or late glacial climates were markedly
concentrated in the polar regions, especially in the northern hemisphere (Peteet 1987:Fig.
2, 11,000 BP; Kutzbach 1987:Figs. 3, 7; CLIMAP Project Members 1981:Maps 5A and
5B, 18,000 BP). If, as it now appears, changes in ocean circulation were a major cause of
abrupt climate changes (see Bond 1995), the process would have been global, but the
most dramatic effect would have been in the north Atlantic region (northeastern North
America, Greenland, and Europe). Analyzed at 200-year intervals, pollen records from
the eastern US show "rapid" rates of change at the onset of the Holocene, but chiefly
between about 40° and 50° latitude (Grimm and Jacobson 1992:181). Studies of fossil
chironomids from lakes at about 49° N in British Columbia show a dramatic rise in July
air temperature from the Younger Dryas into the early Holocene, perhaps as much as 7-9°
C (although the radiocarbon dating is not well resolved; Palmer et al. 2002:Fig. 8).
Temperature departures in more southerly latitudes, especially near the Gulf of Mexico,
must have been less extreme. Indeed, simulations of other variables such as surface
winds, precipitation departures, and atmospheric pressure suggest departures were much
less pronounced over Texas than in boreal regions (Kutzbach 1987:Figs. 4-6, 8-10).
Empirical studies of glacial-aged proxy data also suggest that temperatures rose steeply
away from the southern border of the Laurentide ice sheet (about 1.3 to 3.0° C of
temperature per degree of latitude, compared to 0.3 to 1.0° C for the same region today;
Curry and Delorme 2002:199). At Bellefontaine Quarry near St. Louis, ostracod data
indicate mean annual temperature was about 10° C below today (Curry and Delorme
2003). In Texas, studies of chlorine isotopes and noble gas content in groundwater from
Atascosa and McMullen County suggest the mean annual temperature was about 5° C
lower at 12,000-17,000 RCYBP than at present (Stute et al. 1993). Packrat midden data
11

from the same timespan in south-central New Mexico suggest a July maximum
temperature depression of 3.5° to 5° C (and a climate about 20% wetter than present;
Betancourt et al. 2001). A similar difference of 5.4±0.7° C for the San Juan basin was
obtained by Stute and Bonani (1995). Packrat midden data from southern Nevada suggest
mean annual temperature was about 8° C colder than today at 20,500-18,000 RCYBP,
and about 5.5° C colder at 14,000-11,500 RCYBP (Thompson, Anderson, and Bartlein
1999a:34). Dutton (1995) suggests that middle to late Wisconsinan recharge temperatures
of groundwater on the Llano Estacado were about 5-8° C cooler than average Holocene
temperatures. However, note that Johnson (1987:98) estimates that Clovis period winter
minimum temperatures at Lubbock Lake were about 0° C, compared to -18° C today,
with the summer maximum about 28° to 32° C, compared to 38° C today. Terrestrial
records from tropical and subtropical areas suggest late glacial sea surface temperatures
were 4.2 to 8° C cooler than at present; strontium/calcium temperature estimates from
coral reefs in the southwest Pacific show sea surface temperatures about 4-6° C colder
than today at about 9350 radiocarbon years BP (Beck et al. 1997; Gagan et al. 2000). A
more recent review puts tropical sea surface temperatures at about 2.5° C cooler than
present at the last glacial maximum (Crowley 2000; see also Lea, Pak, and Spero 2000).

Unfortunately, most of the general circulation models that have been done so far
have been run at 3000-year intervals on grids that are about 250-800 km in size, and these
are far too coarse-grained to address the problems of abruptness or spatial variation on a
scale that is of interest to archeologists. According to Kutzbach and Ruddiman (1993:12),
3000-year intervals were chosen because bioturbation in ocean cores was thought to
prohibit finer resolution, and models were run at 12,000 BP and 9000 BP specifically to
avoid periods of rapid transition such as that at 10,000 BP. Studies of general circulation
12

models at different resolutions have shown that resolution affects the spatial accuracy of
the models (Dong and Valdes 2000). More recent research has shown that sampling of
marine cores at 1 cm intervals can provide century scale resolution, despite the effects of
bioturbation (Chapman and Shackleton 1998; but see also D. Anderson 2001). A more
recent modeling study by Bartlein and others (1998:Fig. 5, 6) suggests that in the early
Holocene (about 9900 RCYBP), winter temperatures did not greatly differ from the
present, the greatest summer temperature departures from the present are in the midwest
and northern Plains, the greatest winter precipitation departures from the present were
located in the Rocky Mountain area, and the greatest summer departures were in Florida
and the midwest.

Long, but very fine-grained terrestrial records are needed for comparison with the
ice core record, and varved lake sediments are probably the only kind of record that can
approach the continuous detail seen in the ice cores (Colman 1996). In the last couple of
decades, some palynologists have begun to extract samples as thin as 2 mm, with each
sample in some cases representing as little as a couple of years of accumulation (Turner
and Peglar 1988:754). Unfortunately, while many of the existing deep lake cores show
clear evidence of major excursions by various proxy measures near the PleistoceneHolocene boundary, the sediment cores are often dated not by varve counts, but by
radiocarbon assays that are too few and too widely spaced (intervening segments are
"dated" by interpolating sedimentation rates). As a result, there is often evidence of
environmental change, but it is impossible to tell how rapid it was, or exactly when it
occurred. The ice core data have posed an entirely new research question that
paleolimnologists need to address by targeting the parts of their cores that span the
Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition for very close-interval studies, with multiple AMS
13

assays, if necessary. The discovery of rapid change in the Greenland record has
stimulated the search for comparably resolved paleolimnological records from
continental interiors, but because these findings are so recent, it will be a few years
before these studies are completed. A number of high-resolution records from freshwater
lakes have recently become available, but many (Butler 1985; Bradbury and Dean 1993)
are from sediment cores extracted before the Greenland research. Previous records like
the Oxford Lake-Levels Data Bank (tabulated in thousand-year units) are too coarsegrained to address the question of rapid change. New programs are getting underway, like
the European Lake Drilling Programme (ELDP), another European Science Foundation
project to run from 1996 to the year 2000, and here in the US, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has likewise funded some paleolimnological
studies in the northern Plains, although there are not many sites in that area with records
that reach into the Pleistocene. Recent research at Kråkenes Lake on the western coast of
Norway ought to serve as a model for research on the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in
lake cores. At Kråkenes, Holocene samples analyzed were 1 cm thick and Younger Dryas
samples were 2 cm thick or less, depending on the thickness of laminations, and dating is
fixed by over 70 AMS assays and some known ashfalls (Gulliksen et al. 1998).

Continental climates show marked seasonal extremes and are not buffered by
adjacent water bodies. Figure 1.1 shows an isopleth map of Conrad's continentality index
for North America, along with the location of Berger Bluff (site 1) and some key
lacustrine records that extend near or beyond the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Areas
with high values are climatically sensitive. As the map shows, some of the key records
are not located in climatically sensitive areas, and the central and southern Plains regions
are poorly represented.

Figure 1.1. Isopleth Map of Continentality for North America. Contemporary distribution
of continentality (seasonal severity of climate), based on Conrad’s (1946)
continentality formula (after Trewartha 1961:Fig. 6.1). Some important
paleoenvironmental sites are also shown, as follows: 1, Berger Bluff; 2,
Lake Estancia; 3, Black Mountain Lake; 4, Elk Lake; 5, Medicine Lake; 6,
Devil’s Lake; 7, Moore Lake; 8, Owens Lake; 9, Walker Lake; 10, Lake
Lahontan. Sites 2-7 are in climatically sensitive areas with very continental
climates, but the Gulf of Mexico moderates climate at Berger Bluff.

Some new records are emerging from Devils Lake and Rice Lake (North Dakota),
Owens Lake (California), and other sites. Projects such as PALE (Paleoclimates from
Arctic Lakes and Estuaries) and the Taconite Inlet Project (Canada) have begun to look
for well-preserved annually laminated lake sediments in boreal environments. Since most
15

of this new funding will inevitably be directed toward climatically or agriculturally
sensitive areas such as the northern Plains and Midwest, the issue of how rapidly climate
changed in areas such as Texas may not be resolved for some time. The answers must
come from climatically sensitive lakes, that is closed basins with no input from tributary
streams, with deep bottoms and rapid sedimentation rates. To approach the kind of
resolution found in the Greenland summit ice cores, parts of the sediment cores from
these lakes will have to be sampled at much finer intervals than the 5 cm or 10 cm
intervals generally used in earlier work. Because Texas has few natural lakes except for
the abundant playas of the Llano Estacado, there are few prospects for research of this
kind in the state. Hovorka (1997) and others have found that some of these playas contain
more than 10 m of sediments, and radiocarbon assays as old as 12,530 radiocarbon years
BP have been obtained, but because these are seasonally dry lakes, the continuous varve
sequences needed to detect abrupt climate change are probably not preserved.

Elsewhere in the world, a few records from continental interiors are beginning to
emerge that suggest abrupt climatic change is not limited to boreal regions. Some of the
best records are from Swiss lakes where sediment cores document a rapid shift toward
more positive oxygen isotope values at the onset of the Holocene (Dansgaard, White, and
Johnsen 1989); at Soppensee, for example, this shift is estimated to have taken about 50
years (Lotter et al. 1992. At Gerzensee and Leysin, summer temperatures rose at a rate of
about 0.3° C per 25 years at the start of the Holocene (Birks and Ammann 2000:1393).
One of the best records is from Lake Gosciaz, in Poland, with a sample resolution of 1-4
years. Here, the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition spanned about 160 years, but in
a series of stepwise phases, and the transitions between phases lasted 10 years or less.
Major postglacial warming comprised an initial 20-year phase (11,520-11,500 cal BP) of
16

winter warming, followed by a second phase 40-year of warming at 11,500-11,460 cal
BP (Ralska-Jasiewiczowa et al. 2003; see also Ralska-Jasiewiczowa et al. 1995:185).
Other relatively fine-grained European records come from Ammersee in southern
Germany (sample resolution = about 11 years; von Grafenstein et al. 1999), Lake
Holzmaar, also in Germany (Zolitschka et al. 2000), and Lago Grande di Monticchio in
Italy (Allen et al. 1999). Asian records include Lake Qinghai in China (Yu and Kelts
2002), where the onset of the Holocene is marked by an abrupt increase in precipitation at
10,000 RCYBP. One of the best records anywhere is the 14,570-year long varve record
from Lake Van in eastern Turkey, at about N 38° latitude (equivalent to Wichita,
Kansas). Here sediment deposition rates increase abruptly by about 40% in just five years
at the beginning of the Holocene (10,920 varve years BP, or about 9668 radiocarbon
years BP; Landmann et al. 1996:113; Fig. 4A; Landmann and Reimer 1996). The best
continental climate records come from these European lakes – many of them are varved,
at least in part, have finer resolution, and have been more extensively studied. From
these, it is clear that the onset of the Holocene was fairly abrupt, though not quite so rapid
as portrayed in the Greenland ice cores. However, European climate is heavily influenced
by the Gulf Stream and by North Atlantic climate processes.

By contrast, the North American lake record is much more sketchy, coarsegrained, and less well studied, in large part because the geological conditions are not as
favorable as in Europe; and climate in North America is conditioned by the jetstream and
by relative dominance of the Pacific, Gulf, and boreal airmasses. There are a few North
American lakes that hint at how rapid the onset of the Holocene was. At Moore Lake in
Alberta, cores were sampled at 5 to 10 cm intervals, and evidence was found for rapid
replacement of the initial sagebrush-grassland association by spruce-birch forest between
17

about 11,600 and 11,400 BP (Hickman et al. 1996:166). At Devils Lake, North Dakota,
freshwater diatom taxa were abruptly replaced at 8000 BP by salt-tolerant taxa indicating
low water levels (Fritz et al. 1991). At Lake Estancia, New Mexico, the sedimentary
sequence was sampled at 2.5 cm intervals (representing about 60 years) for detrital quartz
and ostracods, documenting freshwater pulses that "lasted only a few decades and were
separated by a few hundred years" (Allen and Anderson 1993:1922, 2000:Fig. 12; R.
Anderson 2001). The freshwater pulses are attributed to increases in precipitation. These
records suggest that abrupt climatic change at the dawn of the Holocene was not limited
to the North Atlantic region.
Contributions from new technology
Two new developments since the original fossil pollen studies were done in Texas
may help to revise earlier ideas about climate change. Commercial availability since
about 1980 of accelerator or atomic mass spectroscopy (AMS) radiocarbon dating of
small plant macrofossils now permits dating of lake sediments where varves are either
lacking or obscured. The continued improvement in computers and decline in memory
chip price may enable climatic modeling at a much finer temporal and spatial scale.
Because general circulation models are three-dimensional (often with 9-12 vertical
layers), they are computation-intensive. The application of networked computers may
enable a new generation of finer-grained models.
Insects record rapid temperature change
Some of the best evidence for rapid temperature change at the onset of the
Holocene comes from fossil beetles recovered from sediments, most often in lakes or
bogs, but sometimes in drier settings. The pioneering work was done by G. Russell
Coope in Britain. Because climatic tolerances of insects have not evolved significantly
18

during the Quaternary, maps of modern species distributions can be used to define the
upper and lower thermal limits of each species in the assemblage (see Elias 1994:74-79).
Elias remarks that
Most changes registered in pollen spectra through the Quaternary have been
gradual, with transitions between glacial and interglacial episodes lasting
hundreds if not thousands of years. However, Coope's work began to cast doubt
on paleobotanical reconstructions of climate during intervals of rapid change,
especially during the late glacial interval. In fossil insect records, changes
between faunas suggestive of major climatic episodes may occur in as little as a
few decades, and are often so rapid as to appear instantaneous in the fossil record
(Elias 1994:79).
In Britain, the insect data record abrupt warming just before 10,000 radiocarbon
years BP. Maximum temperature shows an increase of about 7° C, but minimum (winter)
temperatures show an even more drastic increase of about 26° C (Elias 1994:Fig. 5.3).
Similar abrupt warming episodes are recorded in Sweden at about 10,200 BP and in
southern France at about 10,000 BP (Elias 1994:Figs. 5.4, 5.5). In North America, insect
data from the northeast suggest episodic or oscillatory warming beginning very early
(before 16,000 BP), with modern July temperatures reached in Ontario by 10,000
radiocarbon years BP (Morgan 1987:Fig. 8; see also Elias 1994:Fig. 5.6). At Splan Pond
in New Brunswick, summer surface water temperatures abruptly increase by about 3° C
beginning somewhat before 10,100 BP (Walker, Mott, and Smol 1991:Fig. 2). Insect
assemblages from the Rocky Mountains show the same trend (Elias 1996:Fig. 2), but
unfortunately the samples are too widely spaced in time to address the question of
abruptness. A sample at 12,000 radiocarbon years BP has January temperatures about 14°
C below modern, while the next sample at 10,000 BP is about 7° C above modern (the
mean July values are roughly 2° below and 3° above, respectively). It is interesting to
note that here as in Britain, it is the winter temperatures that show the greatest flux (this
19

despite the fact that the insects are poikilotherms and are inactive in winter; Elias
1994:89). Chironomid assemblages from Greenstone Lake in California suggest July
surface water temperatures increased steadily (with some oscillations) from the Younger
Dryas into the early Holocene, increasing no more than 2° C in the millennium after
10,000 RCYBP (Porinchu et al. 2003:Fig. 6).
Fight or flight?
The history of Quaternary insect assemblages is one of relocation rather than
extinction or evolutionary adaptation (Elias 1994:59-72). Insects are highly mobile, and
Coope (foreword in Elias 1994:x) remarks that insect species responded to rapid climate
shifts "by moving out of trouble rather than by evolving out of trouble.” Since Paleoindian
foragers have been characterized as equally mobile, we might ask whether Quaternary
insects should serve as a useful model for human responses to rapid climate change. In
cases of very rapid (one human generation or less) climate change, did Paleoindians
simply relocate rather than seek new cultural adaptations? Persistent occupation of New
England and eastern Canada through the vicissitudes of the Younger Dryas (see the next
chapter) suggests that in some cases, the answer is no. If Paleoindian populations did
relocate, would they seek out maritime areas where climatic extremes were buffered?
CYCLICAL CHANGES IN CLIMATE: SCALE AND RECOGNITION
Climatic changes are often thought to be cyclical (but see Burroughs 1992),
meaning not only that some variable (such as temperature or precipitation) oscillates in
opposing directions, but that the amplitude and frequency of the peaks occur with some
consistency. Changes of climate also occur on many different time scales. Many of these
occur on a wavelength that is much too long to find expression in the typical New World
20

archeological record. Paleoclimatologists know that glacial-interglacial cycles are caused
by changes in the Earth's orbital eccentricity (in a cycle of 100,000 years) or inclination
(Muller and MacDonald 1997), obliquity (41,000-year cycle), and precession of the
equinoxes (23,000 and 19,000-year cycles; Imbrie and Imbrie 1986; Kerr 1996), but
cycles of this length are far too long to show up in the archeological record, though part
of a climatic hemicycle may appear as a unidirectional, monotonic trend. The Holocene
warming that we have already discussed is a part of one of these cycles of course, but we
can see only part, and even then only when the record is pieced together from many
archeological sites.

At the opposite end of the spectrum are very short climatic cycles lasting a few
years or decades. These are usually investigated using historical records of temperature,
precipitation, or barometric pressure. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, on
about a 6-year cycle, or the quasi-biennial oscillation (Burroughs 1992:49, 60) are so
frequent that we read about them in the newspaper. Cycles on a decadal-to-century scale
have been ascribed to feedback effects in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, solar
variability, volcanic events, or variations in CO2 or methane content of the atmosphere
(Rind and Overpeck 1995). But events like these are too short to appear (individually, at
least) in the archeological record, especially a poorly resolved and time-averaged one.

Of more interest are climatic cycles that lie between these two extremes. Cycles a
few centuries in length ought to be of an appropriate scale to show up in the archeological
record. Many of these have been identified in the worldwide proxy record (Mann, Park
and Bradley 1995; Stocker and Mysak 1992), although it has yet to be determined how
many are statistically significant (that is, distinguishable from random variation). Stocker
21

and Mysak (1992) have ascribed such cycles to natural oscillations in the oceanatmosphere system.

Oxygen isotope analysis of the Camp Century ice core suggests cycles at
frequencies of 78 and 181 years (Burroughs 1992:80-81). Isotope analysis of the GISP2
core has revealed about seven different possible cycles ranging from 2.7 years to 69 years
in frequency in the single-year resolution

18

O data set, while the bidecadal

18

O data set

shows 10 different possible cycle lengths ranging from 120 to 3300 years (Table 1.1,
based on Stuiver, Grootes, and Braziunas 1995). Any of the cycles listed here in the range
from 120-1050 years might conceivably be displayed in sedimentary archeological
contexts. Other cycles have been identified in Holocene lake sediment varves (30-40
years, Renberg, Segerstrom, and Wallin 1984; 25, 31, 44, 78, 100, 165, 200, and 270
years, Halfman and Johnson 1988; 22, 40-50, and about 200 years, Anderson 1993), dust
content (400 and 84 years, Dean 1997), pollen content (1100 years, Overpeck 1987),
beach ridges (18.2-23.4 years, Philip 1984; 72 years, Delcourt, Petty, and Delcourt 1996),
Nile floods, rainfall and temperature records (Burroughs 1992:Table 3.2), tree-rings from
the US (30 years, Stahle, Cleaveland and Hehr 1988; 15-25 years, Blasing, Stahle, and
Duvick 1988; 18.6 and 11-year cycles, Kokus 1988), hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in
tree-rings (various lengths from 55-156 years, Libby 1983:Table 2-1).

To summarize, there is a hierarchy of climatic cycles driven by different forcing
mechanisms. The very long cycles (about 20,000 years and up) are typically explained by
astronomical forcing. Very short cycles (years to decades) have been extensively studied
through historical weather records or tree rings and are not well explained but have been
linked to lunar or solar cycles. In contrast, it is the intermediate length (century-length)
cycles that are of most interest to archeologists, but these are understudied by
comparison, and efforts at explanation have not gotten very far. Researchers seem to
suspect some sort of variation in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Cycles in the
millennial range are often explained by mode-switching in thermohaline circulation.

PRECIPITATION AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION
Up to this point, most of the discussion has dealt with changes in temperature.
What about changes in rainfall and atmospheric circulation? Changes in temperature are
important, since temperature controls evaporation rates, but changes in precipitation are
even more critical since precipitation rates directly affect hydrology and moisturesensitive biota (such as the snails and diatoms used as climate proxies in this study).
Unfortunately, although the paleoenvironmental record can tell us something about
cyclicity and magnitude of change in precipitation (as well as origin of airmasses), it is
very difficult to address the question of abruptness except for the most recent part of the
record, as documented by tree rings.
General Circulation Models: Ice Wasting Leads to Shifts in Storm Tracks
Climate modeling by the COHMAP team suggests that in late full glacial time
(18,000 BP) the winter Polar Front Jetstream was split by the Laurentide ice sheet
24

(Thompson et al. 1993:500, Fig. 18.18) into northern and southern branches. Abrupt
changes in the relative amounts of moisture transported by the northern and southern
branches may have resulted in abrupt changes in Greenland ice δ 18O (Stuiver, Grootes,
and Braziunas 1995:351). In January, the southern branch, which now lies at about N 50°
(about the latitude of Winnipeg), then lay at about N 30° (or about at the latitude of
Smithville, Texas). Upper-level winds (and perhaps to some extent surface winds as well)
were also stronger in some regions; for example, the maximum speed of the January
north Atlantic jet was estimated at 40 meters/second, compared to 30 m/s now (Kutzbach
and Guetter 1986:1742; 30 m/s is the arbitrary lower limit for wind speed of a jet stream
by definition; Stringer 1972:227). The southward displacement was less prominent in
July simulations (Kutzbach et al. 1993, compare Figs. 4.15 and 4.16). This southwardly
displaced jetstream would have moved winter storm tracks along with it and would have
brought greater winter precipitation (originating as Pacific moisture) to the Southwest
(Kutzbach and Guetter 1986:1743; Dawson 1992:28, 138). For Texas east of W 101°, the
COHMAP simulations suggest a January level of 0.16 mm/day of precipitation above the
present (and 0.32 mm/day below present in July) at 18,000 BP (Thompson et al.
1993:500, Fig. 18.16). That works out to about 2.9 cm (roughly an inch) more of rainfall
over a 90-day period, compared to the present. Under present climatic conditions, Pacific
moisture is a significant source of rainfall on the Texas central Gulf coast only in winter
and early spring, when large anticyclonic systems originating in the Gulf of California
can track across northern Mexico, the Lower Pecos, and eastern Texas, moving from
southwest to northeast. Most of our annual rainfall now, though, comes from moisture
that originates in the Gulf of Mexico (this can be clearly seen on maps of Texas in which
average annual rainfall steadily diminishes away from the Gulf).

25

Texas archeologists working with isotopic data should keep in mind that, if in fact
full-glacial climates were characterized by much greater proportions of (winter) Pacific
moisture than today, that moisture may have left a Pacific isotopic signature in Texas soil
carbonates, organic carbon, and biota. Gulf of California sediments show evidence of low
δ 18O events at 8000-10,000, 12,000, and 13,500-15,000 radiocarbon years BP, as well as
a high δ 18O event that may correspond to the Younger Dryas cold event (Keigwin and
Jones 1990).

A computer simulation by Mock and Bartlein differs somewhat from the general
circulation models described above and relies on finding present-day weather anomalies
that are thought to be good analogs for paleoclimates at 18,000 and 9000 BP. Their
analog for 18,000 BP shows most of Texas with precipitation levels similar to today,
except for the lower Gulf coastal plain around Berger Bluff, which appears drier than
today (Mock and Bartlein 1995:Fig. 3, B). This agrees fairly well with the simulation by
Thompson and others, but does not discriminate between seasons.

As the ice sheet melted, the jetstream displacement effect diminished, and by
11,000 BP, when the period of concern for this study begins, the effect was considerably
reduced, the winter jetstream perhaps lying at roughly N 40° (along the Kansas-Nebraska
border; Thompson et al. 1993:500, Fig. 18.17). By 9000 BP, the COHMAP simulations
suggest increased onshore flow of warm, moist air from Baja California in July
(Kutzbach 1987:434). January precipitation over the eastern part of Texas is estimated at
0.27 mm/day below present, but July precipitation is estimated at 2.21 mm/day above
present levels (Thompson et al. 1993:500, Fig. 18.16). That works out to 19.9 cm (about
7.5") of increased precipitation over the 90-day summer season, compared to the present.
26

When changing insolation values are used to estimate precipitation minus evaporation (PE), the departures are less pronounced: 0.09 mm/day below present levels in January,
1.65 mm/day above present levels in July for 9000 BP.

This difference between winter and summer precipitation levels is worth noting.
The present climatic regime for the eastern part of Texas is bimodal, with September and
May the wettest months. According to the COHMAP simulations, late glacial
precipitation would have been more plentiful in winter when annual ground cover is
minimal, there is less interception of runoff, and loss to evaporation is minimal. This
combination probably would have led to increased silt loads in streams and higher levels
of winter groundwater recharge, indicated by steady spring discharge at Berger Bluff.
According to the general circulation models, climate in the Southwest and eastern Texas
was in transition from winter-enhanced rainfall at 18,000 BP to summer-enhanced
rainfall at 9000 BP. By the time the bench sediments accumulated at Berger Bluff (850011,000 BP), the Gulf coastal plain climate was well advanced toward the summerenhanced state, but the climate continued its transition toward the summer-enhanced
regime. Whether the present bimodal September-May rainfall maximum was
recognizable amid all these changes is still unclear. Reduction of winter rainfall probably
resulted in greater loss of soil moisture to evaporation, reduced spring discharge, reduced
silt loads in streams, and the disappearance of a significant Pacific isotopic signature.
Under present conditions, heavy winter rainfall generally occurs only in years with El
Niño events.

27

The simulation for 9000 BP by Mock and Bartlein (1995:Fig. 4, B) shows nearly
all of Texas considerably drier than present, unlike the simulation by Thompson and
others, which prescribes 0.95 mm/day of precipitation over present levels.

Much of our present springtime precipitation (and a good deal of the fall
precipitation, as well) in Texas is generated when cold, fast-moving, Arctic airmasses
penetrate the southern Plains and encounter Gulf moisture introduced by low pressure.
The Laurentide ice sheet is thought to have blocked these meridional incursions of Arctic
air during the full-glacial period, which is another reason why the present bimodal
rainfall pattern would have been lacking in the Pleistocene, and why Pleistocene climates
are thought to have been more equable (that is, lacking in seasonal extremes; Martin and
Martin 1987; Auffenberg and Milstead 1965), allowing cold-intolerant taxa such as
Geochelone wilsoni to survive at sites such as Domebo (Slaughter 1966:32), Lubbock
Lake (Johnson 1987:65-66), Blackwater Draw, Friesenhahn Cave, and Buckner Ranch
(Bee County; Moodie and Van Devender 1979) as components of disharmonious faunas
(Lundelius 1989). Even as late as 10,000 radiocarbon years BP, the ice sheet still
provided something of a barrier to airmass incursions, but by 8000 BP was diminished
enough to open up the Plains to Arctic northers (Denton and Hughes 1981:Fig. 2-2;
Andrews 1987:Fig. 7):
The Boreal episode was initiated when ablation of glacial ice permitted arctic air
to flow unimpeded onto the plains. Essentially modern biomes were organized by
individualistic species response... as a result of colder winters along with warmer
summers (Semken and Falk 1987:184).
The ice sheet also functioned as a reflective surface, amplifying polar cooling
during glacial periods, and according to Webb (1986:86), "the climatic impact of its role
28

as an orographic barrier decreased faster than its role as a reflective surface." Meridional
air flow may also have been enhanced in the early Holocene by another process, as well.
The maximum seasonal contrast in insolation occurred about 10,000 BP. Since the
strength of westerly flow (and hence strongly zonal circulation) depends on the
temperature difference between equatorial and polar regions, increased summer
insolation should lessen the latitudinal contrast, weakening westerly flow and
encouraging a more meridional circulation pattern during the summer (with the opposite
effect in the winter; Vance 1987:21, Spaulding and Graumlich 1986). The physical
barrier presented by the waning ice sheet probably reinforced this effect (Vance
1987:Fig. 4). By 8000 BP, zonal circulation may have resumed (Vance 1987:27).
Empirical support
There is some empirical evidence that supports the modeled displacement of the
jetstream. The latitudinal distribution of subfossil bison tracks its movement fairly well,
especially in the late Holocene, at N 50° (McDonald 1981:Fig. 103). Packrat midden data
from the Hueco Mountains and from the Sacramento Mountains in New Mexico indicate
greater rainfall, mostly winter, in the late Wisconsinan (Van Devender 1990a:124-126;
see also Allen and Anderson 1993 and Elias 1994:214), corresponding to a series of
highstands in the nearby Salt Basin (Hudspeth County, Culberson County) from 15,94022,570 radiocarbon years BP (Wilkins and Currey 1997). Spaulding and Graumlich
(1986) cite packrat midden data from the Mohave Desert that suggests replacement of
winter-dominant precipitation by summer monsoon rainfall at 8000-12,000 BP. This may
also correspond to a period of low salinity and δ

18

O in the Gulf of California at 8000-

10,000 BP (Keigwin and Jones 1990). Davis and Sellers (1987) have pointed out that for
the period 11,500-7000 BP, lakes dried and xeric vegetation expanded north of latitude N
29

40°, while lake levels rose and mesic vegetation expanded to the south. In another paper,
Davis (1989) disputes the shifting jetstream model and maintains that only its strength
has varied in the late Quaternary, not its position. More comprehensive mapping by
Thompson et al. (1993:Fig. 18.13) shows that the boundaries between wet and dry
regions in the western US shifted over time, but the northern limit of maximum effective
moisture at 9000 BP was positioned at about N 40° (Thompson et al. 1993:Fig. 18.14).
They suggest increased monsoonal rainfall from southerly sources. There is widespread
evidence from the southern Great Basin for wetter conditions in Late Glacial time.
Packrat midden data from southern Nevada indicate mean annual precipitation 2.6 times
modern levels at 14,000-11,500 RCYBP (Thompson, Anderson and Bartlein 1999a:34).
The lake level history of Lake Lahontan in Nevada appears to have been heavily
influenced by the position of the jetstream, showing a final rise in elevation by 10,500
RCYBP (Benson, Kashgarian, and Rubin 1995). Geologic and archeological evidence
shows the floor of the Bonneville basin was wetter than at present from before 13,000 to
8800 RCYBP (Oviatt, Madsen and Schmitt 2003:208). The lake level history of Laguna
Babicora in Chihuahua (Ortega-Ramirez et al. 1998; Metcalfe et al. 2002) also suggests
wet conditions in the Late Pleistocene, particularly the Younger Dryas, due to winter
rainfall and a southward displaced jetstream; Lake Chapala in Baja California likewise
experienced higher levels before 9070±60 RCYBP (Davis 2003). Pollen and macrofossil
data from Fracas Lakes and Bear Lake (northern Arizona; Weng and Jackson 1999),
pollen from Lost Park (central Colorado, N 39°; Vierling 1998), and radiocarbon
estimates of groundwater paleo-recharge rates from Black Mesa, Arizona (Zhu et al.
1998) suggest a similar pattern. The lake level history of Lake Estancia in New Mexico is
rather poorly dated, but shows many fluctuations during the Late Pleistocene, with a final
highstand bracketed between 11,500-9650 RCYBP (Allen and Anderson 2000;
30

Anderson, Allen, and Menking 2002: see Fig. 5) that is probably the result of jetstream
displacement. Speleothems from caves in the Guadalupe Mountains, just north of the
Texas-New Mexico border, have been dated by uranium-series dating, and show a period
of growth from about 12,425±520 cal BP (roughly 10,505 RCYBP) to 10,613±498 cal
BP (roughly 9475 RCYBP). This growth has been attributed to a wet period beginning in
the second half of the Younger Dryas and lasting at least 500 radiocarbon years into the
Holocene, as a result of jetstream displacement (Polyak, Rasmussen and Asmerom
2004:Fig. 2).

Site-specific climatic modeling by Bryson and Bryson (1996) suggests that the N
40° boundary extends eastward onto the Plains as well. Their modeling efforts suggest
that sites in the northern Plains became progressively wetter from late glacial time
through the Holocene to the present (Bryson and Bryson 1996:Figs. 6, 7, 11), while sites
in the southern Plains became drier until about 10,000 radiocarbon years BP, then
experienced a trend of slowly increasing precipitation (Bryson and Bryson 1996:Figs. 2,
5). Paleoclimatic modeling for Wyoming suggests the northern border of monsoonal
precipitation and Gulf airmass incursions moved northward across the N 40° boundary at
about 7000 RCYBP; this finds some limited support from estimates of C4 plant cover
(Lovvorn, Frison, and Tieszen 2001:2488 and Fig. 3). However, the site-specific models
for the northern Plains seem contradicted by other empirical evidence showing
progressive aridification in the Holocene. Cores from a series of lakes in southern Alberta
suggest severe drought from 10,000 to 6800 radiocarbon years before present (Beierle
and Smith 1998).

31

Complications
Some of the empirical evidence from the Southwest challenges aspects of the
above model. On the part of Fort Bliss extending into southern New Mexico (roughly
latitude N 32º), pedogenic carbonates from buried soils in alluvial fans (Monger, Cole,
and Giordano 1993) and basin floors (Monger 1993) furnished oxygen and carbon
isotopes for study. The oxygen isotope values seem to show that late glacial or full glacial
temperatures remained about the same as today (Monger, Cole, and Giordano 1993:Fig.
VII-8) throughout the fan deposits, but shifted significantly toward warmer temperatures
or summer precipitation after 16,000 BP in the basin-floor deposits (Monger 1993:91,
Fig. VIII-1). In the fan deposits, δ

13

C values show major shifts toward more negative

values after the full glacial, but these shifts ostensibly occur as late as 7000-8000 BP
(Monger, Cole, and Giordano 1993:Fig. VII-7; Buck and Monger 1999). Except for a few
charcoal deposits in the more recent sediments, these dates are based on radiocarbon
assays of the carbonates themselves or on extrapolated dates for soils dated elsewhere
from charcoal. The shift from more negative

13

C values seems consistent with a shift

from winter rainfall-supported grassland to desert scrub, but the timing seems many
thousands of years later than would be expected by the modeled migration of the
jetstream. A similar shift occurs at Lubbock Lake (roughly N 33.5°) at 8200 BP and at
Mustang Springs at about 7000 BP (Holliday 1995:55-56, Fig. 31), but here the shift is
instead toward less negative

13

C values and from C3 grasses to C4 grasses, and the

analysis is of organic carbon from sediments. Still farther north, in the central Plains loess
deposits of Kansas and Nebraska, the record is longer. The same shift toward less
negative values for organic carbon occurs, but in some places it occurs at about 1011,000 BP (Johnson and Park 1996:Figs. 11, 15), at other places at about 8000 BP
(Johnson and Park 1996:Figs. 12, 21), and the longer record provided by thick loess
32

deposits shows that the early Holocene shift is actually just one of several excursions in a
long-term trend toward less negative values that begins before the full glacial at least as
early as 23,000 BP. Connin, Betancourt and Quade (1998) studied carbon and oxygen
isotopes in glacial-aged (mostly 10,000-55,000 RCYBP) herbivore teeth from the
southwestern US and claim to have found significant evidence of C4 plants sustained by
summer rainfall, in contrast to the winter-dominant model discussed above.

Haynes (1991) believes that a drought occurred over the Southwest and beyond at
about 10,900 BP, followed by a return to mesic conditions. He is vague about the onset,
magnitude, and duration of this supposed "Clovis drought," but if it was as brief and
abrupt as he seems to imply, general circulation models cannot identify episodes at such
short time scales. He himself notes that arroyos do not appear in the southwest until 8000
RCYBP (Waters and Haynes 2001). Site-specific modeling might reveal such an episode,
but northward shifting of the jetstream suggests only continued drying of the Southwest
at 10,900 BP, not the mesic reversal postulated by Haynes. Holliday (2000) argues for
widespread drying and eolian deposition on the Southern High Plains at 10,200-10,900
RCYBP, a finding at odds with the evidence elsewhere in the Southwest.

This picture of northward-shifting storm tracks and seasonal shifting of rainfall
regimes, as seen through the 3000-year thick time slices provided by general circulation
modeling (and driven by ice sheet ablation and rising insolation rates) cannot account for
short-term climatic events (such as Haynes's postulated "Clovis drought"), nor can it
account for reversals in the climatic pattern (droughts followed by wet episodes). Thus,
the features of abruptness and cyclicity identified in the paleotemperature record cannot
easily be seen here, both because the precipitation model is too coarse-grained and
33

because the empirical record is less sensitive to precipitation changes than to temperature
changes. Precipitation changes probably had more far-reaching effects on Paleoindians
and the biota on which they depended, but we usually cannot detect these changes in the
proxy record with the same fine-grained resolution and rapid response time with which
Quaternary insects portray the temperature record. If there were dry or wet episodes,
abrupt or cyclic in nature, during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (such as the
freshwater pulses at Lake Estancia), they must have been due to other causes, such as
volcanic events that loaded the atmosphere with ash and sulphur compounds (the general
circulation models used so far do not include aerosols), or atmospheric circulation
changes that have nothing to do with gradual ice sheet wasting.
Volcanic aerosols
Volcanic eruptions, loading the atmosphere with fine-grained ash and sulphitic
aerosol compounds, have been implicated in episodes of climatic cooling (Dawson
1992:180-198; Flohn 1979; however, see also Sadler and Grattan 1999). Mass and
Portman (1989) examined historic weather records corresponding to known major
eruptions since 1883 to determine whether volcanicity influences climate. They find that
once the confounding effects of ENSO events are removed, only the largest eruptions
cause cooling, that cooling only lasts for one to two years, and that temperature drops
only about 0.1-0.2° C. They specifically address the possibility that volcanic aerosols
might alter precipitation rates indirectly by shifting atmospheric circulation patterns
(particularly toward more meridional flow), but find no relation between volcanicity and
precipitation (Mass and Portman 1989:576, 589).

Mass and Portman's conclusions, however, are based only on a century-long
sample of volcanic events; are they representative of the Quaternary? The ice core record
shows that volcanic events may be clustered in time (presumably the result of episodes of
crustal plate movement or isostatic adjustment to deglaciation). A major cluster of events
between 16,000 and 20,000 BP corresponds to a 2-3° C cooling in the Byrd Station δ 18O
record (Dawson 1992:Fig. 10.4). Hammer, Clausen, and Langway (1997) further define
this as a massive 170-year-long series of eruptions at about 17,500 calendar years BP
(roughly 14,617 radiocarbon years ago) that produced an estimated 5-11 billion tons of
atmospheric acids. A massive increase in sulfate flux between 13,713 and 13,531±520
BP (Bolling-Alleröd interval) in the GISP2 core could represent another period of
volcanism (Mayewski et al. 1993:197). Mayewski has also identified a cluster of volcanic
events at about 8000-12,000 BP that he attributes to stresses induced by isostatic rebound
(lecture notes, October 9, 1997). Zielinski and others examined SO42- concentrations in
the GISP2 core for the last 9000 years and found that "there are three times as many
events from 5000 to 7000 B.C. as over the last two millennia with sulfate deposition
equal to or up to five times that of the largest known historical eruptions. This increased
volcanism in the early Holocene may have contributed to climatic cooling" (Zielinski et
al. 1994:948). See also Adams, Mann, and Ammann (2003).

Dust loading
Heavy levels of atmospheric dust have also been implicated as either a cause or a
result of global cooling, and glacial periods are known to have been dusty (Overpeck et
al. 1996; Taylor et al. 1993). On a long time scale (that is, tens of millennia),
concentrations of dust in the polar ice cores are associated with cold periods. In the
35

Vostok (Antarctic) core, for example, heavy dust loading occurs at about 20,000 BP, near
the height of the Wisconsinan glaciation, but drops off sharply at the beginning of the
Holocene, to only 1/15 the previous value. The dropoff precedes the temperature change
(Petit et al. 1990:56). Likewise, the Holocene value from the Camp Century core
(Greenland), is only 1/12 the late glacial value (Thompson and Mosley-Thompson 1981).
Recent computer modeling by Overpeck and others (1996), on the other hand, suggests
that atmospheric dust actually caused episodic regional warming (over 5° C) of areas
downwind from ice margins and may have triggered abrupt warming events. Depending
on size and reflectivity, dust can both scatter and absorb sunlight, and it tends to warm
the upper atmosphere, but cool dark surfaces (such as oceans or forests); the reverse is
true over surfaces with high albedo (such as ice and sand sheets; Harrison et al. 2001:48).
Heavy dust in polar regions has been attributed to increased aridity and less frequent
washing out of surface dust by precipitation (Yung et al. 1996), greater windiness, and
expansion of source areas (Harrison et al. 2001:58-59), but dust loading was spatially
variable. Dust in the Greenland ice cores has been traced to east Asian source areas, so it
does not bear directly on the question of North American aridity during the glacial
period. During the Last Glacial Maximum, dust accumulation rates were highest at
latitude 20-25° N in the Atlantic basin and at 30-50° N in the Pacific basin (Kohfeld and
Harrison 2001:Fig. 10).

The Bermuda High
The Bermuda High is a persistent high-pressure area located in the Atlantic, off
the eastern US seaboard. Expansion and/or southwestern movement tends to cause
increased precipitation both on the western Gulf coastal plain (Keim 1997) and southern
Plains (Forman et al. 1995:51, Figs. 9, 10) with anticyclonic advection of moisture from
36

the Gulf of Mexico. Contraction or northeast movement causes drought. Persistent
episodes of expansion or southwesterly movement might cause clusters of heavy rainfall
events that could show as flood-prone periods at archeologically-resolvable time scales,
but the atmospheric mechanisms that might cause such long-term shifts in the position of
the high are essentially unknown.
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Events
In normal years, the westward-moving Pacific trade winds pile up warm water in
the western Pacific (about half a meter higher than in the eastern Pacific) and produce
cold upwelling along the western coast of South America (about 8° C cooler). The warm
western Pacific sends heat and moisture into the upper atmosphere. During El Niño
events, this system breaks down: the trade winds weaken, warm water extends into the
eastern Pacific, and upwelling diminishes. Pressure gradients along the equator (the
Southern Oscillation, starting in October and occurring most commonly on a 6-year
cycle; Burroughs 1992:49) diminish. The linked wind-water-pressure process is known as
an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Although ENSO events originate far
away in the tropical Pacific, they have profound effects on United States weather. During
ENSO events, tropical Pacific storms spread farther eastward, strengthening the jetstream
and displacing it southward. Manty (1993:xxxiii, Fig. 4.9) found that during El Niño
winters from 1966 to 1989 the southern jetstream at the 250 millibar pressure level was
intensified by 5-10 meters per second and displaced southward 200-285 km.

Warm western Pacific events like these (which occur every two to seven years)
may be followed by cool events (referred to either as La Niña or El Viejo). Normal years
are referred to as "neutral" events. During warm ENSO events, heavy rainfall occurs in
37

the Southwestern US and around the Gulf of Mexico in October, November, and
December (Ropelewski and Halpert 1987:Fig. 21; Burroughs 1992:Fig. 5.8a; Cleaveland,
Cook, and Stahle 1992) and major winter floods may occur in the Southwest (Ely, Enzel,
and Cayan 1994). Warm Pacific sea surface temperatures are also correlated with heavy
rainfall in Texas from November through March (Montroy 1997:552, Fig. 8; Manty
1993:62-63, 285; Mjelde et al. 1997:Fig. 1). In fact, the strongest ENSO effect in the
eastern United States is found in Texas and other Gulf states (Cleaveland, Cook, and
Stahle 1992:279). Warm events may also be associated with cooler than normal
temperatures on the Texas Gulf coastal plain in the winter, spring, and summer (Green et
al. 1997), although the temperature effect is less pronounced than the precipitation effect.
At Corpus Christi, for example, over the period 1887-1950, winter temperatures averaged
13.8° C in El Niño and 15.7° C in La Niña years (Manty 1993:Table 2.5). In the
southeastern US, there is about a 2° C difference between warm and cold event years
(Diaz and Kiladis 1992:20) over land. Over the Gulf, sea surface temperature is about
0.7° C cooler and air temperature 1.4° C cooler during warm events (White and Downton
1991:Table 15.1). Cold or La Niña events tend to be associated with reduced rainfall
(Montroy 1997:552; and below average tree growth in the year following an event, as
shown by tree ring studies). This effect can be seen in 42 years of rainfall records at
Yorktown, in the Berger Bluff catchment. Average rainfall for El Niño years runs about
14 cm higher than for La Niña years (Table 1.4). Warm events also tend to suppress
hurricane formation in the Gulf; the frequency of hurricanes in a warm event year is
about half that in a neutral year (O'Brien, Richards, and Davis 1996). This apparently
happens because increased westerly wind shear decapitates tropical disturbances before
they can form hurricanes (Gray and Sheaffer 1991:258-264).

38

Since El Niño-induced winter rainfall normally starts in October and may last
through the following months into the next calendar year, half of the rainfall may fall in
one calendar year, while the rest is reported in the next year's statistics. This tends to
conceal the ENSO effect in annually compiled rainfall amounts. Hydrologists have long
recognized this, even before the significance of ENSO events was understood, and as a
result the hydrologists' "water year" starts on October 1 and extends to the following
September 30. Table 1.4 might have been more representative had it been compiled using
water years, but would have required too much manipulation of monthly data. Lagging
the ENSO events by one year actually reduces the contrast between warm and cold years
to about 6 cm of precipitation, suggesting the calendar year data used here are an
adequate expression of the data.
El Niño Events: Mini-Analogs for Pleistocene Climates?
The reader will note that warm events have some of the key attributes (southwarddisplaced jetstream and enhanced winter rainfall, reduced summer temperatures, and lack
of hurricane formation) that I have already identified for full-glacial climates in Texas.
Can El Niño years be considered mini-analogs for Pleistocene climate in the eastern part
of Texas? Future researchers should ponder this possibility. Stott and others (2002)
propose that Late Pleistocene stadial conditions at high latitudes were correlated with El
Niño-like climatic conditions in the western Pacific.

Another interesting characteristic of ENSO events is the tendency for the system
to go from one extreme to the other in adjacent years (Diaz and Kiladis 1992:11). This
means that heavy rainfall in an El Niño year may be followed by drought in a La Niña
year, a very non-equable climatic regime that selects for hardiness in plants and animals.
39

In other words, ENSO-like climates should select for eurytopic species and against
stenotopic species. La Niña years also tend to be associated with episodes of "false
spring" (unseasonably warm winters followed by a hard spring freeze; Stahle 1990:177189), which are also stressful for plants and animals (especially poikilotherms).

How old are ENSO-like climatic features? Did El Niño events occur at all in the
Late Pleistocene? What about the early Holocene? Direct evidence must come either
from the tropical Pacific or coastal South America. Proxy evidence of teleconnections
might be found in other areas, but it might be hard to prove climatic effects elsewhere are
ENSO-related. The evidence from coastal Peru is somewhat controversial (see comments
in DeVries et al. 1997, Wells 1990). Martin et al. (1993) argue for intermittent ENSOlike events beginning at least 7000 BP, based on South American evidence. Based on
debris-flow deposits with a lower infrared-stimulated thermoluminescence date of
38,200±4300 cal years BP and an upper radiocarbon date of 10,770±150 RCYBP (about
12,880 cal BP, and absent at about 5300-8400 cal BP), Keefer et al. (1998, 2003) argue
for the presence of Late Pleistocene El Niño events at Quebrada Tacahuay, Peru (see also
Moy et al. 2002; Rodó and Rodriguez-Arias 2004). The debris flows are thought to have
been left by exceptionally severe events with a recurrence interval of “less than 2530
years” (Keefer et al. 2003:69); during the early Holocene, the maximum recurrence
interval was 600 years. Anderson, Soutar, and Johnson (1992:430) also claim to
recognize "El Niño-like" and "La Niña-like" conditions off the coast of California in the
Late Pleistocene (also Heusser and Sirocko 1997, Bull, Kemp, and Weedon 2000; but see
discussion in Cole et al. 1992:357). A lake core from Laguna Pallcacocha in
southwestern Ecuador shows cyclic banding back to about 12,470±80 RCYBP,
interpreted by Rodbell and others (1999) as ENSO evidence, but the banding is very
40

weak before about 6200 RCYBP, and occurred on about a 15-year cycle (Rodbell et al.
1999:519, Fig. 5), suggesting a weak ENSO system. Climate modeling suggests that El
Niño may have been suppressed in the early Holocene by the intensified Asian monsoon,
which increases upwelling and cooling in the central to eastern Pacific (Liu et al. 1999).
In some cases, cyclic climatic behavior throughout the Quaternary, regardless of cycle
length, has been attributed to the ENSO system – for example, stacked Wisconsinan-aged
paleosols in Illinois have been examined for δ
cycles with periodicities of

13

C, iron content, and color, revealing

800-1000, 450-550, and 350-390 years that have been

attributed to ENSO-like climate cycles (Wang, Follmer, and Chao-Li Liu 2000; Wang et
al. 2003).
Tudhope and others (2001) see evidence of a weak ENSO system in cores
through annually banded coral from Papua New Guinea, at various times during
Pleistocene glacial periods. Thermal and circulation properties of the glacial-age
atmosphere and oceans were so different from Holocene patterns that I find it difficult to
envision a contemporary ENSO system existing in a Pleistocene environment, although
Koutavas and others (2002) argue that increased equatorial seasonality during the Late
Pleistocene (about 17,000-21,000 cal BP) favored the growth of El Niño events by
weakening trade winds (although see Koutavas et al. 2002:Fig. 2, C). Note that they
define seasonality as the difference between March and September insolation at the
equator, whereas I define it here as the difference between December and June insolation
at latitude N29° in Fig. 1.5, A. Even if ENSO events were present during the Pleistocene,
it is not necessarily clear whether the effect on Texas weather would be the same as is
seen today. Contemporary ENSO events affect Texas weather by displacing the
jetstream, but in the late glacial period, the jetstream and the Intertropical Convergence

41

Zone were already displaced southward, so it is not clear whether glacial-aged ENSO
events would increase (as in today’s climate) or diminish winter rainfall.

Individual ENSO events (for example, a major winter flood generated by heavy
warm-event rainfall) are plainly too short-lived to show up in the archeological record,
but clusters of events within a span of, say, one or two centuries might appear, in the
same way that I have suggested clusters of volcanic events might leave an imprint in the
paleoenvironmental record (see Charles 1998). Without annually-resolved proxy data,
however, demonstrating that these were due to ENSO patterning might be difficult.
INSOLATION

Astronomical forcing makes insolation (the amount of solar radiation received by
the earth) vary over long periods. The eccentricity of the earth's orbit around the sun
affects insolation on a 100,000-year cycle. Of more interest are changes in axial tilt (the
41,000-year cycle) and precession of the equinoxes (22,000-year cycle). The tilt of the
earth's axis with respect to the sun, which is now 23.44°, determines the amount of
seasonal contrast between summer and winter. Increased tilt means more radiation for
polar regions (Imbrie and Imbrie 1986:Fig. 25). It chiefly affects high latitudes and is
much less important at N29°, the approximate latitude of Berger Bluff. Precession of the
equinoxes is much more important, especially in low latitudes (Imbrie and Imbrie
1986:107); it determines the seasonal distribution of the annual radiation budget. Today,
winter begins when the earth is close to the sun, at one extreme of its elliptical orbit, but
11,000 calendar years ago (about 9870 radiocarbon years BP), winter began when the
earth was much farther away from the sun, at the opposite end of the ellipse (Imbrie and
42

Imbrie 1986:73). Interaction between the precession effect and the axial tilt effect has
produced complex patterns of insolation changes at different latitudes. As Dawson
(1992:239) notes,
A critical factor... was the seasonal temperature gradient between low and high
latitudes — known as the insolation gradient.... During periods when the
insolation gradient from the equator to the pole was high, meridional (northsouth) circulation would have been increased, thus providing a greater rate of
delivery of snow-bearing precipitation to high latitudes. By contrast, low
meridional temperature gradients would have been associated with oscillatory jet
stream flow, the more frequent development of blocking high pressure systems in
the middle latitudes and a decrease in the rate of supply of moisture to high
latitudes.
In 1978, Andre Berger published a FORTRAN computer program to calculate this
complex pattern of past insolation rates for given latitudes of the earth's surface. This
program was later adapted by Nicholas Pisias, and eventually rewritten in TurboPascal by
Owen K. Davis of the University of Arizona. This version of the program
(INSOLATN.EXE) is available for downloading on the World Wide Web, and I have
used it to calculate the insolation values displayed here in Langleys/day.
Using values produced by Davis's program, I have produced two series of plots.
The first series (Figs. 1.2-1.4) shows insolation changes from the full-glacial (18,000
radiocarbon years BP) to the early Holocene (7000 BP) for certain selected months; the
period of chief interest for the present study, 8500-11,000 BP, is marked by a screen
pattern, and the modern insolation value is also shown for comparison. The reader should
note that while Davis's program is keyed to calendar years, I have chosen to display the
results on the distorted radiocarbon time scale, since that is the standard chronological
scale for this study. In order to do that, I have used CALIB 3.03 to work backwards from
calendar years to radiocarbon years (the difference between these scales will be discussed
43

in more detail in the next chapter). In the first series of figures, I show changes in annual
insolation (Fig. 1.2, A), followed by insolation for January (at the height of winter), May
(the second-wettest month of the year), July and August (normally dry months, when
Gulf sea surface temperature rises), and September (the wettest month and the chief
hurricane month at present).

Fig. 1.2, A, shows that annual insolation was actually above present-day levels
throughout the end of the Pleistocene and during the early Holocene, peaking at 10,000
radiocarbon years BP, at about 101% of the modern value (from a percentage viewpoint,
the changes shown on these plots are not large) and declining thereafter. January
insolation, on the other hand (Fig. 1.2, B) declined below contemporary levels by 15,000
BP and reached a minimum by 9000 BP. May insolation (Fig. 1.3, A), on the other hand,
peaked by 11,500 BP and declined thereafter. July and August insolation were near
modern values in the late glacial, increasing steadily throughout the 8500-11,000 BP time
span (Figs. 1.3, B, 1.4, A). July insolation peaked by 9000 BP, but August insolation
continued to rise until 7000 BP. September insolation (Fig. 1.4, B) was near
contemporary levels at 10,500 BP, then rose somewhat until at least 7000 BP. Fig. 1.5, A,
shows insolation "seasonality," or the difference in insolation between the month with the
most insolation (June in every case) and that with the least (December in every case). The
pattern is very similar to that for the total annual insolation, with insolation "seasonality"
about 100 langleys/day above modern levels throughout the period when the bench
deposits were forming, and peaking at 10,000 radiocarbon years BP.

47

Perhaps the most important thing to note about this series of figures is that for the
months of July, August, and September, the critical months when heating of the Gulf can
generate hurricanes, solar radiation was steadily increasing to levels above contemporary
values throughout the period when the bench deposits were forming at Berger Bluff.

The second series of plots (Figs. 1.6-1.10) consists of circular graphs designed to
show the seasonal distribution of insolation at 7000, 8500, 10,000, 11,000, and 18,000
radiocarbon years BP. All these plots are off-center because most insolation is received in
the summer months. The plot for 10,000 BP is most off-center, that for 18,000 BP the
least because these two periods have, respectively, the most and least seasonal contrast.
The reader will also note that none of these plots appear greatly different from each other,
especially at the scale shown here, because the differences involved are relatively small
percentages of total annual insolation.

SEASONALITY
There seems to be a consensus among Quaternary paleoecologists (or at least,
among North American practitioners) that Pleistocene climates were more equable (less
subject to seasonal extremes) than Holocene ones, which are viewed as much more
seasonal (Martin and Martin 1987). This is probably true, but to some extent it is another
example of received wisdom. Demonstrating the seasonal range of climate requires proxy
data with a resolution of at least six months or finer, and there are few kinds of data that
can reach back into the Pleistocene with subannual precision. Finely laminated varves
that probably represent daily events (and can be counted to determine the length of the
late Pleistocene summer) have been found in Sweden (Ringberg 1984), but proxies with
this kind of resolution are rare, scattered, and discontinuous. Tree rings (width data or
deuterium content) can furnish subannual precision, but there are no continuous records
reaching back into the full glacial. Oxygen isotope variations in laminated mammoth
tusks (Koch, Fisher, and Dettman 1989) and dentin increment analysis in mammoth tusks
and teeth give us some idea of the seasonal amplitude of such measurements, but we have
nothing for comparison, since continental mammoths are extinct. The mid-Holocene
mammoths from Wrangel Island could be studied, but may not help us understand
continental climatic history.

"Seasonality"

is

usually

ill-defined

by

archeologists

and

Quaternary

paleoecologists. Presumably it could mean seasonal contrast in temperature, insolation,
precipitation, evaporation, windiness (Zielinski and Merson 1997:558), or some other
factor, but seasonal temperature changes are probably what most paleoecologists
envision. Lambeck, Esat and Potter (2002:200) observe that “Growth of large ice sheets
55

requires warm temperatures during winters to enhance moisture transport to high
latitudes, and cool temperatures during summers to prevent melting of snow.” From this,
we expect that the last glacial period would have featured summer temperatures much
lower than present, but winter temperatures similar to, or perhaps even higher than
present temperatures. Fossil insects are one of the few kinds of proxy data that can
capture both winter and summer temperatures. Most other proxies (for example, noble
gases, altitude lapse rates, or carbon isotopes) record only mean annual temperature or
summer maximum temperatures.

Fig. 1.5, B, is a plot of the difference between mean January and July
temperatures derived from Elias's Rocky Mountain insect data (Elias 1996:Table 1). It
shows that, contrary to expectations, the reconstructed mean annual temperature range
actually declines at the onset of the Holocene, rather than increasing, and mid-Holocene
temperatures were actually more equable as well. Unfortunately the data are not old
enough to show what was happening in the full glacial; the curve starts at 14,500
radiocarbon years BP, during the late glacial warming period. What signals increased
"seasonality?" Is it an expansion in the annual range of temperature between summer and
winter, as in the peaks seen at 2965 and 9000 BP (Fig. 1.5, B, Fig. 1.11), or is it a drop in
the winter minimum temperature, such as those seen at 2965 BP, 9000 BP, and 12,194
BP (Elias 1996:Fig. 2)? Put another way, what are the most crucial limiting factors for
human populations or the biota on which they were dependent? Is it the ability to survive
winter cold or is it the ability to survive summer heat that defines an organism's range?
Or both?

56

Figure 1.11. Temperature Estimates from Rocky Mountain Fossil Insect Data. A,
departure from modern July temperature. B, departure from modern January
temperature. Note winter temperatures fluctuate more radically at these
high-altitude sites; also note excursion at 10,000 BP. Vertical bars represent
mutual climatic range of beetle species (adapted from Elias 1996:Fig. 2).

57

The insect data show that it is chiefly the winter minimum temperatures that
fluctuate in the late Quaternary (Fig. 1.11); the summer maxima are much less variable.
We might suppose that this is in large part due to the relatively high elevation of Elias's
sites (most over 2700 meters), but the same pattern can be seen in the British insects. And
insect data from the Canadian maritime provinces show the same thing – winter
temperature departures are greater than summer departures at 10,600-12,600 RCYBP,
and the winter temperatures show greater fluctuation over time than the summer
temperatures (Miller and Elias 2000:Fig. 2). This would seem to contradict the model for
ice sheet growth sketched above, except that the insect data begin around 13,000-14,000
RCYBP, after the glacial maximum, when climate warming had already started. Are
these insect-based temperature patterns unique to the particular type of proxy data, or are
they simply not old enough to capture Full Glacial climates?

The Berger-Davis insolation model cannot show the annual temperature range,
but it can show the annual range in insolation values, and here a picture emerges that
differs somewhat from the insect data. The annual range in insolation values (here always
the difference between the December and June values), as we have seen, rose above the
modern level by about 17,000 BP and peaked at 10,000 BP. Curiously, though, most of
this increased insolation "seasonality" comes from increased solar radiation during the
summer months. The change in winter insolation (Fig. 1.2, B) is much less pronounced.
In other words, the astronomical model seems to say that seasonality increases at the
onset of the Holocene, and summer radiation is mostly responsible. The cordilleran
insects, on the other hand, seem to say that seasonality drops sharply at the onset of the
Holocene, then peaks again at 9000 BP, then drops again, and that winter temperatures
are mostly responsible. What accounts for the discrepancy between these two views?
58

Altitude and latitude may be relevant. Continentality is reduced in mountainous
areas (Fig. 1.1) because summer highs are restricted. And nearly all of Elias's sites are
north of N40° latitude, where changes in axial tilt would have been somewhat more
important than at N29° latitude. In other words, location may have had a significant
effect on "seasonality" changes during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, and the
pattern of change at Berger Bluff may have been different from that in the cordilleran
area. Some of the packrat midden data support this possibility. Early Holocene packrat
midden data from northwestern Colorado, assayed at 9870 RCYBP, show January
temperatures 1 to 3° C below modern and July temperatures 3 to 10° C below modern
(Sharpe 2002:Table 1). Van Devender (1990b:155) estimates a Late Wisconsinan
temperature departure of about 3.6 to 5.0° C below modern for January and 8.4° C below
modern for July at Picacho Peak, Arizona. Other reconstructions using packrat midden
data from the Sonoran Desert estimate departures of 5° C for December-January and 3° C
for July-August (Arundel 2002:Fig. 3).

DIFFERING VIEWS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: WHY THE DISCREPANCY?
In this first chapter we have had the opportunity to see how astronomically
oriented climate modelers, paleobotanists, and paleontologists have viewed late
Quaternary climate change. The computer models and the empirical data reveal rather
different views. Nothing in the computer models can predict the sometimes dramatic and
abrupt periodicity of the empirical data, at least not on an archeological scale. And among
the empiricists, there is a spectrum of opinions. The palynologists are most likely to agree
with the modelers that climates wax and wane smoothly over thousand-year increments.
The paleontologists and archeozoologists (especially those working in the northern Plains
59

under the influence of Wendland and Bryson's climatic framework) are much more likely
to see episodic change in their data, and among the fauna, it is the insects recovered from
sediments or packrat middens that are most likely to reveal abrupt, episodic change.

What accounts for the discrepancy between the Bryant-Shafer model of gradual
climatic transition at the onset of the Holocene and the newer picture of sometimes
abrupt, episodic, and cyclic change that has emerged from the ice core, subfossil insect,
and other new empirical data? I would argue that the willingness of Quaternary scientists
to recognize abrupt, short-term episodic, or cyclic climatic change in their data depends
on the climatic sensitivity or "response time" of their data, and that the response time
depends in very large part on the lifespan (or age at reproduction) of the organism.
Highly mobile organisms with short lifespans, like insects, are likely to respond much
more rapidly to climate change than sessile, long-lived organisms like pollen-producing
trees. Table 1.2 (condensed and modified from Williams 1981) illustrates this. Pollenproducing forest trees may often lag climatic changes by 1000-2000 years. Referring to
postglacial dispersal of beech and hemlock into Michigan, Davis (1986:278) remarks
Although expansion apparently could not keep up with climatic change, it still
was rapid (100 to 400 m per year) relative to expectations of ecologists....Note,
however, that 100 m per year is two orders of magnitude slower than the
expansion rate of cotton rats in the course of the twentieth century....

Elsewhere, with Daniel Botkin, she observes that
When climatic change occurs, adult perennial plants continue to survive, but do
not reproduce successfully. Young plants of other species, better adapted to the
new climatic regime, enter the community gradually, and existing plants are
replaced as they die by invading species (Davis and Botkin 1985:336).

61

Species abundances are not always in equilibrium with climate...biotic
interactions can have a strong effect on climatic response and can obscure and
delay the response... the pollen record in sediments, even if it records the
vegetation perfectly, cannot resolve climatic changes more closely than within a
century or two.... The pollen record cannot distinguish between larger, short-lived
changes and smaller changes of longer duration (Davis and Botkin 1985:338).
Webb (1986), on the other hand, maintains that delayed response of some pollenproducing species may be due to individualistic response of the species to particular
climatic variables. In any case, in regions where both insect faunas and pollen
assemblages have been thoroughly studied (Elias 1994:80-89), or better yet, where both
have been studied at the same site (Berglund et al. 1984), the pollen data generally lag
anywhere from 300 years to possibly as much as millennia behind the insects in
responding to rapid climate changes. Of course, the insects respond mostly to
temperature, while vegetation may be responsive to precipitation, temperature, growing
season length, or other variables. Plants probably integrate more kinds of environmental
variables than insects; this certainly makes them informative, but not necessarily
responsive to abrupt change. In the Rocky Mountain region, Davis (1989:625) maintains
that high-altitude pollen sites, where moisture is abundant, mostly document the
Pleistocene-Holocene temperature change, while for low-elevation sites, it is moisture
that is limiting. This might also explain some of the discrepancy between the insect and
pollen records. In any case there are a number of fairly well documented millennial-scale
cases of "vegetational inertia" in the paleoenvironmental literature (Cole 1985a, b;
Markgraf 1985). Williams and others (2002) have used a novel method to study
vegetation response in the North Atlantic region. Instead of simply looking at pollen
counts from single taxa, they used core data from 11 European and North American lakes
(all north of 45° N latitude), performed a principal components analysis of all the pollen
counts from each lake, then computed the downcore correlation between the PCA factor
62

scores and two climate proxies (δ 18O and chironomid-based temperature estimates) and
performed a cross-correlation analysis to measure the lags of entire vegetation
communities behind the climate proxies. For these sites, in which the individual sample
resolution ranges from 16 to 93 years, some vegetation lags are about 400 years, but
many are 200 years or less (Williams et al. 2002:Fig. 1). This may suggest part of the
vegetational inertia documented in the older literature is simply the result of poor
sampling resolution (extracting samples from cores at 20 cm intervals, perhaps, instead of
1 cm intervals).

At the same time, if we examine the distribution of vegetation at smaller scales
(smaller than biomes, provinces, or associations), perhaps at the level of individual
habitats, we may find examples of abrupt vegetational changes in particular habitats as a
product of geomorphic change. The bench deposits at Berger Bluff probably furnish an
example of this kind of change. Shelford (1932:Table 1) long ago defined a biome as
covering about a million square miles, an association about 100,000 square miles, giving
some idea of the scale involved. Palynological sites sample areas that are smaller than an
association, but commonly larger than an individual habitat (usually various habitats are
represented), making them less sensitive to geomorphically-driven habitat deletion. If
vegetation at this spatial scale ("palynological scale") tends to show inertia in the face of
abrupt climate change, can we conclude that Paleoindians had no need to adapt to
vegetational change at the onset of the Holocene? Probably not, because individual
habitats may still have changed drastically, even when inset into a larger matrix (biome,
province, or association) stubbornly displaying Cole's "vegetational inertia."

63

I should also note that of the organisms listed in Table 1.2, the last three (pollenproducing trees, mammals, and diatoms), although perhaps the least responsive, are some
of the environmental indicators most commonly recovered from archeological sites.
Ostracods and insects would probably be more responsive climatic proxies, but are not
recovered from archeological sites very often. This table also conceals a great deal of
significant variation (r-selected and K-selected mammals vary greatly in lifespan).
A MODEL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE
The discussion to this point can be summarized in the form of a very general
model for climate change:
1. As the GRIP and GISP2 ice cores show, past climates may have changed abruptly (i.e.,
in a few years), especially at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition;

2. Climate change may be cyclical. The cycles occur at many different superimposed
frequencies and amplitudes. Many are either too long or too short to appear in the
archeological record, but others may be occur at scales consistent with archeological
resolution;

3. The magnitude of temperature change at the onset of the Holocene in lower midlatitudes is unknown in any detail (except for a few estimates from insect and other
data); it is likely to have been less drastic than in boreal areas. In any case, winter and
summer temperature trends may have been largely independent; the insect data
suggest the change in winter temperature is likely to have been greater than the change

64

in summer temperature, while insolation modeling and some of the packrat midden
data suggest the opposite;

4. Likewise, the rapidity of temperature change at the onset of the Holocene in lower
mid-latitudes is essentially unknown; it is likely to have been less rapid than in boreal
areas;

5. Throughout the transition from the terminal Pleistocene into the early Holocene, total
annual insolation at N29° was above present levels, late summer (hurricane season)
insolation was above present levels and increased steadily throughout the period, and
winter insolation was below present levels. The seasonal contrast in insolation was
well above present levels, peaking at 10,000 BP;

6. In lower mid-latitudes, precipitation change is likely to have been more significant
than temperature change, especially in maritime areas;

7. Long-term, gradual changes in precipitation were driven by northward migration of the
jetstream in response to wasting of the Laurentide ice sheet, and possibly by a shift
from zonal to meridional circulation;

8. The Pleistocene-Holocene transition is thought to have occurred near the end of a shift
from winter-enhanced to summer-enhanced rainfall and from Pacific-derived moisture
to moisture derived from the Gulf of Mexico;
9. Shorter term or episodic changes in precipitation, such as Haynes's "Clovis drought,"
or abrupt shifts in δ 13C detected in soil/sediment humate samples, remain unexplained
65

for the time being. Causes such as clustered volcanic events or clusters of ENSO
events cannot yet be ruled out;

10. ENSO events, whenever they began, should select for eurytopic biota and against
stenotopic biota;

11. Maritime areas should have experienced less abrupt and less severe climatic change,
except where maritime tropical storms are concerned;

12. Climate change may be regional, with opposing trends (antiphasing) in adjacent
regions;

13. Because of bioturbation and time-averaging, abrupt climate changes (on the scale of a
few years, as revealed in the polar ice cores) are not likely to be detectable in
archeological sites, even though abrupt changes may have had major impacts on
human populations;

14. As paleoenvironmental data sites, networks of archeological sites are perhaps best
suited to revealing spatial patterns of precipitation changes.

SUMMARY
New data and analytical methods show that the conventional view of Pleistocene
climates evolving into Holocene climates so imperceptibly as to remain unnoticed by
human populations is simply wrong, at least for northern latitudes. How abrupt the
66

transition might have been in Texas, especially in areas that, like Berger Bluff, are
buffered by proximity to the Gulf of Mexico is still unclear. In some of the chapters to
come, I hope to demonstrate that threshold effects can cause abrupt habitat deletion or
reorganization, even in areas where the climate itself shows substantial maritime
buffering.

Glacial-age and Holocene climates in Texas have differed in several important
respects. In the full glacial, winter rainfall was probably more prevalent due to the
displaced jetstream and moisture derived from the Pacific was probably more significant
than now. The May-September bimodal rainfall pattern was probably reduced or lacking,
with summer rainfall somewhat below contemporary levels. A greater proportion of
rainfall in the cool season, when evaporation rates are much lower, probably meant that
soil moisture levels were higher, and there may have been a much higher proportion of
cool-season grasses in ground cover. Grasses with the C3 photosynthetic pathway and
carbon isotope values of -23 to -32 ‰ may have been more abundant. The onset of
rainfall patterns driven by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation system meant the beginning
of dramatic flipflops characterized by heavy winter rainfall in some years followed by
drought the next year, a pattern that would select for euroky (environmental hardiness) in
various kinds of biota and lead to extirpation of stenotopic taxa, and it is probably just
this kind of transition that led to the disappearance of the "disharmonious faunas" thought
to typify the Pleistocene.

Violent floods were probably uncommon in glacial-age drainage basins because
the heat-driven, monsoon-like mechanisms for concentrating enormous amounts of
precipitation in localized areas over short periods of time did not yet exist. As glacial
67

meltwater from the Laurentide ice sheet dissipated in the early Holocene, the Gulf
warmed until enough heat energy was present to sustain hurricanes. By 8000-9000 BP an
insolation maximum had arrived, maximizing the contrast between land and sea heating
and allowing monsoon conditions to develop. The ENSO system would suppress
hurricanes, but only in warm event years. The severe northers that characterize
contemporary Texas winter weather also probably appeared for the first time in the early
Holocene, perhaps around 8000 BP, as the Laurentide ice sheet waned.

Now that some of the key features of global climate during the transition to the
Holocene have been reviewed, I will present an introduction to the study area — Berger
Bluff and the drainage basin lying upstream from it.

BERGER BLUFF
Berger Bluff is a high, sandy, northeast-facing bluff that overlooks Coleto Creek
at the eastern edge of Goliad County. Victoria County lies on the other side of the creek,
and the city of Victoria is about 15.5 kilometers to the east. From the blufftop, the creek
seems timeless. Heavy mist often hangs low over the creek bottom until late in the
morning, when the sun breaks through to glance off the clear water and whiten the dewsoaked sand. Raucous kildeer ply the sedges and ragweed brakes along the creek, and
occasionally a coyote or a deer can be seen crossing the sandbars downstream. Once or
twice I have surprised egrets or graceful herons at the water's edge. Later in the day,
when the lowering sun stretches the mosaic of shadows on the ground into a long and
linear pattern, hawks often cruise for field mice in the grassy sloping floodplain across
the creek. But timeless as it seems, this sandy bluff is in fact an archive documenting a
68

somewhat changeable environment. The record, or at least the part of it that we know,
extends backward to the end of the Wisconsinan glacial stage.
The deposits at the base of Berger Bluff give considerable geologic evidence for
changes in the character of Coleto Creek as well as the area it drains. Berger Bluff itself
did not yet exist in the late Wisconsinan, although there were bluffs, or at least a valley
slope of about the same height, cut into the Goliad Formation and Lissie and Beaumont
terrace deposits in the immediate vicinity. Probably the valley margins varied from
sloping to steep-sided at times, depending on the availability of protective plant cover and
whether the creek happened to meander against the valley margin to form a cutbank.
Coleto Creek was apparently deeper, narrower, considerably muddier and more sinuous,
flowing over a floodplain that was lower and flatter, but not much wider in most places
than at present. Extreme floods appear to have been less common (at least until about
8500 BP), with the annual flow of the stream more evenly distributed. Floodplain
vegetation was probably adapted to wetter conditions, with less severe or frequent flood
damage. Throughout the Holocene, Coleto Creek continued to deposit alluvium on its
floodplain with little or no evidence of erosion. This continual aggradation seems to have
taken place despite the fact that the ultimate base level for the creek — the Gulf of
Mexico — had ceased to rise by about 4000 BP. At some point (perhaps near the end of
the Late Prehistoric; the dating is uncertain and will be discussed at length in a later
chapter) aggradation ceased and Coleto Creek experienced a major change in hydraulic
regime, and began cutting down to its present grade. The creek has now cut down
through all of its Holocene deposits and is incising sediments that were deposited at the
Pleistocene/Holocene boundary.

69

The site lies 82 km from today's Gulf coast, measured from the seaward side of
the Holocene barrier island (Matagorda Island), and 30 km from Green Lake, the
drowned head of the Pleistocene Guadalupe River valley. During the Late Pleistocene,
however (at, for example, eleven to twelve thousand years before present), with sea level
in the Gulf about 40 to 60 meters lower than at present, the Gulf coast would have been
positioned about 50-70 km farther to the southeast, leaving Berger Bluff a thoroughly
inland 150-170 km from the coast (Berryhill 1981a, 1981b, Beeville and Corpus Christi
quadrangles). This is about the same distance from the coast as Hallettsville or Karnes
City, under modern conditions. This Late Pleistocene positioning of the Gulf would have
tended to make the Coleto Creek basin climate slightly more continental in nature, just as
present-day Hallettsville or Karnes City are less affected by Gulf temperatures or
moisture than is Victoria.

HISTORY OF DISCOVERY AND INVESTIGATION
Berger Bluff has been well known locally for many years. A human burial (with
worn teeth) washed out of the cutbank years ago and was collected by Nelson Pantel and
others. Although the burial was reportedly found in cohesive sediments (Nelson Pantel,
personal communication), its stratigraphic position is unknown, and it seems unlikely it
relates to the earliest occupations of the site. The remains have since been lost. Local
avocational archeologists Bill Birmingham, Smitty Schmiedlin, Sonny Timme, and Ed
Vogt have all observed the site for years and have made collections from it. Timme, for
example, monitored the site regularly from 1956 to 1960; Birmingham monitored the site
in the early 1960's and has contributed from recollection some useful observations on the
appearance of the site before flooding spawned by Hurricane Beulah in 1963.
70

The planned construction by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA)
and Central Power and Light Company of a coal-fired power plant and a large cooling
reservoir on Coleto Creek south of the site provided a stimulus for formal studies of the
site, for the 98 foot normal pool level is very near the top of the bluff. In 1975 the GBRA
contracted with the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San
Antonio to begin a program of survey and testing in the reservoir area, and the Berger
Bluff site was first recorded by a UTSA survey crew the same year (Fox and Hester
1976). The site is a Texas State Archeological Landmark and has been determined
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (but is not listed). Test
excavations were dug in the spring of 1977. Two test pits were excavated to depths of
1.90 and 1.65 m below the blufftop surface, the latter in a portion of the site designated
41 GD 30B, farther upslope and well back from the edge of the cutbank (Fox, Black, and
James 1979). The part of the site which is of primary concern here has been designated
41 GD 30A, and in June, 1979, a UTSA crew returned to this part of the site and
excavated a 3 x 4 m block on the blufftop, a few meters back from the edge, to a
maximum depth of 2.54 m below ground surface (maximum depth was achieved only
in two one-meter squares). These excavations are reported by David Brown (1983).
During this phase Victoria avocational archeologist Sonny Timme discovered some small
bits of charcoal embedded in the sloping surface of an erosional bench about seven and a
half meters below the blufftop surface. A 1 x 1 m excavation unit, designated "Unit 2,"
was laid out and excavated to a maximum depth of 32 cm below the bench surface,
revealing a small hearth in situ. Charcoal collected by Timme from the hearth gave a
radiocarbon date of 11,550±800 BP (Tx-3569). The date helped to confirm the
considerable antiquity of the lower deposits, and to dispel doubts that the materials
observed in the lower deposits were in situ. At the same time, consulting geologist Glen
71

Evans, who many years ago had done the geologic study of the Berclair terrace
associated with the Buckner Ranch sites (Sellards 1940), inspected and recorded the
stratigraphic section exposed in the cutbank. The combined weight of Evans' assessment
of the lower, or bench deposits, and the radiocarbon date from the hearth left little doubt
of the significance of the bench area. Accordingly, more excavations on the bench were
sponsored by the GBRA for three weeks with a crew of four during November and
December, 1979, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as
amended) and its implementing regulations, 36CFR800; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969; and Executive Order 11593. This work was done under Texas
Antiquities Committee Permit No. 80, with Thomas R. Hester as principal investigator. I
supervised the field work and was assisted by Will Goetzmann, Dan Potter, Lang
Scruggs, and Don White, along with volunteers listed in the Acknowledgments. Later, I
continued to work at the site sporadically, on an unfunded basis with volunteer help
(mostly from Victoria avocational archeologists) from January to April, 1980. Work on
the lower deposits ended on April 18, 1980, with the rising water of the reservoir about
30 cm below the edge of the lowest excavation unit. It should be noted that although less
excavation was accomplished, the volunteer phase of the project produced some of the
most important data to come from the site. None of this would have been possible
without the contributions of interested local residents and CAR archeologists who
worked in weather ranging from warm, to cold and rainy, to sniveling cold.

In the summer of 1983 further work was done at Area B and at another site
downstream (41 GD 31) to assess the impact of the planned construction of Flume #3 for
the cooling reservoir. Several backhoe trenches were dug in and around area B by a

72

UTSA crew. This work, which is reported elsewhere (Brown 1986) contributed some
useful geologic information.

CONTEMPORARY CLIMATE
The Berger Bluff catchment (Fig. 1.12) is located in the subtropical humid
climatic zone of east Texas, although the boundary with the subtropical subhumid zone
lies only a short distance to the southwest (Larkin and Bomar 1983:2). It is part of the
South Central climatic division of the National Weather Service. Average annual rainfall
declines rather rapidly westward from this area. The nearest first-order weather station is
at the Victoria Regional Airport, located 25.75 km (16.0 miles) to the east-northeast of
Berger Bluff. Yorktown is the only weather station actually located within the catchment,
and it measures only precipitation. Victoria, Cuero, and Goliad are the only temperature
recording stations (the Cuero and Goliad stations also have a history of location shifts).
Although the smaller weather stations are operated by volunteer observers and frequently
have incomplete data (days when nothing was recorded), they are located closer to the
catchment and may give a better picture of local rainfall averages. Table 1.3 shows
precipitation and temperature recorded at Yoakum (DeWitt County), Goliad (Goliad
County), Victoria (Victoria County), plus precipitation measured at Yorktown and Cuero
(DeWitt County), and Runge (Karnes County).

The Berger Bluff catchment and the area around it generally gets about 84-94 cm
(33-37 inches) of rainfall annually, with a standard deviation of about 20-27 cm at any
one station, and an average of about 49 days per year with thunderstorms. Snowfall is so
infrequent that it can essentially be disregarded in the precipitation statistics. The record
snowfall of February 12-15, 1895 (twelve inches at Victoria; Griffiths and Ainsworth
1981:26) was a very rare event. Like the rest of Texas, the region experienced record low
rainfall in the mid-1950s drought. Yorktown received only 38.1 cm (15 inches) and the
Goliad 1 SE station received only 35.2 cm (13.85 inches) of precipitation in 1956. That is
nearly as dry as the long-term average for Sanderson. The highest annual rainfall for
Yorktown during the period of record was 143.4 cm (56.56 inches) in 1973, which is
comparable to the long-term average for Port Arthur. When data for the entire period of
record (1948-1996) are used, the mean annual precipitation at Yorktown rises to about 88
cm (Table 1.4), higher than that shown in Table 1.3 because Table 1.4 includes several
rainy years in the 1980s and 1990s.

Average annual temperature is slightly over 21º C (70-71° F); the standard
deviation is about 2° C at Cuero and Goliad. Daily highs run about 27-28º C, daily lows
slightly over 15º C. The growing season is about 270-290 days per year (74-79% of the
year). Because of its nearness to the Gulf, the region has a fairly maritime climate at
present, ranging at Victoria from an average minimum temperature in January of about 6º
C (43º F) to an average maximum in July of about 34º C (93.5ºF). As Fig. 1.13 shows,
the maritime climate of the Berger Bluff catchment translates to a low continentality
index, although the area is slightly more continental than adjacent parts of the coastal
plain.

Figure 1.13. Isopleth Map of Continentality Index for Texas. Distribution of
continentality (seasonal severity of climate), based on Conrad’s (1946)
continentality formula. Continentality is reduced along the Gulf coast and in
the Chisos Mountains, highest in north Texas and the Panhandle. Berger
Bluff is located in a part of the state that is less climatically sensitive. Note
that absolute values differ from Figure 1.1, which uses a slightly different
formula. Data for Texas (1951-80) are from Natural Fibers Information
Center (1987); for surrounding US states (1951-73, 1951-74) from Ruffner
(1980); for Mexico (mostly 1961-70), Mosiño Alemán and García (1974)
and NOAA (1979). Numbered localities: 1 = Berger Bluff, 2 = Richard
Beene site, 3 = Hall’s Cave.

78

Although the boundary of the subhumid climatic region lies to the southwest, it
would only require a slight reduction in annual rainfall or a small increase in evaporation
rate to move the boundary across the catchment to the northeast. There are some
indications that this may have occurred in the past. A scatter of large playa lakes can be
seen on the Lissie Formation north of Refugio (about 24-43 km from Berger Bluff);
particularly good examples can be seen on the USGS Live Oak Lake and Ryanville
quads. Although flooded now, these interesting features appear to have well-developed
lee dunes on the south side, suggesting at least seasonal desiccation and strong winter
winds from the north (departing from the prevailing southeasterly winds; see wind
discussion below). These playas are unstudied and undated, but suggest very strong, dry,
meridional air mass movement, presumably sometime during the Holocene (?). Aronow
(1982:88-89) discusses similar depressions on the Willis Formation. Other dunes on the
Beaumont Formation near Tivoli date about 1100-1200 cal BP (Otvos 2004:Table 4).
Despite this documented potential for aridification, most of the vertebrates and
invertebrates recovered from archeological deposits at Berger Bluff (both in the bench
deposits and in the late prehistoric midden at the top of the bluff) have affinities to the
more mesic east (east Texas and eastern US). The present-day geography of climatic
regimes as portrayed by Larkin and Bomar probably had no parallel in the Pleistocene,
when the geographic organization of regional climate may have been radically different.
Rainfall in the catchment
Like the rest of south Texas, maximum rainfall in the Berger Bluff catchment
occurs in the months of May and September, under the present-day climatic regime (in
neutral ENSO years), separated by summer and winter dry seasons. In years with warm
ENSO events, extra winter rainfall may occur. Most grasses in the catchment are adapted
79

to warm-season growth that depends on the pulse of moisture received in late spring. At
Yorktown, the only weather station within the catchment, average May rainfall from
1959 to 1979 was 11.66 cm; September rainfall was 14.45 cm; and the driest month was
March, with 3.12 cm. In Figs. 1.14 and 1.15 the average monthly rainfall for the same
period has been contoured on Yorktown and the four stations closest to the catchment
(Runge, Goliad, Cuero, and Victoria). In general, the isohyets in most months parallel the
geologic outcrops, indicating a potential for seasonal bias in sediment contribution by
different formations. The principal contrast is between the summer months of June, July
and August, and the rest of the year.
Five patterns of spatial distribution of rainfall seem to occur:
1. winter (November through February; and April): light rainfall (except in El Niño
years), decreasing with a south-southeasterly trend;
2. spring (March, May): heavy rainfall in May produced by south-southeasterly
diminishing frontal systems;

3. summer (June, July): rainfall decreasing northwest-ward, away from the coast;
convective thunderstorms;

4. late summer (August): rainfall decreasing northward; convective thunderstorms with
unusually high rainfall at Yorktown;

5. early fall (September, October): rainfall decreasing northwestward, with heavy rainfall
in some years produced by tropical hurricanes from the Gulf.

82

Cuero has a bimodal April-September precipitation pattern [1942-76 data;
Gustavson, Reeder, and Badger (1980:Fig. 5)]. Annual precipitation data for Beeville and
Victoria show the same bimodal May-September pattern, but Beeville also has a third
rainfall peak in early November, while Victoria shows a prominent peak in mid-June
(1961-1996 data downloaded from NOAA via the World Wide Web). This suggests there
are tertiary rainfall peaks that differ from station to station, and probably vary over
different periods of record, as well. Further investigation might show the November peak
at Beeville originates in ENSO warm event years.
Wind
The only weather station near the catchment to record wind direction is the
Victoria airport. Fig. 1.16 is a wind rose showing directional frequencies for wind at the
Victoria station from 1968 to 1978. It shows that the most common origin for wind is to
the southeast (azimuth N130° E to N160° E), chiefly from March through August when
insolation rates and diurnal heating are high. Wind from this direction originates as a
daytime land-sea breeze. During the day, the land heats faster than the adjacent Gulf,
resulting in lower air pressure over the land and consequent air flow (the "sea breeze")
from water to land; at night, the process reverses. Even though the airport is about 85 km
from the open Gulf, the sea breeze dominates wind direction. A secondary origin for
wind is northerly (azimuth N0º E to N30º E), chiefly from November through February,
due to winter intrusion of frontal airmasses from the northern Plains. This kind of wind is
likely to originate both during the day and at night. Another secondary wind source is
easterly to east-northeast (azimuth N50º E to N90º E), occurring chiefly from September
through November.

83

Figure 1.16. Average Annual Wind Direction, Victoria Airport. Wind rose shows
prevailing direction in ten-degree increments as a percent of the annual total.
The three major peaks are identified by month (source: NOAA
Climatological Data for Texas, 1968-1978).
Larkin and Bomar (1983:138-141) also show wind roses from the Victoria airport,
based on 1961-1980 data and segregated by season. Their diagrams also include wind
strength, however, and look somewhat different from the one I have shown here.

Wind direction will become significant when I discuss the evidence against eolian
origin of sediments at Berger Bluff, in a later chapter. For now, the reader should note
that northerly winds are much less common and prolonged than southeasterly winds,
although they may be strong (18 knots and above; Larkin and Bomar 1983:138).

84

CONTEMPORARY FLORAL ASSOCIATIONS
Vegetation in the catchment can be variously characterized depending on the
scale of mapping. Statewide vegetation maps simply show the area around the site as post
oak woodland or "oak-hickory forest" and the upper basin as "mesquite-chaparral
savanna." Vegetation mapping by the Bureau of Economic Geology (Fig. 1.17) shows
that the vegetation is to a large extent edaphically controlled (Smeins and Diamond
1983), with association boundaries following geologic formations closely. The Bureau
map shows a belt of "oak/ huisache/ elm woodland" (C5) surrounding the site, with a belt
of "oak-acacia woodland" (C6) to the west. These essentially occupy the Goliad
Formation, the latter belt sitting atop the higher and better-drained part of the cuesta. To
the east is the Lissie Formation, occupied by a savanna association ("bluestem/
indiangrass/ oak," B3). The contact between the Goliad and Lissie formations
corresponds rather closely to the contact between these woodland and savanna
associations. The upper part of the Berger Bluff catchment is covered by "mesquitecondalia chaparral" [A4, essentially the brushy southwestern extension of the Fayette
Prairie (Smeins and Diamond 1983)], with the head of the catchment lying in another belt
of oak-acacia woodland (C6).

These lie on the Fleming, Oakville, and Catahoula

formations. Most of the "A4" area of the catchment looks as if it might have been former
prairie, first converted to cropland and now to pasture, with grass or in some cases,
broomweed and other weedy invaders, along with scattered huisache trees (Fig. 1.18).
Streamcourses are generally intermittent, often with gallery thickets of huisache.

terrain near crest of cuesta, just inside the DeWitt/Karnes County line west

Most of the catchment, then, is covered by three major plant associations (C5, C6,
and A4), arranged roughly into thirds, becoming progressively more open and aridadapted as the more elevated and better-drained head of the catchment is approached to
the northwest. Except for the belt of post oak woodland at the head of the catchment in
Karnes County, the proportion of tree canopy diminishes up-basin, while the proportion
of chaparral and grasses increases. The heaviest belts of woodland are near Berger Bluff
and downstream from it, but even here the densest woodland is confined to terrace
remnants adjacent to Coleto Creek and its tributaries; interfluvial areas are much more
open (Fig. 1.19). These are gallery forests, but they occupy elevated terraces rather than
the present floodplain.
88

Figure 1.19. Upland Prairie. Pasture with scattered large live oaks on Goliad Formation,
about two miles east of Upper Meyersville, DeWitt County.
There is a surprising number of pine trees in and around the catchment, especially
on the sandy Fleming Formation. All of them appear to be introduced. I assume these are
all loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Many farmhouses in the region have one or two pine trees
planted in the yard. There is even a small pine grove on the east side of Yorktown, near
the American Legion hall (Fig. 1.20). Although these pines are not native to the
catchment now, and presumably cannot compete with native vegetation except when the
natives are removed and replaced with planted trees, they all appear to be thriving, and
many appear to be at least a couple of decades old. Since these pines appear to thrive
under current climatic conditions, I would guess that the substrate is suitable, and the
contemporary climate is only slightly beyond the tolerance of the species. The Lost Pines
89

variety of loblolly pine is better adapted to drought than east Texas varieties (Hacker and
Bilan 1995). This suggests pine could have been a minor but significant component of
catchment vegetation during the Pleistocene. The nearest stand of apparently native, nonintroduced pines that I am aware of is located on Sandies Creek, just south of Leesville,
about 32.5 km (20.2 miles) NNW of the head of the catchment.

Figure 1.20. Pine Trees at Yorktown. Stand of introduced loblolly pines on the eastern
outskirts of Yorktown, DeWitt County.
Pinus taeda is a southeastern species. In its present distributional core, the optimum
January temperature is about 7º C (range, 0.1-15.8º C), July 28º C (range, 21.4-29.0º).
Optimum precipitation is over 10 cm/month in both January and July (range, 5.6-15.0 cm
in January and 4.7-21.4 cm in July; Thompson, Anderson, and Bartlein 1999b).

The catchment was settled by German immigrants in the 1840s, after which bison
and antelope were replaced first by free-ranging cattle, then fenced cattle. Dobskyville
90

was settled in 1847. Coletoville and Meyersville were both reportedly founded in 1849
[although another source (Jacob and Egg 1978:3) says the Meyersville area was first
settled in June, 1846 and the historical marker in town says 1843]. An 1864 Confederate
map of the region (part of which is reproduced in Fox and Livingston 1979:Fig. 2)
indicates the post oak belt schematically and shows the extent of woodland in the
Coletoville-Berger Bluff area when the basin was still thinly settled. Domenech
(1858:146-147) in an undated passage probably referring to the period about 1849,
described the Goliad to Victoria trail as follows:
The country is very fertile; and maize is every where cultivated, while
magnificent tracts of rich pasturage support large herds of fine oxen, horses, and
sheep. We next crossed the Coleto, which runs through an extensive prairie, and
like all the rivers of Texas is bordered on each side by trees of great height and
strength, which grow so closely to each other, and are, besides, so interlaced with
the wild vine, ferns, and underwood, that in some places it is impossible for either
man or beast to force a passage through them.
Old church records from St. John Lutheran Church at Meyersville recount that
More settlers came and settled on the right and the left banks of the Twelve-Mile
Coleto, especially in the years from 1855-1859. The raising of cattle became
especially profitable because of the grass which in the beginning of the settlement
was so tall that it was almost impossible to walk in (Jacob and Egg 1978:4).
Native grassland has been severely reduced by 160 years of fire suppression,
which has allowed chaparral to increase, and heavy grazing pressure, which has thinned
ground cover, removed tall or mid-grasses (little bluestem, switchgrass, and indiangrass),
and allowed their replacement by "increaser" and "invader" species (see Gustavson,
Reeder, and Badger 1980:91). Some areas have been converted from rangeland to
improved pasture. Mechanized chaining of brushland first became widespread in south
Texas in the 1950s.
91

More detailed mapping can be found in environmental impact statements for two
areas in the catchment. A study by Gustavson, Reeder, and Badger (1980:91-92; Table
D1) includes a small part of the northern side of the catchment in the Threemile Creek
and Fivemile Creek drainages. Their map (Gustavson, Reeder, and Badger 1980:Fig. 25)
shows mostly grassland and parkland, with woodland along Fivemile Creek. A
quantitative and much more detailed study of the vegetation in the Coleto Creek reservoir
and power plant project area can be found in Espey, Huston & Associates (1976). The
final impact statement for the power plant (Environmental Protection Agency n.d.) is
simply a summary of that work, and contributes no new information.

The Espey, Huston & Associates pre-construction baseline study (1976) sampled
five different kinds of "stands" in the Coleto Creek power plant project area; the entire
project area is within the Bureau of Geology's "C5" association, but at this level of detail,
it can be seen that there are different kinds of woodland, brushland, and grassland
embedded within the post oak belt. The following descriptions are abstracted from the
text and tables in that report:

1) Live oak stand. Live oak (Quercus viginiana, 580 trees per hectare) with
sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), coma (Bumelia lanuginosa, or gum bumelia), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria) and persimmon (Diospyros texana) in the understory. Leaf litter comprises
over 70% of the ground cover, along with grasses (Paspalum, basketgrass and
bristlegrass). Frostweed occurs under the canopy.

2) Post oak stand. The overstory is about 67% post oak (Quercus stellata, 627
trees per hectare), 22% blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica, 160 trees per hectare), and
92

11% live oak (80 trees per hectare). On the Lissie terrace surface in the immediate south
and southwest of Berger Bluff, most of the post oak occurs in a parkland setting, with
individual trees rather widely spaced, and almost no understory (reportedly due to
grazing pressure). This area looks very much like a photo shown by Schmidly (1983:15).
The oldest and largest of these post oaks are about 300 years old, as shown by tree-ring
studies (to be discussed later). Other species include chittamwood, yaupon, hackberry,
mesquite, yucca, and prickly pear. Species of Panicum, Paspalum, smutgrass, three-awn,
lovegrass, and knotroot bristlegrass are the chief ground cover. Table 1.5 shows the
nature of the heavily grazed ground cover in the Coleto Creek power plant project area,
based on fall and spring samples; most of the cover is perennial grasses and annual forbs.
Little bluestem now represents less than one percent of the ground cover. Most of the
grasses are native warm-season grasses, but smutgrass is introduced, and Scribner's
panicum, round-seed panicum, little bluestem, and ozarkgrass are cool season grasses,
probably depending on both the May and September pulses of moisture for sustained
growth. Both C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways are represented. Cool season grasses
begin growing in early spring and continue well into the fall season; growth of warm
season grasses is confined to the summer warm season. Leaf litter represents 57-66% of
ground cover, while about 18-19% is bare ground.

Schmidly (1983:16) notes that
In the past it is probable that the grass layer in the entire post oak region was
dominated by bluestems and their tall-grass associates wherever light could reach
the ground. However, under heavy human use, which has severely affected the
whole region, most openings maintain a vegetation of low grasses such as
threeawns, panicums, lovegrass, and others.

The "potential plant community" listed for the Gravelly range site habitat in the
DeWitt County soil survey (Miller 1978:46) is
55 percent little bluestem; 15 percent indiangrass, switchgrass, beaked panicum,
and purpletop; 10 percent brownseed paspalum, side-oats grama, purple
lovegrass, and other grasses; 10 percent post oak and blackjack oak; 5 percent
hawthorns, American beautyberry, and greenbrier, and 5 percent lespedezas,
tickclover, bundleflower, snoutbean, and annual forbs.
This may be a better estimate of the presettlement ground cover in the post oak
belt than the actual quantitative studies of the present ground cover done by Espey,
Huston & Associates. Except for the grasses noted above, these natives are warm-season
grasses (that is, they are perennials, but mature in the warm part of the year).

3) Brushland. Brush consists of over 90% huisache (Acacia farnesiana, 381 per
hectare), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa, 210 per hectare), and post oak (133 per
95

hectare), along with some live oak, yaupon, and coma. About 12% of the ground cover is
litter. Ground cover is mostly knotroot bristlegrass (about 44-45% of ground cover),
Paspalum, Panicum, and ragweed.

4) Grassland. Grazing of grassland in the power plant project area has artificially
increased its species richness. Johnston (1963:460) notes the same effect for prairies
farther south on the coastal plain. Dominants include smutgrass, Bahia grass, knotroot
bristlegrass, thin paspalum, Scribner's panicum, round-seed panicum, oldfield three-awn,
pan American balsamscale, brownseed paspalum, Kearney three-awn, lovegrass, and
various forbs, mostly annual (Tables 1.6, 1.7). Here again, the grasses are mostly annuals.
Litter ranges from about 4-6%; bare ground ranges from about 5-23%.

5) Bottomland forest. The closed-canopy floodplain forest habitat was essentially
removed from the Berger Bluff catchment in the early Holocene. The Espey Huston
baseline study included one "bottomland forest" stand, but it is located three meters
above the creek bed (Espey, Huston & Associates 1976:2-9) on what is evidently a
narrow post-Beaumont terrace remnant, on the west side of Coleto Creek about 800 m
downstream from the mouth of Turkey Creek (USGS Fannin quad). It is therefore better
regarded as "terrace woodland," seldom flooded except in extreme flood events, and is
not really the functional equivalent of the late Pleistocene/early Holocene floodplain
forest.

PALEONTOLOGICAL CLUES TO PAST FLORA
Undated Quaternary fossils of both grazers (mammoths and Bison antiquus) and
browsers (mastodons) have been found in or near the catchment, suggesting it has long
supported some mixture of woodland and prairie. One of the earliest records is by
Berlandier, who reported in 1829 that

It was in this area on the banks of the Coleto that a resident of Goliad found a
molar of a mastodon. Although it was in three pieces it was taken to Dr. Chowell,
from whom I learned these details. A few years previously in the same place that
same resident found a tooth which, by the description he gave of it, could have
belonged to some large species of Anoplotherium (Berlandier 1980:552).

Howard (1931:33) reported that "the remains of a mastoden [sic] have been taken
from the banks of Caleta Creek [sic], eight miles West-Southwest of Victoria."
McReynolds (1981:29) reports a mammoth tooth from deposits on the south side of
Perdido Creek near its junction with Coleto Creek (now under the reservoir). Figure 1.21
shows a Bison antiquus skull found by Sonny Welsch on Eighteenmile Coleto Creek,
near Weesache. The unconfirmed presence of mastodon is interesting, since these
animals are usually interpreted as browsers living in wooded or shrubby habitats. Some
finds may be exhumed Miocene fossils.

Post oak dendroecology
David Stahle analyzed a set of 42 tree-ring chronologies from the south-central
US for his dissertation research on frost-damaged rings (Stahle 1990); a subset of nine of
these is used by Stahle and Cleaveland (1988) for their research on drought recurrence.
The southernmost of these sites (site 38) is a stand of post oaks (Quercus stellata) located
on the southwest side of Coletoville Road and on the northeast side of Turkey Creek, near
the Flume 3 right-of-way (Fig. 1.22). The location is on Lissie Formation sediments
about 2.3 to 3.1 km southwest of Berger Bluff (David Stahle, personal communication;
Stahle et al. 1985:103). The 330-year chronology for this stand, sampled in March 1983,
extends from 1682 to 1982. Only 0.13% of the rings in this set of trees were frost
damaged (compared to over 4% in interior parts of Texas; Stahle 1990:Table 1).
Generally speaking, the distribution of frost damage corresponds fairly well to
continentality as mapped in Fig. 1.13.

Figure 1.22. Post Oak Woodland. Looking south at mature post oak woodland on Lissie
Formation southwest of Coletoville Road, Goliad County. This stand was
cored in 1983 by David Stahle. Trees in this view are more closely spaced
than is typical for much of the surrounding area.
Figure 1.23 shows the tree-ring index for post oaks at this site, along with a
couple of smoothing methods applied to the original data. A spectral density plot (not
shown) of the data does not appear to show any noticeable frequency peaks, but a lowesssmoothed plot of the data (Fig. 1.24) shows what appear to be a series of surprisingly
regular peaks in the index. Intervals between successive peaks range from roughly 11-38
years (visually estimated). In this plot, the Y axis is the tree-ring index, shown on a
logarithmic scale. The tree-ring index is a measure of ring width that omits effects such
101

as growth that slows as a tree ages. Wide rings in these trees are produced by cool, moist
growing conditions, while narrow rings are produced by warm, dry conditions (Stahle
1990:32).

et al. (1985), covering the period 1682-1982.

Spectral analysis of the Palmer Drought Severity Index as estimated from the
subset of nine chronologies revealed one statewide frequency peak at 2.3 years and peaks

at 17.5 and 20 years for the Yegua Creek, Lavaca River, and Coleto Creek sites (Stahle
and Cleaveland 1988:70).

Same data shown in previous figure, with lowess weighting. Peaks of index
indicate cool-moist periods. Note logarithmic Y axis.

The tree-ring data do not help explain cyclic deposition at Berger Bluff, for the
climatic cycles seen in the post oak rings are too brief to be visible in the
geoarcheological record. Nor do they help date the late Holocene incision of the postBeaumont terrace, an event that probably begins anywhere from decades to centuries
before the beginning of the tree-ring record. Rather, the chief value of the tree-ring data is
that they demonstrate that evidence of cyclic climate change can be detected in the
103

biological record of the Coleto Creek basin, even though the area now experiences
substantial climatic buffering by the Gulf of Mexico (although the frost ring counts
clearly demonstrate that the chronologies are not nearly as sensitive as those from the
interior parts of the state). In summary, for the late Holocene the paleoclimatic record
appears somewhat climatically insensitive, but not entirely silent.
REGIONAL GEOLOGIC SETTING
The Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas is a broad, flat plain with low relief, consisting of
sediments which crop out in imbricated narrow bands parallel to the present coastline and
which become progressively younger toward the Gulf. Within the Berger Bluff catchment
basin (that is, that part of the Coleto Creek drainage basin lying upstream from Berger
Bluff) these formations range in age from Miocene to late Pleistocene; sediments younger
than these are confined to stream valleys. Since the late Tertiary as well as Quaternary
sediments contain fossilized plants and animals that are in some instances similar to
modern species, all the formations in the catchment basin are potential contributors of
relict life forms to the Late Pleistocene or Holocene sediments at the site. Special care
must be taken in the identification of snails, vertebrates, and fossilized plant parts to
distinguish potential environmental "background noise". As an example, freshwater
sponge spicules in the bench deposits may be at least partly derived from older Lissie
deposits upstream, since identical but less fragmented spicules have been found in soil
samples from the base of the Lissie cutbank.

Many of the Gulf coastal plain formations form low cuestas as a result of crosssectional resistance to erosion, and these create water gaps which inhibit lateral migration
of streams at the knickpoints. Coleto Creek itself heads on the Gulf-facing flank of the
104

Oakville Escarpment but has not cut through it. This escarpment appears as a
conspicuous ridge on the horizon when approached from the west on Highway 119.
Achalabhuti (1973:44) also recognizes a Goliad Cuesta in the catchment basin, but it
seems less well defined. Elevation in the Berger Bluff catchment varies from about 570
feet (175 m) on ridges at the head of the catchment to about 75 feet (23 m) for the bed of
the creek at the site.

Since the Pleistocene/Holocene sediments at Berger Bluff rise to nine meters
above the creek bed, we might ask whether some or all of this elevation may be due to
postdepositional uplift, either on a regional or a local scale. Several considerations argue
against it. First, the Coleto catchment lies in an area that has been generally subsiding
during the Quaternary, as a result of isostatic adjustment to sediment loading or to
differential loading caused by eustatic sea level changes in the Gulf (see Higgins 1969). It
is positioned well to the downwarped side of all of Winker's estimates of the position of
the hinge line for deformation of the Beaumont surface (Winker 1979:Fig. 44). Secondly,
the age of the deposits which are of concern here is probably less than the amount of time
required for significant deformation. Third, while there is a fault scarp passing near the
site, the site lies on the downthrown side of the scarp (Fig. 1.25).
CATCHMENT BASIN GEOLOGY
The Berger Bluff catchment is defined here as that part of the Coleto Creek
basin lying upstream from Berger Bluff — in other words, the maximum area that could
have contributed sediment to the deposits at Berger Bluff. It is a leaf-shaped area (Fig.
1.26) about 60 km long, 29 km wide, oriented northwest-southeast, and covers an area of
1011.77 square kilometers, heading in Karnes County on the southeastward-sloping face

of the Bordas-Oakville Escarpment. The maximum drainage length is 89 river kilometers
(55 miles) from Berger Bluff to the head of Salt Creek in Karnes County. It represents
less than 7% of the Guadalupe River basin, which covers 15,403 square kilometers.
Together with the San Antonio River basin (10,787 square kilometers), the two river
basins cover an area of 26,190 square kilometers at present, though the area was
somewhat larger in the early Holocene (see below). In terms of Schumm's (1977:Fig.
1-1) three fluvial zones, Berger Bluff lies in Zone 2, the sediment transfer zone. It is
107

important to remember that, because Berger Bluff lies near the distal end of the Coleto
Creek drainage, the climatic events that may have affected sediment deposition at the site
were primarily those taking place in DeWitt County, generally around Yorktown. Most of
the Berger Bluff catchment consists of fairly easily eroded, sandy Miocene sediments.
The major drainages in the catchment are Eighteenmile, Fifteenmile, Twelvemile, and
Fivemile Coleto Creeks. As defined by the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Beeville and Seguin
sheets; Barnes 1974, 1975) the Oakville Sandstone (Miocene), Fleming (Miocene),
Goliad (Miocene or Miocene/Pliocene), and Lissie formations (Pleistocene) crop out as a
succession of increasingly younger units proceeding downbasin toward Berger Bluff. The
Lissie Formation as defined both by Winker (1979) and the Geologic Atlas includes the
Montgomery and Bentley terraces (recognized as separate units farther up the coast but
considered indistinguishable here). There are also isolated very small remnants of the
Willis Formation, early Pleistocene or late Pliocene stream gravels occurring as small,
patchy deposits chiefly on the divide between the Coleto and the Guadalupe River,
overlying the Goliad Formation. Only about five and a half square kilometers of the basin
are covered by the Willis Formation, but the larger deposits are indicated in Figure 1.27
both as a potential source of cobble chert for making stone tools and as a possible source
of coarse lag gravels in present-day Coleto Creek. Another, later Pleistocene high gravel
deposit occurs as a single isolated remnant just outside of the catchment boundary
northwest of the head of Salt Creek, in Karnes County. It has been heavily quarried for
road metal, but enough gravel remains to demonstrate a unique lithology very
reminiscent of reworked Ogallala gravels in east Texas. In the stream valleys are situated
the two youngest units, post-Beaumont terrace deposits and very recent packages of
Holocene alluvium. Figure 1.27 shows that, in terms of proximity to the site, the Lissie
terrace is the most important source of alluvium for the site and the Oakville Sandstone
108

the least important. However, in terms of outcrop area, the ranks are somewhat different.
The Goliad Formation, with about 509 km2 of exposure occupies the first rank, and the
Lissie with about 12 km2, the next to last rank (Fig. 1.28)

The cuesta-forming Oakville Sandstone occupies the head of the catchment
basin in an area drained by the heads of Salt and Thomas creeks, and consists of light
gray medium-grained calcareous sandstone and yellowish-gray calcareous clay. Chert
and quartz gravel, vertebrate fossils, and redeposited Cretaceous invertebrates are also
present (Geologic Atlas of Texas, Seguin sheet). Vertebrates include softshell turtle,
alligator, extinct Miocene camels, horses, rhinoceroses, and a mastodon (Sellards,
Adkins, and Plummer 1932). Galloway and others (1986:Fig. 2) list its age as about 1923.5 million years. Tedford and others (2004:Fig. 6.2) list a slightly longer span, about
111

16.5-24.5 million years ago. Ragsdale (1960:26) reports grain size means from the
Oakville in Gonzales County ranging from 1.08 to 2.51 phi, with standard deviations
ranging from 0.57 to 0.72.

The Fleming Formation (formerly Lagarto Clay) occupies an area around
Yorktown drained by Yorktown and Smith creeks and may have been a major source of
the clay fraction in the Berger Bluff sediments. It consists of calcareous clay and
yellowish-gray to light gray, calcareous medium to coarse-grained sandstone (Seguin
sheet). It is similar to the Oakville, but more clay-rich. Vertebrate fossils, including
Miocene quadrupeds (see MacFadden and Skinner 1981; Prothero and Sereno 1982;
Prothero and Manning 1987), microvertebrates (Albright 1996; Schiebout and Ting
1998), salamanders, anurans, crocodilians, gar, drum, turtle, lizards, snakes (Holman
1977), occasional land invertebrates, and redeposited Cretaceous fossils occur in the
sediments. Galloway et al. (1986) list it as early Miocene. Tedford and others (2004:Fig.
6.2) list it as early to Middle Miocene, perhaps about 12.5-24.5 million years before
present. Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1932:746) report modal grain size chiefly in the
0.0 to 3.0 phi range.

The Goliad Formation, covering an area of about 509 km2, occupies nearly the
entire downstream half of the catchment, an area drained by Fivemile, Twelvemile,
Fifteenmile, and Eighteenmile Coleto creeks and Hoosier Creek. The Goliad sandstone
also forms several ridge-capping erosional outliers to the northeast of Yorktown. Its
updip erosional face is sometimes referred to as the Bordas Escarpment. The Goliad
consists of pink or green clay, medium to coarse-grained sand and sandstone,
conglomerate consisting of gravel in a caliche or sandy matrix, and marl or limestone. At
112

the Highway 622 crossing over the Coleto, five kilometers upstream from Berger Bluff, a
section of the Goliad (now drowned by the lake) consists of two to three meters of white
to gray sandstone overlain by white, pink and red sandy marl with caliche nodules (cf.
Achalabhuti 1973:47). The Goliad is actually a heterogeneous, poorly defined unit that
has served as a catchall term for calcareous strata above the Lagarto clay and below the
Lissie Formation. Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer recognize three members, Lapara,
Lagarto Creek, and Labahia, with gravel more common in the lower strata; they list the
overall composition of the Goliad as about 80% sand, 5% gravel, 10% clay, and the
remainder calcium carbonate. Modal grain size is about 2.0 to 3.0 phi (Sellards, Adkins,
and Plummer 1932:758). It is roughly 5-10 million years old. Extinct horse (Hulbert
1987), rhinoceros, camel, canid, cervid, antilocaprid, and bird bones have been found in
the Goliad. A more recent study of the formation by Hoel (1982) suggests that the
members recognized by Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer have no regional significance.
According to her, the Cuero and Eagle Lake fluvial systems (recognized in subsurface
Goliad deposits chiefly on the basis of electric well logs) are characterized by channel fill
facies with poor to moderately well sorted medium to coarse sand and pebbly sand and
minor components of fine sand, silt and clay; crevasse splays are characterized by
medium to fine sand and silt with minor components of coarse sand, pebbly sand, and
clay; and floodplain facies are characterized by mottled red and white calcareous clays
with white caliche nodules and stringers (Hoel 1982:79-87). Arrendondo and Thomann
(1996:285-287) also provide a detailed description of Goliad Formation petrology.
Although the Geologic Atlas of Texas originally assigned the Goliad Formation to the
Pliocene, Hoel (1982:Fig. 7) assigns the basal part to the Miocene, and regards the entire
formation as stratigraphically equivalent to the Willis Formation (a relationship not
recognized by other stratigraphers, and probably not valid). Late Miocene climate is
113

thought to have been generally arid and strongly seasonal, characterized by widespread
expansion of C4 grasses and high rates of animal extinctions.

This unit is represented at Berger Bluff by exposures of white, friable to well
indurated, calcareous cemented sandstone in the ravine next to the site and by caliche
and well indurated sandstone bedrock exposed in backhoe trenches in area B. A few
samples have been disaggregated and analyzed for grain size distribution. A more
detailed description will be provided in Chapter 4.

The Goliad Formation is an important part of the Berger Bluff story. Although
parts of the unit are well cemented, much of it is so friable and coarse-grained that it is
easily erodible. As a result Coleto Creek is much more deeply and narrowly incised
(about 14 meters at Arnold Road, for example) during its passage across the Goliad
Formation than either upstream or downstream. Sediment production rates from the
Goliad outcrop are very high, unless the surface is well stabilized by vegetation. The
Goliad Formation is also an important aquifer, as will be seen in later chapters.

The Willis Formation, as mentioned before, is a Pleistocene (or Pliocene,
according to some interpretations; Winker 1979:104, Hoel 1982:Fig. 7) fluviatile deposit
that is insignificant in areal extent, occurring only as patchy remnants on the ColetoGuadalupe divide, overlying the Goliad Formation. It has sometimes been equated with
the Citronelle Formation of the Gulf coast between Mississippi and Florida, but the
Citronelle Formation is evidently late Pliocene (about 2.7-3.4 million years old; Otvos
1998). It is of importance, however, as a possible source of cobble-sized chert, quartzite
or other rocks. Collins (2002) provides a thorough discussion of this chert source, and
114

Glascock (2002) has characterized its chemical composition. It also includes fine to very
coarse sand, silty yellow-gray to mottled red and light gray clay with iron oxide
concretions locally abundant. Willis deposits frequently support post oak motts. The
formation equates in part with a pre-Lissie terrace surface

The remaining stratigraphic units in the Coleto Creek catchment — Lissie,
Beaumont, and post-Beaumont — are exposed in the immediate vicinity of Berger Bluff
and will be described in considerably more detail in a later chapter. The origin of the
Pleistocene units has been summarized by Winker:
The lower Texas coastal plain is essentially a clay-rich alluvial plain made up of
coalescing low-gradient fans. The Beaumont alluvial plain onlaps an older surface
(Lissie) which was tilted seaward prior to Beaumont deposition; the Lissie in turn
onlaps remnants of older surfaces. During Beaumont deposition, each major
coastal river deposited a branching network of meanderbelt sand-bodies by
repeated avulsions... (Winker 1979:vi). Smoothing of the shoreline by waves
resulted in deposition of strike-oriented sand bodies in interdeltaic bights (Winker
1979:150).
Overbank muds fill the interfluves.
The

Lissie Formation, although covering only about twelve km2 of the

catchment, lies immediately upstream from Berger Bluff, extending almost as far as the
Highway 622 bridge, and because of its proximity to the site can be expected to have
been a major contributor of sediment. Comparisons of grain size for the Berger Bluff
sediments and two stratigraphic sections in the Lissie terrace just upstream from the site
will be presented later. The distinctively pink to red, iron and manganese-rich Lissie
sediments consist of sand, silt, and clay, with some gravel; zones of caliche nodules occur
in the cutbank near the site and elsewhere in the formation. Winker (1979:34) estimates
the Lissie to be between 0.4 and 1.4 million years old.
115

The Beaumont Formation encloses the post-Beaumont sediments across the creek
from Berger Bluff, but presumably contributed no sediment to the site. Winker (1979)
estimated the age of the Beaumont Formation at 12,000-130,000 BP; radiocarbon assays
on the equivalent Prairie Formation in Louisiana range from 23,080 RCYBP (or early
Late Glacial Maximum; Birdseye and Aronow 1991) to more than 50,000 RCYBP. More
recent optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates summarized by Otvos (2005:Table
4) range from 27,900 ± 2500 to about 135,000 calendar years BP (with a few scattered
dates up to 194,000 BP). These deposits were formed during a period when sea level lay
below its present level, rising and falling, but generally dropping as the polar regions
became increasingly glaciated (Lambeck, Esat, and Potter 2002:Fig. 2, a). Fluvial facies
consist of fine-grained meanderbelts separated by overbank clays. Vertebrate fossils
include giant ground sloth (Eremotherium sp., Elsik 1986), fish, snakes, aquatic snails
(Amnicola limosa, Cincinnatia cincinnatiensis, Planorbella trivolvis) and freshwater
mussels (Amblema, Leptodea, Toxolasma; Aronow, Neck and McClure 1991).

In addition to the stratigraphic units already mentioned, there are about 101 km2
of creek alluvium within the valleys of Coleto Creek and its tributaries upstream from
Berger Bluff. About 53 km2 represents modern alluvial fill in temporary storage by the
fluvial system, chiefly sand with localized deposits of cobble-sized chert, petrified wood,
and quartzite. This fill presumably postdates the Berger Bluff deposits. The remainder, 48
km2, consists of Quaternary terrace deposits (probably mostly post-Beaumont, perhaps
partly contemporaneous with Berger Bluff deposits).

116

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
Although written in the present tense, the following is a description of the site and
its surroundings as they appeared before inundation by the reservoir.
Northeast-facing Berger Bluff rises nine meters above the bed of Coleto Creek, to
an elevation of about 100 feet (30.5 m) above mean sea level (Fig. 1.29). Back from the
bluff edge, the sloping, eroded surface of the post-Beaumont terrace continues to rise
gently another four and a half meters in height to a low, rounded hill, underlain by Goliad
marl and sandstone bedrock, roughly a hundred meters back from the bluff edge. This
area of the site, designated 41 GD 30B, is partly wooded and partly covered with pasture
grasses. The area next to the bluff edge (41 GD 30A) is covered with a thick anaqua
grove in which hackberry, persimmon, and brazilwood trees can also be found. Mustang
grapevines festoon the bluff edge and anaqua trees.

Bordering the site to the northwest is a narrow, deep ravine (Fig. 1.30, with its
mouth shown near the number "1") which has cut down, through Goliad sandstone
bedrock, to about nine meters below the crest of the hill. This ravine appears to be a very
old erosional feature, probably predating all of the post-Beaumont deposits. In the bottom
of the ravine, west of the site, is a small permanent spring, a pool of water a few meters
across, bordered by cattails (Typha sp.; Fig. 1.31). Fed by groundwater emerging from an
aquifer in the Goliad Formation, the spring — or others like it — is evidently as old as
the ravine itself and may well be one reason why Berger Bluff has been so persistently
occupied throughout prehistory. It was also the carbonate-laden groundwater from this

site, but the site is located along the cutbank on the south side of the creek.
The circled area south of 41 GD 31 is a surface concentration of patinated
chipping debris lagged atop the terrace scarp. Note the smooth nature of the
post-Beaumont sediments on the north side of the creek and the much
greater dissection of the older Lissie Formation deposits on the south side of
the creek.

can be seen in the walls of the ravine, separated by an erosional contact from the
overlying Lissie sediments, which near the contact sometimes incorporate gravels or
other clasts eroded from the bedrock. The headward part of the ravine is bedrock floored,
and several wet weather seeps occur there (Fig. 1.32).

As it nears Berger Bluff, Coleto Creek swings southeastward in a broad, gently
curving arc that allows the creek to cut into the base of the bluff over a long reach. At
present, the Coleto is cutting downward and shifting its channel southward along this
reach, and has probably been doing so for some time. It is perhaps partly because of this
southward-and-downward movement that the Goliad County side of the creek has a steep
cutbank, while the Victoria County side slopes gradually down to the creek bed (Fig.
1.33). The present cutbank corresponds closely to the scarp representing the maximum
southwestern limit of Beaumont age valley widening. The Beaumont surface is about 2.5
km across in the vicinity of the site.

Figure 1.33. Cross-Section of Deposits Along Line A-B. This view looks upstream.
Vertical exaggeration is 10X. Berger Bluff comprises Area A, Area B, and
bench (base for topography: URS/Forrest and Cotton, Coleto Creek project
map, sheet 140).
The cutbank along most of this reach of the creek just forms a vertical bluff with a
low toe slope and a narrow, vegetated bank at its foot. At Berger Bluff, however, erosion
of the overlying unconsolidated sediments has left a more resistant stratum remaining as
a narrow erosional bench, the surface of which is about 1.5 m above the creek bed. The
slumped and eroded area forms a shallow alcove (Fig. 1.34) about 7.5 m wide and
approximately 22 m long. Much of this area is covered by slumped bluff deposits which
form a steep toe slope 2.5 m high, extending to within four meters of the terrace surface.
About 66 m2 of the bench deposits remained clear of slumped fill at the beginning of
124

excavations. The toe slope was covered with leaf litter, grasses, a thick stand of ragweed,
and a tangle of anaqua trees that had fallen from the bluff, mixed with some driftwood
from floods in previous years. All of this loose vegetation was cleared off before
excavation was begun.

Figure 1.34. Looking Southwest at Bench Area Before Excavation. Debris on bluff face
and slipoff slope was removed at beginning of project. Note thick, welldeveloped soil at top of section, and excavated hearth (Feature 5, white area
on shelf at right side). Photo taken November, 1979.
Plants growing on the toe slope included several grasses, such as hairy grama
(Bouteloua hisuta), rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis), coast cockspur
(Echinochloa walteri), savanna panicum (Panicum gymnocarpon), southwestern
bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei), and vaseygrass (Paspalum urvillei), along with snow-onthe-prairie (Euphorbia bicolor), broomweed (Xanthocephalum dracunculoides), giant
125

ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), another unidentified composite, an unidentified legume,
giant pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), dewberry (Rubus trivialis), and groundcherry
(Physalis sp.). Some plant parts, generally leaves or wood, occurred as stream drift
lodged on the slope, or as debris from the anaqua grove on the bluff. These included
leaves and fruit of sycamore (Plantanus occidentalis), ash (Fraxinus cf. pennsylvanica)
leaflets, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) needles and wood, hackberry (Celtis
laevigata) leaves, leaves of walnut or pecan (Juglandaceae), and possibly chinkapin oak
(? Quercus muehlenbergii; plant identifications by Billy Griffin and Russell Castro, SCS;
O. W. Van Auken, UTSA; and the author).

Very little is known about the spatial extent of cultural deposits near the base of
the bluff. The distribution of more recent cultural debris on the surface of the blufftop is
shown in the Flume No. 3 report (Brown 1986:Fig. 2), but the horizontal extent of the
much older and more deeply buried archeological remains near the base of the bluff is
likely to be somewhat different. A few isolated items were noted in the cutbank
downstream from the bench area. Measured from the east end of the cutbank profile (at
the 17-meter mark), these include some mussel shell and charcoal 20.1 m downstream;
more mussel shell 23.3 m downstream; and charcoal and fired clay (?) 28.4 m
downstream. All of these occurrences appear to be discontinuous, isolated items and are
not considered part of the bench deposits. In two interviews (2/12/83 and 6/19/98) Bill
Birmingham has passed along his recollections of the bench area when he visited the site
in the 1960s. At the time, according to Birmingham, the cutbank lay farther to the north
and the mussel shell zone in stratum 2A was denser and better defined, and included
some chipping debris. He also recalls seeing a well-defined hearth near the top of the
bench area. This hearth, evidently separate from and downstream from Feature 5, but
126

about the same size, had orange fired clay and was lined with hard objects (sandstone or
fired clay).

The sandy creek bed is wide (25 m across at the bench), flat and shallow. The
clear, steadily flowing water is in most places 20 cm deep or less. Several informants
noted that in past years a large hole existed here, deep enough for fishing or swimming
(Nelson Pantel, Stan Pantel, Leslie Berger, personal communication); it has since filled
with sand, perhaps during Hurricane Beulah in 1967. They also remembered that in years
past the main channel lay farther to the northeast; in fact, the channel split around a
sandbar, the main part passing to the north, in an area now choked with sand. Both banks
of the creek are lined with a narrow band of horsetails (Equisetum cf. E. laevigatum) and
sedges (probably Cyperus erythrorhizos or C. odoratus).

Wide, flat, unvegetated sandbars, rhombohedral in plan view (Fig. 1.35), break up
the channel, but shift position after each high discharge. On the opposite side of the creek
is a vegetated lee side dune about a meter high, composed of clean, loose sand partially
anchored by sedges and weeds (Figs. 1.36, 1.37). It isn't clear whether this deposit of
windblown sand is derived from the active channel, delivered by the prevailing southeast
wind, or from dry, loose sand in the chute to the northeast, driven by the north winds
associated with Arctic frontal systems in late fall, winter, and early spring. The first
possibility seems unlikely since most of the sand in the active channel is continuously
damp and therefore not easily picked up even by strong winds. Determining the source of
this channel-margin dune would help to clarify whether any of the deposits in the postBeaumont terrace topstratum are eolian.

Figure 1.36. Sand Dunes Opposite the Site. Looking north at small dunes bordering
Coleto Creek northeast of site.
This long, narrow stabilized dune forms a continuous border between the active
channel and a broad, flat overflow chute to the northeast. The chute (Fig. 1.37) is about
120 m wide, extending about 700 m both up and downstream from Berger Bluff. Its flat
bottom is about three meters above the active creek bed and is interrupted by brush piles,
small dunes and scours, and lag deposits of gravel and cobbles, possibly brought in by the
record high discharge of Hurricane Beulah in 1967. A chute bar at the downstream end
has formed where velocity of the overflow, reentering the main channel, decreases to
such an extent that the sediment load can no longer remain entrained; most of the chute
129

opposite Berger Bluff is bounded by a low, sandy cutbank, beyond which a gentle slope
slowly rises once more to the level of the post-Beaumont terrace surface.

Figure 1.37. Overflow Chute. Looking northwest (upstream) at overflow chute northeast
of site, with ripples probably left by last flood event.
The lower reaches of Coleto Creek (chiefly in the Schroeder quad) are fairly well
incised and really have no active floodplain except near its distal end, just before
disemboguement onto the Guadalupe River floodplain. Here and elsewhere along its
course, overflow chutes fill the function of an active floodplain by straightening and
widening the channel during high discharge. During the flood of January 20, 1980, for
example, flood stage at Berger Bluff peaked at about 83 feet MSL yet did not climb out
of the chute opposite the site.

130

Several flow gauging stations are maintained on Coleto Creek and its tributaries,
but the period of record for some of these is limited. One station (08176600), located on
Threemile Coleto Creek near Cuero, is a partial-record station operated from 1969 to
1974. Another (8177000), at the Highway 622 crossing five kilometers upstream from
Berger Bluff, was operated from January, 1930 to December, 1933, and from October,
1952 to November, 1979. It is the most useful data source for examining the hydrology of
the Berger Bluff catchment up to April, 1980, when reservoir impoundment began to
affect the stations downstream. It also corresponds to sampling locality "C-1" in the preinundation aquatic ecology study (Murray, Jinnette, and Moseley 1976). After March 6,
1980, the makeup pipeline diverting water from the Guadalupe River (southwest of
Nursery) into the reservoir above the Highway 622 bridge became operational. Before
this station was discontinued, another gauging station (0817900) was established 5.7 river
kilometers upstream at the Arnold Road crossing of the creek, where the makeup pipeline
cannot affect it, and this station has been in operation from October, 1978 to the present.

A station (08176550) is located at the US 183 bridge over Fifteenmile Creek
about halfway between Weser and Upper Meyersville, but has daily mean discharge
records only from October, 1984 to September, 1989, long after field work at Berger
Bluff was completed. Another station (8177500) is located downstream from the site,
near the Highway 59 crossing, and was operated from June, 1939 to September, 1954. A
new series of stations (8176900 through 8177410) has been established in the reservoir
area, but these are quite recent. The following discussion is based on the USGS records
obtained from the stations mentioned above (data downloaded from the USGS web site),
on observations of the creek itself, and on summary comments by Morton and Donaldson
(1978) and the Coleto Creek Power Station EIS (Environmental Protection Agency n.d.).
131

THE CONTEMPORARY COLETO CREEK FLUVIAL SYSTEM
The drainage network for the catchment begins on the Gulfward-sloping face of
the Oakville cuesta, near the Karnes-DeWitt county line, and passes through the former
prairie occupying the Oakville Formation and Fleming Formation. The small creeks here
(such as Salt and Little Salt Creek) are intermittent drainages that usually have no
standing water except where scour pools are deep enough to intercept the water table;
these are characterized by stagnant, turbid water. The streams are not incised much below
the surrounding terrain, and there is no well-defined floodplain (Fig. 1.38).
Streamcourses are often marked by gallery thickets of huisache, with willows at scour
pools.

Farther down the catchment, south to east of Yorktown and still on the Fleming
Formation, perennially standing or flowing water becomes more common, creek channels
(such as Cottonwood or Smith Creek) generally have bimodally sized bed sediments,
with mud and/or pebble or small cobbles on the bottom, and a weakly defined floodplain
may or may not be present (Fig. 1.39). The Fleming Formation has a higher percentage of
clay and other fine-grained sediments than the Oakville or Goliad Formation. The active
channel may be anywhere from about a meter wide to about nine meters wide (where
pools have formed behind obstructions). Willows are common along elongate pools.

132

Figure 1.39. Smith Creek. Looking downstream at Smith Creek about four kilometers
south of Yorktown, DeWitt County. Banks are clay-rich alluvium inset into
Fleming Formation bedrock. Channel is about a meter wide, with mud and
pebble bottom.
Where the drainage network crosses onto the Goliad Formation, to the west of US
183, the relief increases, the streams become more deeply incised, and they begin to carry
the heavy sand bedload that is characteristic of the Coleto Creek drainage for the
remainder of its course toward the Guadalupe River (Fig. 1.40). The increased relief is
perhaps due to greater induration and, at least in the reach upstream from Berger Bluff,
134

due to the fact that this part of the outcrop has been probably been elevated as an upthrust
fault block. Meandering channels (bordered by sedges and large willows) carrying a
constant base flow of clear water between rhombohedral sandbars become common at
this point. Twelvemile and Fifteenmile Coleto Creek, the two principal tributaries, are
examples. Below their junction, the drainage is simply referred to as "Coleto Creek," and
it is deeply incised into the surrounding terrain from this point until it passes onto the
Lissie Formation. At the Arnold Road crossing, for example, the maximum depth of
incision is about 14 m. The following discussion applies mainly to this lower section of
Coleto Creek, from the Twelvemile-Fifteenmile Creek junction downstream to Berger
Bluff.

The essential characteristic of Coleto Creek is its "flashy" discharge: long periods
of low flow (or sometimes none at all) are broken by episodes during which the creek
swells overnight to flood stage, then falls nearly as rapidly. These episodes generally last
four days or less. Discharge usually peaks within 24 hours and returns to normal flow
within the succeeding 72 hours, more or less. Sometimes a much smaller peak precedes
or follows the main peak.

135

Figure 1.40. Coleto Creek. Looking upstream (west) at Eighteenmile Coleto Creek one
kilometer south of Ander, Goliad County. Note small flowing channel
incised into rhombohedral sandbars, and wide, flat floodway.
The significance of this discharge pattern is that very high velocities are
periodically available to move larger caliber bedload material, but the sustained periods
of turbulence necessary to move a substantial suspended load are absent, so the Coleto
runs clear again soon after every flood. It is thus a bedload stream (Morton and
McGowen 1980:39), rather than a suspended load stream, in Schumm's (1977:Table 5-4)
terminology. Morton and Donaldson 91978:10350 classify the lower reaches as a mixedload stream, but that does not appear valid for the rest of the drainage. These very high
velocities are important since the weight of the largest particles of sediment entrained by
the stream is proportional to the sixth power of the velocity (Mackin 1972:136). In other
words, very large increases in velocity are necessary to effect relatively small increases in
136

competence (the ability of a stream to transport material of a certain caliber). This pattern
contrasts with that of the Guadalupe River and San Antonio River, which transport
chiefly suspended rather than bed sediments (Holley 1992:100).

Some idealized hydrographs are shown schematically in Figure 1.41. The lower
part typifies contemporary Coleto Creek. The upper part illustrates another catchment
(Black Cypress Bayou, upstream from Jefferson in Marion County) that is very nearly the
same size but located in a wetter climatic regime, to show what the hydrograph of a
suspended load stream might look like (it is also perhaps a good analog for Coleto Creek
during the Pleistocene). The important thing to note here is that for fine-grained
sediments (clay and silt) to be deposited on a floodplain or in a channel, the waning phase
(recession limb) of a flood ought to persist for at least several days to allow very fine
sediments to drop out of suspension. For significant accretion of fine-grained sediments
on floodplains, persistence of stilling waters at overbank levels is required. Conditions
like these are lacking in the modern Coleto Creek system, but are perhaps more likely in
the Black Cypress Bayou drainage (I have no data on overbank flooding, however).

137

Figure 1.41. Idealized Hydrographs for Streams in Two Different Climatic Regimes. Top
diagram, contemporary Black Cypress Bayou (Marion County) has a
flattened hydrograph with slowly receding floodwaters that deposit
suspended sediment, but cannot move a very heavy bedload. Pleistocene
Coleto Creek might have looked much like this. Bottom diagram,
contemporary Coleto Creek has flashy discharge, a very peaked hydrograph,
and very little lag time between rainfall and flood events; it can move a very
heavy bedload but cannot deposit much suspended sediment.
138

Rainfall and runoff
In order to illustrate some of the pre-inundation characteristics of Coleto Creek, I
have prepared hydrographs and rainfall graphs for five different years. In each of these
diagrams, discharge at USGS station 08177000 (the Highway 622 bridge over Coleto
Creek, five kilometers upstream from Berger Bluff) is plotted in cubic feet per second
(left vertical axis), while rainfall at Yorktown is shown in inches (right vertical axis). For
heuristic purposes, I have selected two ENSO cold event years (1956 and 1975), two
ENSO warm event years (1957 and 1976), and the year 1967 (another ENSO cold event
year) is shown to illustrate the effects of Hurricane Beulah. Hurricane Beulah broke the
drought of 1960-67, which was nearly as severe as that of 1950-57. The first figure (Fig.
1.42) shows the transition between 1956, the worst drought year of the 1950s, and 1957,
a rainy year that broke the drought. The figure showing 1975-76 (Fig. 1.43) shows the
period just before excavations at Berger Bluff, the same two years during which the
aquatic ecology of the creek was studied by Murray, Jinnette, and Moseley (1976). These
five years should give a good picture of how contemporary climate shapes the hydrologic
character of the creek.

The discharge peaks shown on the graphs are perhaps best termed "discharge
events" or "streamflow peaks," rather than "flood events," since presumably only the
largest events shown here exceed the bankfull capacity of the creek. I have not tried to
identify which events represent actual overbank floods. Several things can be noted by
studying the Coleto Creek hydrographs:

Yorktown and flood events (gauged at Highway 622 bridge near Schroeder,

example, the upper diagram runs from January 1956 on the left to January
1957 on the right). Note short duration and peakedness of flood events, and
clustering in May and November. Precipitation in inches (scale on right

the previous figure is shown here in greater detail. Each tick mark on the X
axis represents a day’s time. Note that most flood events gauged at the
Highway 622 bridge are either simultaneous with or at most, follow by one
day the corresponding rainfall event measured at Yorktown.

144

1. Rainfall and runoff events are clustered, usually in April-May, October, and sometimes
January.

2. Base flow for Coleto Creek is so low that it is not visible on these graphs.

3. Discharge events at Highway 622 follow rainfall events so closely that on these
illustrations, the rainfall peaks are usually hidden behind the discharge peaks. In
Figure 1.44, I have shown an enlarged detail of the months of April and May from the
preceding figure so the time relationship can be seen better.

4. As the detailed illustration shows, discharge events often occur on the same day as a
rainfall, or sometimes on the following day. The discharge event of April 18, 1976,
actually precedes by one day the main rainfall event of 1.7 inches at Yorktown.

5. Study of the numerical data shows that there are many small rainfall events that do not
show up in the discharge curves. Usually these are in late summer, when the ground is
dry and rainfall is directly absorbed without running off. There are also some
discharge events with no corresponding rainfall at Yorktown. This suggests the
drainage basin is sufficiently large that a single central station like Yorktown is not
adequate to capture all rainfall events.

6. The recession limb for Coleto Creek discharge events is rarely more than about three
or four days.

145

In Table 1.8, I have tried to estimate average lag times between rainfall events and
clearly related discharge events. Sometimes this is difficult, when a series of rainfall and
discharge events overlap (especially in the case of Black Cypress Bayou). As the table
shows, average lag time is only about half a day, indicating that rainfall at Yorktown
moves as runoff into the lower Coleto Creek drainage very rapidly (overland distance
between these two recording stations is about 35 km). I have not tried to compute mean
length of the discharge recession limb, but it clearly would not be much longer.

Figure 1.45 shows the largest discharge on record at the Highway 622 gauging
station. On September 21, 1967, 10.62 inches of rain fell at Yorktown during Hurricane
Beulah (followed by 9.49 inches the next day), and a peak average daily discharge of
74,800 cfs was recorded at the station. After the flood, the maximum instantaneous
discharge was computed at 122,000 cfs based on a flood stage of over ten meters (from
the evidence of flood marks). The discharge averaged over the entire day is shown in
Figure 1.45; for a hydrograph of the instantaneous value, see Schroeder et al. (1974:Fig.
24) and Morton and McGowen (1980:Fig. 23). According to local residents, this
represents the highest stage since at least 1872 (USGS 1974:85), indicating that flood
may be close to the "hundred-year flood" for Coleto Creek (the peak discharge for the
Guadalupe River on the same day was actually slightly smaller, 70,000 cfs; US Army
Corps of Engineers 1968:Table 5). Note that because this flood was nearly an order of
magnitude larger than previous ones, both vertical scales on the figure have been changed
compared to the other figures. Other major flood events occurred at the Highway 622
station in 1946 (63,700 cfs) and 1925 (46,700 cfs).

Convective thunderstorms cannot produce rainfall over an entire basin the size of
the Berger Bluff catchment. Thunderstorms associated with a frontal passage can cover a
larger area, but a hurricane, even if it merely approaches the catchment without entering
it, can cover the entire basin with simultaneous rainfall, and can produce two or three
days of continuous rain, as Hurricane Beulah did). Pettus, in Bee County, received over
27 inches of rain over the course of several days. The hurricane struck the coast near
Brownsville on September 20, traveled northwest to Duval County, then on the following
morning stalled and veered southwestward into Mexico. At the turn point in Duval
County on the 21st, the center track of the hurricane remained 190 km away from
147

Yorktown (Schroeder et al. 1974:Plate 1), yet still produced record-breaking rainfall. On
September 21, 10.0 inches of rain fell eight miles west of Nursery, 16.0 inches at Fannin,
and 18.0 inches at Victoria; on the 22nd, 21.02 inches fell at Weesatche, while 22.2
inches fell 10 miles northwest of Victoria, and at least 21.0 inches fell eight miles
southeast of Yorktown (Schroeder et al. 1974:Table 2. Despite the magnitude of this
flood, flow had returned to less than 100 cfs by October 1.

Although frontal passages can also cause severe flooding and erosion, there are
some significant differences in scale that might be recognizable in the geological record.
Frontal passages tend to be fast-moving, often producing no more than a couple of days
of rainfall, and they generally move north to south in this region, or down-drainage.
Large hurricanes can be immense. Some of the more recent examples have been observed
to cover nearly the entire Gulf in satellite imagery. A storm of this size can easily cover
most of the eastern half of Texas, even after moving inland, and the sprawling
circulations of such storms tend to produce a lot of rain. A large hurricane can change
track and meander around the state for over a week, as Hurricane Amelia did in 1978.
Hurricanes also tend to move east to west or southeast to northwest, and up-drainage in
relation to the major river systems. Systems like this are potentially capable of more
severe and prolonged flooding than convective thunderstorms. Largely because of ENSO
influence, hurricanes tend to be clustered in time, which might mean that their geologic
signatures could also be clustered in time.

148

Figure 1.45. Coleto Creek Hydrograph for 1967, Showing Effects of Hurricane Beulah.
Because of the record discharge for this year, both vertical axes are scaled
differently from the other hydrographs shown here. The horizontal line at
10,000 cfs is the maximum shown on all the other hydrographs. Note that
the rainfall peak is concealed behind the flood peak.
149

Effects of flooding on biota
Both the present-day marginal vegetation and the aquatic fauna of the lower
reaches of Coleto Creek are adapted to its flashy discharge. Sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis), black willow (Salix nigra), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides) are the
most important stream-margin species in this part of the drainage (Espey, Huston and
Associates 1976:2-3). These are all water-loving species, but they are also fast-growing
species well adapted to rapidly recolonizing sandbars after washouts. Telfair (1987:Table
1) classifies species like these as inundation Zone III indicators. These three species first
flower at 25, 10, and 10 years of age, respectively, and have normal lifespans of 250-500,
50-125, and 60-100 years (Altman and Dittmer 1962:Table 103). Very large live oaks
(Quercus virginiana) are also members of the bottomland forest, but grow on the welldrained upslope margin of the bottomland, probably well out of reach of the hundred-year
flood zone. Most oaks first flower at about 20-35 years, and live oaks have a normal
lifespan of 200-300 years (Altman and Dittmer 1962:Table 103). Live oaks are Zone V
indicators (Telfair 1987:Table 1). There are also chinquapin oaks and a good many elms
growing on the terrace scarp at the Arnold Road crossing of Coleto Creek. The
distribution and composition of floodplain vegetation is rather similar to that reported for
the San Antonio River near Floresville (Bush and Van Auken 1984). The small aquatic
plants and animals in the creek tend to show wide seasonal variance in abundance and
species diversity, changing with flow conditions and frequency of washouts. Among the
benthic fauna, the only mollusks recovered in an aquatic ecology study done for Central
Power and Light Company were the Asiatic clam (Corbicula manilensis = Corbicula
fluminea), limpets (Ferrissia sp.) and aquatic snails (Physa or Physella sp.). Although 32
species of fish were recorded, most of these were smaller fish — minnows, mosquitofish,
150

crappie, sunfish, and the like. Larger species such as the yellow cat were recorded, but
only as juveniles (Murray, Jinnette, and Moseley 1976). Over much of its length the
Coleto is too shallow to support larger species of fish; occasional large pools as much as
a couple of meters in depth occur, but these are frequently relocated by high discharge
reworking of bed sediments. Perennial pools may support large populations of frogs.
Channel form and bed sediments
A fluvial system is an example of a natural system in dynamic equilibrium. The
term "dynamic equilibrium" means that the system is stable at any one moment in time,
but eventually one or more components of the system will change, after which all the
other components readjust themselves, resulting in a new state of (temporary)
equilibrium. System variables such as discharge, amount and grain size of sediment load,
channel form, sinuosity, and gradient are all

interrelated. Geologists tend to view

sediment load and discharge as independent variables and the others as dependent
variables. Lower Coleto Creek, adapted to carrying a heavy sand bedload with variable
discharge, shows many features of coarse-grained point bar (McGowen and Garner
1975) and braided stream systems (although it has not actually developed multiple
channels). The channel width/depth ratio is very high; at Berger Bluff, the channel width
during normal flow is 24 m and depth averages around 20 cm; the ratio at bankfull
discharge is unknown but would probably be similar. Sinuosity is very low; for a reach of
Coleto Creek about 15 river kilometers in each direction from the site, it is 1.02. This
figure is somewhat lower than that (1.37) reported by Morton and McGowen (1980:39),
perhaps because they interpret the extent of the floodplain differently, or because the
Coleto is more sinuous in their study area. Channel gradient over the same section at
Berger Bluff is about 1.57 m/km. There is about 152 m of relief in the entire catchment.
151

Morton and McGowen (1980), in their study area farther downstream, recognize
three major depositional features: alternate side-attached bars (Fig. 1.46), point bars with
chutes, and point bars without chutes. Similar features are found at Berger Bluff and
upstream in the catchment. The most prominent features of the creek at Berger Bluff are
the long, arcuate chutes occupying the insides of bends. These help to carry excess water
during periods of peak discharge, widening and straightening the channel; the thalweg is
presumed to remain in the active channel, however, rather than migrating to the insides of
bends. Since the floor of the chute is elevated above that of the active channel, the chute
dries rapidly as flood stage falls, leaving extensive scour-and-fill features preserved. In
the active channel, high flow regime structures are soon reworked during normal flow,
but in the chutes, reworking is mainly confined to wind erosion and redeposition. Peak
discharge is also recorded in the caliber of the bedload left in the chute: lag deposits of
chert and petrified wood cobbles are exposed on the bank and in scours in the chute at
Berger Bluff. These almost certainly were deposited in 1967 during Hurricane Beulah;
discharge since then has been insufficient to remove them. Similar cobbles, up to about
12 cm (estimated) in maximum dimension can be seen in point bar deposits at various
places in the catchment. Small gravel bars of similar caliber material can be seen in the
active channel just downstream from the confluence of Twelvemile and Fifteenmile
Coleto Creek (Fig. 1.47). The rate of movement of clastic particles through the catchment
is probably inversely proportional to their caliber, with very large cobbles perhaps not
moving at all except during floods with a recurrence interval of a century or so.

the bench area before reservoir inundation. Note side-attached bar.
Bedforms visible in the active channel at Berger Bluff are primarily small scale
ripples, often with small (pea-sized) lag gravels in the pockets between the ripples. The
flood of January 20, 1980 gathered these gravels and rearranged them as long stringers
armoring the planar bed along the thalweg, but was unable to loft the pebbles out of the
channel. Two sediment samples from the bed of Coleto Creek were collected for grain
size analysis during field work in the spring of 1980. Both were collected soon after the
January 20 flood. Sample #1 was collected in the thalweg just upstream from a
midchannel bar opposite the bench at Berger Bluff. Sample #2 came from slightly farther
upstream and includes the layer of lineated gravels mentioned above; some of the sand
immediately below the gravel is also included. The ratio of sand to gravel is therefore
strictly a function of the thickness of the sample collected; both represent only the upper

4 or 5 cm of sediment. Sample #2 contained juvenile Asiatic clams (Corbicula manilensis
= Corbicula fluminea). These are quite abundant in the creek bed at the site.

Bed sample #1 is composed chiefly of coarse and medium-grained sand and is
bimodal, with modes at the 0.5 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 2.0 grades. Sample #2 is more variable;
154

the gravel population is unimodal, at -2.5 to -2.0 phi, and the sand population is also
unimodal, at 1.0 to 1.5 phi (Fig. 1.48; the Wentworth grade scale, represented by phi, will
be explained in the chapter on sedimentology). Both samples are significantly coarser
than the early sediments from the bench area. Fines (sediment finer than 4.0 phi) were not
analyzed, but amount to only a fraction of a percent in both cases.

A third sample was collected in April, 1983 from the bed of the Twelvemile
Coleto southeast of Meyersville, 33.6 river kilometers upstream from Berger Bluff. It
contains no gravel but is very well sorted, with a very pronounced peak at 1.5 to 2.0 phi.
Nearly all the sample falls in the coarse to fine sand range.

Bedforms and channel morphology in the lowest reaches of Coleto Creek have
been described as follows by Morton and Donaldson (1978:1034-1035):
Major bed forms along the meandering channel of Coleto Creek are alternate bars
and point bars. These bars, which are active only at high discharge, are incised
and modified by a low-stage meandering thalweg within the channel. Point bars
consist of lower and upper point-bar deposits separated by a scour trough or
chute. Point-bar morphology is similar to that of coarse-grained point bars of the
Amite and Colorado Rivers described by McGowen and Garner (1970), but grain
size of Coleto Creek bars is substantially less. Lower and upper point bars of
Coleto Creek are each about 3 m thick, giving a total bar thickness of about 6 m.
These bars are submerged during moderate to high discharge, when sediment is
transported across the entire bar surface. Bar surfaces exhibit low-relief rhomboid
ripples and ripples on megaripples with sinuous lee faces extending transversely
across the bar. Mud drapes occur as thin veneers over the bar and as local
concentrations between small bed forms. Other high-discharge bed forms include
flat-crested medial bars stabilized by vegetation. These bars have steep lee faces
and are 1.8 to 2.1 m high.
Bed forms in the low-stage thalweg are primarily transverse bars with amplitudes
less than 1 m and wave lengths of about 30 m. Some of these transverse bars are
marked by scour troughs that contain lag gravel and that form upstream from
clumps of vegetation.

From the discussion that has been presented so far it should be apparent that
Coleto Creek is well adapted to the present climatic regime — one with fairly
pronounced seasonal distribution of rainfall, and a tendency for relatively rapid
concentration of runoff within the catchment. Channel form, for example, is adapted to
rapid throughflow. The straightness of the channel promotes rapid discharge, and the
slightly elevated high-water chutes serve to straighten further the channel and to
provide additional capacity by greatly broadening it at flood stage. At very high
discharge, the creek actually reexcavates the areas occupied by the bars, entraining the
sediment and sending it downstream. Morton and McGowen speculate that the largescale sedimentary structures visible in their trenches are relics of the 1967 flood. Shallow,
flat-bottomed, wide channels, augmented mostly in width rather than depth by flooding
are characteristic of drainages in areas with seasonally uneven precipitation (see Gupta
1975).

The frequency of the flows on the Coleto inhibits growth of vegetation on the
bars, and in fact slow-growing species such as live oak (Quercus virginiana) are excluded
from most of the flood zone, so there is very little vegetation to impede discharge.
Comparison with Black Cypress Bayou
In order to get some idea of what the discharge behavior of Coleto Creek might
look like under a different climatic regime, I have compared it to Black Cypress Bayou.
This catchment, gauged at Jefferson (Marion County) has an area of 945 km2, nearly the
same as the 956 km2 area above the Highway 622 station on the Coleto. There is about
100 m of relief in the catchment, compared to 152 m in the Berger Bluff catchment. Most
of the catchment lies in Cass County and Morris County. The precipitation values shown
157

were gauged at Linden, which is spatially positioned in the Black Cypress catchment
much as Yorktown is in the Berger Bluff catchment, except that it is offset to the east of
the drainage. Black Cypress Bayou is shown as a heuristic example of a non-flashy
stream, one with a much more even annual discharge, located in a wetter and more
heavily vegetated part of the subtropical humid climatic zone (Larkin and Bomar
1983:2), with maximum rainfall in April and November-December (Natural Fibers
Information Center 1987:90). Annual rainfall is about 117.5 cm (46.3 inches). Figure
1.49 shows rainfall and runoff for 1975 and 1976. As the illustration shows, rainfall
events are small but frequent, base flow is relatively high from winter until early summer,
and notably, the recession phase of discharge events is quite prolonged. In the flood event
of February 3, 1975, for example, the stream takes about two weeks to return to base flow
level. The average lag time between rainfall events and related discharge events is almost
three days (Table 1.8), indicating movement of rainfall into the drainage system is
relatively slow, presumably impeded by heavy vegetation cover (the overland distance
from Linden to Jefferson is about 27 km). Figure 1.50 shows the probability of a given
peak discharge for the two streams, based on historical discharge records. The curves
were generated by PEAKFQ, a computer program produced by the United States
Geological Survey (Slade and Asquith 1996). Coleto Creek (the upper curve) clearly has
a higher probability of a given peak discharge and is a much "flashier" stream (although
the periods of record are not the same). Note also that the maximum discharge shown is
defined by the 1967 Hurricane Beulah flood.

(Marion County). Rainfall at Linden (Cass County) and flood events
(gauged at Jefferson, USGS station 07346045) are plotted on the same
timeline to show lag time. The scale for rainfall is on the right vertical axis.
These east Texas hydrographs are shown as an example of a similar-sized
basin in a different climatic regime, one that might have resembled
somewhat that found at Berger Bluff in the Pleistocene. Note the somewhat
more frequent rainfall events, higher base flow level, more prolonged falling
limb for each flood event, and relatively constant flow from winter through
early summer. The bimodal May-September rainfall peaks seen in the
Berger Bluff catchment are not visible here. Precipitation is in inches,
discharge in cubic feet per second.

159

Black Cypress Bayou corresponds — physically, hydrologically, and in climatic setting
— more closely to how Late Pleistocene or early Holocene Coleto Creek might be
envisioned. It is ideally suited for carrying large quantities of fine sediments since the
minimum turbulence necessary to keep fine sediment in suspension is available for
sustained periods. Movement of runoff through this catchment is clearly much more
prolonged than in the Berger Bluff catchment. This could be a result of several different
factors, such as somewhat lesser relief, perhaps coarser-grained soil cover, or a more
convoluted and meandering drainage network in the Black Cypress Bayou catchment, but
most likely the key factor is much heavier vegetation cover, intercepting and slowing the
progress of rainfall into the drainage network. Another factor might be the possible
tendency for rainfall events in this part of east Texas to be clustered in time. Small but
closely repeated rainfall events serve to maintain base flow in the drainage.
ANTIQUITY OF THE MODERN HYDROLOGIC REGIME
Coleto Creek is presently incising its earlier deposits and in fact appears to have
cut completely through the entire Holocene sequence of sediments. Nowhere in this
stratigraphic sequence is there clear evidence of previous incisive events. Apparently the
entire section represents uninterrupted aggradation, right up to the point when the present
episode of downcutting began. This change in stream behavior, then, seems to indicate
the reversal of a trend spanning several millennia and must as well indicate a major
hydrologic change, or more likely the passing of some kind of hydrologic threshold.
Dating this event is therefore a matter of some interest. The study of aquatic ecology
done for Central Power and Light Company assumes the event is recent:
Land clearing and alterations in native vegetation have reduced the retention
capacity of the watershed, resulting in greater runoff and stream discharge.
161

Channel bottoms tend to be very unstable due to flash erosion and sediment
loading (Murray, Jinnette, and Moseley 1976:1).

Figure 1.50. Estimated Peak Discharge Frequency for Coleto Creek and Black Cypress
Bayou. This log-log graph shows the probability of a given peak discharge
(in cubic feet per second) for both streams based on available historical
records (1930-1979 for Coleto Creek, 1969-1993 for Black Cypress Bayou)
and was generated using PEAKFQ, a computer program produced by the
USGS (Slade and Asquith 1996). It shows that Coleto Creek has higher peak
discharges and a higher probability of a given peak discharge.

Although this characterization is accurate, I suspect that historic land clearance
has simply exacerbated a trend already underway when the earliest non-Indian settlers
arrived. Perdiz arrow points were recovered from the upper 30 cm of post-Beaumont
sediments at Berger Bluff, and four potsherds from the upper 15 cm. Similar artifacts
have been radiocarbon dated elsewhere in south Texas at 1300 to 1600 AD. Little or no
162

sediment accumulated over these artifacts after they were discarded. Probably all were
deposited near the present ground surface, with some having been displaced downward
by bioturbation. This implies aggradation had ceased by Late Prehistoric time, otherwise
a recognizable sterile deposit would have accumulated over these Late Prehistoric
markers. Moreover, if the upper meter of post-Beaumont sediments are even partially
eolian in origin (as suggested by Glen Evans), a metamorphosis to a wide, sandy,
seasonally desiccated channel is implied, perhaps as early as the Late or Middle Archaic
(the date cannot be specified with any more precision because no radiocarbon dates are
available from the upper deposits, and few diagnostic artifacts were recovered below one
meter in depth). In any case, it seems highly probable that downcutting began whenever
the present channel form, adapted to flashy and potentially erosive discharge, was
assumed.

If we examine historical accounts of Coleto Creek to try to determine the earliest
date at which the present channel form appears, the data are no more precise than the
archeological evidence. Limited settlement probably began along lower Coleto Creek
soon after establishment of the De Leon colony in the early 1820's, but most of the
Berger Bluff catchment appears to have remained unsettled until after about 1845, when
German immigrants landing at Indianola began to occupy the basin. Major land clearing
in the Coleto basin may be presumed to date after this initial wave of settlement (see
Biesele 1930). Most of the cleared land is now in pasture rather than cropland, and forms
a mosaic pattern that can be recognized on USGS maps or satellite imagery. In
comparison to the upper part of the catchment, the post oak belt near the site is less
affected by clearing.

163

After the founding of Victoria in 1824, travel between Victoria and La Bahia
(Goliad) became frequent, passing along a route approximated by Highway 59, so there
are a number of early descriptions of Coleto Creek at a point near the present Highway 59
bridge at Raisin. Unfortunately most of these are too vague to be of much help.

One of the earliest descriptions is that of Stephen F. Austin, on his first trip to
Texas. In August, 1821, Austin traveled from Goliad toward the future site of Victoria
and made the following journal entry:
Monday 3d...came out 4 miles to a Creek where the company encamped — clear
runing [sic] water, land good but rather sandy [this presumably was Manahuila
Creek] — in the afternoon came on 12 miles to the Colato Creek a large bold
stream of clear runing water land generally good, in some places too sandy,
considerable quantity of oak timber.... (Austin 1903:299).
Berlandier also crossed Coleto Creek in both directions in February, 1829, but
says only that "...piles of sand...are common on the banks of the stream named Coleto...."
(Berlandier 1980:552).

One of the early guidebooks for Texan immigrants, Moore's Map and Description
of Texas (1840), says:
The Coleto empties into the Gaudalupe [sic] a few miles below Victoria. It is a
beautiful stream of clear and wholesome water, and is distinguished for the
remarkable beauty and fertility of its banks (Moore 1840:134).
In 1841 Thomas Falconer recorded:
At the distance of about six miles from Victoria we crossed the Rio Coleto, the
banks of which for a considerable distance are of light white sand (Falconer
1843:202).
164

In March, 1844, Auguste Fretelliere, an immigrant traveling inland from Victoria, noted:
After crossing a little stream [presumably Dry Creek], we came for the second
time to an immense prairie, on which the verdure was magnificent and the
bogholes less frequent. Although we were in the first days of March the sun was
disagreeably hot, and we were always very thirsty. The horizon with its mirages
represented a lovely sheet of water which seemed to retreat as we went forward.
Finally, toward sunset we camped on the bank of a creek called the Colette. The
water was crystalline and rushed over a bed of white sand. You will believe that
we waded in with delight. An hour after colic and nausea taught us, to our cost,
that we must not always rely on appearances (Waugh 1934:89).
In October, 1846, another traveler named Furber recorded, "We marched over a
pleasant country, but rather scarce of timber, and at noon encamped on a clear, rapid
stream, called the Colette" (Furber 1848:145).

The most detailed of these historical accounts is that of John Bartlett, traveling
with the International Boundary Commission in 1850, from Victoria to Goliad. Bartlett
wrote,
...I left Victoria on the 13th, with the larger portion of the Commission, and
formed my camp in a beautiful grove of live oaks, on the banks of the river
Colette... September 14th... The banks of the Colette are overhung with trees,
from the branches of which hang long festoons of moss, waving gracefully with
the breeze. The river is about 150 feet wide, and near our camp about five feet
deep and quite sluggish. Saw many fine fish, among them the kind known as the
`buffalo fish'...." (Bartlett 1965:18-19, 21).
In 1853 Brevet Lieutenant Colonel W. G. Freeman took a different route inland
from Victoria, passing across the Berger Bluff catchment. Not referring specifically to
Coleto Creek, but to the streams in the area generally, Freeman observed,
Leaving Indianola at 4 p.m., May 26th, I proceeded via Lavaca, Victoria,
Yorktown and the Sulphur Springs, to San Antonio.... Ocasionally trains are kept
back, involving sometimes the loss of animals, by the swelling of the streams on
165

the route, which in this country frequently rise twenty feet in a few hours, but the
waters subside almost as rapidly, and such detentions rarely exceed two days
(Malsch 1977:90).
While none of these historical accounts spanning the years 1821-1853 is detailed
enough to permit an accurate reconstruction of the hydrologic regime of early nineteenth
century Coleto Creek, it is important to note that all are at least consistent with the idea
that the creek had already taken on its present form. Most accounts mention clear water
and clean white sand, indicating the Coleto carried little suspended load and was choked
with a heavy sand bedload as it is now. The account by Bartlett indicates the creek was
about 45 meters wide, and at the point described, evidently a slackwater pool, was about
1.5 m deep and large enough to support a population of buffalo (presumably Ictiobus
bubalus).

Other records from the second half of the nineteenth century, as German
settlement was spreading over the Coleto basin, show how clearing and grazing began to
reinforce the already rapid throughflow potential of the creek. Early church records from
Meyersville, translated from the original German, are a valuable source of information
from the beginning of the Civil War into the twentieth century (Jacob and Egg 1978).
While these records contain no really detailed accounts of the local environment, there
are brief notations for almost every year. The nature of the land at the beginning of
settlement is indicated in an entry I have already quoted in the section on vegetation, but
which is worth repeating here:
More settlers came and settled on the right and the left banks of the Twelve-Mile
Coleto, especially in the years from 1855-1859. The raising of cattle became
especially profitable because of the grass which in the beginning of the settlement
was so tall that it was almost impossible to walk in (Jacob and Egg 1978: 4).
166

There followed a severe drought at the beginning of the war, especially in the
years 1860, 1862, and 1863. The entry for 1860 reads,
The year 1860 was a hard year.... From May 22 until August 7, no rain fell.
Consequently the grass dried entirely and the springs and brooks stopped flowing,
so that the oldest settlers stated that there had not been such a drought within the
last 20 years (Jacob and Egg 1978:11).
The combination of recurrent drought and grazing by cattle depleted the ground
cover during these years, so that when a major storm track crossed the Coleto basin in the
spring of 1865, severe flooding followed:
During the night of March 26 a terrible storm struck. The rain came down in
torrents and lasted until midnight....The water overflowed the banks of the Coletto
and washed away fences. The homes of Mr. P. Walker and Mr. Kohler were torn
loose from their foundations and were washed away (Jacob and Egg 1978:18).
In summary, archeological evidence suggests floodplain aggradation had ceased
and channel incision began by the Late Prehistoric, but perhaps as early as the Middle to
Late Archaic. The reversion from aggradation to incision presumably documents the
passing of a geomorphic threshold as a result of increasingly flashy, erosive discharge;
and it was presumably at the same time that Coleto Creek assumed its present channel
form: wide, shallow, sand-choked, with chutes colonized only by fast-growing pioneer
plant species. The historical accounts, sketchy as they are, nevertheless suggest this
channel form was already in existence well before the first significant wave of land
clearing by German settlers after 1845. Moreover, it seems unlikely Coleto Creek would
be able to hew its way through the nine meters of sediments at the bluff in just over a
century. More probably, historic land clearance has simply accelerated an erosional
regime that was already well established before the earliest Euroamerican settlement.
