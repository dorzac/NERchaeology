ABSTRACT
The City of Melissa and Greater Texoma Utility Authority propose to
construct approximately 2.2 miles of sanitary sewer line and 1300 feet of
water line for the Fitzhugh Branch Sewer Project in north central Collin
County. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a comprehensive pedestrian
survey of the proposed routes. No prehistoric cultural resources were
encountered during the survey, likely owing to the study area’s upland
location and distance from major drainages. However, archival research
suggested the presence of a historic gravesite near the sewer line. The
grave, which sits completely outside of the project corridor, was located
during the survey and recorded as site 41COL208. The site was recorded
primarily to establish its location in relation to the proposed sewer line and
to insure its avoidance by this and future development. Based on the
results of the survey, no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Melissa and Greater Texoma Utility Authority (GTUA) are proposing to
construct approximately 2.2 miles of sanitary sewer pipeline and 1300’ of water line for
the Fitzhugh Branch Sewer Project in north central Collin County, Texas (Figure 1). The
sanitary sewer line has a diameter which alternates between 21”, 17” and 15”, and
roughly traces the eastern side of Fitzhugh Branch. It runs from downtown Melissa to the
Clemons Creek Basin Interceptor south of town, and is referred to in this report as the
Fitzhugh sewer line. The water line has a diameter of 16”, follows the east side of Berry
Road between SH 121 and FM 545, and is referred to in this report as the Berry Road
water line. Both lines have a temporary construction easement of 45’ to the east of the
center line and a permanent easement of 20’. The City of Melissa is receiving funding
from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for this project. The GTUA and the
City of Melissa have contracted with Bucher, Willis and Ratcliff Corporation (BWR) to
conduct the environmental permitting for this project, and BWR has contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey.
The survey was necessitated because the City of Melissa is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, and because they received funding for the project from the TWDB, a state
agency. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation, and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5598 was issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose
of this survey was to locate cultural resources, make recommendations about their
significance and describe how they might be impacted by construction. Relevant federal
legislation includes Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the
Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural
Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by the
research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of the investigation
follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations
that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Collin County lies in North Central Texas, and is located totally within the Blackland
Prairie physiographic region of Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1).
The prairie is dissected by the East Fork of the Trinity River on the eastern edge of the
County, and by various drainages that empty into the Elm Fork. Narrow bands of
bottomland forest are confined to the drainages throughout the County.
The underlying geology within the study area is comprised of Upper Cretaceous-aged
Austin chalk undivided, with a thickness of about 600 feet (Bureau of Economic Geology
1967). The upper and lower parts include chalk and light gray, massive calcareous clay.
This is overlain in the study area by the Houston Black-Austin soil association, which
consists of gently sloping to sloping upland soils over marl and chalk (Hanson and
Wheeler 1969: General Soils Map). Individual soils in the study area include eroded
Lewisville silty clay with 3 to 5 percent slopes, Houston Black clay with 0 to 3 percent
slopes, Hunt clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes, Austin silty clay with 1 to 5 percent slopes,
severely eroded Altoga silty clay with 8 to 12 percent slopes, Eddy gravelly clay loam
with 1 to 3 percent slopes, and occasionally flooded Frio clay loam (Hanson and Wheeler
1969: Sheet 19). Each of these soils is associated either with upland or terrace settings,
which correspond to the study area’s location. The only disparity in this trend is the Frio
clay loam, which occurs in the extreme southern terminus of the line, where it abuts the
edge of the Clemons Creek floodplain. Springs are found in the western half of the
County, primarily where the underlying Austin chalk crops out, though none exist near
the study area (Brune 1981: 122). Many of the County’s springs have dried up due to
extensive digging of wells, which has lowered the water table considerably.
Collin County lies in the Texan biotic province, as determined by Blair (1950:98). Clay
soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but these are now mostly cultivated (Blair
1950). The Texan biotic province sits between a water surplus and a water deficiency
zone, which characterizes the entire fauna and flora of the area. The principal types of
vegetation encountered in the Blackland Prairie are grasses, primarily Bluestem and
Grama. Forty-nine species of mammals have occurred in recent times, including various
species of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and armadillo. Other animals include 16 different
species of lizards as well as 39 different species of snakes. Precipitation in the north of
this zone averages 115 cm and temperatures reach an average of 28 degrees centigrade.
Fields of Uvalde Gravel (Byrd 1971) have been recorded in upland settings between the
valleys of the Elm Fork and West Fork on upland divides (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217). Mapped locations of previously recorded beds of Ogallala gravels are on
upland divides to the south, east and southwest of the study area (McGregor 1995:Figure
4). These gravels are likely to be an eastward extension of Ogallala gravels (Banks
1990:56) and similar gravel fields may be present in the study area, although not shown
by McGregor.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as the Paleo-Indian
Period and since that time Collin County appears to have been continuously occupied
(Crook n.d.). The physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed
“cultural resources,” and many of these resources have been of such significance that
they have been recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Collin County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points. No very early prehistoric
sites have been recorded in the county, but Paleo-Indian sites have been reported from
Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Nevertheless, artifact collectors report the presence of
Folsom, Scottsbluff, and other Paleo-Indian points from surface of sites in the region. The
presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people
traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a
system of raw material trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but
probably also foraged off the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 or 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt animals and gather wild
plants (Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are
common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making
and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the
use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde
Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Small scatters of lithic debris have
been recorded in upland areas throughout the county (Lynott 1974; Hughston and Lynott
1974; Peter 1990; Hunt, Peter and Allday 1991). These sites appear to be Archaic in age
but none have been thoroughly studied and their relationship to the Lake Lavon sites is
uncertain.
About A.D. 700 or 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of
the Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently, the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. The other interesting
thing is the appearance of large, circular pits constructed at sites along the East Fork and
its tributaries (Stephenson 1952; Lynott 1975; Bruseth and Martin 1987).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of Collin County and the North Central Texas area based on an absence of
sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English

traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region. There is
very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the county
until historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800's.
European settlement in Collin County began in the mid-1800s with the establishment of
the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. The colonists cultivated the prairie lands for
their livelihood. The county was established in 1846 and the county seat was at Buckner
until 1848 when it was moved to McKinney. Settlement has continued to the present. By
the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had
passed away.
Previous Investigations
Numerous surveys in the Blackland prairies of Collin County indicate that unless a
permanent water supply such as a spring or perennial stream is present, the prehistoric
archaeological potential is low (La Vadera and Geister 1988; Hunt, Peter and Allday
1991; Skinner 1996, 1998; Skinner and Trask 1996; Skinner and Whorton 1996a, b and c;
Hunt Peter, Largent and Shanabrook 1997; Todd and Skinner 2002, Davis and Coleman
2010). This trend is exemplified by the results of a 1974 study conducted in preparation
for the construction of three East Fork watershed floodwater retarding structures
(Hughston and Lynott 1974). Three locations were surveyed during the study; two on
Clemons Creek and one on Fitzhugh Branch. Three prehistoric lithic procurement sites
(41COL46, 41COL47 and 41COL48) were recorded on the hills that overlook Clemons
Creek, while no sites were recorded on or around Fitzhugh Branch. The authors
speculated that this was due to the larger drainage affording greater accessibility to water
and aquatic resources (Hughston and Lynott 1974: 3).
Additionally, a number of prehistoric lithic procurement sites have been located to the
northeast of the study area. During a 2000 survey of a proposed landfill site near Melissa,
four lithic procurement sites were located in the hilly uplands overlooking Brinlee Branch
(Clow and Hunt 2000). These sites, 41COL131 through 41COL134, each consisted of
scattered lithics and tested cobbles, indicative of limited and semi-permanent quarrying
of the local quartzite gravels in the area.
Though prehistoric sites may be rare or rarely identified in the Blackland prairie,
numerous historic sites have been recorded, particularly along roads and railroads. The
aforementioned landfill study recorded nine historic sites (41COL122 through
41COL130). These sites were mostly historic homesteads, which varied in terms of
intactness and integrity from standing farm structures and structural elements, such as
wells and cisterns, to ephemeral historic artifact scatters (Clow and Hunt 2000). The
structures were generally present along FM 545 and other smaller ranch roads in the area,
and in upland ridges above the drainages.

Additional historic sites have been recorded in the general vicinity of the study area as
well. A number of historic farm outbuildings were recorded as site 41COL186
approximately one mile north of the northern terminus of the water line route (TASA
2010). Site 41COL96, recorded during a 1996 survey of the proposed Allen Station Park
site, consists of a limestone dam with a pump foundation and a limestone foundation to a
water tank that was associated with the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, to the
southwest of the study area in Allen (Skinner and Skinner 1996). Site 41COL157, which
consists of a historic cistern, was recorded in 2002 during a study of the Timber Creek
development north of McKinney (Todd, Wheeler and Skinner 2002).
In addition to a review of applicable archaeological literature, a review of historic maps
reveals the presence of structures near the study area. However, the sewer line route does
not encounter any historic structures as mapped on the Collin County soil map (USDA
1930) or general highway map (Texas State Highway Department 1936).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
A records review indicated no evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation in the survey
corridor. Based on the known prehistoric and historic archaeology of the area, we
proposed the following two research questions.
The first research question concerns the potential for prehistoric sites in the study area. It
was predicted that the upland portions of the route had little likelihood of having been
occupied prehistorically based on the absence of permanent water, low biotic diversity,
and lack of knappable gravels. However, archaeological sites might be present where the
route runs closest to Fitzhugh Branch and its tributaries. Additionally, due to the small
size of these drainages, such sites are likely to be temporary hunting camps and would
consist of artifact scatters of lithic debris, likely imported cherts or local quartzite gravels,
as well as fire cracked rock.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area, which is near
numerous historic roads and railroads. Historic sites could consist of structures and trash
scatters. Since the study area has been continuously occupied since the 19th century,
historic structures are likely to be located on the uplands above the creek or near
roadways and railroad tracks. Additionally, archival research indicated the presence of a
single, historic grave near the study corridor.
Methodology
The field teams walked parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests were excavated
in relatively undisturbed areas approximately every 50 meters, where ground visibility
was less than 30 percent. Each one was excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposit
according to THC standards (n.d). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter, and were
supplemented by an auger. The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and
broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Sandy
soils from the shovel tests were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices
were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used
to identify the specific soil colors in each test. Photographs were taken throughout the
survey area using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with a description of the survey area for the
proposed routes presented first, followed by a description of the survey results. Shovel
tests are discussed briefly within the text and are detailed in Appendix A. Conclusions
end the chapter.
Survey Area
The Fitzhugh sewer line runs from downtown Melissa to the Clemons Creek Basin
Interceptor south of town (Figure 2). The northern terminus of the route is located in a
thinly wooded area that traces Fitzhugh Branch. After approximately 30 feet, the route
crosses the channel for the first of three times. At this point, the channel is approximately
1.5 meters deep and 2.5 meters wide, with less than 50cm of running water present at the
time of survey. Vegetation in the area consists of numerous oaks, hackberries and
junipers, while ground cover consists of ankle to knee-high prairie grasses and weeds.
Green briar is abundant in the understory, particularly near the drainage. Ground
visibility is between 0 and 30 percent. This vegetation occurs in all of the wooded areas
adjacent to Fitzhugh Branch (Figure 3).

The wooded area tracing Fitzhugh Branch as seen from the first crossing.
View is to the south.

The route then crosses the Southern Pacific railroad tracks and moves immediately into a
paved distribution center. Turning south, the route parallels a gravel road which runs
from the main distribution center to a secondary lot. The route is roughly six meters to
the east of the road. The route then turns southeast, and crosses Fitzhugh Branch for a
second time. The channel has similar dimensions here as it does at the first crossing, and
similar vegetation is present. Southeast of the crossing, the pipeline encounters a dump
which stores push piles of concrete, asphalt and other construction debris before turning
again to the south.
The route then runs south through a residential area, crossing through the yards of two
mobile homes before encountering SH 121, which it parallels to the northeast before
crossing. South of the road, the route again parallels SH 121, crossing through first a strip
mall parking lot and then a vacant lot, which has been built up and flattened. Ground
visibility in all of the developed areas north of SH 121 is poor, generally between 0 and
30 percent.
After the developed section, the route turns to the south, crosses Fitzhugh a third time,
and runs through a heavily wooded area east of the drainage. The channel is larger in this
area, between three and four meters deep, and four meters wide. The route’s distance to
the drainage varies, being at times as close as 20 meters and as far as 140 meters farther
to the south. Vegetation and ground visibility is similar to that encountered on the
northern terminus of the line, though thicker in places.
The route then emerges from the wooded area, and runs first south and then east through
a series of recently plowed fields (Figure 4). The plowing afforded excellent ground

visibility of between 60 and 90 percent. The route stays in these plowed fields for almost
one mile, the final 1500 feet of which parallel CR 339 to the north.

Figure 4.

The northernmost of the recently plowed fields. View is to the south.

After its eastern jog along CR 339, the route turns again to the south running west of a
fenced property line before terminating north of Clemons Creek. The majority of this
final southern portion of the line ran through improved pasture with ground visibility of
between 20 and 65 percent. An isolated stand of junipers, hackberries and one
cottonwood tree was present in the pasture. This section of the line was the only one to
feature discernable relief, with gently undulating terrain that slopes gently toward the
creek drainage.
The Berry Road water line runs north to south, paralleling Berry Road for approximately
1300 feet between SH 121 and FM 545. Situated roughly two meters east of the road, this
route runs through the mowed and maintained lawns of both residences and businesses.
Survey Results
The Fitzhugh sewer line route was surveyed north to south, with the first shovel test
excavated at the northern terminus of the line, which is immediately northwest of the first
crossing of Fitzhugh Branch (Figure 5). This crossing is near the headwaters of the
drainage, so at this point it is not a significant channel. However there is still a fair
amount of modern trash dumped in and around the drainage. Shovel testing revealed
black clay to a depth of 130cm overlaying very dark gray clay with degrading bedrock to
a bottom depth of 150cm.

Upon crossing the railroad tracks, the route encountered paved distribution center (Figure
6). This portion of the route was walked, but not shovel tested. South of this distribution
center is a house that sits within the temporary construction easement. However, the
structure will be avoided by and protected from the sewer line construction. The structure
appears to be a small, two room house of later 20th century construction, which sits upon
a poured concrete slab foundation (Figure 7). An additional structure of similar
construction sits approximately 20 meters to the southeast of the first structure, but will
not be impacted.

A single shovel test (ST 2) was excavated to the south of a western bend in the gravel
road, and roughly 25 meters north of the second crossing of Fitzhugh Branch. It
encountered a far more stratified soil profile than ST 1, and consisted of a 14cm layer of
very dark gray silty clay, which overlay steadily lightening layers of dark grayish brown
to grayish brown silty clays and silty clay loams. Pea-sized gravels were present from
14cm to the bottom depth of 160cm; below 140cm, yellowish brown clay was mottled
with the silty clay loam subsoil. This soil may have been a precursor to degrading
bedrock, as was seen in shovel tests excavated further south.
South of the channel crossing, the route ran through a residential area, in which a number
of mobile homes were present, including one completely modern mobile home that will
be indirectly impacted by sewer line construction (Figure 8). Though it sits on the
Fitzhugh sewer line right of way, the mobile home will be simply moved out of the
project corridor rather than demolished. Due to the manicured and residential nature of
this section of the line, only one shovel test was excavated in this area. It revealed a
shallow A horizon, with bedrock encountered at 65cm.

Figure 8.

Immediately south of SH 121, the sewer line runs between the sidewalk and parking lot
of a small strip mall. As it was paved, this area was visually inspected but not shovel
tested. Rather, shovel testing began in this area with ST 4, which was excavated in the
vacant lot to the west, and revealed a disturbed 20cm layer of fill overlaying very dark
grayish brown silty clay mottled with lighter silty clays which gradually disappeared with
depth (Figure 9).

View looking northeast from ST 4 toward the vacant lot and strip mall

ST 5 was excavated south of the line’s crossing of Fitzhugh Branch in the wooded area
that traces the drainage. It encountered a soil profile that consists of 20cm of very dark
gray silty clay top soil overlaying very dark grayish brown silty clays which grade
gradually to brown with depth. Light yellowish brown clay mottled with eroding bedrock
was encountered at 95cm. This general soil profile was encountered in all of the shovel
tests excavated near the drainage (ST 5-10). Eroding bedrock was encountered here at
various depths of up to 135cm. It was in this section, approximately 150 feet east of the
Fitzhugh sewer line and roughly 175 feet southeast of ST 8, that a historic grave was
recorded as site 41COL208. A detailed description of the site appears later in this chapter.
South of the wooded area that traces the drainage, the route emerged in recently plowed
fields which offered excellent ground visibility. The topsoil was perceptibly darker in this
area, seeming at times to be almost black, though this may be caused by drying. In the
northernmost field, some modern whiteware and glass fragments, including part of an
“Old Spice” bottle, were observed on the ground surface. However, these most likely
result from present day dumping of trash, as no structural remains were observed in the
vicinity and no structures are mapped in this particular location on historic maps of the
area.
Ground visibility in the first 200 meters of the route south of CR 339 was similarly
revealing, at approximately 50 to 65 percent. South of this area the route was shovel
tested, given both the area’s steadily decreasing ground visibility and the proximity of the
route to the larger drainage of Clemons Creek. Various building materials of various ages
were observed on the ground surface in this portion of the route, including machine cut
bricks, both historic and modern; large aggregate, historic concrete and modern concrete;

asphalt and other roadwork materials; and various scrap metal. Additionally, the area
exhibited signs of being built up and otherwise disturbed. Indeed, the first two shovel
tests excavated in this area (ST 11 and 12) revealed a 35 to 45 cm thick layer of fill
material above the natural silty clay topsoil. Objects encountered in this fill layer include
a machine cut brick fragment and a small wire nail.
During an interview of Al and Martha Guin, the landowners on the adjacent property, it
was discovered that there has never been a structure in this area, and that the previous
landowner had dumped the building debris on this sloping portion of his property to
prevent washout erosion. This was done since 1973, when the Guins bought their
property.
The remaining shovel tests excavated in the southern portion of the sewer line
encountered a far less disturbed soil profile. Top soil consisted of very dark gray to very
dark grayish brown silty clay topsoil. In ST 13, this top soil overlay very dark grayish
brown silty clay. ST 14, which was excavated at the southern terminus of the line,
encountered black clay at 45cm. This overlay very dark gray loamy clay, which was
encountered at 95cm, and continued to a depth of 145cm, at which point the clay content
increased to a degree that made continuing the shovel test impossible.
The Berry Road water line
The 1300-meter long Berry Road water line route was surveyed last. Due to the route’s
proximity to the road easement, and since it ran through an existing utility corridor, the
route was not shovel tested but was walked by field personnel (Figure 10).

Fitzhugh Grave Site (41COL208)
Prior to fieldwork, Brian Umberger of BWR made mention of a possible grave site near
the study area. Before conducting the survey, field personnel visited the grave to confirm
its location, which is approximately 150 feet east of the sewer line route. More generally,
the grave is 1280 feet south of SH 121, 1142 feet west of Miller Road, and sits atop a
ridge above Fitzhugh Branch, which is 325 feet to the west (Figure 11). The grave marker
consists of a single bois d’arc post that sits adjacent to a felled oak tree (Figure 12).
According to the current landowners, the area in which the grave sits was once a cleared
pasture, but has become overgrown as it is no longer actively used. Information from the
landowners and family as to the past condition of the grave indicate that the marker was
once ornately wrapped in leather (presumably in the still visible notch), and that the grave
boundary was fenced at one time, but neither of these claims could be verified in the
field.

Though accounts by the landowner’s family vary somewhat concerning the grave, deed
records which make mention of the grave were provided by UWR prior to fieldwork. A
deed dated December 7, 1882, which grants the land from William F. and Mary Fitzhugh
to J.R Watts and J.W. Erwin, makes mention of the “grave and sufficient ground to
preserve the same of my [Fitzhugh’s] child” (Collin County Deed Book, Vol. 18, P. 261).
This grave was granted along with the surrounding land to Watts and Erwin and their
“heirs or assigns forever.” This is in keeping with research suggesting that wooden posts
were typically used for folk grave markers in the late 19th century (Jordan 1982: 42-43).
They were particularly common among settlers to Texas from the southern states, as
Fitzhugh was himself (Jordan 1982; Lee and Stambaugh 1958). Indeed the earliest type
of folk grave markers found in Texas, wooden grave markers preserve well in the
Blackland Prairie.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the 2.2-mile and 1300-foot study
area corridors contained significant prehistoric or historic cultural resources. A total of 14
shovel tests were excavated along the proposed Fitzhugh sewer line route, all of which
were negative for cultural materials. Based on archival research and a review of previous
investigations in the region, it was expected that the study area held low potential for
prehistoric archaeological resources. Indeed no prehistoric cultural resources were
located as a result of the survey. However, it was expected that historic resources would
be located during the survey.
The Fitzhugh Grave Site (41COL208) was recorded approximately 150 feet east of the
Fitzhugh sewer line route, and sits amid a thinly wooded area that traces the drainage.
Though the grave’s eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places is
undetermined, it was recorded primarily in order to identify its location, and confirm that
it would be avoided and not be impacted by construction of the Fitzhugh sewer line.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the negative results of the survey, it is clear that no archaeological sites will be
disturbed by construction of the 2.2-mile long Fitzhugh sewer line or the 1300-foot long
Berry Road water line. Accordingly, it is AR Consultants, Inc.’s recommendation that the
City of Melissa and GTUA be allowed to construct the Fitzhugh sewer line and the Berry
Road water line, without the need for further cultural resource investigations. The
Fitzhugh Grave (41COL208) is out of the construction easement, 150 feet from the
centerline, and will not be impacted. However, if cultural resources are encountered
during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
