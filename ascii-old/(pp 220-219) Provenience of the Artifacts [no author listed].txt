Provenience of the Artifacts
The respective authors examined separately the intra-site distribution of the different kinds of artifacts, sometimes in detail (for
example, in the ease of pottery vessels and glass beads), sometimes
cursorily. There has been no over-all analysis of artifact distribution
at the site.
While some authors noted minor variations in the occurrence of
certain kinds of artifacts from feature to feature, no general patterns suggesting significant temporal or cultural differences were
discerned. Still less did anyone observe any significant differences
in the artifact content of individual strata at the few stratified places
that were dug.
The material recovered from Area B (the point of high ground
extending northward from Area A, the main part of the site) consisted entirely of Indian artifacts which seem to be of prehistoric
origin, dating well before the 18th century. A few artifacts of late
19th- and 20th-century vintage, too, lay scattered about the site.
Otherwise the artifacts appear to be a relatively clean sample from a
single occupation dating from the period when the local Indians
were trading actively with Europeans. How long this occupation
lasted is uncertain.
If a more thorough distributional analysis of the entire artifact
collection were carried out, or if more features were excavated
extensively, perhaps important differences between features might
become apparent. But none have been observed as yet.
Table 10 lists the occurrence of al! the artifact categories by feature, except for glass bead types and pottery vessels which are
tabulated respectively in Tables 4 and 5. Giving more precise provenience data here would entail lengthy, complex tables of no apparent value. Precise information as to the origin of each specimen
is recorded in the artifact catalog, on file at the Texas Archeologieal
Ilesearch Laboratory, The University of Texas.
