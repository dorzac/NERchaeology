ABSTRACT
Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural resources
survey of a 116 hectares (287 acre) portion of Lindsey Park in Tyler, Texas for the City of
Tyler Parks and Recreation Department. The area will be used to expand existing
mountain bike trails and a frisbee golf course. Texas Antiquities Permit #6195 was
obtained for this project, and all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas
Antiquities Code. Previous investigations documented the Lindsey Park site (41SM300) as
a Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric multicomponent occupation with a human burial. The
current investigations documented the Five Snakes site (41SM455) as a small Caddo
occupation. The Lindsey Park site was heavily impacted by quarrying and the construction
of frisbee golf tee-off pads and goals. The proposed mountain bike trail will cross the
Lindesy Park site. DETAC recommends that no further tee-off pads or goals should be
built on the Lindsey Park site and the proposed mountain bike trail should use recycled
asphalt as a surface on the site. Additionally, the high-walls of the quarry pits need to be
stabilized by adding fill to the pits to support the slope and grass planted to stop erosion.
The Five Snakes site should be avoided by the proposed development and any future
development. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no adverse effect” to
properties listed or eligible to the NRHP provided the City of Tyler can meet the avoidance
measures on both the Lindsey Park and Five Snakes sites.

INTRODUCTION
In March 2012 DETAC conducted a cultural resources survey of the unimproved
portion of Lindsey Park in Tyler, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon
request of the City of Tyler, Parks and Recreation Department for improvements to a 116
hectares (ha) (287 acres (ac) area for construction of roughly 14.5 kilometers (km) (9
miles (mi)) of mountain bike trails and expansion of the frisbee golf course (see Research
Design for full description). Portions of the mountain bike trails and Frisbee golf course
were built prior to the survey without consultation from the Texas Historic Commission
resulting in the need for a damage assessment of 41SM300 (described below) and a survey
of the remainder of the park. Texas Antiquities Permit #6195 was obtained for this
project, and all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities
Code.
There are two archaeological sites within the project area: the Lindsey Park site
(41SM300) (Perttula et al. 2003) and the Five Snakes site (41SM455). The Lindsey Park
site is a Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric multicomponent occupation with a human
burial on an upland ridge. The ridge was impacted by quarrying, a gravel road, the
construction of tee-off pads and goals. The Five Snakes site was recorded during the
current investigations as a small Caddo occupation on the shoulder of an upland ridge. No
modern park improvements will impact the site.
DETAC recommends that no further tee-off pads or goals should be built on the
Lindsey Park site, and the proposed mountain bike trail should use recycled asphalt as a
surface on the site. Additionally, the high-walls of the quarry pits need to be stabilized by
adding fill to the pits to support the slope and grass planted to stop erosion. The Five
Snakes site should be avoided by the proposed development and any future development in
the park unless National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) testing can determine if the
site is eligible for inclusion. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
adverse effect” to properties listed or eligible to the NRHP provided the City of Tyler can
meet the avoidance measures on both the Lindsey Park and Five Snakes sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Smith County is within the Pine Woods subdivision of the East Texas Timber Belt
of the Gulf Coastal Plain Physiographic Province of North America and the Austoriparian
Biotic Province of Texas. The Gulf Coastal Plain Province is characterized by low
topographic relief, extensive marshy tracts, altitudes below 152 m (500 ft), and
sedimentary geologic formations (Atwood 1940; Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG
1965). The Austoriparian Biotic Province is characterized by pine and pine-oak forests on
the uplands and by the abundant oak, elm and ash hardwoods in the lowlands (Blair 1950).
The Pine Woods subdivision is the dissected sandy forestlands with rolling relief whose
western boundary is approximately the 109 cm (43 in) rainfall line (Chambers 1948). The
East Texas Timber Belt geographic region supports abundant pine and oak woodlands and
is characterized by a gently rolling to level sandy terrain, annual rainfall in excess of 102
cm (40 in) and an average growing season of over 240 days (Bray 1904). Vegetation in
the Pine Woods subdivision includes a variety of pine, maple, and oak trees with a wide
variety of shrubs to include beauty berry, yaupon, farkle berry, and sumac. Woody vines
and understory include muscadine grape, poison ivy, Virginia creeper, and saw greenbrier.

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain was an elevated sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays and marls in sedimentary geologic formations.
Transgressive deposits are generally clay and silty deposits making them more resistant to
erosion. Regressive deposits are generally silty and sandy and less resistant to erosion.
Resistant strata form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965).
The streams that flow through these hills and prairies typically had floodplains 1.6 to 16.1
km (1 to 10 mi) wide. These floodplains generally occurred 30.5 to 45.7-meters (100 to
150-feet) below the regular elevation of the land creating narrower floodplains where
streams cut through the cuestas (BEG 1967, 1977; Fenneman 1938).
The geologic units in the project area include the Eocene age Sparta Sand formation
on ridge summits and back slopes with Weches formation on toe slopes overlooking the
floodplain in the west quarter of the project area (BEG 1967). The floor of the floodplain is
3

Quaternary Alluvium. Sparta Sand formation is a regressive deposit composed of fine to
medium-grained quartz sand that is light gray to brownish gray in color. Weches formation
is a transgressive deposit composed of thin-bedded grayish green to grayish olive green
glauconite and quartz sand interbedded with light brown to moderate light gray, silty,
muscovitic clay. The Quaterary alluvium in the project area is significantly younger and,
because of its location on the landscape, has the only potential for containing deeply buried
archaeological sites in colluvial deposited material from the adjacent slopes. Unfortunately,
the mapped Quaterary Alluvium is underwater in the project area. To refine how local
geology affects the proposed development relies on the information derived from the Web
Soil Survey (NRCS 2012).

Soils
Soils within the project area vary according to the underlying geology and position
on the landscape. The ridge summits and backslopes are mostly Pickton loamy fine sand
(PkC and PkE) and Wolfpen loamy fine sand (WoC and WoE) with isolated areas of
Gallime fine sandy loam (GaB) and Cuthbert fine sandy loam (CfE) which formed on
Sparta Sand Formation. The toe slopes include Leagueville loamy fine sand (LgB) and
Oakwood fine sandy loam (OkB) which formed on the Weches Formation. The floodplain
is described as Mantachie loam (Ma) which formed on Quaternary Alluvium. According to
the soil survey (NRCS 2012), the Pickton, Wolfpen, Gallime and Cuthbert series have A
and E horizons of loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam between 50 and 130 cm (20 and 54
in) over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Leagueville and Oakwood series have A and E
horizons of fine sandy loam 30 cm (12 in) over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Mantachie
loam has an A horizon of loam and fine sandy loam over a weak B horizon of gley colored
loam. Gley color soils are indicative of long term saturation. No buried soils were noted in
the Mantachie series description.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The project area is in the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early
Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods. Each period was delineated by a change in
environment, technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying
circumstances. Each period is described in reference to the cultural phases within the
period, settlement patterns, subsistence, and artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted
cultural period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America
from the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene. The use of non-local materials and
recycling lead Story and others (1990) to suggest this population was organized into small,
mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacal and unifacial tools. PaleoIndian sites are typified by scattered Clovis, Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and
Plainview projectile points. These sites are rare in the region with only one or two
documented components per county in the area. Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the
region suggested that early occupations were principally distributed in the valleys of major
stream basins (Perttula 1995). Waters (1992:151) suggests sites from the Paleo-Indian
period are less frequent in active floodplains because of the changes in the landscape over
the last 8000 years.

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more
regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period
is represented by three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool
technology progressed from the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of
sand and grog tempered ceramics and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late
Prehistoric. The Archaic, in general, represents a shift in subsistence as Late Archaic sites
are more abundant than Early Archaic sites as populations shifted from major streams to
5

minor streams and natural springs (Story et al. 1990). This increase in site count and
distribution throughout the Archaic suggests the successful adaptation to the environment
lasting until the development of pottery and/or the development of the bow and arrow.
Features found on sites in the Archaic include stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling
implements, and polished stone that serve as indicators of new technologies (Story et al.
1990:213). Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as well (Story et al. 1990) and become an
integral part of the late Archaic. When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic
assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are generally less well made
and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period and earlier Archaic
divisions. Projectile point types associated with the Archaic period include earlier expanded
stem (e.g., Keithville, Palmer, Kirk and Cossatot), corner-notched, and side notched points
(e.g., Big Sandy, Calf Creek , Johnson, Carrollton, and Morrill) followed by stemed points
(e.g., Lang, Castroville, Palmillas, Ellis, Edgewood, and Yarbrough) (Story et al. 1990).

Woodland Period
The Woodland period (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Perttula 2004:9), first
introduced as the Early Ceramic (Story et al. 1990:293), represented an increasing
utilization of the environment and technological changes. A number of characteristic
innovations appear during the Woodland period along with regional differences within the
same environment. In particular, there is a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger
and more prolonged occupations at specific locales.

The technological innovation

appearing during the Early Ceramic period was the widespread production of pottery and
the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the period (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond
1990). Pottery was introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as the Fourche Maline
culture in northeast Texas. Plainware ceramics with clay/grog or bone temper are described
as Williams Plain; however, Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised, Tchefuncte Stamped,
Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised ceramics were also found along the Sabine River
(Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff and Peter 1994:23) while south of the Sabine
River Mossy Grove culture ceramics are mostly plain sandy paste Mossy Grove varieties
(Story 1990, Ricklis 2004:189). Recently, Black and Story (2003) described the Mill Creek
culture along the Upper Sabine River basin with pottery similar to Williams Plain but with
6

incised lines and punctations. Gary and Kent projectile points are found throughout all three
cultures. Additionally, corner-notched arrow points enter the archaeological record at this
period as well (Thurmond 1990) with a split similar to the ceramic border along the Sabine
River having a variety of stemmed arrow points to the south (Perttula 2004:376).
Populations throughout the region attempted to utilize plant resources along valley margins
as sites were located along increasingly larger landforms and covered larger areas (Corbin
1998:115).

Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) Smith County was in the Caddoan
cultural area. The Caddo culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story et al. 1990:323; Wycoff
1971). Caddo subsistence and social organization differed markedly from the Woodland
period as horticulture supplemented hunting and gathering followed by a diet dominated by
maize, beans, and squash. Increasingly larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. A stratified social structure developed
corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads surrounding a
larger community mound center.

Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated

landforms adjacent to major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed
branches. The Late Prehistoric Period is divided into Formative, Early, Middle, and Late
Caddoan phases. The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and material
culture with increasingly smaller regional differences. Overall, the Late Prehistoric Period
to the north is typified by a variety of arrowpoints, ground stone artifacts, and a ceramic
vessel types. Formative and Early Caddo sites include maize and populations lived in semipermanent hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula et al. 1986:54-55). Middle Caddo sites include
increased use of planted crops and increasingly larger settlements with more and larger
mounds sites with evidence of more social and political organization. The Late Caddo
period has the greatest regional and temporal variation which is divided into archaeological
phases. For example, the earlier Whelan phase (ca. A.D. 1350-1450) is replaced by the later

7

Titus phase (ca A.D. 1450-1650) along the upper Cypress Creek basin and the Frankston
phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1650) along the Neches and Angelina River basins (Thurmond 1990;
Perttula 2004).

Historic
Although the Spanish had a presence in east Texas since the late seventeenth
century, the area that would become Smith was not inhabited by Anglo settlers until
American traders moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s and the area was not
heavily settled until the Cherokee were removed in 1839. Smith County was officially
formed on 11 April 1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Cotton was the primary trade
commodity but corn, fruit, and vegetables sustained the growing population. Throughout
the 1850’s the county continued to grow as more farmers planted cotton with slave labor.
The county did have a diverse economy with sawmills, gristmills, and three distilleries.
Smith County voted for secession and hosted two Confederate Camps (Camp Clough and
Camp Ford) north and east of Tyler respectively along with a transportation depot,
ordinance plant, and stockade. Race relations were strained in Smith County as the black
population was constantly harassed into the 1870’s.

The International & Great Northern

Railway reached Tyler in 1874. Three years later 33 km (21 mi) of railway connected towns
across the county. Cotton sales increased dramatically and livestock sales followed. Tyler
grew with new industries and colleges over the next 20 years. Agriculture across the county
expanded to include the sale of what had been subsistence vegetables and fruits. However,
cotton still dominated the market and with the Great Depression and boll weevil infestations
many farmers suffered in the 1930’s. After the depression, industry steadily grew as oil
exploration, a renewed military industry (with WWII), and the lumber industry returned
Smith County to prosperity (McCroskey 2012).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The archaeological regional overview documents of primary importance are D.A.
Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally,
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the east Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
This THC document included several historic contexts each of which dealt with a particular
facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This state plan synthesized the state of archaeological
research in the region and identified problems and objectives to be addressed in future
research and cultural resources management.

Several weak areas in archaeological

knowledge of the region were identified in these recent studies. Chronology, settlement
patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities were some of the general research directions
that all of these recent syntheses emphasized as important for developing future
archaeological research designs. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-408) described the most
up to date descriptions of the region for the Caddo Cultural Area which extends from the
Red River to Angelina County in Texas.
Large-scale investigations including research within specific drainage systems and
extensive excavations on large sites were conducted across the region providing most of the
prehistoric and historic cultural information. Substantial investigations began in the 1930s
with the University of Texas surveys along major stream valleys. Later large survey areas
include surveys and site excavations for reservoirs (e.g., Story 1965; Jelks 1958; and
Anderson 1971). These and other large area surveys over the next forty years document a
majority of the archaeological sites recorded and provide the basis for predicting site
locations across the landscape. The abundance of site data lead to studies of individual
basins (e.g., Thurmond’s 1990 study of the Cypress Creek basin) and excavations of specific
sites (e.g., Thom’s 2004 excavations at Camp Ford). Small-scale investigations include
numerous well and pipelines for utilities, private interests and TxDot scattered across the
county.
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2012) was consulted for the locations
of known archaeological sites, NRHP properties, and State Archaeological Landmarks
within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area. The Site Atlas shows four archaeological
investigations and six archaeological sites within one mile of the project area (Appendix
9

C). The previous investigations include two surveys near Greenbriar Lake roughly 1.5 km
(0.9 miles) north of the project area (Skinner 1992 and Whitsett 1977) and two surveys in
Lindsey Park (Corbin 1985 and Perttula et al. 2003).
AR Consultants (Skinner 1992) surveyed an expansion of the Tyler Fish Hatchery
under Antiquities Permit #1156. The survey was successful in documenting four historic
period sites which included a wooden pipe from 1925 (41SM176), a rock/clay quarry from
the 1920’s (41SM177), cement stairs from the 1920’s or 1930’s (41SM178), and the
original manager’s house from 1934 (41SM179). The other survey near Greenbriar Lake
was conducted by the Texas Water Development Board; no sites were documented within
a mile of the current project area (Whitsett 1977).
The initial Lindsey Park survey was conducted under Antiquities Permit #515.
Corbin (1985) was successful in documenting 41SM159 as a Late Archaic and Caddoan
multicomponent occupation. Artifacts from the site include two flakes, the distal fragment
of a dart point, a pitted stone, two milling stones, and a grog tempered brushed sherd. No
further work was recommended on the site because the site was destroyed by construction
of a well location prior to the cities acquisition of the property.
Most recently, Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC. (AEC)
documented and assessed the Lindsey Park site (41SM300) in the current project area
under Antiquities Permit #3176 (Perttula et al. 2003). Human remains of an unknown age
were discovered in the high-wall of a sand quarry.

AEC profiled the quarry wall,

collected soil samples, shovel tested the summit of the ridge, and conducted a surface
inspection of the quarry pit.

The surface inspection found two dart points (one

Bulverde/Carrollton and one Kent) and a ground stone tool. A total of 11 flakes were
found in ten positive shovel tests on the ridge summit. Based on the shovel testing effort,
AEC concluded up to 70% of the site was destroyed by quarrying. Based on the artifacts,
the site was occupied between 4500 and 1500 years ago. AEC recommended the site for
designation as a State Archaeological Landmark, quarrying should stop, erosion be
minimized, the area posted as off-limits, and the site should be periodically monitored by
an archaeologist. For the current investigations, the results of the 2003 investigation were
incorporated into the recommendations and the sketch map was incorporated into the
modern sketch map of the site to expand the data on 41SM300.
10

The search of existing historical records included the Original Texas Land Survey
(OTLS 2012) data and soils maps (Marbut 1915; Hatherly 1993). The OTLS data shows
the property spanned two properties.

The western half was owned by Henry Teal

(Abstract 997) and the eastern half was owned by Johnston Wright (Abstract 1039) (ETGS
2012). The 1915 soils map shows the road along the western edge of the project area but
no buildings in the project area. The 1979 air photo shows the upland ridges as either
pasture or populated with scattered mature trees and the drainages are forested. No
buildings were visible in the air photo.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The Research Design and Methodology for the recently constructed park
improvements is based on the proposed impacts to the property. The recently constructed
park improvements include creating approximately 14.5 km (9 mi) of mountain bike trails
and expanding the frisbee golf course by building tee-off pads and goals. Mountain bike
trail expansion is generally focus on sloped surfaces to increase the difficulty of the trail
while tee-off pads and goals are on generally level surfaces. Mountain bike trails are
paths 1 m (3.3 ft) wide. These paths are cleared with hand tools and generally avoid trees
with trunks larger than 10 cm (4 in) in diameter. Trees and bushes along the proposed trail
with trunks smaller than 10 cm (4 in) in diameter are cut off at the ground surface.
Recycled asphalt gravel is used to stabilize the mountain bike trail in high erosion areas
and wooden bridges will be built over drainage channels. Tee-off pads are cement pads
roughly 1.5 x 3.0 m (5 x 10 ft) and 20 cm (8 in) thick. Goal foundations are holes
excavated with an auger and filled with a PVC tube containing the base of the goal.
Research began with a literature review for material pertinent to the project area.
The review incorporated the time from the earliest known human occupation to modern
use. The literature review included: reading archaeological and historical publications on
the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2012); reviewing any information concerning
historical, geomorphological, and archaeological information at the Stephen F. Austin
State University Library in Nacogdoches, Texas; and obtaining digital data from the Texas
Natural Resources Information System (2012).

11

DETAC performed these investigations in accordance with the procedural rules of
the Texas Antiquities Code and the CTA Guidelines for Professional Performance
(2005a). Site definitions were in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974 (PL 97-442), 1976 and 1980; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321,
1970); Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources protection Act of 1979; and the ethical codes of conduct
described by the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional
Archaeologists.
To aid in the survey, high and low probability areas were determined by
combining the previous site information with topographic and soils data. Based on the
previous instigations in the area and other surveys in east Texas, archaeological sites were
more likely to be found on level landforms with deep well-drained soils near surface water
resources as these environments provide dryer conditions for year-round occupation and
necessary water (Galan 1996; 1997). Cultural resources on floodplains are less frequent
unless the site is on a levee or other sandy landform that is smaller than the mapped soil
series as described in Thurmond (1990:217 Figure 29) survey of the Cypress Creek
Drainage Basin. Using these criteria those lowland areas and the first upland terraces
along seasonal drainages were considered high probability areas. Sites in seasonally wet
areas are typically more ephemeral occupations and are frequently destroyed by annual
flooding and stream channel migration.
The pedestrian survey was conducted using a visual assessment and shovel testing at
high and low probability areas in accordance with the THC’s guidelines for cultural
resources surveys for areas greater than 100 acres by consulting with the THC. The visual
assessments were conducted by walking mountain bike trails with additional transects over
the entire project area looking for structural remains and areas of potential high probably not
visible on the topographic maps. The surface inspection was conducted at all observed
exposed ground surfaces (recent excavations, slope erosion, cutbanks, and animal
disturbances). Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. Shovel testing
included excavating in 10 cm (4 in) increments to the Bt horizon or to 90+ cm. All
excavated matrix was screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardwire cloth. The depth, soil
12

texture, color, and any artifacts from each shovel test were recorded as part of a GPS
position with 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) accuracy.
Archaeological work on the Lindsey Park site (41SM300) included examining the
quarry pits, mapping surface features and shovel testing the lateral limits of the site
boundaries (Martin 2012 personal communication). The goal of the investigations were to
assess impacts to the site, affirm the site boundary, and search for ceramic artifacts to better
assess the occupation range of the site. Surface features were mapped with a GPS, photos
were taken of surface features and the quarry pits, and shovel tests were excavated in less
disturbed areas of the ridge near new portions of the mountain bike trail, tee-off pads, and
goals to find the extent of the site and potential effects of the modern impacts.
Archaeological work on the Five Snakes site (41SM455), included a surface
inspection and mapping of surface features followed by shovel testing at 10 to 20 m (10 to
20 m) intervals to define the spatial boundaries and vertical depth of the deposits of the site.
All information was recorded on a standard Texas Archaeological Site Form (TexSite v. 3.0
2011). A field sketch map was completed and color photographs were taken to document
the physiographic setting. All of the photographs were recorded on standard DETAC
photographic logs. All artifacts collected were washed, cataloged, analyzed and prepared
for curation.
DETAC prepared all site forms, maps, and field notes along with photographs for
curation at the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Laboratory. Copies of
the draft report were provided to the THC for review following CTA Guidelines for
Cultural Resources Management Reports (2005b). Upon completion of consultation, a
final report was prepared incorporating any comments provided by the THC. Final digital
and hard copies of the report will be provided to the THC for inclusion in the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas.

RESULTS
Field Investigations were conducted between 26 and 30 March 2012. DETAC
archaeologists walked the existing and proposed bike trails with additional transects
between the trails to ensure the pedestrian survey covered the frisbee golf additions and
the remainder of the project area.

Shovel testing and visual examination of the project

area included walking transects across the property making notes on surface disturbance
and shovel testing at low and high probability intervals.
The visual examination found that the project area was forested with mixed
hardwood trees. A dense to moderate understory dominated the drainages and pine trees
an scattered hardwood trees with a light to moderate understory dominated the uplands.
Contour terracing berms were observed on the shoulder and slopes of the uplands.
Evidence of contouring included parallel ridges along the slopes of the hills and level
ridges with steep angled slopes overlooking the drainages. The floodplain in the western
portion of the project area was inundated with water.
Shovel testing in the project area focused on upland ridge toe slopes and shoulders
overlooking the floodplain for evidence of prehistoric sites and investigating the uplands
for evidence of the historic period buildings. A total of 205 shovel tests were excavated
across the project area (Figure 2 and Appendix A). Shovel tests on upland ridges were
generally 70 to 90 cm (28 to 36 in) deep in light yellowish brown loamy sand. Many of
the tests did not find a clear Bt horizon. Investigations on 41SM300, described below,
show the soil formed in loamy sand in excess of 4 m (13 ft) deep on the upland summits.
Shallower soils were encountered on lower ridges and fingers closer to the drainages and
toe slopes. Shovel tests on toe slopes were generally 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in) deep in
brown sandy loam over a clay Bt horizon. Shovel tests in the floodplain found soils were
only 20 cm (8 in) deep in brown and gray silty loam over a dense clay Bt horizon. The
water of a beaver pond limited exploration of the floodplain.

41SM300
The Lindsey Park site (41SM300) was recorded as a multicomponent Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric site, based on the stemmed dart points and a human burial (Perttula et
al. 2003) on the summit of a narrow ridge overlooking an unnamed tributary to Indian

Creek. The burial was found in the high-wall of a sand quarry on the northern edge of the
ridge and the diagnostic artifacts were found on the surface in the quarry (Figure 3).
Lithic flakes were also found in shovel tests on the summit of the ridge. The Lindsey Park
site was recommended for State Archaeological Landmark status and avoidance by
stopping all work and not allowing any additional use of the landform.
The current investigations focused on assessing any additional impacts to the site
and to both affirming the site boundaries and searching for additional artifacts to refine the
estimated age of the site with shovel testing (Martin 2012 personal communication). To
meet these goals, the surface of the ridge and quarry was inspected and modern impacts
mapped followed by the excavation of shovel tests on the less impacted portions of the
ridge.
The surface inspection found quarrying that was not mapped by the AEC
investigations on the southern end of the ridge, a gravel road along the ridge summit, and
several frisbee golf tee-off points and goals erected on the ridge summit and slopes
(Figure 4). A surface inspection of the existing tee-off pads and quarry areas did not find
any additional artifacts and a profile of a section of the high-wall revealed deep A and E
horizons with a weak B horizon. The weak B was identified by coalescing lamellae in the
parent material. Based on the visual inspection, the only portion of the original ridge
summit that is still intact is between the two quarry pits.
A total of ten shovel tests were excavated across the ridge in the less disturbed
portion between the quarry pits near the existing frisbee golf tee-off pads and goals and
where the proposed mountain bike trail will leave the existing gravel road (Figure 5). All of
the shovel tests on the ridge summit and slopes found deep loamy sand with no clear Bt
horizon. Only one of the tests (ST 101) was positive with two flakes on the summit of the
ridge. The negative shovel tests on the slopes helped refine the site boundaries to the
summit of the ridge and the quarry pit. These shovel test results confirm the AEC artifact
findings and refine the site boundary to the summit of the ridge where the slope is less
dramatic. No diagnostic ceramics or lithic artifacts were found to refine the age of the site.

In summary, the Lindsey Park site is a multicomponent Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric site based on the stemmed dart points and the presence of the burial without
associated artifacts.

Nearby sites 41SM159 and 41SM455 (discussed below) have

Archaic and Caddo components which suggest use of the 41SM300 landform throughout
these periods. The site was heavily disturbed by quarrying and little of the original ground
surface remains. The discovery of a human burial and potential for undiscovered burials
makes protection of the site important.
DETAC concurs with AEC’s initial recommendations that the site should be
protected from further development and further erosion because the ridge is an unmarked
grave site. Excavation in the quarry pits and any construction of tee-off pads or goals
should be prohibited. Limiting use of the ridge can be effected by building locking gates at
the two entrances. The proposed mountain bike trail will utilized the existing recycled
asphalt gravel road on the ridge summit with a new trail crossing the ridge. DETAC
recommends adding recycled asphalt to the new mountain bike trail in the site boundary to
ensure no further damage will occur to the site. The high-walls on the quarry pits should be
stabilized by adding fill material (from another quarry off-site) and covering the surface
with grass seed to halt mass-erosion in the quarry pits.

41SM455
The Five Snakes site (41SM455) is a Caddo lithic and ceramic artifact scatter on
the shoulder of an upland ridge overlooking an unnamed drainage to the north (Figure 6
and Appendix C). The slope is nearly level on the southern edge of the site and increases
to 15% just north of the site. Vegetation is mixed hardwood and pine forests with a
moderate understory of various bushes, shrubs, and vines. Ground cover included patches
of shin high grass separated by areas of leaf litter and pine straw. Soils are described as
Pickton fine loamy sand. Shovel tests were excavated to 90 cm (36 in). No distinctive Bt
horizon was found, but there was a change in color from yellowish brown to reddish
brown roughly 50 cm (20 in) below the surface. This gradual color change without a
textural change is the boundary between the A and E horizons (Figure 7).

Modern surface features include a low contouring terrace berm that crosses the
southern portion of the site. The berm is roughly 2 m (6 ft) wide and 60 cm (24 in) tall
running parallel to the ridge shoulder across the southern portion of the site. Based on the
size of the trees, the berm was most likely built early in the 20th century.
A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated in the immediate area. Negative shovel
tests and the steep slope defined the site boundary. Only five shovel tests were positive:
ST 105 contained four ceramic sherds and one flake, ST 106 contained one sherd and one
flake, ST 151 contained one sherd, ST 152 contained one flake, and ST 155 contained one
sherd. Vertically, the artifacts were found between 10 and 50 cm (4 and 20 in) below the
surface with four artifacts in Levels 2 and 4 each and one artifact in Levels 3 and 5. No
cultural features be were observed on the surface or in profiles of the shovel tests.
Artifacts found on the site include seven ceramic sherds and four flakes. All of the
sherds are grog temper. Decorations include four brushed, two incised, and one punctated.
One incised sherd has broad incised diamond patterns and the only rim sherd has parallel
incised lines extending diagonally from the rim (Figure 7). The lithic are all tertiary
flakes; two are chert and two are quartzite.

Detailed ceramic and lithic analysis is

presented in Appendix B. The Five Snakes site is most likely a Middle Caddo occupation
although the site is small and there are few artifacts.
The Five Snakes site is a small Caddo lithic and ceramic artifact scatter on the
shoulder of an upland ridge. Artifact distribution, variety and types suggest a short-term
occupation on or near the current ground surface. A disturbed surface and deep sandy
soils suggest little chance of intact features on the site; however, the presence of a burial
on the Lindsey Park site in similar soils and topographic setting suggests there is the
potential for similar intact buried features. The proposed mountain bike trail will not
impact the Five Snakes site. DETAC recommends either maintaining the trail in its
current location or shifting the trail east to provide a buffer around the site boundary.
Based on the current investigations, the Five Snakes site has an undetermined eligibility
for inclusion to the NRHP; therefore, the site should be avoided because of the potential
for undocumented features similar to Lindsey Park site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Lindsey Park improvements consist of expanding mountain bike trails and a
Frisbee golf course on 116 ha (287 ac) of property owned by the City of Tyler. The
mountain bike trail construction includes clearing a path roughly 14.5 km (9 mi) long
without excavation, constructing narrow bridges over stream channels and using recycled
asphalt gravel to check erosion. The Frisbee golf course expansion includes building teeoff pads and goals from existing facilities.
Previous investigations by AEC in the Lindsey Park property documented the
Lindsey Park site (41SM300) in the current project area as a Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric multicomponent occupation with a human burial (Perttula et al. 2003). Shovel
testing on the Lindsey Park site refined the site boundaries but did not find any artifacts
that would refine the age of the site. The pedestrian survey also documented the Five
Snakes site (41SM455) as a small Caddo occupation on the shoulder of an upland ridge.
The proposed mountain bike trail will not impact the Five Snakes site; however, DETAC
recommends avoiding the site because the NRHP eligibility is undetermined.
DETAC concurs with AEC’s initial recommendations that the Lindsey Park site
should be protected from further development and further erosion because the ridge is an
unmarked grave site. More burials may be present on the ridge. Excavation in the quarry
pits and any construction of tee-off pads or goals should be prohibited; limiting use of the
ridge can be effected by building locking gates at the two entrances. DETAC recommends
adding recycled asphalt to the new mountain bike trail in the site boundary to insure no
further damage will occur to the site. The high-walls on the quarry pits should be stabilized
by adding fill material (from another quarry off-site) and covering the surface with grass
seed to halt erosion.
Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no adverse effect”
to cultural resources eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or the
State Archaeological Landmarks. If any artifacts, bones, or dark greasy soils are found,
then work should stop in the immediate area and both the Texas Historic Commission and
DETAC should be contacted immediately.
