ABSTRACT

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline south and west of Orla, Texas in Reeves
and Culberson Counties, Texas. This report encompasses only the portion of the proposed Junction to Orla
Pipeline located on two tracts of Permanent School Fund land in Reeves County, Texas. The Permanent
School Fund is administered by the Texas General Land Office (TGLO), a political subdivision of the State
of Texas. The portion of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands is approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km)
in length and is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Orla, Tex. (1968) and Screw Bean
Draw East, Tex. (1973) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps. The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15.24
m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50 foot (15.24 m) wide temporary
workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area of potential effect (APE) on TGLO lands consists
of the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 21.8 acres (8.8 hectares).
The cultural resources intensive field survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC) and the intensive field survey of the TGLO lands was completed under TAC Permit
No. 9013.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Cody
Kiker to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, one site, 41RV15,
has been previously recorded within the APE and will be impacted by construction of the proposed Junction
to Orla Pipeline. Site 41RV15 was for reviewed for NRHP eligibility twice by the Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) and its status is listed as undetermined. An additional seven sites, 41RV14,
41RV17, 41RV92, 41RV104, 41RV105, 41RV106, and 41RV167, have been previously recorded within
1-mile of the APE. Site 41RV14 is designated as a SAL and was determined eligible for listing to the
NRHP. However, site 41RV14 is located approximately 600 feet (183 m) from the APE and will not be
impacted by construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline. The remaining sites were either not
assessed for NRHP eligibility or were determined ineligible for listing to the NRHP and all are located at
least 300 feet (91 m) from the APE. Only six of the eight sites, 41RV14, 41RV15, 41RV104, 41RV105,
41RV106, and 41RV167, have been recorded within 1-mile of the Junction to Orla Pipeline APE on TGLO
lands.
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands was conducted April 9, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Christopher Flowers. All aspects of the project were supervised by Gary D. Edington,
an ENERCON archeologist who meets U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards
for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline did not result in finding any prehistoric or
historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites over 50 years of age within the ROW on TGLO lands.
Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands
will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion in the NRHP or designation or
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). No further cultural resources investigations are recommended
prior to construction of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands. If cultural material, including sites,
features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW on TGLO lands during
construction of Junction to Orla Pipeline, work in the area must cease and the regional THC Archeologist
must be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline south and west of Orla, Texas in Reeves
and Culberson Counties, Texas (Figure 1). This report encompasses only the portion of the proposed
Junction to Orla Pipeline located on two tracts of Permanent School Fund land in Reeves County, Texas.
The Permanent School Fund is administered by the Texas General Land Office (TGLO), a political
subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands is
approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km) in length and is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
Orla, Tex. (1968) and Screw Bean Draw East, Tex. (1973) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps (Figure 2). The
construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15.24 m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an
additional 50 foot (15.24 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area of
potential effect (APE) on TGLO lands consists of the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling
21.8 acres (8.8 hectares).
Construction of the Junction to Orla Pipeline will involve the mechanized clearing of vegetation within the
APE and open-cut trenching where the pipeline will be buried. Clearing of vegetation is typically done with
bulldozers. The trenches are typically at least four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) deep and three to four feet (0.9
to 1.2 m) wide and dug by excavators. State, County, and private lease roads are typically bored under by
horizonal directional drilling. Additional impacts within the APE include foot traffic and general vehicle
traffic from everything from light-duty pickup trucks to heavy mechanized equipment. Once construction
is complete and the pipeline is operational, all trenches and pits will be backfilled, and all construction
equipment will be removed. Salt Creek, which is crossed by the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline, will
also be bored under into bedrock by horizontal directional drilling. Boring under Salt Creek into solid
bedrock eliminates any potential impact to the creek, slopes, banks, and canyon. As the proposed Junction
to Orla Pipeline will not impact Salt Creek, no “Waters of the United States” will be affected by the
proposed project and no permit or concurrence from the United States Army Corps of Engineers is required.
Because of the depth of the canyon, the bore entry and exit points will be set back several hundred feet from
either edge of the canyon, eliminating any impacts to the banks of the creek and the immediately adjacent
uplands. As these areas will not be impacted by the proposed project, no deep testing or mechanical
trenching along Salt Creek is required.
The cultural resources intensive field survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC) and the intensive field survey of the TGLO lands was completed under TAC Permit
No. 9013. No artifacts were collected during the survey. Pursuant to 13 TAC 26.17, notes, records,
photographs, and photograph logs generated during the field investigations have been prepared for
permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands was conducted April 9, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Christopher Flowers. All aspects of the project were supervised by Gary D. Edington,
an ENERCON archeologist who meets U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards
for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline APE is situated within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas subecoregion of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas
are part of the larger Chihuahuan Deserts which extend from the Madrean Archipelago of Arizona in the
west to the Edwards Plateau of west-central Texas. The boundaries of this area are defined by an arid
climate with some of the lowest precipitation rates in Texas, with annual rainfall recorded at eight to
fourteen inches (20 to 36 centimeters [cm]), which support desert scrub-shrub vegetation dominated by
creosote bush on the alkaline or gypsiferous soils (Griffith et al. 2007). The elevation of the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas range from 1,200 to 4,500 feet (366 to 1,372 m) above mean sea level (amsl) with local
relief varying from 25 to 500 feet (8 to 152 m) (Griffith et al. 2007:10). The major drainage of the
approximately 12,625 square mile (32,699 km2) ecoregion is the Pecos River which carries runoff south
from New Mexico to the Rio Grande (Griffith et al. 2007:8-9). Otherwise, the ecoregion is primarily
internally drained, resulting in alkaline soils, but an efficient recharge rate of local aquifers.
The presence of the quality groundwater did not go unnoticed by settlers and early 20th century inhabitants
who made use of the abundant groundwater with irrigation wells with flow rates between several hundred
to 2,000 gallons (7,571 liters [L]) per minute (Griffith et al. 2007:9). The primary crops on these irrigated
agricultural fields have included cotton, pecans, alfalfa, tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and the famous
melons, particularly cantaloupe from Reeves County (Griffith el al. 2007; Geiser 2010). Prehistoric and
protohistoric populations made use of irrigation in the region in the past (Long 2010, Dethloff and Nall
2010). The ranching and irrigation based agricultural practices developed from the late 19th to 20th century
in the region have altered the native environment. In the El Paso area to the west aquifer drawdown has
resulted in an over a 100 foot (30 m) decline in ground water levels from those recorded at the turn of the
20th century and salt build up in soils has led to the abandonment of Pecos Valley agricultural fields which
were previously productive farmlands in the 1900s (Griffith et al. 2007:9). The agricultural and industrial
uses of the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas have reduced the river, which was described by early
observers as being 4 to 15 feet (1.2 to 4.6 m) deep, and up to 100 feet (30 m) wide, and as fast, deep and
wide (Griffith et al. 2007:9; Hayter 2010), into a gentle, slow, shallow and narrow channel. As an example,
the early history of settlement in the region of modern Pecos, Texas was related to the encampments of
cowboys in the region due to the safe ford for cattle across the mighty Pecos River to the east of the modern
town site (Smith 2010a). The historic to modern grazing practices in the region have also altered the
environment. The former grasslands which supported cattle have been reduced by overgrazing to desert
shrub lands suitable only for sheep and goats (Griffith et al. 2007:8).
The desert setting of the APE results in relatively sparse vegetation and excellent ground surface visibility
(GSV). The dominant creosote bush is an example of the resilient regional flora which can tolerate the
diurnal temperature range, low moisture conditions, and high evapotranspiration rates of the region.
Additional ecotones include the high saline environments of the dry saltpans and playas where saltbush and

alkali sacaton may be found (Griffith et al. 2007:8). Honey mesquite, yucca, and mixed grasses are found
intermittently in the region.
The Junction to Orla Pipeline APE on TGLO land ranges in elevation from approximately 2,850 feet to
3,020 feet (869 to 920 m) amsl (Figure 2). The highest elevation within the APE on TGLO lands is at the
far east edge of the southeast State of Texas tract. The lowest elevation within the APE on TGLO lands
occurs where the proposed Junction to Oral Pipeline crosses Salt Creek, which flows north-northeast into
the Pecos River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande.
Reeves County has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short, cool winters and long hot
summers. In winter, the average high temperature is 46°F, with an average low of 29°F. In summer, the
average high temperature is 99°F, with an average low of 83°F (Jaco 1980). The record low in winter is
9°F, recorded on January 11, 1962, and the record high in summer is 118°F, recorded on June 29, 1968
(Jaco 1980). Annual precipitation averages 8.5 inches (22 cm), with 6 of the 8.5 inches (15 cm) falling from
April through September. Thunderstorms occur on an average of 40 days per year (Jaco 1980). The growing
season averages 226 days (Smith 2010b). Snowfall is rare, and in 70 percent of winters there is no
measurable snowfall (Jaco 1980). The average humidity ranges from a low of 40 percent in midafternoon
to a high of 70 percent at dawn (Jaco 1980).
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline
APE on TGLO lands crosses three mapped soil units which are presented alphabetically in Table 1 (USDA
2019). The soils consist of residuum weathered from limestone and gypsum, as well as loamy to gravelly
alluvium derived from limestone and gypsum. None of the soils are considered prime farmland due
primarily to salinity, gravel content, or shallow depth to bedrock (USDA 2019). The majority of the soils
have a relatively shallow depth to bedrock suggesting a low potential for deeply buried cultural deposits.
The shallow depth to gypsum in the Holloman-Reeves association soils, six inches (15 cm) and 33 inches
(84 cm) respectively, severely limits the possibility of deeply buried cultural deposits within those soils.
The Pleistocene-age gravels at all depths of the Delnorte-Chilicotal association soils precludes the
possibility of deeply buried cultural deposits within those soils.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Based on the archeological record, people have inhabited Texas for at least the last 12,000 years. The
prehistory of the Southern High Plains has been commonly broken into five temporal periods. The dates
assigned to those periods differ between authors but generally include the Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,5008,500 B.P.), Archaic Period (ca. 8,500-1500 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,500 B.P. to 500 B.P.).
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500-1700) is followed by the Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700-1950)
(adapted from Boyd 2004).
A summary of the culture history is presented below. For additional information on the cultural history of
the region and a more detailed review than is possible here, the reader is directed to the works by Patterson
(1995), Ensor (1991), Perttula (2004), and Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011).
Paleoindian Period
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the area is relatively scarce in the Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,5008,500 B.P.). It is highly likely that earlier sites have been lost to erosion due to the geological context of the
area (Boyd 1997). Paleoindian sites are more common on the eastern Edwards Plateau, although sites and
isolated artifacts have been recorded. Although there is growing evidence for human presence in the
Americas, the Clovis is the first well-defined cultural horizon in the region. The remains of large herbivores
are often found in association with Clovis artifacts but there is a growing body of evidence for the
procurement of smaller animals and plants during this time. The Clovis projectile points are lanceolate in
shape and have fluted bases. Subsequent Paleoindian projectile points include Folsom and Plainview
(Turner, Hester, and McReynolds 2011:45). These projectile points were typically hafted to spears, which
were often thrown with the aid of atlatls.
Archaic Period
With the extinction of megafauna, the Archaic Period (ca. 8,500-1,500 B.P.) is generally defined by broader
subsistence practices and an increase in intensity of resource exploitation. The climate transitioned from
relatively wet in the Early Archaic Period to relatively dry in the Late Archaic Period. Additionally,
temperatures appear to have increased which resulted in changes to the biotic community. FCR and
oxidized rock is relatively common during this period and likely results from hearths and ovens (Collins
2004). Although resource exploitation is inferred to be more intense, subsistence appears to be focused on
seasonal mobility tied in part to bison hunting (Boyd 1997). Campsites and rock shelters have been
identified from this period, mostly from the Late Archaic. Projectile points are normally barbed spear and
dart points, and plant-processing tools increase through time (Johnson and Holliday 2004).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Ceramic Period (ca. 1,500 B.P. to 500 B.P.) is marked by the presence of ceramics
and smaller projectile points indicating the switch from atlatl and spear to the bow and arrow (Johnson and
Holliday 2004). Due to further drying of the climate, bison appear to become scarcer in this region. Trading
is inferred to have occurred with Southwestern groups including the Jornada Mogollon (Boyd 1997).
Brownware pottery was imported from the Puebloans and habitation structures from this period include pit
houses. Campsites were still likely used during parts of the year and would be representative of seasonal
mobility. Subsistence practices included the introduction of corn. In the latter part of the period, prestige
goods like Olivella shell beads, turquoise, non-local pottery, and obsidian become more common.

Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500-1700) begins with direct and indirect European influences in the
region. The end of the period coincides with an increase in European presence and their effects on traditional
lifestyles. Limited access to Europeans goods begin but there is relatively minimal change from the Late
Prehistoric. Trade goods include bells, spikes, glass beads, and nails. European settlement did not begin to
seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation until after A.D. 1700 (Patterson 1995:249). European diseases,
probably introduced by explorers and early traders, did begin to have impacts as early as A.D. 1528. At
least seven epidemics were recorded among the tribes of the APE between that date and A.D. 1890 (Ewers
1974). The Tonkawa appear to have been joined by the Ervipiame from northern Mexico (Hester 1980).
Subsequent immigration by the Lipan Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche appear to change control of the area.
Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1950)
Spanish explorers began expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the early 1500s followed by
Catholic missionaries accompanied by Spanish soldiers. The Spanish, while teaching locals Christianity
and farming, attempted to make loyal Spanish citizens. The first missions were established in Mexico, but
were later built in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (Campbell 2003:36-38). The French,
partially to stem the advance of the Spanish, wanted to increase their fur trading territory and gain control
of the Mississippi River valley. By 1682, LaSalle, a Frenchman, launched an expedition down the
Mississippi River that claimed all of the lands drained by the river for France followed by a colonization
effort to settle the mouth of the Mississippi River. Subsequent to the French incursion into the region, the
Spanish increased the rate of establishing settlements in Texas (Campbell 2003:41-45, 48).
The Spanish mission system did not expand during the 18th century. Native American attacks and a lack
of colonists contributed to the decline of Spanish settlement in Texas. In 1762, the Spanish acquired
Louisiana from the French, which slowed the need to settle east Texas. In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to
France, who then sold it to the U.S. From 1800 to the 1820s, the population of Texas decreased as a result
of the effects of the Mexican Revolution. In 1821, Mexico finally became an independent nation, separate
from Spain. This newly independent country encouraged Anglo-American settlement within Texas; this
effort was led by Stephen F. Austin. Austin came to an agreement with the Mexican government in which
he would bring settlers to Texas and, in return, he would be rewarded with land and money. By 1830, ten
thousand Anglo-Americans, mostly from the American southeast, had settled in Texas (Campbell
2003:105-110).
Texas operated as an independent nation for 10 years (1836 to 1846) and during this time, the Mexican
government never truly recognized its independence. In 1846, Texas was annexed by the U.S. and it was
now up to the U.S. government to settle the border dispute with Mexico. The Mexicans claimed the
international border as the Nueces River, while the U.S. claimed the Rio Grande as the demarcation line.
After two years of skirmishes and an attack on Mexico City, the U.S. succeeded in its efforts; with the treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the border and ceded the entire southwest to
the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. (McComb 1989:57).
At the time of annexation by the U.S., west Texas was unexplored territory, home to various Native
American groups. Settlers began slowly pushing into this territory in the mid-19th century. In 1848, the
U.S. army stationed troops in west Texas and created travel routes through this new territory, which would
become corridors for pioneers traveling to California. These included the Chihuahua Trail, which led from
Mexico to Indianola, Texas, and Horsehead Crossing and Castle Gap in Crane County, all of which were
utilized as trade networks during the prehistoric period as well as forming part of a historic transportation
corridor linking Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Castle Gap functioned as a primary route for the U.S. Cavalry,
California Forty-niners, cattle drives and stage coach/wagon trains.

During the Civil War, Texas was a large contributor to the Confederacy, but differed significantly from
other southern states. Texas was a frontier state, with a diversified population of Mexicans, AngloAmericans, and Native Americans. The state also had a large European immigrant population, many of
whom were small farmers. Two-thirds of the farmers in the state were non-slave holding, which meant that
the agricultural economy was maintained following the Civil War. In addition, cattle ranches were a large
industry, resulting in economic diversity. Thus, Texas was not as negatively impacted economically as other
southern states during post-Civil War Reconstruction (Campbell 2003:209, 213).
The Native American groups of Texas saw the defeat of the Confederacy and the weakening of Texas as a
chance to regain lands they had lost. During this period, the Comanche and Apache occupied the areas of
west Texas. In response to this increase of Native American attacks, the U.S. sent troops to reoccupy several
forts. By 1874, a major campaign was initiated in Texas that took away Native Americans’ horses,
destroyed their villages and forced them to return to their reservations. The consolidation of Native
Americans on reservations allowed Anglo-Americans to settle permanently in west Texas (Campbell
2003:291, 295).
Following these campaigns, the military sent troops to conduct detailed expeditions of the former Native
American lands. By 1876, several of the counties northeast of the APE were surveyed by parties from Fort
Concho. Ranchers moved into these areas and began raising large herds of cattle, as the demand for beef
had risen after the Civil War. New cattle trails developed throughout west Texas, where large herds were
driven hundreds of miles north to the mid-western railroad routes. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway
extended their rail lines through west Texas; up to this point, rail transportation was only available in east
Texas. Between the 1870s and 1890s, 8,000 miles (12,875 km) of railway track were laid, connecting the
entire state. The new railroads significantly reduced the time and distance it took the cattle industry to
transport their herds to market (Campbell 2003:297, 306).
The expansion of the railroad connected the rural communities of west Texas with the booming cities to
the east. Towards the end of the 19th century, cattle ranchers began to fence off their herds and create small
communities on the frontier. In 1895, a law was passed that broke up these larger ranches, allowing farmers
to purchase smaller tracts of land. This led to the end of open-range ranching and attracted additional
settlers. West Texas communities grew slowly due to poor soil conditions and the difficulty of accessing
water. People began to farm corn and cotton on the newly settled land, but ranching was still the dominant
economic activity of west Texas at the end of the 19th century.
Reeves County is located in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas on the southwest side of the Pecos River from
Ward County and totals 2,538 square miles (6,573 km2) of primarily flat to undulating lands, with
mountainous areas found in the southern point of the county (Smith 2010b). The Texas and Pacific Railway
was constructed through the area in 1881 with railway section houses at Pecos and Toyah, and in 1883
Reeves County was separated from Pecos County to the southwest, and Pecos was designated the county
seat in 1884 during the formal organization of the county (Smith 2010b). By 1885, the community of Pecos
reported 150 residents and the community of Toyah reported 75 residents, and by 1890, Reeves County had
a population of 1,290 persons (Smith 2010b). The census of 1900 counted 1,847 residents in the county,
with 63 farms being reported totaling 900,000 acres of farmland and 51,000 head of cattle (Smith 2010b).
Intermittent droughts affected the region, as noted above, and the acres of farmland and size of the cattle
herds in the county fluctuated over the next 20 years, but the population had increased to 4,457 residents
(Smith 2010b). The discoveries of oil in the county in the 1920s contributed to the economy, but the large
boom experienced in the Hendrick Field to the east did not extend into Reeves County, and it was not until
the 1930s that oil fields in Reeves County brought significant economic and population growth, and by
1940 the population had increased to 8,006 residents (Smith 2010b). The 1950s discoveries of the of the
Toyah Gas Field and the Geraldine-Ford Field were significant in the county, but again did not compare to
the “giant fields” discovered elsewhere in the region. Nevertheless, the population of the county enumerated

Page 8

in 1960 was 17,644 and had declined to 16,526 residents in 1970, and then to 15,801 residents in 1980. The
population decline is intriguing as the area experienced a significant oil boom in the 1970’s and early 1980s
(Smith 2010b). The 1990 census listed 15,852 residents, in 2010, 13,783 residents were counted, and the
current July 1, 2018 estimated population is at 15,685 residents (Smith 2010b; USCB 2019). Since inception
in 1883, the economy has been based on agriculture and mineral extraction, with oil and gas development
being the primary economic activity over the last nine decades, while crops have included cotton, hay,
wheat, barley and fruits and vegetables such as onions, peppers, pecans and peaches, and cantaloupes
(Smith 2010b, Jaco 1980).

METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources field investigation followed the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The project area was surveyed by using parallel pedestrian transects spaced no more than 50 feet (15 m)
apart. The entire 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor within the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline APE
on TGLO lands was subjected to pedestrian survey for cultural resources.
Shovel testing density within the survey followed minimum standards outlined by the THC and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ practices and procedures, which call for 16 shovel tests per mile is settings which
have the potential for buried deposits. Shovel testing was not required in areas where ground surface
visibility (GSV) was greater than 30 percent, or areas with slopes greater than 20 percent, or which did not
exhibit potential for buried deposits. Shovel test pits are not excavated in areas with standing water, or in
areas in which underground utilities are present.
Shovel tests generally measure 30 cm in diameter and are excavated by digging to bedrock, a stratigraphic
deposit (e.g. subsoil) that was determined to be below Holocene aged deposits, or to 80-100 cm (dependent
on soil matrix consistency and hardness). All shovel test pit fill was passed through ¼ inch mesh screen or
gone through by hand if the soil would not pass through the screen. Shovel test pits were excavated in
arbitrary 10 cm levels unless stratigraphic changes were observed.
The cultural resources field investigation of the 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor exceeded the
minimum standards outlined by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ practices and procedures
(13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).
The Junction to Orla Pipeline will be bored under Salt Creek into bedrock by horizontal directional drilling.
Boring under Salt Creek into solid bedrock eliminates any potential impact to the creek, slopes, banks, and
canyon. Because of the depth of the canyon and the further depth of the bore below the creek, the bore entry
and exit points will be set back several hundred feet from either edge of the canyon, eliminating any impacts
to the banks of the creek and the adjacent uplands. As these areas will not be impacted by the proposed
project, no deep testing or mechanical trenching along Salt Creek was conducted. Additionally, the exposed
Pleistocene caliche and gypsiferous bedrock and surface gravels and cobbles of chert, quartzite, limestone,
and volcanic rocks in the area adjacent to Salt Creek demonstrates that subsurface testing would encounter
sediments and bedrock that predate human occupation.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Pre-field background research was conducted to determine if any cultural resources have been previously
recorded within the APE or within 1-mile of the APE of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO
lands. This research assists in determining the types of resources in the area and the probability of
encountering those resources during fieldwork. Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Cody Kiker to locate previously recorded archeological sites,
archeological surveys, NHRP properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, one
site, 41RV15, has been previously recorded within the APE. On September 21, 2019, Cody Kiker spoke
with Johnathan Jarvis, Associate Director and Senior Archeologist at TARL. Jonathan Jarvis reviewed the
Atlas and hard copy records on file at TARL and confirmed that site 41RV15 is mapped correctly and is
therefore crossed by the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline (Appendix A: Aerial Photography). An
additional seven sites, 41RV14, 41RV17, 41RV92, 41RV104, 41RV105, 41RV106, and 41RV167, have
been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE (Table 2). Only six of the eight sites, 41RV14, 41RV15,
41RV104, 41RV105, 41RV106, and 41RV167, have been recorded within 1-mile of the Junction to Orla
Pipeline APE on TGLO lands.

Site 41RV14 is a prehistoric open campsite recorded by Mark Sachrist in May 1985. The site measures
approximately 1,970 feet (600 m) north-south by 1,475 feet (450 m) east-west. The site contains 1,200+
groundstone, 1,000+ lithics, including flakes and flake tools, 100+ hearths, and an Archaic Period projectile
point. Material types included chert quartzite, chalcedony, rhyolite, andesite, and Alibates silicified
dolomite. Eleven shovel tests were excavated within the site, which recovered burned lithics to a depth of
only four inches (10 cm), due to the generally shallow soils. Due to the abundance of artifacts as well as
heath features, site 41RV14 was designated as a SAL and determined eligible for listing to the NRHP by
the SHPO in November 1986. Site 41RV14 is located approximately 600 feet (183 m) from the APE and
will not be impacted by construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV15 is a prehistoric lithic quarry/procurement site also recorded by Mark Sachrist in May 1985.
Lithics recorded included flakes, cores, hammerstones, and shatter of chert quartzite, chalcedony, rhyolite,
and andesite. No diagnostic artifacts were observed at the site. The site measures approximately 2.7 miles
(4.3 km) long east-west within the 200 feet (61 m) wide ROW corridor of the All American Pipeline during
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands

Page 10

the survey of which it was recorded. The site is not a continuous, dense scatter of lithics, but rather, a series
of concentrations of varying densities of lithics dispersed along the survey corridor. The lithics were more
densely concentrated in some areas, and more diffuse in others. The site most likely extends both north and
south of the survey corridor, however, it was not surveyed outside of the All American Pipeline ROW. As
evidenced by the gravels on the surface, soils are likely shallow within the site, though no shovel tests were
excavated. The site form states that the site is “deflated, eroded, not buried, has had multiple mechanized
disturbances, and has fair integrity.” The “SHPO Eligibility Determination” status of site 41RV15 is listed
as “undetermined” in both February 1998 and October 2003. On August 21, 2019, it was confirmed with
Johnathan Jarvis at TARL, based on a review of the online Atlas and hard copy records, that site 41RV15
is plotted correctly. Thus, the proposed Junction to Orla pipeline will cross a narrow 100 foot (30 m) wide
portion of site 41RV15. The 100 foot (30 m) wide portion of site 41RV15 will be impacted by mechanical
vegetation clearing, open-cut trenching, vehicle traffic, and related pipeline construction activities.
Site 41RV17 is a multi-component site which includes both a prehistoric open occupation as well as an
early to mid–20th century shepherd camp recorded by M. Miller in May 1985. The site measures
approximately 820 feet (250 m) east-west by 105 feet (32 m) north-south. The prehistoric open occupation
includes flakes of chert and chalcedony as well as a corner-notched projectile point. The early to mid–20th
century shepherd camp contains both structure remnants as well as a trash scatter. The shepherd camp
included three structures, made of native stone slabs, brick, cement, and lumber with wire nails, one of
which measures 26 feet (8 m) by 13 feet (4 m). The trash scatter included plain and decorated ceramics,
lard buckets, baking powder cans, coffee cans, porcelain, bottle glass, and window glass. No shovel tests
were excavated at site 41RV17, which was not assessed for NRHP eligibility. Site 41RV17 is located
approximately 1,950 feet (594 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the proposed
Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV92 is an early to mid–20th century road recorded by Prewitt and Associates in December 2015.
The length of the recorded portion of the road measures approximately 12,300 feet (3,750 m) long by 50
feet (15 m) wide and runs northwest-southeast. The road is depicted on 1936 Texas highway maps. The site
also included two abandoned power poles, cross-bars, and glass insulators left on the ground during a
previous replacement of the power line. The portion of site 41RV92 within the ROW corridor of the pipeline
during the survey of which it was recorded was determined not eligible for listing to the NRHP. Site
41RV92 is located approximately 5,250 feet (1,600 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by
construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV104 is a prehistoric lithic quarry/procurement site recorded by SWCA Environmental
Consultants in August and September 2016. Lithics recorded included flakes, edge-modified flakes, cores,
tested cobbles, and shatter of chert, quartzite, and limestone. No diagnostic artifacts were observed at the
site. The site measures approximately 165 feet (50 m) east-west within the 150 feet (45 m) wide ROW
corridor of the pipeline during the survey of which it was recorded. The site most likely extends both north
and south of the survey corridor as the site is situated with a wider area of outcrops of knappable stone. Six
shovel tests were excavated within the site, all of which were negative for buried cultural material. The
portion of site 41RV104 within the ROW corridor of the pipeline during the survey of which it was recorded
was determined not eligible for listing to the NRHP by the SHPO in October 2016. Site 41RV104 is located
approximately 1,000 feet (305 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the proposed
Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV105 is another prehistoric lithic quarry/procurement site recorded by SWCA Environmental
Consultants in August and September 2016. Lithics recorded included flakes, edge-modified flakes, cores,
tested cobbles, and shatter of chert, quartzite, and chalcedony. No diagnostic artifacts were observed at the
site. The site measures approximately 295 feet (90 m) east-west within the 150 feet (45 m) wide ROW
corridor of the pipeline during the survey of which it was recorded. The site most likely extends both north
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands

Page 11

and south of the survey corridor as the site is situated with a wider area of outcrops of knappable stone.
Seven shovel tests were excavated within the site, all of which were negative for buried cultural material.
The portion of site 41RV105 within the ROW corridor of the pipeline during the survey of which it was
recorded was determined not eligible for listing to the NRHP by the SHPO in October 2016. Site 41RV105
is located approximately 300 feet (91 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the
proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV106 is another, smaller prehistoric lithic quarry/procurement site recorded by SWCA
Environmental Consultants in August and September 2016. A total of 12 lithics were recorded at the site,
including one non-diagnostic biface, one uniface, one edge-modified flake and nine cores and tested cobbles
of chert, quartzite, and chalcedony. The site measures approximately 345 feet (105 m) east-west within the
150 feet (45 m) wide ROW corridor of the pipeline during the survey of which it was recorded. The site
most likely extends both north and south of the survey corridor as the site is situated with a wider area of
outcrops of knappable stone. Six shovel tests were excavated within the site, all of which were negative for
buried cultural material. The portion of site 41RV106 within the ROW corridor of the pipeline during the
survey of which it was recorded was determined not eligible for listing to the NRHP by the SHPO in
October 2016. Site 41RV106 is located approximately 630 feet (192 m) from the APE and will not be
impacted by construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Site 41RV167 is a prehistoric lithic scatter recorded by BGE, Inc. in June 2018. The site measures
approximately 100 by 100 feet (30 by 30 m) and includes two flakes and three shatter debris, all of chert.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed at the site. Shovel tests excavated at the site were negative for buried
cultural material. Site 41RV167 is recommended as not eligible for listing to the NRHP. Site 41RV167 is
located approximately 850 feet (259 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the
proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline.
Based on the Atlas one previously surveyed project is mapped within the APE and an additional three
projects are mapped within 1-mile of the APE. The proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline crosses the Orla Gas
Gathering System Pipeline that was surveyed by SWCA Environmental Consultants for Enterprise Texas
Pipeline in July 2016. Three projects surveyed within 1-mile of the Junction to Orla Pipeline APE include
the Orla Residual Gas Pipeline surveyed by SWCA Environmental Consultants for Enterprise Texas
Pipeline in April 2017, State of Texas (TGLO) Lands surveyed by Horizon Environmental Services for
Anadarko Petroleum in December 2017, and the West of Pecos Solar Project surveyed by Prewitt and
Associates for Energy Renewal Partners in November 2015 and January 2017.
The overall background research of the region suggests that the Junction to Orla Pipeline is located within
a larger area where climatic conditions, burrowing rodents, and the effects of ranching and oil and gas
exploration have each affected the cultural landscape leading to two types of general settings. Wind erosion
and extensive bioturbation from rodent burrowing, and sheep and cattle grazing have exposed the upper
surface of the landscape within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas. With the exception of a few
geomorphological locations, archeological sites of all ages may be located on the exposed ground surface
and/or were never buried (Hall 2006:2-7). The majority of archeological sites are located on eroded surfaces
and therefore lack vertical integrity and stratigraphy (Hall 2006:2-15). While intact archeological deposits
may be encountered where depositional processes, such as (a) colluvial; (b) eolian sand deposits associated
with the playa margins; (c) upland playa and lake fill deposits; and (d) within and adjacent to extant and/or
extinct draws and/or drainages of Late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Hall 2006:2-7, 2-11; Johnson
and Holliday 2004:285, 290, 294). Within the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline APE, eroded surfaces are
predominant, and many sites would be expected to be resting on the surface, or ephemerally exposed by
shifting sand dunes.

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline APE on TGLO lands was conducted April 9,
2019 by Cody Kiker and Chris Flowers. Fieldwork was conducted under the authority of TAC Permit No.
9013 and supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who meets U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Fieldwork was
conducted in accordance with the THC Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The cultural resources
survey APE on TGLO lands consists of the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 21.8
acres (8.8 hectares). The State of Texas lands includes two tracts. The northwest tract is irregularly-shaped
and crossed by Salt Creek and the southeast tract is square (Figures 3.1 and 3.2).
The weather was sunny with calm winds, temperatures were close to 70°F in the morning and up to 95°F
by mid-afternoon. Terrain within the APE on TGLO lands is gently sloped down from southeast to
northwest, towards Salt Creek (Figure 2). Soils within the APE on TGLO lands were generally gravelly to
very gravelly sandy loams and silty clay loams with abundant caliche (Figures 4-9). Vegetation was
dominated by creosote bush, tarbush, locust, cat claw acacia, and tasajillo cacti, as well as sparse, patchy
grasses. Other common, but less abundant vegetation included saltbush, althorn, Mormon tea, and alkali
sacaton (Figures 4-11). GSV throughout the APE was above 80 percent, and generally almost 100 percent
due to the abundant gravels (Figures 4-11). The entire APE on State of Texas land parallels existing
pipelines and 50 to 100 percent of the Junction to Orla Pipeline APE is within the disturbed ROW of the
parallel pipelines (Figures 3.1, 3.2, and 4-7). A total of 30 shovel tests were excavated within the Junction
to Orla Pipeline APE on State of Texas land, all of which were negative for buried cultural resources
(Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and Appendix A: Aerial Photography).
The vicinity of site 41RV15 was inspected and two shovel tests were excavated in the area during the
cultural resources survey (Figure 3.2: ST18 and ST19, Appendix A). No artifacts were observed on the
surface or recovered from either shovel test. However, the site was only surveyed within the APE of the
proposed Junction to Orla pipeline. The site has likely been disturbed by construction of the All American
Pipeline as well as multiple other adjacent parallel pipelines (Figure 3.2 and Appendix A: Aerial
Photography). Additionally, as noted in the previous paragraph the construction corridor of the proposed
Junction to Orla Pipeline in this area was fully to partially within the disturbed ROW of existing parallel
pipelines. These more recent pipelines are not visible on aerial imagery but are visible in photographs
(Figures 4-9 and 14).
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline did not result in finding any prehistoric or
historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites over 50 years of age within the APE on TGLO lands.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline south and west of Orla, Texas in Reeves
and Culberson Counties, Texas. The portion of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands is
approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km) in length and is depicted on the USGS Orla, Tex. (1968) and Screw Bean
Draw East, Tex. (1973) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle maps. The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15.24
m) wide permanent pipeline ROW and an additional 50 foot (15.24 m) wide temporary workspace corridor.
The cultural resources survey APE consists of the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling
21.8 acres (8.8 hectares).
The cultural resources intensive field survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 TAC
and the intensive field survey of the TGLO lands was completed under TAC Permit No. 9013.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Cody Kiker to locate previously recorded
archeological sites, archeological surveys, NRHP properties, and SALs. Based on the Atlas, one site,
41RV15, has been previously recorded within the APE and will be impacted by construction of the proposed
Junction to Orla Pipeline. Site 41RV15 was for reviewed for NRHP eligibility twice by the Texas SHPO
and its status is listed as undetermined. An additional seven sites, 41RV14, 41RV17, 41RV92, 41RV104,
41RV105, 41RV106, and 41RV167, have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE. Site 41RV14
is designated as a SAL and was determined eligible for listing to the NRHP. However, site 41RV14 is
located approximately 600 feet (183 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the
proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline. The remaining sites were either not assessed for NRHP eligibility or
were determined ineligible for listing to the NRHP and all are located at least 300 feet (91 m) from the
APE. Only six of the eight sites, 41RV14, 41RV15, 41RV104, 41RV105, 41RV106, and 41RV167, have
been recorded within 1-mile of the Junction to Orla Pipeline APE on TGLO lands.
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands was conducted April 9, 2019
by Cody Kiker and Christopher Flowers. All aspects of the project were supervised by Gary D. Edington,
an ENERCON archeologist who meets U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards
for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the THC
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
Site 41RV15 was revisited during the cultural resources survey, but only within the 100 foot (30 m) wide
proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline ROW. No artifacts were encountered within the APE or within two
shovel tests excavated within the APE at the site.
The cultural resources survey of the Junction to Orla Pipeline did not result in finding any prehistoric or
historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites over 50 years of age within the ROW on TGLO lands.
Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Junction to Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands
will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a
SAL. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to construction of the Junction to
Orla Pipeline on TGLO lands. If cultural material, including sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old
or older are encountered within the ROW on TGLO lands during construction of Junction to Orla Pipeline,
work in the area must cease and the regional THC Archeologist must be notified immediately.
