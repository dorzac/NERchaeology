ABSTRACT
In January 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of a 30 hectare (75 acre) property for Andy
Gardner in Nacogdoches County northeast of Appleby, Texas. The pedestrian survey
was conducted with a combination of visual examination and shovel testing. A total of
85 shovel tests were excavated across upland ridges, toe slopes, and the Crawford Creek
and Mud Creek floodplains. Three sites, 41NA311, 41NA312, and 41NA313 were
documented through shovel testing. Site 41NA311 was recorded as a multi-component
Archaic/Caddoan site with the potential for buried intact features. Sites 41NS312 and
41NA313 were recorded as small artifact scatters on the toe slopes of a steep upland
ridge. Site 41NA311 should be avoided by the proposed development. No further
investigations are recommended for 41NA312 and 41nA313; however, if any cultural
material is recovered during clearing, than excavation should stop and a qualified
archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting concurrence with
the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project
area provided 41NA311 is avoided.

INTRODUCTION

In January 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed 30 hectare (75 acre) Gardner property in
Nacogdoches County, Texas (Figure 1). Proposed developments include logging the area
then turning it into a cattle pasture. The survey was conducted under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act as part of the terms and conditions of receiving a
federal loan thru the Farm Service Agency. The report was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission.

The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources
within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications
requested by the THC (Martin 1999). Three archaeological sites, 41NA311, 41NA312,
and 41NA313, were found during the survey. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends
41NA311 be avoided because the site potently contains stratified cultural deposits from
the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.

DETAC requests concurrence with a

determination of “no effect” to cultural resources for 41NA312, and 41NA313 and that
the project may proceed providing 41NA311 is avoided.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA

The project included approximately 30 hectares (75 acres) roughly 3 kilometers (1.9
miles) northeast of Appleby, Texas. The Gardner project area includes the flood plains of
Crawford and Mud Creek along with adjacent slopes and uplands. Project area
boundaries were delineated by existing fence line, flagging tape, and logging marked
trees at the time of the survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY

Overall, Nacogdoches County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both
larger examinations and numerous small surveys. A majority of these investigations in
the City of Nacogdoches were in connection with public utilities. Examples of these
investigations include sewer replacement and construction lines (Murin 1998; Galan
2001; Galan 2002). The surveys that have successfully documented archaeological sites
were conducted along larger streams with well developed floodplains where the toe
slopes and shoulders of the adjacent ridges were not previously impacted by
development. Corbin (1986) of the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology
Department conducted a survey and assessment of archaeological sites in the city limits.
Many of the sites recorded along the La Nanna Creek floodplain during Corbin’s survey
were found along tow slopes and ridges overlooking the creek floodplain similar to those
found in 1972 (Prewitt et al. 2000) along Bayou Loco for the Lake Nacogdoches survey.
Closer to the project area, Perttula (2000, 2002) conducted a survey and testing
investigations for Lake Naconiche. This survey documented 61 archaeological sites in a
508 ha. (1254 acre) area along the Naconiche floodplain and adjacent uplands. The
testing excavations focused on 10 of the sites and found an intact Late Caddoan midden,
carbon datable material from other sites, and a sample of ceramic sherds, bone, and other
artifacts.

In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission,
Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion
of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several
historic contexts, each of which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas
prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the current state of archaeological research in
the region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and
cultural resources management. Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the

3

region are identified in these studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns
and subsistence, and historic continuities are some of the general research directions that
these recent studies emphasize as important for developing future archaeological research
designs.

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D.
800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro
American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca.
10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that
consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200
B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of east
Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 8001600).

This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the

Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates
of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and
cemeteries found in association with large mounds.

A stratified social structure

developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975).
Extensive commercial networks were also established. The Historic period (1680present) describes both the history behind the current cultural setting of the area and
marks a transition from the native populations domination of the area, to the European
immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. Today, the area remains largely
agricultural and produces crops including cotton, corn, hay and vegetables. Beef and
dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised. The timber and oil industries currently play
a prominent role in the area’s commercial enterprises (THA 2008).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.

The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. Newly recorded sites were delineated vertically
and horizontally with shovel testing. The data was used to determine each site’s integrity
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using
maps and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009). The site location maps and cultural resources
records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites
within or in close proximity to the project area. The Site Atlas was consulted for
published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.

DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys.
According to these guidelines, project areas between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11 and 100
acres) require a minimum of one shovel test per 0.8 ha (2 acre); therefore, a minimum of
38 shovel tests were required for the 30 ha. (75 ac.) area. Shovel testing included

5

excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels
down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened
through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil texture, and color of
each shovel test were recorded with a GPS position.

RESULTS

The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009) has six sites recorded within 1.5 miles
(2.4km) of the project area (41NA229, 234, 235, 266, 240, and 281) (Nelson 1999)
during the survey for Lake Naconiche. All of these sites were recorded as prehistoric
occupations with Archaic and Caddoan components. Site 41NA235 was described as a
th

th

“discreet 15 or 16 century late Caddoan settlement, probably a farmstead or single
house hold based on its small size” (Perttula 2002). Site 41NA236 was described as
having “research potential to inform on the pre-history of North East Texas because it has
an intact and well preserved late Caddoan period midden deposit along with cultural
deposits above and below the midden” (Perttula 2002).

Soils in the project area were described as Briley loamy fine sand and Sacul fine sandy
loam on uplands, Darco loamy fine sand and Tenaha loamy fine sand between uplands
and terraces, and Marietta soils in the flood plain (NRCS 2009).

Briley soils are

described as 58 cm (23 inches) of loamy fine sand over sandy clay loam. These soils are
loamy residuum weathered from sandstone or shale. This soil is found mostly in the
upland ridges near the eastern most portion of the project area. Darco soils are described
as 120 cm (48 inches) of loamy fine sand over a sandy clay loam. These soils are found
mostly on the side slopes near the flood plains in the eastern portion of the project area.
Marietta soils are described as 30 cm (12 inches) of fine sandy loam over a sandy clay
loam. This soil is frequently flooded and covers most of the project area. Sacul soils are
described as 50cm (20 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay. This soil is a clayey
residuum weathered from sandstone or shale and is found mostly on side slopes. Tenaha
soils are described as 46 cm (116 inches) of loamy fine sand and sandy clay loam over
clay. This soil is also found mostly on side slopes.

The pedestrian survey found the Gardner project area divided into eastern and western
sections by Mud Creek and an existing railroad track paralleling Mud Creek. The western
half of the project area is dominated by the flood plain of Crawford Creek with upland
toe slopes to the north while the eastern half is dominated by Mud Creek east of the
railroad with an upland ridge to the east. Bottomlands on both sides of the railroad are
frequently flooded with wetland species of plants and trees throughout. The adjacent
slopes and uplands varied from gentle slopes north and west with steeper slopes prevalent
on the east end of the property. Vegetation in upland areas consisted of mixed pine and
hardwood trees with moderate understory and dense leaf litter. A total of 85 shovel test
were excavated across the property focusing on the uplands and toe slopes (Figure 2).
The floodplain was saturated between Crawford Creek and Mud Creek.

Visual

examination found the area level and in ankle-deep water. Shovel testing found soil
conditions similar to the soil survey with varying depths of sandy loam over clay. Shovel
test results are presented in Appendix A. Three cultural resources were found within the
project area boundaries: 41NA311, 41NA312, and 41NA313 described below.

The

artifact analysis for each site is presented in Appendix B.

41NA311
Site 41NA311 is a multiple component, Archaic and Caddoan campsite or farmstead,
containing lithic and ceramic artifacts along with bone fragments (Figure 3). The site is
situated on a sandy bench overlooking the Crawford Creek floodplain. A tributary creek
channel defines the southern border of the landform. The northern portion of the site is
bordered by an existing pipeline and the eastern side is defined by the property line. The
western edge slopes to a seasonal drainage. The slope, while gentle, suggests the site is
limited to the summit of the landform. In general, the soils at the site are very deep sandy
loam up to 100+ cm deep on the summit and shallower down slope. Basal clays were not
encountered in any of the shovel tests excavated on the summit. Soils at the site are
described as Tenaha loamy fine sand (NRCS 2009). Vegetation includes mixed pine,
various hardwood trees and shrubs with dense leaf litter.

Seventeen shovel tests were excavated across the landform to delineate the site’s
boundaries. Of these, 10 shovel tests were positive yielding 111 artifacts (Figure 4). Of
the recovered artifacts, 53 were lithic debitage to include chert, ironstone, quatzite, and
petrifed wood materials. Tools include 2 dart points one Morrill (Turner and Hester
1984:129; Suhm and Jelks 1964:223) and one Kent-like stem (Turner and Hester
1984:110)), 1 knife, 1 graver, and 1 Clifton-like arrow point (Turner and Hester
1984:169). Lithic artifacts were found in levels 2 through 8 (10 to 80 cmbs). A total of
42 ceramic sherds (5 rim, 6 brushed, 2 punctate, 5 incised). The majority of ceramic
sherds were found between 20 and 40 cmbs.

A total of 16 bone fragments were also

recovered. All of the bone fragments were non-human mammal bones based on the less
porous exterior surfaces and absence of trabecula on interior surfaces.

Most have

evidence of burning.

The deep sandy matrix on an elevated landform suggest the site may have intact buried
features. Shovel testing could not confirm or denie if the site was stratified; but the
presence of ceramics in the upper 40 cmbs and lithic debitage and tools to 80 cmbs is
promising. This site may be an intact multi-component site with Archaic and Caddo
intact features. Avoidance is recommended.
41NA312
This site is a Caddoan artifact scatter containing lithic debitage and a single ceramic
sherd. The site is located on a small bench near the toe slope of an upland ridge
overlooking the Mud Creek floodplain (Figure 4). A marshy area with a small stream
channel defines the northwestern border of the landform. The eastern limit of the site is a
steep slope. In general, the soils at the site are very deep sands between 90 and 100 cm
deep. Soil at the site is described as Darco loamy fine sand (NRCS 2009). Vegetation is
mature mixed hardwood and pine forest with dense ground cover.

Eleven shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site boundaries in the more level
areas of the slope. Tests closer to the floodplain contained redox features while those

upslope were more homogenous sand. Of the 11 tests, 5 were positive yielding 7 chert
flakes, 1 petrified wood flake and 1 plain bone tempered sherd between 30 and 90 cmbs.

The limited size and diversity of artifacts scattered throughout the soil column suggests
41NA312 is a small artifact scatter and may be a remnant of a larger site. Shovel testing
upslope found no cultural material. No further work is recommended for 41NA312.
41NA313
This site is a lithic artifact scatter toe slope of a narrow upland ridge. The ridge is
defined by two intermittent drainages flowing westward into Mud Creek (Figure 5). The
eastern limit of the site is a steep slope. In general, soils on the site are very deep sands
100+ cm in depth. Basal clays were not encountered in any of the shovel tests excavated.
Soil at the site is described as Darco loamy fine sand (NRCS 2009). Vegetation is mature
mixed hardwood and pine forest with dense ground cover.

Eleven shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site boundaries. Of the 11 tests, 4
were positive yielding 4 chert flakes and 3 quartzite flakes. Artifacts were recovered
from 10 to 80 cmbs.

The limited size of the landform and quantity, diversity, and stratigraphic integrity of
artifacts is not indicative of a site worth nomination to the NRHP. No further work is
recommended for 41NA313.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Gardner property is situated near the confluence of two named creeks and adjacent to
a larger creek floodplain. Project plans include logging the property and converting the
floodplain to cattle pasture. The cultural resource survey was conducted in order to
locate, describe, and document any cultural resources within the proposed project area. A
thorough visual examination and shovel testing found three previously undocumented
cultural resources, 41NA311, 41NA312, and 41NA313. Site 41NA311 has potential to
contain stratified cultural deposits on an isolated landform.

Artifacts suggest both

Archaic and Caddoan occupations. Sites 41NA312 and 41NA313 are small artifact
scatters on the toe slope of large steep ridges. Shovel testing up-slope could not find any
artifacts from a larger site. Neither 41NA312 nor 41NA313 is potentially eligible for
NRHP nomination. No further work is recommended for either site.

In conclusion, DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed clearing of the Gardner property with the
exception that 41NA311 be avoided.
