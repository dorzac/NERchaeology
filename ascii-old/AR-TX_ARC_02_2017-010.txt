ABSTRACT
Atmos Energy Corporation is planning to construct the 4.5-mile-long DT3 Irving
Wildwood Pipeline in portions of the Elm Fork floodplain northeast of SH114
along Tom Braniff/Wildwood Road and Northwest Highway in Dallas County,
Texas. Pipeline construction will consist of a mixture of open cut trenching down
to a maximum depth of 10 ft and boring to depths of 25-40 ft below the present
ground surface. Much of the pipeline will be installed in wide, existing right-ofways along major roadways in the area. ARC proposed to survey only those areas
that appear not to have been previously disturbed in floodplain settings, the
location of site 41DL236, and along a 162-m portion of the route that passes
within 100 ft of the western boundary of site 41DL235 along Las Colinas Blvd. It
was hypothesized that there was a high potential for identifying prehistoric
cultural resources in those locations. ARC surveyed these high potential areas on
February 8, 2017. A total of five shovel tests were excavated and 8.9 acres were
surveyed. The shovel tests were negative and no cultural resources were identified
on the surface. Additionally, no evidence of 41DL236 was discovered on the
surface and the location of the site has been heavily disturbed by road
construction and maintenance. ARC recommends that the site is not eligible
within the survey corridor. Given the results of this survey, ARC recommends
that further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary for this project, and
requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this recommendation.
Project documents will be curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas
State University, San Marcos.

INTRODUCTION
Atmos Energy Corporation is planning to construct the 4.5-mile-long DT3 Irving Wildwood
Pipeline in portions of the Elm Fork floodplain northeast of SH114 along Tom
Braniff/Wildwood Road in L.B. Houston Park and Northwest Highway in Dallas County, Texas.
An additional line along Las Colinas Blvd. will link into the main line at the intersection of Las
Colinas Blvd. and Northwest Highway. Approximately 2.6 miles of the line installation will be
open-cut trenched and the rest will be bored (Figure 1). On November 4, 2016, ARC conducted a
cultural resources evaluation of the proposed route and found that much of the route (including
both boring and open-cut trenching locations) have low potential for cultural resources since they
are within wide, well-established ROWs. The open-cut trenching will occur to a maximum depth
of 10 ft below the surface. In all but one of the locations where open-cut trenching is to occur,
the trenches will be dug in existing ROWs that have been disturbed by previous utility line
installation and/or road construction.
ARC proposed to survey only those areas that appear not to have been previously disturbed in
floodplain settings and along a 162-m portion of the route that passes within 100 ft of the
western boundary of site 41DL235 along Las Colinas Blvd., even though the area appeared to be
heavily disturbed by road construction and urban development (Figure 1). The floodplain
settings included high potential area 1 (HPA1) which was a 980 m long segment on the east side
of Wildwood Road and included the location of 41DL236 at its north end. HPA2 was a 22-mlong segment at the northern end of the route running perpendicular to Colwell Blvd. This
segment was originally meant to be trenched, but prior to survey, coordination with Texas811
and Atmos indicated that Atmos had a high-pressure line in this location. Trenching did not
ultimately occur along this segment, but it was surveyed. HPA3 was the segment passing
41DL235. Along HPA1 the pipeline will be bored and pass more than 25 feet below the surface,
well below depths of archaeological concern. The bored pipeline will pass up to 36 feet below
the mapped location of 41DL236. Line-of-sight clearing will take place along HPA1 in a 30-ftwide corridor. Clearing will be done by hand and should not make significant ground
disturbance. Halff Associates, Inc., which is handling the environmental permitting for the
project, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct archaeological survey of the
proposed pipeline project. ARC surveyed approximately 8.9 acres of high potential areas on
February 9, 2017.
The cultural resource investigation was required because L.B. Houston Park is a property of the
City of Dallas and the City of Dallas is a state entity. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7892 was
issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission will review this report on behalf of the State. Relevant federal legislation
includes the Section 404 Permit under the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 âProtection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environmen,â and
Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is in the Northern Blackland Prairies ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007:40-41).
Historically, this region has been comprised of large expanses of grassland, with wooded areas in
stream bottoms. KÃ¼chler (1964) classified the prairie as being dominated by Andropogon-Sipa
grasses, while stream bottoms were wooded with big trees such as oak, ash, cottonwood, and
pecan trees. However, a transition from ranching to farming in the late 19th century saw an end to
most of these tallgrass prairie communities as they were converted to croplands and non-native
pastures. Due to expanding urban and suburban uses, the prairie environment continues to be one
of low biotic diversity and covers less and less acreage. The Blackland Prairies that once
supported bison, pronghorns, wolves, and greater prairie chickens, now have little habitat to
support a diversity of wildlife (Griffith et al. 2007). The study area is in the floodplain and
terraces of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. The route crosses the Elm Fork twice as well as
crossing Cottonwood Branch once.
Most of the study area is located on Quaternary alluvium and terrace deposits associated with the
Elm Fork floodplain, but the southernmost portion of the area is underlain by the Cretaceousaged Eagle Ford Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Several soils overlie these
geological formations, but the most relevant are the frequently or occasionally flooded Trinity
and Ovan clays (Coffee et al. 1980: Sheets 16 and 23). The Trinity clays feature approximately
6-16 inches of very dark gray clay underlain by up to 60 inches of very hard, very dark gray to
dark olive gray clay. The Ovan clay features 6-25 inches of grayish brown clay underlain by up
to 65 inches of grayish brown clay with dark reddish to faint brown mottles.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The archaeological literature lacks a definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity
River Basin and North Central Texas. However, for the purposes of this report, a prehistoric
chronology for North Central Texas, based on Prikryl (1990) with an added historic period and a
divided Late Prehistoric, is presented below to provide the reader with a temporal framework for
the cultural history of the region.
Historic European
Protohistoric
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Archaic
Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800 [Historic Native American]
A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1700
A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200
6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points and radiocarbon dated site
deposits at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring
2001). These early people hunted now-extinct large game and foraged off the land. Evidence of
Paleo-Indian occupation in the Upper Trinity River is generally limited to surface finds of
Clovis, Dalton, Plainview, Midland, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff projectile point types (Prikryl
1990). The most common types found are Plainview and Dalton, suggesting that this region may
have been a cultural hinterland used by both the western Plainview culture and eastern Dalton
culture (Byers 2003). These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm
Fork area most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain
(1990:19). Currently, six Clovis points have been reported in Dallas County, and more have been
found in surrounding counties (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-70).
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from as early as about 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late
as A.D. 700. Archaic populations lived throughout North Central Texas, but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they could hunt and gather foods and resources. Dart
points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are artifacts commonly found at Archaic
sites across the state. The earliest Archaic populations continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics, Uvalde
Gravels, for chipped stone tools. Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges
that overlook the Trinity River and its various tributaries. Smaller lithic scatters have been
recorded in upland areas throughout the area.
Prikryl (1990) divides the Late Prehistoric into two phases for this region (at ca. 1200 A.D.)
based on projectile point types and changes in raw material frequencies. Late Prehistoric I is
generally represented by heat-treated quartzite and expanding-stemmed arrow points, such as
Scallorn and Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an
increase in buffalo bones in deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Late Prehistoric II saw an
increased use of chert, suggesting an increase of mobility or the expansion of trade networks.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF DT3 IRVING WILDWOOD PIPELINE

During the Late Prehistoric, bison-hunting appears to have become the dominant subsistence
strategy. There is a marked Plains influence on lithic tool assemblages found in North Central
Texas dating to this period, with projectile points, scrapers, knives, and drills present here that
are seen throughout the Southern Plains (Prikryl 1990:80).
There is very little evidence of protohistoric era Native American occupation in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. At
the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general abandonment of the
North Central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade goods that might have been
obtained from French, Spanish, or English traders (Skinner 1988). This interpretation is tied to a
perceived general drying trend and attempts to factor in negative information generated by
professional and avocational archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys
throughout the region.
Anglo-American settlers in the early 1800s were the first non-natives to settle in North Central
Texas. Though, beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, indigenous inhabitants
continued to maintain a presence in the region. Anglo settler John Neely Bryan first occupied
Dallas County in 1841 on the bluff of the Three Forks to the Trinity River. This early settlement
attracted other settlers who arrived to receive land grants or to join established colonies within
the area. Many settlers came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only
160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). Many of the
families that obtained land through these grants maintained and farmed their land well into the
mid-twentieth century.
The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Regardless, Dallas County continued to grow and prosper
after the war. The primary industries throughout Dallas County were agricultural until the
twentieth century, which was replaced by manufacturing soon after the Great Depression.
Defense factories built near Grand Prairie for the development of goods for World War II
attracted those seeking work from rural areas. From the 1940s onward, many factories in Dallas
and Tarrant Counties continued to turn out a wide variety of products, including airplanes,
helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics. Along with the increase of manufacturing
was a rapid rise in the population of Dallas, Fort Worth, and the surrounding communities.
Between 1950 and 1990, Dallas County has tripled in population to almost two million residents
(Maxwell 2010). Today the Dallas area continues to grow along with the rest of North Central
Texas.
Previous Investigations
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2017) located several archaeological sites, but
no cemeteries, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, or State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) within a 1-mi radius of the project area. Recorded sites include 41DL20,
41DL32, 41DL35, 41DL215, 41DL230-232, 41DL236, 41DL244, and 41DL383, and are located
primarily in the Elm Fork floodplain or on terraces overlooking the floodplain. These sites
generally consist of lithic scatters exposed by ground disturbance, but there is evidence of shell
middens and possible burials at 41DL20 and shell middens are recorded at 41DL231-232. Those

three sites are in the western floodplain of the Elm Fork (TASA 2017). Site 41DL233 is located
on an upland ridge overlooking the north side of Cottonwood Branch. The route intersects
41DL236 which was exposed by the construction of Wildwood Drive in L.B. Houston Park in
1971. Some flakes and unidentified points were identified in and collected from the road cut. The
extent of the site was undetermined and no boundaries were drawn.
Previous archaeological surveys have been conducted within the same search radius, with some
overlapping the current project area. The most relevant of those surveys are those that intersect
or are with half a mile of the proposed route. In 1998, ARC surveyed a wetland mitigation area
between Loop 12 and Tom Braniff Drive on the south side of the Elm Fork. The survey included
several trenches up to 23.7 m in length that exposed up to 1.5 m deep profiles in the Elm Fork
floodplain. None of the trenches were positive for prehistoric resources, nor did they expose any
buried paleosols. In 2001, ARC surveyed a 133-acre tract bisected by Tom Braniff Drive on the
south side of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River for the University of Dallas (Kent et al. 2001). In
2004, Geo-Marine, Inc. surveyed W. Northwest Highway between the Elm Fork and
Cottonwood Branch for TxDOT (TASA 2017). The study area of a 2009 survey included the
current project area in L.B. Houston Park as part of its reconnaissance (Davis et al. 2009). The
study area was scouted for the best possible locales for trench excavation. The portion of the
study area where the current project area is located was removed from consideration because
surface disturbance in that part of the study area was to be minimal (Davis et al. 2009:19). It was
also observed that much of the area along Wildwood Drive was inundated at the time. Trenching
was ultimately conducted in an area to the northeast of the current project area. No sites were
found and recorded in the surveys discussed above. However, the Elm Fork floodplain has been
the location of the discovery of many prehistoric archaeological sites. The Dallas Archeological
Society (DAS) has done considerable survey along the Elm Fork and recorded several sites
(Prikryl 1990). Survey conducted through UT-Arlington recorded 35 prehistoric sites along the
Elm Fork as part of reconnaissance associated with the potential construction of levees in the
floodplain (Hays et al. 1972). The floodplain of the Elm Fork was designated as having a high
probability for containing prehistoric sites (Kent et al. 2001; Skinner et al. 1978). One other
relevant project was the testing project at the Hackberry Creek Archaeological Site (41DL383)
near the confluence of the Elm Fork and channelized Hackberry Creek (Skinner and Ferring
1998). Testing at the Late Archaic site included ten trenches and several test units. Though 2,400
artifacts, including a burial, were recovered at the site, most the deposit was either discovered on
the surface and near surface.
The 1959 Irving and Carrolton, TX 7.5â USGS topographic maps, the 1936 and 1961 general
highway maps for Dallas County, and the 1920 Dallas County Soil Map were examined to search
for structures mapped within the project area. No structures were mapped along the proposed
pipeline route. Current aerial photography reveals a continued absence of structures to the
present day. However, the route does parallel some roadways that have been mapped in the area
since as early as 1920.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF DT3 IRVING WILDWOOD PIPELINE

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. The first is that
there is high potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological sites within undisturbed
floodplain settings. Previous investigations in the floodplain of the Elm Fork have identified
many prehistoric sites, many which are deeply buried, in the last 40+ years. Sites are likely to be
temporary camp sites and/or shell middens buried under 60 to 70 cm of alluvium. Additionally, a
segment of the proposed pipeline passes within 100 ft. of the western boundary of site 41DL235
and another segment passes through the location of site 41DL236. Both sites are prehistoric. The
second hypothesis was that it is unlikely that historic cultural resources would be found in the
floodplain as no structures were identified within the project area on historic maps or aerials and
because it is unlikely that such structures would be in a floodplain setting. It is possible that trash
scatters or isolated artifacts may be encountered, in part because of the project areaâs location
along roadways that have been mapped in the area for more than 50 years.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field
personnel walked the HPAs within a 30-meter survey corridor where merited. Shovel tests were
placed every 100 m where ground visibility was less than 30-percent and the ground surface was
not heavily disturbed. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill was inspected
visually and broken into smaller chunks to determine if cultural materials were present. Shovel
test matrices were described based on composition, texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color
Chart (2010) was used to identify soil colors. The authors made notes about the ground exposure,
drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken
during the survey using a 16-megapixel, digital camera. Shovel test and project boundary
locations were marked with a handheld Garmin GPSmap64st receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project areaâs natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Conclusions derived from the survey close the
chapter. Shovel tests are described generally throughout the text and detailed in Table 1 at the
end of the survey results.
Survey Results
Prior to survey, three high potential areas for prehistoric cultural resources were identified
through previous research in the area and minimal surface disturbance on aerial photographs
(Figure 2). The first high potential area (HPA1) surveyed was a 980 m long segment along the
east side of Wildwood Road. A total of five shovel tests were excavated in HPA1. Survey began
at the southern end of the proposed route and proceeded north, terminating at the recorded
location of 41DL236. The beginning of the route, located on the north bank of the Elm Fork, was
heavily eroded with a sandy surface from recent flooding events (Figure 3). Even though ground
visibility was greater than 30-percent in this location, a shovel test (ST1) was excavated due to
proximity to the river. Moving north, the natural topography gently rises from the river bank into
a wooded area. In parts of the woods that are slightly elevated, leaves cover the ground making
ground visibility 0- to 10-percent. In areas with slightly lower elevation, the ground is either
inundated or recently inundated. The recently inundated areas have ground visibility ranging
from 40- to 70-percent. Vegetation in the wooded areas consisted of a mix of old and new
growth forest and some invasive underbrush including greenbriar (Figure 4). The route continues
through the parking lot of LB Houston Park and then back into a wooded area.
At the north border of LB Houston Park, the route exits the wooded area and follows closely
along the eastern ROW of Wildwood Road. Much of this part of the route is inundated and/or
eroded. It is also disturbed in some locations from road construction and maintenance (Figure 5).
There is a lot of evidence of modern garbage dumping along Wildwood Road and in LB Houston
Park, but no evidence of historic artifacts were identified on the surface. There was no evidence
of site 41DL236 within the survey corridor (Figure 6). No shovel tests were excavated at the
marked location of the site because ground visibility was greater than 30-percent and the
centerline of the route was within the ROW of Wildwood Drive which has been disturbed by
road construction and maintenance. The trinomial for 41DL236 is located on Wildwood Drive.
Its initial discovery was associated with the construction of Wildwood Drive in 1971. In the
ensuing years, Wildwood Drive has been improved and its associated ROW houses many
underground utility lines. The trinomial for the site is located on the road and the survey corridor
lies within the disturbed ROW. Given the lack of evidence for the site, ARC recommends that
the site is not eligible for NRHP or SAL within the survey corridor. Should ground disturbing
activity occur outside of the survey corridor to the east or west, work should be done to
determine whether evidence of the site exists in those locations.
Shovel tests (STs) 2-5 revealed a similar soil profile consisting of a 30-50 cm thick layer of dark
to very dark grayish brown clay underlain by brown to dark yellowish brown clay. ST3
terminated with a layer of mottled light olive brown and strong brown clay. ST5 was terminated
due to inundation after 30 cm. ST1 revealed an 18 cm thick top layer of light yellowish brown

sand underlain by 82 cm of dark grayish brown clay. All the shovel tests were negative and no
cultural resources were encountered on the surface.
HPAs 2 and 3 were visited, but ground disturbance in both locations precluded shovel testing.
HPA2 was a 162 m segment that passes within 100 m of site 41DL235. Aerial photos of the area
indicated that the segment passed through a heavily disturbed area but part of it was an open
grass field/parking area. When the segment was visited during fieldwork there was a major
construction project occurring along the segment (Figure 7). Additionally, site 41DL235 was
located on a hilltop topographic feature when it was first discovered. There is no current
evidence of this hilltop at the location of 41DL235 anymore. It has been leveled and graded.
HPA3 was visited despite the knowledge that no excavation could occur there due to the
presence of a high-pressure line below the surface. The entire survey corridor was flagged
indicating the presence of the high-pressure line and much of the corridor is located along an
artificial levee (Figure 8).

Conclusions
No archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the survey. This was
predicted regarding historic cultural resources due to the absence of mapped structures. Though
it was predicted in the Research Design of this document that prehistoric sites may be found in
the floodplains of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and Hackberry Creek, none were discovered
within the survey corridor either due to existing disturbance or because shovel testing below 100
cmbs was necessary given the scope of the proposed construction project. Additionally, no
evidence of site 41DL236 was identified on the surface and the segment that passes near the
boundary of 41DL235 was entirely under commercial development.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
along the proposed DT3 Irving Wildwood Pipeline route in Dallas County, Texas. No
archaeological sites were recorded. Additionally, no evidence of site 41DL236 was discovered
within the survey corridor. ARC recommends that 41DL236 is ineligible for NRHP and/or SAL
listing within the survey corridor. However, if ground disturbing activity is to occur outside the
survey corridor to the east or west, a professional archaeologist should assess those areas to
determine whether evidence for the site exists in those locations. AR Consultants, Inc. concludes
that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted within the proposed project area and
recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this assessment. However, if
buried cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
