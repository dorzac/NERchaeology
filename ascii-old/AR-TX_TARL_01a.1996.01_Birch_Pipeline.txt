ABSTRACT
A survey for cultural resources was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 1588 on
22 September, 1995, at Lake Fork Reservoir, in Wood County, Texas, within the two termini of
the proposed route of the Birch pipeline connection and consisted of 100% pedestrian survey
combined with a series of shovel tests. A limited number of twentieth century artifacts was
recovered in the "south landing." These materials are clearly modem (post-1940) and occurred
only in the uppermost 20-30 cm, well within the highly disturbed plow zone. No other cultural
resources were identified either in the surface examination or the subsurface sampling. No further
archeological investigation is indicated in the surveyed areas.

INTRODUCTION

A survey for cultural resources was conducted by staff of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number 1588 on 22 September,
1995, at Lake Fork Reservoir, in Wood County, Texas. The survey was performed for the firm
of Trident NGL, Inc. and the Sabine River Authority in anticipation of construction of a
petroleum pipeline across the bottom of Lake Fork Reservoir (Figure 1). The investigations
reported below were conducted within the two termini of the proposed route of the project,
referred to hereafter as the "north landing" and "south landing." These rights of way (ROW)
measured 50 ft wide by 50 ft long for the former, and 50 ft wide by 425 ft long for the latter.
Both areas had originally been covered with trees and dense brush although the south landing had
been partially cleared in preparation for the project. The south landing had been under cultivation
at some time in the past. Work conducted consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey of both landings
and a series of four shovel tests placed in the north landing, and nine in the south landing. In
addition, five sections along the cut face of the beach at the south landing were cleaned and
examined. The fieldwork was performed by W. David Driver and Keith L. Prilliman.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located near the west border of Wood County, within the Northeast
Texas Archaeological Region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This area is part of the West Gulf
Coast Plain. Soils within the upland areas examined by the project are primarily WoodtellFreestone. These sandy soils are acidic and well drained but slowly permeable, with slopes of 2
to 12% (Bruseth et al. 1977).
The area lies within the ecotonal region of the Blackland Prairie located to the west and
the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest located to the east. In response to the effects of extensive modem
disturbance, Bruseth and Perttula (1981) subdivided the Lake Fork area into two biotic
communities. The current project area lies mostly within their upland community (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981:7). This is described in terms of a savannah environment and is characterized by
an overstory of tall trees with the understory consisting of grasses.
Extensive previous research in the area was conducted b'y Southern Methodist University
during the mid to late 1970s in preparation for construction of the Lake Fork Reservoir dam and
resulting inundation of the reservoir area (Bruseth et al. 1977; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula
and Bruseth 1983). A total of 130 sites was located during the initial investigation. Nine of these
were extensively tested, producing a detailed cultural history and model for associated spatial and
adaptive change for the area. Although the route of the Birch Pipeline Connection Project does
pass near one site (41 WD446) and cross through another (41WD447) within the lake itself, neither
had been recommended for further work. No prehistoric or historic sites had been located by
previous work within either the north or south termini of the present project.

METHODS
Initial visual examination of the proposed area of impact was conducted in two zig-zag
transects, one to each side of the centerline of the pipeline route. Prior to the arrival of the
archeologists, the construction firm had placed stakes along the planned pipeline. In addition,

most of the ROW of the south landing was cleared of brush and most small to medium-sized trees
using chain saws and a mechanical shredder. Surface visibility in this area ranged from 10% in
the majority of the area to I 00% along the lake beach. Vegetation in the north landing was
extremely dense, with overall visibility of less than 10%. However, a narrow erosional gully,
approximately 40 cm wide and 30-40 cm deep, extended along a large portion of the ROW. This
was closely examined along its length. In addition, the soil around all ant mounds and animal
burrows was examined in both survey areas. No evidence of cultural materials was observed in
any of these efforts.
Following the initial surface examination, a series of shovel test excavations was
distributed throughout the ROW (Figures 2 and 3). A total of 13 tests was conducted, 9 (ST 1-9)
in the south landing, and 4 (ST 10-13) within the north landing (see Appendix for stratigraphy
and results of individual tests). Excavation was conducted in arbitrary 20 cm levels, with
maximum depths ranging from 40-100 cm due to variances in sediment composition and density.
At least 50% of excavated matrix was screened using 114-inch mesh, with all nonscreened matrix
slowly dumped and visually examined for artifacts. In the south landing, a total of 6. 7 linear
meters of vertical cut face along the beach erosion line were cleaned and examined (Sections AE). All shovel tests were documented with photographs, and a tape and compass map was made
of both landings showing all shovel tests and relevant cultural and natural features.

RESULTS
No evidence of cultural resources was identified in the north landing area. A limited
number of twentieth century artifacts were recovered in the south landing, from Shovel Tests 1,
3, and 5. These artifacts include clear bottle glass, beer bottle glass, whiteware sherds, plastic,
and an automobile fuel tank cap. The whiteware was identified as Luray, which was
manufactured from the 1940s to the 1960s (Leslie Shaw, personal communication 1995). The
materials occurred only in the uppermost 20-30 cm, well within the highly disturbed plow zone.
No other cultural resources were identified either in the surface examination or the subsurface
sampling.

RECOMMENDATIONS
As described above, no prehistoric or significant historic cultural materials were identified during
the survey of either north or south landings of the Birch Pipeline Connection Project. As a result,
it is our recommendation that no further archeological work be required. However, should
cultural resources be encountered during construction, the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified immediately.
