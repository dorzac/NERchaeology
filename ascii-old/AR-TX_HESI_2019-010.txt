MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Georgetown Independent
School District (ISD) to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment for a
proposed new elementary school on a 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) tract in Williamson County, Texas
(the Project Area). The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Georgetown ISD, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal
permits, licenses, or funds have been identified for the project. As the project represents a publicly
sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state
of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect
historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs).
On 22 February 2019, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons, Emily McCurdy, and McKinzie
Froese conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area. The survey was
conducted under the overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, under Texas
Antiquities Permit no. 8796. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant cultural
resources that would potentially be impacted by the purposed undertaking. Horizon’s
archaeologists traversed the 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) tract and thoroughly inspected the modern
ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The Project Area is located on
the gravelly northern terraces of a tributary of Cowan Creek. Vegetation consisted of Ashe
juniper, oak, cottonwood, prickly pear, and greenbrier. Short grasses interspersed with exposed
limestone outcrops provided fair to excellent ground surface visibility across the Project Area
(10 to 75%). Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and decomposing limestone gravels are
present on the modern ground surface across the Project Area, and only a thin veneer of sediment
is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in most areas.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archaeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for Project Areas between
4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. As such, a minimum of 8 shovel tests would
be required within the 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) Project Area. Horizon excavated a total of 20
shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS minimum survey standards.
Disturbances observed in the Project Area included a network of two-track roads, several burned

Management Summary

push piles, hydro-axing, boar rooting, and natural erosion. The pedestrian survey and shovel
testing revealed shallow gravelly clay sediments overlying limestone bedrock.
One newly recorded archaeological site (41WM1402) was documented within the Project
Area. Site 41WM1402 consists of a low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris,
including 20 to 30 tertiary chert flakes, 1 crude uniface scraper, 1 heat-treated core, and 1
indeterminate projectile point preform. Based on the lack of integrity of archeological deposits,
the site is recommended as ineligible for SAL designation. No further investigations are warranted
on site 41WM1402.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the Project Area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately.

Williamson County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Georgetown Independent
School District (ISD) to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and assessment for a
proposed new elementary school on a 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) tract in Williamson County, Texas
(Project Area). (Figures 1 to 3). The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Georgetown
ISD, a political subdivision of the state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the
jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At
this time, no federal permits, licenses, or funds have been identified for the project. As the project
represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for
the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to
adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL).
On 22 February 2019, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons, Emily McCurdy, and McKinzie
Froese conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area. The survey was
conducted under the overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, under Texas
Antiquities Permit no. 8796. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant cultural
resources that potentially would be impacted by the purposed undertaking. The cultural resources
investigation consisted of an archival review, intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and
the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the Project Area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses cultural resources survey methods.
Chapter 6.0 presents the results of the cultural resources survey, and Chapter 7.0 presents
cultural resources management recommendations for the project. Chapter 8.0 lists the
references cited in the report, and Appendix A summarizes shovel test data.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located on the gravelly northern terraces of a tributary of Cowan Creek
in the City of Georgetown in central Williamson County, Texas. Williamson County is situated
near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain in Central Texas and close to the common
junction of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau,
and the Blackland Prairie (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125). The Blackland
Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf
Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern
edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern
edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which
water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards
Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across
Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and
lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt
scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length
of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil,
vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, ranging in elevation from
230.0 to 400.0 meters (754.4 to 1,312.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and
forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rock shelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain
and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the site is situated within the Brazos River basin. The Project Area is
located on the gravelly northern terraces of a tributary to Cowan Creek. Cowan Creek and its

H048-190036

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

unnamed tributaries flow eastward into Berry Creek, which then flows generally eastward into the
main body of the San Gabriel River, east of Georgetown. The San Gabriel River then flows to its
confluence with the Little River in Milam County. The Little River, in turn, flows a short distance
eastward and empties into the Brazos River. The Brazos River flows southeastward across the
Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short
distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay. Elevations within the Project Area range from
approximately 295.5 to 299.6 meters (969.5 to 983.0 feet) amsl.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the Project Area is situated on the Lower Cretaceous Edwards Limestone,
a member of the Fredericksburg Group (Barnes 1995). This geological formation is composed of
limestone, dolomite, and chert deposits. The chert deposits associated with the Edwards
Formation were extensively exploited by the aboriginal inhabitants of Central Texas.
Geomorphologically, the Project Area is situated on 2 specific soil types (Table 1; Figure 4). Soils
within the Project Area consist predominantly of a mix of gravelly residuum weathered in situ from
underlying limestone bedrock and remnants of Pleistocene-age alluvial terraces (NRCS 2019).
In Central Texas, aboriginal archeological sites are commonly located adjacent to streams
as well as in upland environments. The physiographic setting of the Project Area on a series of
gravel terrace benches and upland formations adjacent to the unnamed tributary of Cowan Creek
suggests that the Project Area possesses high potential for aboriginal cultural resources. The
antiquity of the limestone uplands and gravelly terrace soils suggest that any aboriginal cultural
resources present within the Project Area would be present on the modern ground surface or in
very shallowly buried subsurface contexts in eroded settings lacking integrity.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from

the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to
5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 centimeters (12.0 to
25.0 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 cm (45.0 to 50.0 inches)
of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (cm) (36.0 inches) of rain that
fell within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-cm
(22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975).
Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass
so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is

Williamson County, Texas

derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the Project Area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The indigenous
human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle
throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North America, mobility and
settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9200 TO 6000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011, 2018).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (9200 to 6000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this
stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone
foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2
periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early
PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,

H048-190036

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in Central
Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and gathering pattern is
characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6000 to 3000 B.C., the Middle Archaic
subperiod extends from 3000 to 1000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the 1000 B.C.
to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers
differentiating these subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well.
Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod,
continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic
subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered
to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least
partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by the
appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin phase
sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to suggest
that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who lacked the
ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed
South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,

12

190036_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed Georgetown ISD Elementary School Project,
Williamson County, Texas

European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa Indians.1
The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to
aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to a horsebased culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases and by
warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by the 1850s.
Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would become
Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches ranged
through the western part of present Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions were
established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the 1860s.
There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye
Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that would
serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed through
the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was called
Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis and
Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de
San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th century and occupied
a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern border of Williamson
County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively explored by the Spanish.
During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land grants, first to several
Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement resulted from these
grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in

what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post. The
post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of the
present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx of
settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western Milam
County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a new
county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was considerably
closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson County on 13
March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson. Georgetown, the
county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court was in session by
October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a population of 1,379 Anglos
and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel. As was
common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was used to grow corn. Three
families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and subsistence agriculture remained
the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had moved to Texas from other southern
states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and
this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican in its political orientation during the
secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and
was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850 and
1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, 6 times the number
of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s geographical
diversity. Farmers used the rich Blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to grow wheat
and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in 1860, and it was
not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found large herds of wild
cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the market was
widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county ranches had more
than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the number of sheep
grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and 32,994 pounds of
wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis, divisions
that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was strong in
the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas Constitutional Union
party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the secession convention,
Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the ordinance of secession. When

14

190036_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed Georgetown ISD Elementary School Project,
Williamson County, Texas

the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson County was 1 of 19 counties to
oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the war came, most of the citizens of
Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at least 5 companies were raised in
the county: an independent “spy” company under James O. Rice, a company of Texas Rangers
for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and
Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of those who had opposed secession became
active Confederate supporters, others remained loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North,
and a number enlisted in the Union army. In July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught
by Confederate troops while traveling to Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and
other Unionists were persecuted during the war. The pattern of violence within the community
continued into the summer following the end of the war, when several men were arrested for
“flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of
the citizens of Williamson County was held on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the
gathering set a general tone of reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the
Reconstruction period in Williamson County, a period that ended with the return of county
government to conservative Democratic control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new
communities, and the county seems to have been free of much of the political and racial strife
that occurred in other Texas counties during Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a
great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and
some of the more famous outlaws of the day, such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed
on the property of citizens, and long-term family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons
in the towns added to the toll of homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a major
part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record 65,093 cattle.
Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its pre-war level
by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then declined in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920. The industry
revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds of wool in
1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak in 1959,
when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom industry in
Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As early as 1869,
the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton, but do not, by any
means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been insignificant before
the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in 1890, and
80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than any county

H048-190036

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost tenfold from 1870
to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of cropland used for cotton
production moved from about 1/3 of the total in 1880 to a high of 77% in 1910, and cotton was
grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes in land tenure attended the
shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms, or 77%, were still worked
by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners, and the percentage of
owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still further to 29% in 1930.
Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton
and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad, which
later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the county in
1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and Hutto and
to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson County to
commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was eventually
consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s and aided in
the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor throughout the
county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county by 1930, and
extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th centuries.
While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in Williamson
County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends, and Austrians
moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in the county
population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration reached a
significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county. There were
294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930. In 1980,
9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their distinctive
customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of other
denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran, Catholic,
and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally diverse
population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural; only
29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year. While cotton production was
near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already undergoing a
rapid transformation.
The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in

16

190036_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed Georgetown ISD Elementary School Project,
Williamson County, Texas

subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used for
cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers increasingly
turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter 20th century.
Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a significant role
in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production of eggs and
chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15% and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing from
37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in population
growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources as well as previous cultural resources investigations conducted within and in the vicinity
of the Project Area. Based on this archival research, 6 previously recorded archeological sites
and 1 cemetery are present within a 1.0-kilometer (0.6-mile) radius of the Project Area (Figure 5;
Table 2). Three of the 6 sites consist of aboriginal lithic scatters of undetermined prehistoric age.
Three of the 6 sites contain historic-age cultural components, including a mid-19th- to mid-20thcentury farmstead, an early to mid-20th-century homestead, and a historic-age well of
undetermined age. No historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or designated as SALs are present within the Project Area or within the desktop archival
study radius. All of the sites are located well beyond the boundaries of the Project Area and would
have no potential to be affected by the proposed undertaking.
Based on the THC’s TASA, no cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the
Project Area. One survey was conducted immediately adjacent to the Project Area in 2007 ahead
of a proposed roadway project (Lawrence and Wingate 2007). During this investigation, several
archaeological sites (41WM1117-1121) were recorded, including 2 sites adjacent to the Project
Area (41WM1117 and 41WM1118).

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On 22 February 2019, Horizon archeologists Jacob Lyons, Emily McCurdy, and McKinzie
Froese, under the overall direction of Jahleen E. Sefton, Principal Investigator, performed an
intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area to locate any cultural resources that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archaeologists traversed
the 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) tract and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for
aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The Project Area is located along the gravelly
northern terraces of a tributary of Cowan Creek. Vegetation consisted of cedar, oak, cottonwood,
prickly pear, and greenbrier. Short grasses interspersed with exposed limestone outcrops
provided fair to excellent ground surface visibility across the Project Area (10 to 75%). Extensive
exposures of limestone bedrock and decomposing limestone gravels are present on the modern
ground surface across the Project Area, and only a thin veneer of sediment is present overlying
bedrock or dense clay subsoil in most areas (Figures 6 to 8).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archaeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for Project Areas between
4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. As such, a minimum of 8 shovel tests would
be required within the 6.1-hectare (15.1-acre) Project Area. Horizon excavated a total of 20
shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS minimum survey standards
(Figure 9). Disturbances observed in the Project Area included a network of two-track roads,
several burned push piles, hydro-axing, boar rooting, and natural erosion. Shovel tests measured
up to approximately 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and typically revealed shallow
gravelly clay sediments overlying limestone bedrock or gravels derived from decomposing
bedrock at depths ranging from 5.0 to 30.0 centimeters (2.0 to 11.8 inches) below surface.
Sediments excavated from shovel tests were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch)
hardware cloth, and the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were
determined using hand-held Garmin eTrex global positioning system (GPS) devices based on the
North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were

described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found.
One newly recorded archaeological site (41WM1402) was documented within the Project
Area. A standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information on location,
physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts
observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of
surface and subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn illustrating site
boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well as
notable features of the landscape. The site was thoroughly photo-documented using color digital
photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all photographs taken. Based on the
information recorded on the standard archeological site recording form in the field, a Texas
Archeological Data Site Form was completed for the newly recorded site by Horizon’s laboratory
personnel using the most current version of TARL’s TexSite archeological data collection
software. The TexSite form was submitted by TARL, and a permanent site trinomial was obtained
for the site.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the Project Area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

One newly recorded archaeological site (41WM1402) was documented within the Project
Area. Site 41WM1402 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris,
including flakes, 1 crude uniface scraper, 1 heat-treated core, and 1 indeterminate projectile point
preform. The site is described in more detail below.

6.1

SITE 41WM1402
General Description

Site 41WM1402 consists of a low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on
the gravelly northern terraces of an unnamed tributary to Cowan Creek (Figure 10 to 11).
Vegetation consists of Ashe juniper, oak, cottonwood, prickly pear, and greenbrier. Short grasses
interspersed with exposed limestone outcrops provided fair to excellent ground surface visibility
across the Project Area (10 to 75%). Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and
decomposing limestone gravels are present on the modern ground surface across the Project
Area, and only a thin veneer of sediment is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in
most areas (Figures 12 to 13). Some areas of the site were moderately disturbed by vegetation
clearing, controlled burning, debris, push piles, hydro-axing, boar rutting, and two-track roads
(Figures 14 to 15). Elevations across the site range from approximately 298.1 to 300.2 meters
(978.0 to 985.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials
The boundaries of site 41WM1402 measure approximately 200.0 meters (656.7 feet) east
to west by 110.0 meters (361.0 feet) north to south. The site boundaries have been determined
based on the extent of the aboriginal lithic scatter observed on the modern ground surface, as no
subsurface cultural material was recorded.
Horizon excavated a total of 10 shovel tests within the site (see Figure 11). Shovel testing
typically revealed shallow deposits of dense gravelly clay to clay loam from the surface to about
10.0 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (3.9 inches), underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of
about 10.0 cmbs (3.9 inches). Only 1 shovel test, ST JL05, reached to 30.0 cmbs (11.8 inches).
No subsurface cultural resources were observed in any of the shovel tests excavated on site
41WM1402; archeological deposits are constrained to the modern ground surface.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on site 41WM1402.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural material included 20 to 30 tertiary chert flakes, 1 crude uniface scraper, 1 heattreated core, and 1 indeterminate projectile point preform (Figures 16 to 19). A total of 10 shovel
tests were excavated within the site boundary, none of which yielded any subsurface cultural
material. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved floral/faunal remains, or subsurface
materials were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41WM1402 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic debris,
including 1 crude uniface scraper, 1 heat-treated core, and 1 indeterminate projectile point
preform. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM1402 are constrained entirely to the
eroded modern ground surface of the gravelly northern terrace of an unnamed tributary of Cowan
Creek and possess minimal research potential. Based on the lack of integrity of archeological
deposits, site 41WM1402 is recommended as not eligible for SAL designation. No further
archeological investigations are warranted on this site.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the area of potential effect (APE) and to make preliminary determinations
of whether or not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in
the state and/or federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding
archeological properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing
defined research needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their
association with important historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of
Texas, archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

One newly recorded archeological site (41WM1402) was documented during the survey.
Site 41WM1402 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts on the
gravelly northern terraces of an unnamed tributary of Cowan Creek. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts, intact cultural features, preserved floral/faunal remains, or subsurface materials were
observed. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on the site are constrained entirely to the eroded
modern ground surface and possess minimal research potential. Based on the lack of integrity
of archeological deposits, the site 41WM1402 is recommended as not eligible for SAL
designation. No further archeological investigations are warranted on this site.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the Project Area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately.
