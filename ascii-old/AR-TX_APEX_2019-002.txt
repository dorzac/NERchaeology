ABSTRACT
Between April 28-30, 2019, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex), at the request of G&A | McAdams
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 50-acre fill site on Lewisville
Independent School District (ISD) property located southeast of the intersection of Josey Lane
and Windhaven Parkway in Lewisville, Denton County, Texas; hereafter referred to as the
proposed Project (Project No: 725030942010). The Lewisville ISD is the landowner and the
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit number 8893, issued by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) on April 26, 2019.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the entire 50 acres proposed for soil deposition.
The pedestrian survey of the APE included strategically placed shovel tests. Two historic sites,
41DN614 and 41DN615, and one Isolated Find (IF-1) were recorded in the central portion of the
uplands located in the northern third of the APE. The remainder of the APE was negative for
historic or prehistoric cultural resources.
Site 41DN614 consists of a partially fenced area containing a patch of planted irises and
collapsed/destroyed root cellar and water well with trees growing through both; two associated
artifacts were found in the site area (dating between 1870 and 1962). The IF-1 consists of historic
bottles (dating between 1870 and 1968) and a few rusted cans located in a gully downhill and to
the south of site 41DN614.
Site 41DN615 consists of a large expanse of demolished and partially demolished agricultural
and domestic materials collected in clusters/mounds of similar material types (hubcaps, barrels,
pallets, wire, T-posts, large tractor tires, batteries, plastics, etc.) along with large trash piles and
demolished wooden structures without foundations (possible small barn, shed, and doghouse).
It is unclear how much of the debris originated at this location as a considerable amount appears
to have been dumped here.
Both sites are severely damaged and lack research potential; therefore, Apex recommends that
the proposed Project be allowed to proceed as planned as there will be no effect to cultural
resources eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, augmented with shovel
testing, of the proposed Project. Locational maps of the proposed Project are provided in
Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2, on aerial imagery and topographic maps, respectively. The
survey boundary, site locations, and shovel test locations are provided in Appendix A, Figure 3.
Site maps of 41DN614 and 41DN615 are provided in Appendix A, Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
Project photographs are found in Appendix B.
The northwest corner of the proposed Project is located approximately 564 feet south of the
intersection of Windhaven Parkway and North Josey Lane; it is bounded by commercial and
residential development to the north, a tributary to Indian Creek to the south and east and North
Josey Lane to the west. It is located in southeastern Denton County, Texas.
The Project consists of a 50-acre fill site located approximately 564 feet south of the intersection
of Windhaven Parkway and North Josey Lane in Lewisville, Denton County, Texas. The proposed
Project is subject to the provisions of TAC which requires state agencies to consider potential
impacts on historic and/or prehistoric properties for projects located on state public lands. The
Lewisville ISD, the lead state agency, signed the TAC permit application outlining the proposed
cultural resources investigation.
The cultural resources investigation was conducted to identify archeological and historical
resources within the proposed Project. The survey methodology followed the Survey Standards
of Texas developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) (1987) and Texas Historical
Commission (THC) (n.d.). The investigation included an intensive cultural resources survey
augmented with strategically placed shovel tests. This survey report follows the CTA and THC
report format (CTA 1987); it presents the management summary, introduction, environmental
setting of the proposed Project, a brief cultural history, the project methodology, and results of the
field investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is located in the North Central Texas archeological region in southeastern
Denton County. Blair (1950) places north-central Texas in his Texan biotic province. This
transitional or ecotonal zone, located between the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces to
the east and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces to the west,
supported diverse plant and animal communities available to the prehistoric peoples of northcentral Texas. Woodland species can be found in oak-hickory forests, floodplain forests, and
peat bogs/marshes and grassland species are found on the prairies.
The proposed Project falls within the Grand Prairie physiographic region (BEC 1996) and the
native vegetation is known as the Cross Timbers. According to McMahan et al. (1984), the
vegetation types include the Silver Bluestem-Texas Wintergrass Grassland and the Post Oak
Woods, Forest, and Grassland Mosaic vegetation types. However, the proposed project is
located in an area that has been historically farmed resulting in the clearance of the native
vegetation; the current vegetation consists of short and mid grasses, wildflowers, and expansive
honey mesquite and honey locus along with minor hackberries.
Hydrology, topography, vegetation, and soils within the proposed Project are briefly summarized
below.
3.1 Hydrology
An un-named tributary of Indian Creek forms the southern boundary of the proposed Project
from northeast to southwest. A second un-named tributary of Indian Creek crosses the northwest
corner of the proposed Project. Both are mapped as intermittent drainages (EPA 2016);
however, the northern tributary has been modified into a drainage feature.
3.2 Topography
The elevation of the proposed Project ranges from approximately 592 feet above mean sea level
(amsl) at the northeastern corner of the proposed Project to 550 feet amsl along the tributary
forming the southern boundary. The northern third of the proposed Project consist of nearly level
to slightly sloping uplands adjacent to an upland ridge at 580 feet amsl; moderate to steep
slopes, along with numerous erosional gullies and ravines, form between the upland ridge and
the southern tributary. A topographic map of the proposed Project is included as Appendix A,
Figure 2.
3.3 Vegetation
The native vegetation had been cleared long ago; hackberries were observed along fence lines
in the uplands; numerous honey mesquite and honey locust were observed in clusters with a few
bois d’arc trees along the upland ridge and downslope toward the drainage. Due to extensive rain
fall during the past weeks, an abundance of grasses and wildflowers were observed between the
ridge line and tributary.
3.4 Soils
Four soil units [Branyon clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (19); Ferris-Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes
(31); Ferris-Heiden clay, 5 to 15 percent slopes (32); and Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes (42)]
are intersected by the proposed Project (NRCS 2019). Most of the proposed Project consists of
Ferris-Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes (42) and 5 to 15 percent slopes (32). These clayey soils
are located on the upland prairie and steep slopes between the uplands and the southern boundary
tributary.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The APE is located in the Cross Timbers ecoregion in north Texas. The Cross Timbers region is
a transitional area between the once prairie regions to the west and the forested low mountains
or hills of eastern Oklahoma and Texas. It is a mosaic of forest, woodland, savannah, and prairie
(Prikryl 1990). These habitats supported a rich mixture of diverse plant and animal communities
available to the prehistoric and historic peoples of north and north central Texas.
This brief overview of prehistoric north Texas is derived mainly from the cultural history prepared
by Prikryl (1990) for investigations conducted throughout north and northeast Texas. The earliest
investigations in Texas were carried out by E. B. Sayles in the 1920s and 1930s; he conducted a
state-wide reconnaissance and published the first synthesis of Texas prehistory in 1935. In ‘An
Archaeological Survey of Texas’, Sayles attempted to compare archeological sites across the
state and define prehistoric culture and their boundaries. The next significant overview of Texas
archaeology was An Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology by D. A. Suhm, A. D. Krieger,
and E. B. Jelks’ in 1954.
The era of reservoir development in north Texas emphasized the Trinity River drainages resulting
in numerous archeological investigations prior to their inundation. Several large projects took
place along the Trinity River’s East Fork at Lake Lavon (1950, 1973, 1975) and Lake Ray Hubbard
(1963, 1968); these investigations afforded significant contributions to our understanding of
prehistory in the region. Important investigations along other parts of the Trinity River basin have
focused on the upper Elm Fork of the river in the Denton area; these include Ray Roberts
Reservoir (1987, 1997, 1987, 1982), Lewisville Lake (1950, 1991, 1998), and Grapevine Lake
(1975). Large scale research along the West Fork of the Trinity River has been primarily limited
to Mountain Creek Lake (1988).
Following the establishment of federal laws and state regulations to preserve significant cultural
resources (principally the NHPA of 1966, as amended and the Antiquities Code of Texas, as
amended in 1969), archeological investigations increased significantly to fulfill environmental
assessment requirements related to federally funded, licensed, or permitted projects and stateowned lands. Additionally, the Dallas Archeological Society and Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) have produced articles and journals (The Record and Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society [BTAS], respectively) resulting in good data. The TAS has conducted annual field schools
since 1962 as well as recording thousands of archeological sites over the years. Over 70 years
of research has been published in the BTAS documenting the prehistory and early history of
Texas.
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period represents the first known human occupation of the north central Texas
region (at least 12,000 to 8500 BP) (Prikryl 1990). These sites are associated with high mobility;
distinctive lanceolate, unnotched fluted dart points; and the hunting of extinct Pleistocene
mammals.
Archaic Period
The Archaic period in north central Texas extended from approximately 8500 to 1250 BP with
roughly three 2,400-year periods regarded as early, middle, and late sub-divisions (Prikryl 1990).
It is suggested by Prikryl (1990) that diagnostic artifacts associated with the Early Archaic consist
of various split-stem varieties, while the Middle Archaic is represented by basal-notched types
such as Bell, Andice, Carrollton, and Bulverde. Late Archaic dart points include the Castroville,

G&A | McAdams
50-acre Fill Site at Lewisville ISD property CRS

May 2019
Page 7

Marshall, Edgewood, Elam, Trinity, and Gary types (Prikryl 1990). The Late Archaic (and
subsequent Late Prehistoric) archeological record commonly describes human burials and
associated large man-made pits. The burials and pit features suggest group aggregations and
large-scale processing of food resources during the Late Archaic and extending into the Late
Prehistoric.
Late Prehistoric Period
Prikryl (1990) divides the Late Prehistoric period into Late Prehistoric I (approximately 1250 to
750 BP) and Late Prehistoric II (approximately 750 to 250 BP) subdivisions based on projectile
point and ceramic types. Temporally diagnostic arrow points from the Late Prehistoric I
subperiod include Scallorn, Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham. Diagnostic ceramics
primarily consist of grog tempered undecorated varieties. During the Late Prehistoric II
subdivisions, the archeological record exhibits influences from southern Plains groups, which
correspond to an increase in the size of the north central Texas bison herd. Increased population
is thought to have limited hunting ranges and resulted in the gradual trend toward horticulture
and sedentary village life.
Historic Period
With the arrival of the eighteenth century, Plains groups had moved into and beyond north
central Texas and were documented by traders and explorers, thereby heralding the beginning
of the Historic period. During this time, documented groups in and around the region included
Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo. Sites attributed to this
period contain European ceramics, glass beads, flintlock musket fragments, and metal arrow
points in conjunction with chipped lithic tools.
Cultural Resource Sites within a 0.50-mile Search Radius
In April 2019, a review of records available on the Texas Historical Commission’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (ATLAS) was conducted to determine the presence/absence of
archeological resources and/or previously investigated archeological project areas within a half
mile search radius of the proposed Project. The review indicated that no cultural resource sites
and two previous surveys have been documented within the study area. Due to the paucity of
cultural material within the study area, the radius was extended to identify the nearest cultural
resource types located in similar landscapes as the proposed Project.
Previous Investigations
According to the ATLAS (2019), one linear cultural resources survey was conducted paralleling
the western boundary of the proposed Project in 1992. It may represent the survey of North
Josey Lane and was negative for cultural resources.
A large area survey was conducted west of North Josey Lane for the Lakewood Hills
Development in 2015. It was negative for cultural resources and no further work was
recommended.
Nearest Cultural Sites
Site 41DN505 consists of a historic house site located approximately 1.14 mile east of the
proposed Project (ATLAS 2019). It is likely the remains of a tenant house dating from the 1890s
to the 1940s and located on a terrace above Indian Creek. The site was recorded during a
USACE Section 404 permit survey for Indian Creek in 1998. No further investigations were
recommended due to the paucity of artifacts (ATLAS 2019).

Site 41DN484 is located on a small tributary of Indian Creek approximately 1.80 mile southwest
of the proposed Project (ATLAS 2019). No data, other than locational, is available on the ATLAS.
Site 41DN501 consists of a historic cistern located on a slope overlooking a tributary
approximately 2.04 miles southeast of the proposed Project. The cistern consists of single-faced
red bricks with Atlas impressed on a flat face and is in good shape; it will be preserved in-place
by park development at the Arbor Hills Nature Preserve (ATLAS 2019).
Site 41DN523 consists of a historic house located in an upland area approximately 1.48 mile
northwest of the proposed Project. The house, constructed in the 1940s, was abandoned and
used for hay storage. The interior had been gutted and parts had collapsed; no further work was
recommended (ATLAS 2019).
A review of available historic aerials and topographic maps on Google Earth and the Nationwide
Environmental Title Research website, www.historicaerials.com, was conducted to identify
previous structures. One small structure and a two-track access road (from the north) was
plotted in the north central area of the proposed Project on the 1925 USGS Lewisville East &
Hebron, Texas topographic map; however, there was no indication of a larger farmstead in the
maps reviewed. It appears as an outbuilding on the 1960 through 1981 USGS Lewisville East &
Hebron, Texas topographic maps. It is not visible on the 2010 and 2013 USGS Lewisville East
& Hebron, Texas topographic map. Modern aerials depict the proposed Project as mostly
cleared pasture, with the same two track road and single small building in the aerial photographs
from 1951 and 1964. Beginning with the aerial from 2008, neither the structure nor two-track
road is visible.

METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field investigation, the THC’s ATLAS database (ATLAS 2019) was reviewed to
identify significant cultural resources. No standing structures, cultural resources sites, or previous
investigations were found within the proposed Project.
The primary intent of the survey is to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered
within the APE, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and, should eligible
archeological sites be located, make recommendations for future management options, such as
avoidance and preservation or further investigations.
The intensive survey was conducted by the Principal Investigator, who meets the U.S. Secretary
of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology (NPS 1983) and one field
technician. The survey methodology adhered to the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas
developed by the THC (n.d.) in conjunction with the CTA (1987). The pedestrian survey was
conducted in 30-foot (13.2 meter) transect intervals and augmented with judgmental shovel
testing, as needed. The shovel tests were used to assess the subsurface for cultural deposits and
delineate buried archeological sites; however, all of the shovel test were negative for cultural
resources. Soil descriptions, along with Munsell color designations, are provided for most of the
shovel tests. The locations of the two archeological sites, features, concentrations, shovel tests,
and disturbances was entered into the GPS Trimble unit. Digital photographs were taken of the
overall landscape, site features and concentrations, samples of shovel test locations. All cultural
resources sites were recorded utilizing the TexSite Archeological Data Collection Software
(TexSite), a product of the THC. No cultural materials were collected.
This draft technical report meets the standards for cultural resource reports adopted by the
THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists. The report briefly describes the natural and
cultural history of the project area, discusses the methodology and results of the survey,
and concludes with recommendations about site NRHP eligibility and whether further
archeological work should be conducted in the project area. The draft report will be submitted
to the THC for review. Any concerns will be addressed and final reports will be provided to the
client, USACE, and THC, when required. Additionally, two tagged formatted PDF electronic
copies on CD (one with and one without site locational data) along with the Abstracts in Texas
Contract Archeology Summary form and abstract will be provided to the THC. Shapefiles
showing the boundary of the project area and areas surveyed will be submitted to the THC. All
project records will be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

RESULTS

The APE consists of the 50-acre proposed Project as it was considered to have a moderate to
high probability of containing prehistoric and/or historic cultural resources due to its location along
an Indian Creek tributary. The 1925 USGS Lewisville East & Hebron, Texas topographic map
illustrates one small structure and a two-track access road (from the north) in the north central
area of the proposed Project; however, there was no indication of a larger farmstead in the maps
reviewed. It appears as an outbuilding on the 1960 through 1981 USGS Lewisville East & Hebron,
Texas topographic map. It is not visible on the 2010 and 2013 USGS Lewisville East & Hebron,
Texas topographic map. Modern aerials depict the proposed Project as mostly cleared pasture,
with the same two track road and single small building in the aerial photographs between 1951
and 1964. Beginning with the aerial from 2008, neither the structure nor two-track road is visible
(see Appendix C for the historic aerial imagery and historic topographic maps).
The proposed Project is bounded by commercial and residential development to the north, a
tributary to Indian Creek to the south and east and North Josey Lane to the west. The un-named
Indian Creek tributary and fence lines on the west, north, and east separates the parcel from its
neighbors. The northern third of the APE consists of cleared uplands with evidence of cattle
grazing and a detention pond associated with the residential and commercial development
immediately north of the proposed Project. The southern edge is in the floodplain of a small
unnamed tributary of Indian Creek and the area between the uplands and floodplain consists of
moderate to steep downward slopes toward the tributary. Numerous erosional features and
gullying were observed below the upland ridge extending into the floodplain.
An approximately 168-foot wide high-voltage electric utility right-of-way overlaps an approximately
179-foot wide buried pipeline corridor along the northern boundary of the proposed Project or
APE. The buried pipeline corridor extends south along the western boundary of the APE. Shovel
tests were not excavated in these two impacted corridors.
The intensive pedestrian survey was initiated at the southern boundary between the tributary and
the western pipeline corridor. The vegetation consists of short- to mid-grasses, abundant
wildflowers with occasional clusters of honey mesquite and honey locust and minor numbers of
hackberry and bois d’arc trees along the upland ridge and along ravines. The ground surface
visibility was between 80 and 100 percent, much higher than the THC/CTA 30-percent threshold
for shovel testing, and extensive gullying and erosional features were observed devoid of cultural
materials. Shovel Tests (STs) 1 through 11 were excavated in this southwestern quadrant of the
APE with negative results; the typical profile consists of very dark brown/gray loamy clay to clay
over olive brown clay or weathered shale (55 to 80 cm in depth). See Appendix B, photographs
B-1 through B-5. Located north of ST 11, a narrow gully with partially buried glass bottle
fragments and small metal buckets was recorded as Isolated Find (IF) 1 (Appendix B,
photographs B-6 through B-12 ). Shovel Tests 11, 12, and 13 were excavated in the area of IF-1
with negative results; the soil is similar to the previous profile, but the soils are shallower as one
moves uphill (35 cm in depth). A few similar type bottle fragments were observed widely scattered
to the north/northeast of IF-1. We decided to survey the surrounding terrain before fully
documenting IF-1 in order to plan for the best use of field time. The intensive pedestrian survey
continued to the northeast from ST 13; a collapsed root cellar and well were noted within a
dilapidated fenced-in area. After a quick assessment of this historic site (41DN614), we moved
forward with the pedestrian survey. We soon came across a larger historic/modern possible dump
site (41DN615), we made plans to return to the site for formal assessment after we had surveyed
the remainder of the APE (photographs of sites are referenced with site descriptions below).
Shovel Tests 14 through 18, and 23 and 24 were excavated on the upland prairie surrounding the

G&A | McAdams
50-acre Fill Site at Lewisville ISD property
CRS

Page 11

two sites in the northwest and northeast quadrants of the APE (Appendix B, photographs B-13
and B-14). The typical soil profile consists of homogenous and gravely very dark gray clay loam
(29 to 70 cm in depth). Shovel Tests 19 through 22, and 25 and 26 were excavated below the
ridge and overlooking the Indian Creek tributary in the southeastern quadrant of the APE
(Appendix B, photographs B-15 and B-16). The typical profile varied from homogenous yellowish
brown to dark grayish brown over brownish yellow (50 to 80 cm in depth). All of the STs were
negative for cultural materials. The survey boundary, site locations, and shovel test locations are
provided in Appendix A, Figure 3. Site maps of 41DN614 and 41DN615 are provided in Appendix
A, Figures 4 and 5, respectively. Upon completing the survey, the survey crew returned to the
historic sites and Isolated Find; these are described below:
SITE 41DN614
This historic site is in a deteriorated state; it consists of a collapsed root cellar and water well
located within a larger partially fenced yard with damaged gate components and a large
ornamental iris planting (see Appendix A, Figure 4 for the site map and Appendix B-16 through
B-23 for site photographs). The site is located on a flat surface near the ridge line separating the
uplands and the moderate to steep slopes toward the Indian Creek tributary; its center is located
at Latitude 33.058605/Longitude -96.883668. The overall site boundary, based on the fence
outline, measures approximately 113.5 feet N/S and approximately 150 feet E/W and includes
0.393501 acres. The plotted ornamental planting of iris has expanded over the years and
measures 37 feet E/W and 16.5 feet N/S. The plotted concentration measures approximately 105
feet E/W and approximately 33 feet N/S and includes the dilapidated root cellar ruins and the
collapsed water well, and a couple of bottle fragments (not plotted). These are similar to the glass
bottle/cup fragments found at IF-1 just south of the site (see descriptions with the IF-1 discussion
below).
The water well is laying on its side partially buried; the bricks are worn and undefinable; however,
several “Acme Ferris” bricks were observed nearby; these were formerly made by the Green
Pressed Brick Company; their beginning date is unknown, ceased production in 1968 (Source:
Brickmaking in Texas: A History of the Industry and It’s Product by Robert A. Steinbomer, 1982,
Partially complete manuscript submitted to the Texas Historical Commission).
The walls and components of the root cellar are caved in and crumbling; as well, substantially
large trees are growing within this feature. The interior walls consist of poured concrete with plain
single-faced red bricks on the outside, and numerous concrete slabs have been displaced due to
age and erosion. A few slabs have large metal bolts protruding out of their top surface.
The barbed wire that is strung at the top of the hand-made threaded wire fence, appears to be
Scutt’s Clip that was first patented in 1878 and is still produced today (Source:
https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth74/). A fragment of a blue and white metal cup
(splatter pattern on graniteware) was observed near the cellar ruin, as well as at IF-1; production
began around 1870 and ended by 1962 (Source: Graniteware Collectors’ Guide with Prices, by
Vernagene Vogelzang and Evelyn Welch, 1987, published by Wallace-Homestead Book
Company, Lombard Illinois (pages 6 and 23). The site appears to date between 1870 and the
1940s and may be associated with tenant farming.
Shovel Tests 27 through 30 were excavated within the plotted concentration with negative results;
the soil profiles consist of homogenous and friable black loam. Due to the collapsed condition of
the root cellar and well and lack of interpretive data, this site is not recommended for listing as a
SAL; and no further work is warranted.

ISOLATED FIND #1 (Appendix B, photographs B-6 through B-12)
This Isolated Find consists of a small collection of glass bottles and bottle fragments, one metal
cup, a small metal bucket, and rolled up wire fence matching the fencing found at site 41DN614.
The specimens include:
-one Fitch hair tonic bottle (from the base markings) was most likely made in 1932 from the
Owens-Illinois mark,
-two Hi-Lex Bleach bottles, made at the Streator, Illinois plant in 1943 (Sources:
https://www.blm.gov/historic_bottles/pdffiles/OwensIll_Blockhart.pdf and https://sha.org/bottle/
Owens Illinois 2015. Pdf),
-two “33” Bleach disinfectant bottles made by the Beacon Chemical Corporation with a
probable date from the late 1930s to the early 1940s based on pictures from
www.bottlebooks.com/ questions/common/bleach%20bottles.html,
-one blue and white metal cup (splatter pattern on graniteware) (see Source data above with
site 41DN614), and
-two broken colorless medicine bottle bases that are similar to the Fitch hair tonic bottle (see
above).
This IF is likely associated with site 41DN614 as they contain similar materials.
SITE 41DN615
Much of this historic/modern site area has been modified in the past, including indications of razing
any existing building and the dumping additional building supplies, agricultural equipment and
supplies, etc. The site center is located at Latitude 33.059279/Longitude -96.883314. The overall
site boundary, based on the fence outline, measures approximately 244.3 feet N/S and
approximately 232 feet E/W and includes 1.016406 acres (see Appendix A, Figure 5 for the site
map and Appendix B-24 through B-34 for site photographs).
The site is located on a flat surface in the area of a plotted structure on the 1925 USGS Lewisville
East & Hebron, Texas topographic map; there was no indication of a larger farmstead in the maps
reviewed. It appears as an outbuilding on the 1960 through 1981 USGS Lewisville East & Hebron,
Texas topographic map. It is not visible on the 2010 and 2013 USGS Lewisville East & Hebron,
Texas topographic map. Modern aerials depict the proposed Project as mostly cleared pasture,
with the same two track road and single small building in the aerial photographs between 1951
and 1964. Beginning with the aerial from 2008, neither the structure nor two-track road is visible
(see Appendix C for the historic aerial imagery and historic topographic maps). Although site
41DN615 overlaps the plotted location of a structure as early as 1925, there was absolutely no
evidence of this structure or its associated two-track roadbed.
This site consists of a large expanse of demolished and partially demolished agricultural and
domestic materials collected in clusters/mounds of similar material types (large rusted animal
feeder, hubcaps, rusted barrels, pallets, wire, modern barbed wire and gate components, T-posts,
large tractor tires, batteries, plastics, PVC pipe fragments, chunks of concrete, broken toilet and
bathroom tile etc.) along with large trash piles (including batteries, miscellaneous wooden, plastics
and metal fragments, liquor bottles, light fixtures, shoes, TVs, electronic components, etc.) and
demolished wooden structures without foundations (possible small barn, shed, and doghouse).
These items appear to date from the 1960s to the recent period; if earlier historic materials were
once associated with a residential structure at this location, they have since been removed or
destroyed. These items are plotted on Appendix A, Figure 5 and photographs are provided in
Appendix B24 through B34. None of the bulldozer push piles are temporally connected to the
historic past.
Shovel Tests 31 through 35 were excavated within the plotted site boundary with negative results;

the soil profiles consist of homogenous black clay loam to 40 cm in depth. Due to destroyed
condition of the 1960s and later era materials, this site is not recommended for listing as a SAL;
and no further work is warranted.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The APE was subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, supplemented with judgmental shovel
testing. Thirty-five negative STs were excavated within the proposed Project/APE (see
Appendix A, Figure 3). Two historic sites, 41DN614 and 41DN615, were documented on the
upland center of the proposed Project; the remainder of the property was negative for cultural
resources.
Site 41DN614 appears to date between 1870 and the 1940s and may be associated with tenant
farming. Due to its collapsed condition, negative STs, and lack of sufficient artifact assemblage,
this site is not recommended for listing as a SAL or inclusion in the NRHP; and no further work is
warranted.
Site 41DN615 consists of demolished and partially demolished agricultural and domestic materials
collected in clusters/mounds of similar material types. These items appear to date from the 1960s
to the recent period; if earlier historic materials were once associated with a residential structure
at this location, they have since been removed or destroyed. None of the bulldozer push piles are
temporally connected to the historic structure identified on historic aerials and topographic maps
between 1925 and 1951. Due to the total destruction of the site, it is not recommended for listing
as a SAL or inclusion in the NRHP; and no further work is warranted.
The work reported here represents a reasonable and good faith effort to ensure that the
proposed Project will not affect historic properties and no further work is recommended.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
50-acre APE , then further archeological investigations may be necessary in those areas prior
to any construction. If inadvertent discoveries of intact archeological and historic resources are
identified during construction, work in the immediate area should cease until the resources are
assessed by a professional archeologist.
