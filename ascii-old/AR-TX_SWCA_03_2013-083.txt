ABSTRACT
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted archival background research
and cultural resources monitoring of a construction project along S. Alamo Street from Probandt Street to Pereida
Street in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6340. The project replaced an
existing gas main with a new one, and the old gas line was abandoned. The project area was within the existing
50-foot-wide right-of-way (ROW) of S. Alamo Street for approximately 1,300 feet, and the adjacent 100–200
feet along Guenther, Wickes, Johnson, Adams, and Pereida streets, for a total length of approximately 1,520
feet. These side streets typically have a 40-foot ROW. A series of trenches were excavated by a CPS Energy
contractor that were about 1.5–2 feet wide and between 5–6 feet in depth. Thus, the area of potential effects is
1.7 acres and involves about 676 cubic yards of disturbance.
The background review determined that the project area was previously surveyed at the reconnaissance level
in 1979 and that no previously recorded sites are within or adjacent to the project area; however, the project is
within the boundary of the South Alamo Street-South Mary’s Street NRHP District, and it is also adjacent to the
King Williams NRHP District and the Blue Star Industrial NRHP District. The Acequia Madre, a contributing
element of the San Antonio Missions National Historic Park, is within the project area, mapped along both S.
Alamo and Wickes streets.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed during construction activities that occurred from
November 5, 2012 to February 1, 2013. The monitoring activities were conducted in order to identify and record
any existing cultural resources within the project area. Spanning nearly three months, the construction monitoring
identified cultural debris within the APE dating mainly to the twentieth century. Besides traces of streetcar and
railroad spurs, no artifacts or features were encountered that date any earlier than the twentieth century. Overall,
no definitive evidence was encountered in the project area that could be associated with the Spanish Colonial or
the Republic of Texas eras. All work within the project area was conducted within extensively disturbed deposits
predominantly dating to the twentieth century.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. Based on
the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavations within the S. Alamo Street Drainage project had no effect
on significant cultural properties and no further archaeological work is recommended.

County. The project area traverses a largely residential
area of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
structures south of San Antonio’s main commercial
district.

On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted archival research and
cultural resources monitoring of a construction project
along S. Alamo Street from Probandt Street to Pereida
Street in Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). Monitoring
was accomplished for excavations within the right­
of-way (ROW) of S. Alamo Street and Wickes Street.
The project replaced an existing gas main with a new
one, and the old gas line was abandoned.

A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area. Railed street­
car service was in operation in San Antonio from
1878–1933. The southwestern end of the project area
has been a center for industry from at least 1896, and
several spurs from the San Antonio and Aransas Pass
Railroad (SA&APRR) are mapped crossing S. Alamo
Street. At present, the industrial warehouses have been
transformed into the Blue Star Art Complex, a mixeduse development that has sparked a revitalization of
the area.

The project area was within the existing 50-foot-wide
ROW of S. Alamo Street for approximately 1,300
feet, and the adjacent 100–200 feet along Guenther,
Wickes, Johnson, Adams, and Pereida streets, for a
total length of approximately 1,520 feet (Figure 2).
These side streets typically have a 40-foot ROW. A
series of trenches were excavated by a CPS Energy
contractor that were typically about 1.5–2 feet wide and
between 5–6 feet in depth. Thus, the area of potential
effects is 1.7 acres and involves about 676 cubic yards
of disturbance.

GeoloGy
Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100 per­
cent Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits. Fluviatile
Terrace deposits are made of predominately gravel,
limestone, dolomite, and chert (Fisher 1983). The
deposits also consist of sand, silt, and clay. Most low
terrace deposits along entrenched streams are above
flood level (Fisher 1983).

The investigations began with intensive historic archival
and map research for the property encompassing the
Spanish Colonial period up through the 1950s. The
main channel of the Acequia Madre (also known as the
Alamo Ditch) is mapped along S. Alamo Street within
the entire length of the study area (Cox 2005) (Figure
3). Additionally, a desague, or return canal, from the
main channel travels down Wickes Street, a portion
of which is also within the project area (City of San
Antonio Office of Historic Preservation Acequia Map
Sheet 16-57).

SoilS
The project area soil northeast of the San Antonio River
is mapped as 100 percent Houston Black clay with
1 to 3 percent slopes (Taylor et al. 1991:Map Sheet
53–54; NRCS 2012). Southwest of the river, the soils
are mapped as 85 percent Lewisville silty clay with
1 to 3 percent slopes, and the remainder is Frio clay
loam (Taylor et al. 1991:Map Sheet 53; NRCS 2012).

Subsequent to the archival research, the construction
activities were monitored. The goal of the work was
to examine and assess any cultural deposits revealed
in the construction, adequately document the cultural
resources, and provide sufficient information to make
determinations on age and significance. All work was
done in accordance with the standards and guidelines
of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6340.

The Houston series consists of moderately welldrained, slowly permeable, cyclic soils that formed
in alkaline clays and chalk of the Blackland Prairies.
Houston soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.
These clayey soils have very high shrink-swell po­
tential. Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 9 feet. The
soil is clay throughout, ranging from 60–80 percent.
These are cyclic soils, with cycles of microknolls and
microbasins repeated at linear intervals of 6 to 12 feet
(Taylor et al. 1991:21; NRCS 2012).

Project AreA descrIPtIon
Located south of downtown San Antonio, Texas, the
project area is in a highly developed urban setting on
a level floodplain straddling the San Antonio River,
about 1.0 mile south-southwest of the Alamo in Bexar

on nearly level alluvial terraces of the San Antonio
River (Taylor et al. 1991:25; NRCS 2012). The Frio

review

As part of the compliance process, the San Antonio
Office of Historic Preservation (SA-OHP) requested
that an archaeologist monitor the excavations by a
CPS Energy contractor along both S. Alamo Street
and Wickes Street. The goal of the monitoring was to
gather information on the nature and types of cultural
resources possibly buried in the project area with a
focus on potentially significant resources related to the
Spanish Colonial era in general and, specifically, the
Acequia Madre and its associated desague.

Prior to any ground disturbing activities and monitor­
ing, SWCA conducted a comprehensive examination
of available historic maps, records, and archives to
reconstruct the history of the project area, from the
earliest Spanish Colonial period to present. This section
provides a review of the cultural setting for the project
area under examination. The research concentrated on
historic ownership and occupation of the project area to
develop a general history and identify any significant
landmarks or places that should be considered during
the project development. The focus was on the Spanish
Colonial period, but also included the history of the
tract up through the 1950s.

The archaeologist coordinated all field activities with
appropriate personnel and any on-site construction
foremen regarding scheduling and safety. The monitor­
ing archaeologist attended a pre-construction meeting
to ensure full coordination prior to construction. The ar­
chaeologist complied with all applicable Occupational
Safety and Health Administration safety regulations
and wore all required safety equipment (e.g., hardhat
and steel-toed boots). Monitoring consisted of a quali­
fied archaeologist observing the excavation process,
the excavation area, and their resulting fill, frequently
inspecting it for cultural remains. If encountered, ar­
tifacts were examined, quantified and assessed as to
age and origin, and generally were not collected. Di­
agnostic artifacts or those of particular interest were to
be collected for further study in SWCA labs. Particular
attention was given to any cultural resources that may
date to the early- to mid-nineteenth century.

SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any
archaeological sites have been recorded within or ad­
jacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an SWCA
archaeologist reviewed the San Antonio East (2998­
133) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map at TARL and searched
the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) and
site files at TARL. These sources provided information
on the nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural
resource sites, locations of NRHP properties, sites
designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL),
Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighbor­
hood surveys.

If intact cultural resources were revealed in the con­
struction process, the archaeologist attempted to make
a determination as to potential significance. At this
point, construction was temporarily halted so that the
archaeologist could better examine the cultural ma­
terials or features, take photographs, and thoroughly
document the finds. Once the materials were assessed,
construction recommenced, and continued as planned.
Only if the materials were assessed as extremely
significant (mainly human remains or burials) was
construction in the immediate area to be halted. If a
localized work stoppage was required, the monitoring
archaeologist would immediately call all involved
parties (CPS Energy, THC, HPO, etc.) to discuss the
find and formulate a plan of action. However, over the

Additional sources of information that were consulted
included published reports, aerial photographs, records

(TNRIS) archives, Bureau of Economic Geology Maps,
the Natural Resources Conservation Services’Web Soil
Survey, and a 1924 San Antonio public transportation
map. Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
Historic Overlay maps from 1871, 1883, 1887, 1889,
1903, 1912, 1927, and 1953 were consulted, along with
Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, to identify the presence
of potential historic-age structures. The results of

The King William Historic District is a neighborhood
of Victorian and turn-of-the-century homes centered
around King William Street, a five-block-long street
near the San Antonio River just south of downtown San
Antonio. The district is roughly bounded by Durango,
Alamo, and Gunther Streets and the San Antonio River.
The district contains 74 properties that contribute to
its nineteenth-century period of significance. The
Italianate, Greek Revival and Renaissance Revival
homes found in the district are particularly dense and
significant along both sides of King William Street. The
district also includes three mansions: Polk Mansion,
Groos House, and Steves Homestead. The area was pri­
marily established by prosperous German businessmen
in the second half of the nineteenth century (National
Register Nomination Form No. 72001349).

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. Artifacts
were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field,
but not collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts were
described in detail and photographed in the field.

The background review determined that the project

NRHP District, and it is also adjacent to the King
Williams NRHP District and the Blue Star Industrial
NRHP District. As previously mentioned, the Acequia
Madre, a contributing element of the San Antonio
Missions National Historic Park, is within the project
area, mapped along both S. Alamo and Wickes streets.

The Blue Star Street Industrial Historic District consists
of four warehouses erected between 1917 and 1934
on land owned by the San Antonio Belt and Terminal
Railway Company. The approximately 6-acre district
is bounded by S. Alamo Street, Probandt Avenue, and
the San Antonio River (National Register Nomination
Form No. 94000627).

The project area was included in a reconnaissance
survey along with a large swath of downtown paral­
leling the San Antonio River in 1979 on behalf of the
U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District
(Atlas 2012). There is no Antiquities Permit number
associated with this project and the report contains
only general, locational information regarding historic
structures and prehistoric sites (Fox 1979). The current
project area is not mentioned in this report.

The South Alamo Street-South St. Mary’s Street His­
toric District is a residential area south of San Antonio’s
commercial district. Separated from center city by
LaVillita and the Hemisfair grounds, the district retains
intact most of its late nineteenth- and early twentiethcentury structures. The district’s 474 structures and
approximately 125 acres are bounded by the King
William National Register Historic District, South St.
Mary’s and Temple Streets, and the San Antonio River.

S. Alamo Street is the southeastern boundary of
the King William Historic District and the northern
boundary of the S. Alamo Street-S. St. Mary’s Street
Historic District. The three closest sites to the project
area include 41BX236, 41BX326, and 41BX342. All
three are within the King William National Register
Historic District, while two others (41BX351 and
41BX622) are within the U.S. San Antonio Arsenal
National Register Historic District and site 41BX303
is within the La Villita Historic District.

The majority of structures are vernacular frame dwell­
ings which were little affected by stylistic movements
except for decorative details. There are, however,
many finely crafted houses that illustrate the stylistic
eclecticism emblematic of late nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century architecture. Bungalows dominate
the southern part of the district and commercial struc­
tures are largely limited to South Alamo and South
St. Mary’s Streets. The district is characterized by
6

a high concentration of dwellings sharing form and
stylistic elements, a cohesive architectural fabric, and
a low percentage of intrusive structures. There are 332
contributing structures within the district’s boundaries,
and 142 noncontributing structures.

home to a large, ethnic, working class population
(National Register Nomination Form No. 84000026).

SPaniSh aCequiaS
As the Spanish established missions in Bexar County,
they also devised an irrigation and water supply system
using spring water. Friars supervised the labor of
Indians, settlers, and soldiers to construct acequias,
or canals, and dams. The system distributed water
for agriculture, personal consumption, and other
household uses (Porter 2009:48). Thus, the system
represents the first municipal water system in what
would become the United States.

The shape of the South Alamo Street-South St. Mary’s
Street Historic District was fixed early by the courses
of the Acequia Madre (now South Alamo Street, just
south of the northern boundary), the Acequia Concep­
cion (now South St. Mary’s Street, part of the eastern
boundary) and the San Antonio River (the western
boundary). The major north-south streets (Mission,
Adams, Wickes, and East Guenther) were largely
plotted by early developers, such as Ernst Wehrhahn.
Wickes Street covers the route of the Acequia Madre
as it turned south to empty into the river.

The first canal dug at the San Antonio Springs between
1718 and 1744 was the Acequia Madre (also known
as Alamo Madre and Alamo Ditch). It diverted water
from the east side of the headwaters of the San Antonio
River, just below San Antonio Springs, in present-day
Brackenridge Park. The CPS Energy S. Alamo Street
project area includes a portion of the Acequia Madre,
which is a contributing element of the San Antonio
Missions National Historic Park (National Register
of Historic Places [NRHP] 78003147). The Acequia
Madre continued to supply water until the early 1900s.
The project area also includes a portion of a desague, or
return channel, which is mapped along Wickes Street.

The South Alamo Street-South St. Mary’s Street His­
toric District can be read as a physical chronicle of
San Antonio’s urban and architectural history. Con­
sidering the concentration of contributing structures,
the cohesiveness of the architectural fabric, and the
long period of continuous occupation distinguish this
area, this district remains the most intact, in compari­
son with other neighborhoods which were developed
contemporaneously. The district’s earliest documented
history links it to the mission lands, as it was part of
the fields cultivated to support life at the Mission San
Antonio de Valero.

The Spanish missions consumed spring water
exclusively until 1761 when a well was dug at the
Alamo in anticipation that hostile Indians would block
access to the river. Around 1776 a dam was built to
divert spring water into a second canal, the Upper
Labor ditch, which was associated with the San Pedro
Springs.

Known as labores, these fields were irrigated by ace­
quias, and worked by the missionaries and Indians
living at the Alamo. In 1793 the mission lands were
taken from the church, portioned into parcels called
suertes, and apportioned as land grants. Occupation
and division of the land did not begin until the second
quarter of the nineteenth century. At this time original
grantees began selling their land, and Ernst Wehrhahn
was the first to purchase a significant amount of prop­
erty, acquiring land in 1858 and 1860.

As the population of San Antonio grew during the
nineteenth century, the acequias could not meet the
demand and eventually became a source of disease
as people increasingly used them to dispose of waste
(Porter 2009:96). The canals also required constant
maintenance to keep them functioning properly. The
Espada Acequia is the only acequia that still flows
today.

The simple, traditional forms that predominate in the
South Alamo Street-South St. Mary’s Street Historic
District stand in sharp contrast to the more formal, more
architecturally elaborate houses of the King William
Historic District. Ernst Altgelt, who surveyed the three
main streets of the King William Historic District,
envisioned the area as an enclave of the wealthy lo­
cal, usually German, merchants. In contrast, the South
Alamo-South St. Mary’s Street Historic District was

area, along with icons representing the Alamo Methodist
Church and the St. Vincent de Paul Home for the Aged.
Significantly, a set of railroad tracks is depicted perpen­
dicular to S. Alamo Street, crossing just southwest of the
San Antonio River and servicing the Pioneer Flour Mill
(Figure 6). There are also spurs from this line servicing
the Blue Star warehouses. These tracks were encountered
during the survey as documented in the results section.

The 1889 map of San Antonio by J. J. Olsen depicts
streetcar tracks along S. Alamo Street throughout the
project area (Figure 4). Present-day Probandt Street is
labeled, “Aransas,” and the SA&APRR depot is shown
at the intersection of Aransas and S. Flores Streets. The
1903 U.S. Geological Survey map of San Antonio does
not provide much data, but some structures are depicted
adjacent to the project area.

The acequia and desague are included in the 1912 map of
San Antonio Officials, which also places the project area
within the Labor de los Mochos, and specifically within
parcels belonging to Pedro Huizar, Vicente Amador, and
Tomas Pereida (Figure 5). The 1927 U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers map of East San Antonio does not provide
much information, but streetcar tracks are again depicted
along S. Alamo Street throughout the project area.

A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area on a 1924 map of
San Antonio’s public transportation service (on file
with SA-OHP), while bus service is mapped along E.
Johnson and Adams Streets (Figure 7). The map also
depicts the railroad spurs for Pioneer Flour Mill and
Blue Star warehouses.

Finally, the 1953 Army Map Service map of east San
Antonio contains mainly general information, showing

end of the project area is the San Antonio Foundry
Company, J. J. Olsen and Son Steam Wood Yard, and
the SA&APRR.
A 12-inch water pipe is mapped along the centerline
of S. Alamo Street throughout the project area, while
6-inch water pipes are mapped along E. Guenther
and Pereida Streets. A wooden bridge spans the San
Antonio River. Nine houses and a store are depicted
adjacent to the project area, including homes at 407 E.
Guenther Street, 422 and 430 Pereida Street, and 1106,
1113, 1119, 1131, 1203, and 1231 S. Alamo Street. The
store is at 1108 S. Alamo Street at the intersection with
Pereida Street.

Initially, the cars were open to the elements, but were
later enclosed, and never air conditioned. The San
Antonio Traction Company was formed in 1901 by
consolidating four lines. Streetcars made Houston
Street the city’s main shopping area after merchants
along Commerce Street initially blocked streetcars
from using that narrow thoroughfare (Figure 8). San
Antonio’s streetcar system reached its peak at 90 miles
of track in 1926 (Hemphill 2013).

The 1904 Sanborn map (Sheets 17, 18, 22, 23, and 24)
contains much of the same information, except that S.
Alamo, E. Guenther, and Adams Streets are now paved,
a 6-inch water pipe is along Adams Street, and 11 more
residences are depicted along the project area (1208,

As the suburbs developed in hilly areas unsuitable for
streetcars, buses began to replace them. The San An­
tonio Traction Company and the San Antonio Gas and
Electric Company merged into the San Antonio Public
Service Company, which built the
city’s first bus in 1917 (Hemphill
2013). By the Great Depression,
streetcars had gained a reputation
for being both slow and filled with
unsavory passengers. San Antonio
became the first major U.S. city to
abandon streetcar service in 1933.
Afterwards, the four-foot-gauge
tracks were either ripped up or
paved over (Hemphill 2013).

1210, 1212, 1216, 1217, 1220, 1223, 1225, 1232, 1407,
and 1411 S. Alamo Street).
The 1912 Sanborn map (Volume 4, Sheets 351, 352,
356, 358, 361, and 380) continues to depict many of
the same elements, except that the wood yard is now
the Mission Wood and Coal Company, E. Johnson and
Wickes Streets are now paved, two new stores are at
1110 and 1112 S. Alamo Street, and three more resi­
dences are depicted at 1207 and 1215 S. Alamo Street,
and at 101 Adams Street.

The monitoring occurred during about a 3-month
period of construction activity. Specifically, these in­
volved the excavation of a series of trenches and bore
pits by a CPS Energy contractor. Work began southwest
of the San Antonio River near the intersection of S.
Alamo and Probandt Streets (Figures 9a and 9b, and
Table 1). The archaeologist monitored the construc­
tion activities from near the edge of the excavation;
frequently assessing both the excavation profiles and
spoils for cultural remains. Special attention was paid
to the horizons of disturbance and development directly
atop the native clay soil, which was usually found ap­
proximately 40–60 cmbs.

Industrial growth at the southwestern end of the proj­
ect area is evident in the 1912 Sanborn map that was
revised in 1952 (Volume 4, Sheets 351, 352, 356, 358,
361, and 380), where the foundry has been replaced
by a Home Freezers Sales and Service shop, and three
large warehouses have replaced the wood and coal
yard, including the Blue Star Ice and Cold Storage
Company. The railroad is now labeled the Southern
Pacific line and the bridge spanning the river is rein­
forced concrete. An Auto Wheel and Equipment shop
has replaced a residence at the corner of S. Alamo and
E. Guenther Streets, and the Alamo Methodist Church
is at the corner of S. Alamo and Wickes Streets. Several
residences have been converted into commercial or
religious properties, including 101 Adams Street, 422
Pereida Street, and 1113 and 1119 S. Alamo Street. A
store has been constructed at 1114 S. Alamo Street.

ProBandt Street to the San antonio
river
Trench 1 was about 10 m (32.8 feet) long, Trench 1A
was about 3 m (9.8 feet) long, and both were excavated
along the centerline of S. Alamo Street, about 2 m (6.6
feet) and 28 m (91.8 feet), respectively, from a railroad
spur that formerly serviced the Blue Star warehouse
facility and an historic foundry. Trench 1B adjoined
Trench 1 at its southwestern end, was perpendicular
to it, and was about 6 m (19.7 feet) long. The top
10–20 centimeters below surface (cmbs) in all trenches
excavated for this project was asphalt. Below that in
Trenches 1 and 1A was 40–50 cm of limestone gravel
conglomerate, while Trench 1B had a 10-cm thick
layer of concrete over 20 cm of the conglomerate.
Below that in all three trenches was intact silty clay
loam to about 1 m.

hIstorIcAl summAry
The Acequia Madre and its associated desague along
S. Alamo and Wickes Streets, respectively, was con­
structed between 1718 and 1744, and continued to sup­
ply water until the early 1900s. Both are contributing
element of the San Antonio Missions National Historic
Park, which is listed on the NRHP.

An iron railroad spike was encountered in Trench 1
along with eight wooden beams between 26–28 cmbs,
a buried utility pipe was exposed in Trench 1B, and
four wooden beams were encountered in Trench 1A
between 26–28 cmbs. The beams were perpendicular
to Trenches 1 and 1A, were spaced about 1 m (3.3
feet) apart, and are interpreted as the infrastructure for
a streetcar railway that existed along S. Alamo Street
between 1878–1933.

A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area. Railed streetcar ser­
vice was in operation in San Antonio from 1878–1933.
At the southwestern end of the project area are mapped
several spurs from the SA&APRR crossing S. Alamo
Street. The southwestern end of the project area has
been a center for industry from at least 1896, while
mainly residences have been mapped northeast of the
San Antonio River

Trench 2 was about 9 m (29.5 feet) long and excavated
along the centerline of S. Alamo Street about 8 m
(26.2 feet) northeast of Trench 1A (Figure 9a). Trench
2A adjoined Trench 2 near its mid-point, was almost
perpendicular to it, and was about 11 m (36.1 feet)
long. The stratigraphy was similar to Trenches 1 and

1A, except that a steel I-beam rail was encountered
in Trench 2 between 26–28 cmbs along with eight
wooden beams (Figures 10 and 11). The steel rail was
also perpendicular to Trench 2, and is interpreted as a
tributary spur that serviced the Blue Star warehouses
and connected to the main spur that went to the Pioneer
Flour Mill (see Figure 6).

This was the final trench excavated southwest of the San
Antonio River; work then transitioned to the opposite
side of the river, near the intersection of S. Alamo and
E. Guenther Streets.

e. Guenther Street to wiCkeS Street
Trench 5 was about 12 m (39.4 feet) long and excavated
northwest from the centerline of E. Guenther Street to
about 2 m (6.6 feet) beyond the edge of the ROW, and
about 27 m (88.6 feet) southeast of the street’s inter­
section with S. Alamo Street (Figure 9b). Trench 6
adjoined Trench 5 at its western end, was perpendicular
to it, and traversed about 12 m (39.4 feet) along the
centerline of E. Guenther Street. The soils in Trench 5
were mottled, which indicated prior disturbances; this
was confirmed by the presence of three gas lines and
two water lines.

Trench 3 was about 5 m (16.4 feet) long and excavated
along the centerline of S. Alamo Street about 23 m
(75.4 feet) northeast of Trench 2 (Figure 9a). Trench 3A
adjoined Trench 3 at its mid-point, was perpendicular
to it, and was about 11 m (36.1 feet) long. The stratig­
raphy in both was similar to Trench 1B in that they had
a 10-cm thick layer of concrete between 10–20 cmbs.
In Trench 3, a wooden beam was encountered at 26
cmbs, and a steel I-beam rail was found at 30 cmbs.
These were perpendicular to the trench and are inter­
preted as a tributary spur that serviced the Blue Star
warehouses (see Figure 6).

The soils in Trench 6 contrasted with those in Trench
5. The fill layer beneath the asphalt was over gray
loam with pebble and cobbles, which appeared intact.
Trench 7 was 2 m (6.6 feet) long, about 13 m (42.6
feet) northwest of Trench 6, and at the centerline of
E. Guenther Street and the southern edge of S. Alamo
Street. Trench 7 reached 2 m (6.6 feet) in depth and its
stratigraphy was consistent with Trench 6.

Trench 4 was about 4 m (13.1 feet) long and excavated
along the centerline of S. Alamo Street about 24 m
(78.7 feet) northeast of Trench 3 (Figure 9a). Trench 4A
adjoined Trench 4 at its mid-point, was perpendicular
to it, and was about 19 m (62.3 feet) long. Trench 4A
extended beyond the ROW for about 8 m (26.2 feet)
to a water meter on private property. The stratigraphy
in both was similar to Trench 1B, with a 10-cm thick
layer of concrete between 10–20 cmbs.

Trench 8 adjoined the northern end of Trench 7 and
extended diagonally across the S. Alamo Street intersec­
tion for about 30 m (98.4 feet), ending about 10 m (32.8
feet) northeast of the intersection (Figure 9b). Streetcar
rails were encountered in this trench five times across
S. Alamo Street, along with four different utility lines.

Three steel I-beam rails were encountered in Trench
4 between 26–28 cmbs, and they were perpendicular
to the trench. These rails are interpreted as the main
spur that went to the Pioneer Flour Mill (see Figure 6).

Trench 8 was then extended to the northeast along the
northern edge of the S. Alamo Street ROW for 13 m
(42.6 feet), and three different utility lines were encoun­
tered. Trench 9 adjoined Trench 8 at its mid-point, was
perpendicular to it, and was about 17 m (55.8 feet) long
(Figure 9b). A streetcar rail was encountered in Trench
9, along with three different utility lines.

Next, two trenches were excavated along the centerline
of Wickes Street. Trench 16 was 6 m (19.7 feet) long
and about 13 m (42.6 feet) south of S. Alamo Street and
Trench 17. A gas line was encountered in Trench 16.
Although Trench 17 was only 3 m (9.8 feet) long, five
utilities and a storm drain were apparent in its profile.
A series of trenches were then excavated along the
northern margin of the S. Alamo Street ROW, between
E. Johnson and Pereida Streets, including Trenches 22,
23, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 (Figure 9b). Wooden beams
probably associated with the streetcar infrastructure
were encountered in Trenches 22 and 31, while utilities
were found in Trenches 22 and 28.

Trench 10 was about 5 m (16.4 feet) long and excavated
along the edge of the S. Alamo Street ROW, about 34
m (111.5 feet) northeast of Trench 8 (Figure 9b). Three
utility lines were encountered in this trench. Trench 11
was about 10 m (32.8 feet) northeast of Trench 10, was
perpendicular to it, and spanned the entire ROW for
20 m (65.6 feet). A streetcar rail was encountered in
this trench, along with four different utility lines and
modern trash (brick fragment and tin can).

Trench 24 was about 17 m (55.8 feet) long, 8 m (26.2
feet) north of the S. Alamo Street ROW on private
property, and terminated at an existing gas main (Fig­
ure 9b). Trench 25 was a 2-m (6.6-foot) square trench
along the centerline of Adams Street and about 12 m
(39.4 feet) south of S. Alamo Street. Trench 26 was
about 5 m (16.4 feet) long and excavated along the
edge of the Pereida Street ROW, about 41 m (134.5
feet) northeast of the street’s intersection with Adams
Street. Finally, Trench 32 was an elbow shaped trench
that began at the intersection of S. Alamo and Pereida
Streets and extended northeast along S. Alamo Street
for about 12 m (39.4 feet).

A series of small trenches were then excavated along
the edge of the ROW between Trench 11 and the in­
tersection of S. Alamo and E. Johnson Streets (Figure
9b). Trench 12 was 3 m (9.8 feet) long and about 44 m
(144.3 feet) southwest of the intersection). Trench 13
was 4 m (13.1 feet) long and about 7 m southwest of
Trench 12. Two trenches, 14 and 14A, were excavated
about 15 m (49.2) southwest of Trench 13, and were
2 m (6.6 feet) and 3 m (9.8 feet) long, respectively. A
water line was evident in both of these trench profiles.
Trenches 18 and 19 were each 3 m (9.8 feet) long and
excavated along the opposite side of S. Alamo Street
from Trenches 14A and 13, respectively (Figure 9b).
A telephone line was encountered in Trench 18, while
Trench 19 revealed the same utility plus two gas lines.

summAry And recommendAtIons
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted archival
research and cultural resources monitoring of a
construction project along S. Alamo Street from
Probandt Street to Pereida Street in Bexar County. All
work was done in accordance with the standards and
guidelines of the THC and CTA under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 6340. Monitoring was accomplished at
the request of the SA-OHP because a portion of the
Acequia Madre traverses the length of the project along
S. Alamo and Wickes streets. The Acequia Madre is
a contributing element of the San Antonio Missions
National Historic Park.

Trench 20 was excavated about 2 m (6.6 feet) south­
west of Trench 12 and spanned the entire width of S.
Alamo (Figure 9b). A streetcar rail was uncovered near
the centerline of the street, and five utilities were also
documented in this trench.
Trench 21 was about 10 m (32.8 feet) long and ex­
cavated along the edge of the S. Alamo Street ROW,
adjacent to the southern end of Trench 11 (Figure 9b).
Three different utility lines and modern trash were
encountered in this trench.

The work performed by SWCA included in-depth
historical and archival research followed by intensive
archaeological construction monitoring in an effort to
identify, record, and characterize any extant historic
resources or deposits within the project area, with a
focus on the Spanish Colonial period when the acequia
would have been constructed and in use, and on midnineteenth century resources.

Trench 15 was T-shaped, about 3 m (9.8 feet) long,
and at the S. Alamo and E. Johnson Street intersection
(Figure 9b). A water line was documented in Trench 15.

Subsequent to the archival research, SWCA’s intensive
archaeological monitoring was performed during the
excavation of a series of trenches by a CPS Energy
contractor from November 5, 2012, to February 1,
2013. The goal of the work was to examine and assess
any cultural deposits revealed in the construction,
adequately document the cultural resources, and
provide sufficient information to make determinations
on age and significance.

The southwestern end of the project area has been a
center for industry from at least 1896, while mainly
residences have been mapped northeast of the San
Antonio River. Multiple utility lines were encountered
within trenches throughout the project area related to
this development.
Spanning nearly 3 months, the construction monitoring
identified cultural debris dating mainly to the twentieth
century within the project area. Besides traces of the
streetcar and railroad spurs, no artifacts or features
were encountered that date any earlier than the twen­
tieth century. Overall, no definitive evidence was en­
countered in the project area that could be associated
with the Spanish Colonial or the Republic of Texas
eras. All work within the project area was conducted
within extensively disturbed deposits predominantly
dating to the twentieth century.

The archival review found that the Acequia Madre
and its associated desague along S. Alamo and Wickes
Streets, respectively, was constructed between 1718
and 1744, and continued to supply water until the early
1900s. No indication of the acequia or the desague was
revealed by the excavations.
A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area. Railed streetcar ser­
vice was in operation in San Antonio from 1878–1933.
At the southwestern end of the project area are mapped
several spurs from the SA&APRR crossing S. Alamo
Street. Steel rails and wooden infrastructure associ­
ated with these features were repeatedly encountered
throughout the project area.

SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to iden­
tify historic properties within the project area. Based
on the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavations
within the S. Alamo Street Drainage project had no
effect on significant cultural properties and no further
archaeological work is recommended.

APPENDIX
ADDENDUM 1: ADDITIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL
MONITORING INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE SOUTH ALAMO
STREET DRAINAGE PROJECT, BEXAR COUNTY, TEXAS

ABSTRACT
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted archival background
research and cultural resources monitoring of a pole replacement construction project along S. Alamo
Street from Probandt Street to Pereida Street in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6340. In 2014, CPS Energy requested an amendment to the boundary and scope of
the permit in association with the 2013 gas main utility work (Galindo 2013).The additional work consists
of the removal and/or replacement of 38 electric poles along South Alamo Street from Probandt Street to
Pereida Street. Of these 38 pole removal/replacements, 17 were reviewed for archaeological monitoring
due to their proximity to the Acequia Madre and its associated desague. However, only 13 poles were
monitored—as two poles were only removed from their existing locations and one was left in place.
Monitoring investigations were abandoned for one pole due to adjacent construction activities related to
other utility installations. The area of potential effects involved excavation of pole replacements within
the existing 50-foot rights-of-way of city streets. The excavations were 24 inches in diameter and
approximately 8 to 9 feet in depth.
The work performed by SWCA included in-depth historical and archival research followed by intensive
archaeological construction monitoring in an effort to identify, record, and characterize any extant historic
resources or deposits within the project area, with a focus on the Spanish Colonial period and midnineteenth century resources. The archival review determined that the Acequia Madre and its associated
desague, constructed between 1718 and 1744, are mapped along S. Alamo and Wickes Streets,
respectively. A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo Street throughout the project area and the
southwestern end of the project area has been a center for industry since at least 1896. Multiple residences
are mapped northeast of the San Antonio River based on Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed from March 21–27, 2014. The excavations
of the pole replacements revealed disturbed contexts with traces of the streetcar foundations, possible
lithic materials, and a concentration of red brick fragments observed within some pole locations. The
lithic materials were considered isolated finds due to the lack of diagnostic materials, the lack of evidence
of features, and that no other artifacts or features were encountered that date earlier than the early
twentieth century. No evidence of the acequia or desague was observed during the pole replacement
excavations. Overall, no definitive evidence was encountered in the project area that could be associated
with the Spanish Colonial or the Republic of Texas eras. All work within the project area was conducted
within extensively disturbed deposits predominantly dating to the early-to-mid-twentieth century.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the pole replacement
project area. Based on the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavations within the S. Alamo Street
Drainage project had no effect on significant cultural properties and no further archaeological work is
recommended.

approximately 1,300 feet, and the adjacent 100 to
200 feet ROW along Guenther, Wickes, Johnson,
Adams, and Pereida Streets, for a total length of
approximately 1,520 feet (Figure 2). The area of
potential effects (APE) involved excavation of
pole replacements within the existing ROWs of
city streets. The excavations were 24 inches in
diameter and approximately 8 to 9 feet in depth.
Thus, the APE is approximately 1.7 acres in size
and involved approximately 40 cubic yards of
disturbance.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted additional cultural
resources monitoring of a pole replacement project
along South Alamo (S. Alamo) Street from
Probandt Street to Pereida Street in Bexar County,
Texas (Figure 1). Construction activities consisted
of the removal and/or replacement of 38 electrical
poles along the right-of-way (ROW) of S. Alamo
Street from Probandt Street to Pereida Street. Of
these 38 pole removal/replacements, 17 were
reviewed for archaeological monitoring due to
their proximity to the Acequia Madre and its
associated desague that traverses the length of the
project area along S. Alamo and Wickes streets.
The Acequia Madre is a contributing element of
the San Antonio Missions National Historic Park
(National Register of Historic Places [NRHP]
78003147).

Of the 38 poles to be removed/replaced, 17 were
within an area that required monitoring based on
the proximity of the mapped Acequia Madre (also
known as Alamo Ditch) drainage channel that is
mapped along S. Alamo Street (Cox 2005; Figure
3). Additionally, a desague, or return canal, from
the main channel travels down Wickes Street, a
portion of which is also within the project area
(City of San Antonio Office of Historic
Preservation [SA-OHP] Acequia Map Sheet 16­
57). However, only 13 poles were monitored, as
two poles were only removed from their existing
locations and one was left in place. Monitoring
investigations were abandoned for one pole due to
adjacent construction activities related to other
utility installations.

In 2013, archaeological monitoring was conducted
by SWCA under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
6340 for the replacement of a new CPS Energy
gas line within the defined project area.
Monitoring efforts focused on the excavation of a
series of trenches that totaled 1,520 feet long by
1.5 to 2 feet deep. Overall, SWCA found that
trenching activities were conducted in areas of
extensive disturbance, and no impacts were made
to significant cultural deposits. These findings
were concurred with by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in April of 2013 (Galindo
2013).

The goal of archaeological monitoring activities
was to examine and assess any cultural deposits
revealed in the excavation, adequately document
the cultural resources, and provide sufficient
information to make determinations on age and
significance. All work was done in accordance
with the standards and guidelines of the THC and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6340.

In 2014, CPS Energy requested an amendment to
the boundary and scope of Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 6340 for the additional pole
replacement activities in association with the 2013
gas line work. The extension was granted and
archaeological monitoring efforts were conducted
by SWCA for the pole removal/replacement
portion of the S. Alamo project area from March
21–27, 2014. This report will be included as an
appendix to the original report for final reporting
requirements.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
Located south of downtown San Antonio, Texas,
the project area is in a highly developed urban
setting on a level floodplain straddling the San
Antonio River, about 1.0 mile south-southwest of
the Alamo in Bexar County. The project area
traverses a largely residential area of late­
nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century structures
south of San Antonio’s main commercial district.

The S. Alamo project area is within the existing
50-foot-wide ROW of S. Alamo Street for

A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area. Railed streetcar
service was in operation in San Antonio from 1878
to 1933. The southwestern end of the project area
has been a center for industry since at least 1896,
and several spurs from the San Antonio and
Aransas Pass Railroad (SA&APRR) are mapped
crossing S. Alamo Street. At present, the industrial
warehouses have been transformed into the Blue
Star Art Complex, a mixed-use development that
has sparked a revitalization of the area. The pole
relocation project is part of ongoing beautification
efforts within the South Alamo Street-South
Mary’s Street NRHP District. These efforts
included the addition of new street lights, the
planting of new trees, and the widening of
sidewalks to accommodate handicap pedestrian
traffic.

ranging from 60 to 80 percent. These are cyclic
soils, with cycles of microknolls and microbasins
repeated at linear intervals of 6 to 12 feet (Taylor
et al. 1991:21; NRCS 2012).
The Lewisville series consists of moderately deep
soils on nearly level alluvial terraces of the San
Antonio River (Taylor et al. 1991:25; NRCS
2012). The Frio series are limy alluvial soils that
are moderately deep and found on the floodplain
of the river (Taylor et al. 1991:16; NRCS 2012).

METHODS
CULTURAL SETTING AND BACKGROUND
REVIEW
Prior to any ground-disturbing activities and
monitoring, SWCA conducted a comprehensive
examination of available historic maps, records,
and archives to reconstruct the history of the
project area, from the earliest Spanish Colonial
period to present. This section provides a review
of the cultural setting for the project area under
examination. The research concentrated on historic
ownership and occupation of the project area to
develop a general history and identify any
significant landmarks or places that should be
considered during the project development. The
focus was on the Spanish Colonial period, but also
included the history of the tract up through the
1950s.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY
Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100
percent Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits.
Fluviatile Terrace deposits are made of
predominately gravel, limestone, dolomite, and
chert (Fisher 1983). The deposits also consist of
sand, silt, and clay. Most low terrace deposits
along entrenched streams are above flood level
(Fisher 1983).

SOILS

SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if
any archaeological sites have been recorded within
or adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an
SWCA archaeologist reviewed the San Antonio
East (2998-133) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map at Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
searched the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) and site files at TARL. These sources
provided information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resource sites,
locations of NRHP properties, sites designated as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), Official
Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Registered

The project area soil northeast of the San Antonio
River is mapped as 100 percent Houston Black
clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Taylor et al.
1991:Map Sheet 53–54; Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2012). Southwest of
the river, the soils are mapped as 85 percent
Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes,
and the remainder is Frio clay loam (Taylor et al.
1991:Map Sheet 53; NRCS 2012).
The Houston series consists of moderately welldrained, slowly permeable, cyclic soils that formed
in alkaline clays and chalk of the Blackland
Prairies. Houston soils are on nearly level to
sloping uplands. These clayey soils have very high
shrink-swell potential. Depth to bedrock ranges
from 4 to 9 feet. The soil is clay throughout,

attention was to be given to any cultural resources
that may date to the early- to mid-nineteenth
century.

Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys.
Additional sources of information that were
consulted included published reports, aerial
photographs, records at the Texas Natural
Resources Information Systems (TNRIS) archives,
Bureau of Economic Geology Maps, the NRCS
Web Soil Survey, and a 1924 San Antonio public
transportation map. Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay maps
from 1871, 1883, 1887, 1889, 1903, 1912, 1927,
and 1953 were consulted, along with Sanborn Fire
Insurance maps, to identify the presence of
potential historic-age structures. The results of the
archival work are presented here, integrated into a
general cultural history of the surrounding area
followed by an examination of the built
environment through time.

When intact cultural resources were revealed in
the construction process, the archaeologist
attempted to make a determination as to potential
significance. At this point, construction was
temporarily halted so that the archaeologist could
better examine the cultural materials or features,
take photographs, and thoroughly document the
finds. Once the materials were assessed,
construction recommenced, and continued as
planned. Only if the materials were assessed as
extremely significant (e.g., human remains or
burials) was construction in the immediate area to
be halted. If a localized work stoppage was
required, the monitoring archaeologist would
immediately call all involved parties (CPS Energy,
THC, SA-OHP, etc.) to discuss the find and
formulate a plan of action. However, over the
course of the project it was not necessary to
implement this emergency contingency plan.

FIELD METHODS
As part of the compliance process, the SA-OHP
requested that an archaeologist monitor the
excavations by a CPS Energy contractor along
both S. Alamo Street and Wickes Street. The goal
of the monitoring was to gather information on the
nature and types of cultural resources possibly
buried in the project area with a focus on
potentially significant resources related to the
Spanish Colonial era in general and, specifically,
the Acequia Madre and its associated desague.

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts were described in
detail and photographed in the field.

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that the
project area was previously surveyed in 1979 and
that no previously recorded sites are within or
adjacent to the project area; however, the project is
within the boundary of the South Alamo StreetSouth Mary’s Street NRHP District, and it is also
adjacent to the King Williams NRHP District and
the Blue Star Industrial NRHP District. As
previously mentioned, the Acequia Madre, a
contributing element of the San Antonio Missions
National Historic Park, is within the project area,
mapped along both S. Alamo and Wickes streets.

The archaeologist coordinated all field activities
with appropriate personnel and any on-site
construction foremen regarding scheduling and
safety. The monitoring archaeologist attended a
pre-construction meeting to ensure full
coordination prior to construction. The
archaeologist complied with all applicable
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
safety regulations and wore all required safety
equipment (e.g., hardhat and steel-toed boots).
Monitoring consisted of a qualified archaeologist
observing the excavation process, the excavation
area, and their resulting fill, frequently inspecting
it for cultural remains. If encountered, artifacts
were examined, quantified, assessed as to age and
origin, and were not collected. Diagnostic artifacts
or those of particular interest were to be collected
for further study in SWCA labs. Particular

Six sites (41BX236, 41BX303, 41BX326,
41BX342, 41BX351, and 41BX622) and four

(Figure 5). The 1927 USACE map of East San
Antonio does not provide much information, but
streetcar tracks are again depicted along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area.

The project area was included in a reconnaissance
survey along with a large swath of downtown
paralleling the San Antonio River in 1979 on
behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Fort Worth District (Atlas 2012). There
is no Antiquities Permit number associated with
this project and the report contains only general,
locational information regarding historic structures
and prehistoric sites (Fox 1979). The current
project area is not mentioned in this report.

Finally, the 1953 Army Map Service map of east
San Antonio contains mainly general information,
showing the industrial area at the southwestern end
of the project area, along with icons representing the
Alamo Methodist Church and the St. Vincent de
Paul Home for the Aged. Significantly, a set of
railroad tracks is depicted perpendicular to S. Alamo
Street, crossing just southwest of the San Antonio
River and servicing the Pioneer Flour Mill (Figure
6). There are also spurs from this line servicing the
Blue Star warehouses.

S. Alamo Street is the southeastern boundary of
the King William Historic District and the
northern boundary of the S. Alamo Street-S. St.
Mary’s Street Historic District. The three closest
sites to the project area include 41BX236,
41BX326, and 41BX342. All three are within the
King William National Register Historic District,
while two others (41BX351 and 41BX622) are
within the U.S. San Antonio Arsenal National
Register Historic District and site 41BX303 is
within the La Villita Historic District. Detail on
each of the districts and acequia are outlined in the
original report (Galindo 2013).

1924 SAN ANTONIO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
MAP
A double streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo
Street throughout the project area on a 1924 map
of San Antonio’s public transportation service (on
file with SA-OHP), while bus service is mapped
along E. Johnson and Adams Streets (Figure 7).
The map also depicts the railroad spurs for Pioneer
Flour Mill and Blue Star warehouses.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW

Railed streetcar service in San Antonio began in
1878, and for the first few years the cars were
pulled by horses or mules (Hemphill 2013). The
first line operated between Alamo Plaza and San
Pedro Park, followed by a line down S. Flores
Street to the SA&APRR depot in 1884. Service
became electrified in 1890, after the completion of
San Antonio’s first large power generating station.

Eight maps from the TxDOT Historic Overlay
(Foster et al. 2006) dating from 1871–1953 were
reviewed. The 1871 and 1887 maps of Bexar
County did not contain information specific to the
project area; however, the 1883 C. P. Smith map of
San Antonio depicts the study area within Ward No.
4, and illustrates the acequia and desague along S.
Alamo and Wickes Streets, respectively.

Initially, the cars were open to the elements, but
were later enclosed, and never air conditioned.
The San Antonio Traction Company was formed
in 1901 by consolidating four lines. Streetcars
made Houston Street the city’s main shopping area
after merchants along Commerce Street initially
blocked streetcars from using that narrow
thoroughfare. San Antonio’s streetcar system
reached its peak at 90 miles of track in 1926
(Hemphill 2013).

The 1889 map of San Antonio by J. J. Olsen depicts
streetcar tracks along S. Alamo Street throughout
the project area (Figure 4). Present-day Probandt
Street is labeled, “Aransas,” and the SA&APRR
depot is shown at the intersection of Aransas and S.
Flores Streets. The 1903 USGS map of San Antonio
does not provide much data, but some structures are
depicted adjacent to the project area.
The acequia and desague are included in the 1912
map of San Antonio Officials, which also places the
project area within the Labor de los Mochos, and
specifically within parcels belonging to Pedro

The 1912 Sanborn map (Volume 4, Sheets 351,
352, 356, 358, 361, and 380) continues to depict
many of the same elements, except that the wood
yard is now the Mission Wood and Coal
Company, E. Johnson and Wickes Streets are now
paved, two new stores are at 1110 and 1112 S.
Alamo Street, and three more residences are
depicted at 1207 and 1215 S. Alamo Street, and at
101 Adams Street.

As the suburbs developed in hilly areas unsuitable
for streetcars, buses began to replace them. The
San Antonio Traction Company and the San
Antonio Gas and Electric Company merged into
the San Antonio Public Service Company, which
built the city’s first bus in 1917 (Hemphill 2013).
By the Great Depression, streetcars had gained a
reputation for being both slow and filled with
unsavory passengers. San Antonio became the first
major U.S. city to abandon streetcar service in
1933. Afterwards, the 4-foot-gauge tracks were
either ripped up or paved over (Hemphill 2013).

Industrial growth at the southwestern end of the
project area is evident in the 1912 Sanborn map
that was revised in 1952 (Volume 4, Sheets 351,
352, 356, 358, 361, and 380), where the foundry
has been replaced by a Home Freezers Sales and
Service shop, and three large warehouses have
replaced the wood and coal yard, including the
Blue Star Ice and Cold Storage Company. The
railroad is now labeled the Southern Pacific line
and the bridge spanning the river is reinforced
concrete.

SANBORN FIRE INSURANCE MAPS
Six Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps were reviewed
for the project area. The earliest maps (1885,
1888, and 1892) illustrate only C. H. Guenther’s
Lower Mills to the north of the project area along
the San Antonio River; however, more details are
depicted beginning with the 1896 map (Sheets 36–
40). At the southwestern end of the project area is
the San Antonio Foundry Company, J. J. Olsen
and Son Steam Wood Yard, and the SA&APRR.

An Auto Wheel and Equipment shop has replaced
a residence at the corner of S. Alamo and E.
Guenther Streets, and the Alamo Methodist
Church is at the corner of S. Alamo and Wickes
Streets. Several residences have been converted
into commercial or religious properties, including
101 Adams Street, 422 Pereida Street, and 1113
and 1119 S. Alamo Street. A store has been
constructed at 1114 S. Alamo Street.

A 12-inch water pipe is mapped along the
centerline of S. Alamo Street throughout the
project area, while 6-inch water pipes are mapped
along E. Guenther and Pereida Streets. The 1888
and 1892 maps depict an iron bridge with adjacent
foot bridges that span the San Antonio River. Nine
houses and a store are depicted adjacent to the
project area, including homes at 407 E. Guenther
Street, 422 and 430 Pereida Street, and 1106,
1113, 1119, 1131, 1203, and 1231 S. Alamo
Street. The store is at 1108 S. Alamo Street at the
intersection with Pereida Street.

RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
MONITORING
Archaeological
monitoring
for
pole
removal/replacement within the S. Alamo project
area occurred between March 21–27, 2014. Of the
38 poles, 17 (Poles 3, 5–11, 12–15, 17–18, and
21–23) were within an area that required
monitoring, and of these, only 13 were actually
monitored. Poles 3, 5–9, 12–14, 17, and 21–23
were monitored during construction activities
(Figure 8). Pole 11 and Pole 15 were removals
only and Pole 10 was left in place. Monitoring
investigations were abandoned for Pole 18 due to
adjacent construction activities related to other
utility installations. Pole replacement holes were
typically excavated with an industrial auger drill,
although three holes (Pole 9, Pole 14, and Pole 17)
were excavated by hand due to the presence of

The 1904 Sanborn map (Sheets 17, 18, 22, 23, and
24) contains much of the same information, except
that S. Alamo, E. Guenther, and Adams Streets are
now paved, a 6-inch water pipe is along Adams
Street, and 11 more residences are depicted along
the project area (1208, 1210, 1212, 1216, 1217,
1220, 1223, 1225, 1232, 1407, and 1411 S. Alamo
Street). The bridge across the San Antonio River is
labeled as a “macadamized wooden bridge,”
suggesting the bridge was improved or
reconstructed sometime between 1892 and 1904.

buried, live utility lines within close proximity to
the excavation area.

The average soil profile for Pole 6, 21 and Pole 22
consisted of:


0–2 feet: Brown to Dark Yellowish Brown
Clay Loam with gravels



2–8.5 feet: Light Gravy Silty Clay Loam
with gravels (Figure 10)

Pole replacements were not excavated in a
systematic order, but were instead dictated by the
presence or absence of obstacles that would have
an effect on excavation duration (e.g. existing
utility
lines,
uncut
concrete
sidewalks,
overhanging trees, the spreading of existing live
lines). Because of this non-systematic excavation
process, additional pole replacements were
monitored that were not needed. The archaeologist
monitored the construction activities from near the
edge of the excavation; frequently assessing both
the excavation profiles and spoils for cultural
remains. Each time the mechanical auger bit was
withdrawn from the hole, the operator would spin
it in reverse, releasing the matrix from the bit onto
the ground for examination by the archaeologist.
Special attention was paid to the horizons of
disturbance and development directly atop the
native clay soil, which was usually found
approximately 6 to 10 feet below ground surface.

A concentration of red brick fragments were
observed between 3 to 9 feet below ground surface
in the auger hole for Pole 6, but were located
within highly disturbed soil deposits (Figure 11).
In addition to the main auger hole for the pole
replacement, Pole 21 and Pole 22 had anchor poles
excavated approximately 15 to 20 feet from the
base of the main pole. Anchor holes were
excavated to a depth of 8.5 feet, and consisted of
the same average soil profile of the main pole
replacement. All excavated soils from these pole
replacement and associated anchor excavations
were highly disturbed and contained no significant
cultural materials.

POLE REPLACEMENT 3, 8, 12, AND 13

POLE REPLACEMENT 9 AND 14

Four of the 14 pole replacements within the APE
for the S. Alamo project area (Poles 3, 8, 12, and
13) were excavated with an mechanical auger bit
to 8 to 9 feet below ground surface. The average
diameter of the poles was 24 inches. All excavated
soils from these pole replacement excavations
were highly disturbed and contained no significant
cultural materials. The average soil profile for the
four holes consisted of:

Pole 9 and Pole 14 are pole replacements that were
excavated by hand, using extending shovels and
hand-held jackhammers. These pole replacements
were set in locations next to active, buried utility
lines which prevented the use of the industrial
auger. Numerous abandoned and live utility pipes
and conduits were encountered during the
excavation of these two holes. All excavated soils
from Pole 9 and Pole 14 replacements were highly
disturbed and contained no cultural materials. The
average depth for Pole 9 and Pole 14 was 9 feet,
and the average diameter was 24 inches. The
average soil profile for hand-excavated pole
replacements consisted of:



0–2 feet: Brown to Dark Yellowish Brown
Clay Loam with gravels



2–7 feet: Very Pale Brown Clay Loam
with caliche and gravels



7–9 feet: Reddish Yellow Clay Loam with
gravels (Figure 9)

POLE REPLACEMENT 6, 21, AND 22
Pole 21 and Pole 22 were excavated to a depth of
8 to 8.5 feet below ground surface. These two pole
replacements were excavated with a mechanical
auger bit with an average 24-inch diameter shaft.



0–3 feet: Brown Clay Loam with gravels



0–9 feet: Yellow Gravelly Clay with
mottling (Figure 12)

POLE REPLACEMENT 5 AND 23
Pole 5 and Pole 23 were excavated to an average
depth of 9 feet below ground surface. A
mechanical auger bit was used for excavations
with an average 24-inch diameter shaft. The
average soil profile for Pole 6 and Pole 23
consisted of:
 0–1 feet: Brown Clay Loam with gravels

Figure 10. Profile of auger hole for Pole 6
replacement, plan view.

 1–1.5 feet: Concrete
 1.5–9 feet: Yellow Gravelly Clay with
mottling (Figure 13)
A concrete slab approximately 20 centimeters
(cm) thick was encountered at approximately 30 to
40 cm below ground surface in the excavations of
Pole 5 and Pole 23 (seen in the upper levels of
Figure 13. This concrete slab is likely what
remains of the 1920s double–track streetcar line
that ran down S. Alamo. All excavated soils from
these two pole replacements were highly disturbed
and contained no cultural materials, with the
exception of the concrete slab.

drill bore pit. The SAWS excavations consisted of
a large bore pit, measuring approximately 100 feet
in length and approximately the span of the South
Alamo Street ROW for a directional drill below
the San Antonio River. Pole 17 and its associated
anchor hole were excavated by hand due to the
adjacent construction activities. The main pole
excavations were expanded upon due to the
previous pole also set within the S. Alamo Street
sidewalk. The soil profile for Pole 17 and anchor
pole consisted of:

Pole 7 was excavated by a mechanical auger bit to
a depth of 9 feet and a diameter of 24 inches. At a
depth of approximately 5 feet below ground
surface, two secondary chert flakes were observed
in the backdirt pile, along with 5 to 10 possible
chert shatter. However, signs of possible
mechanical crushing on the chert shatter is present,
and may be the result of sediment gravel being
mechanically crushed from excavation activities.
The presence of mechanically crushed chert was a
common occurrence throughout the S. Alamo
project area. No distinctive features or diagnostic
artifacts were observed within the profile or
encountered within the spoil pile. As such, the
materials are considered isolated finds. The soil
profile for Pole 7 consisted of:


0-3 feet: Brown to Dark Yellowish Brown
Clay Loam with gravels



3–9 feet: Yellow Clay Loam with gravels
(Figure 14)



0–6 feet: Dark Yellowish Brown Sandy
Clay Loam with gravel fill, sand, and
mottled soils;



6–7.5 feet: Very Pale Brown Sandy Silt
Loam with mottling;



7.5–8.5 feet: Reddish Yellow Sandy Silt
Loam with gravels;



8.5–9 feet: Very Pale Brown Silty Loam
with mottling (Figure 15).

The hand-dug excavations for Pole 17 revealed
highly disturbed soils related to the previous pole
installation and other construction disturbances
likely associated with the San Antonio River
bridge.

The excavations for Pole 18 were postponed due
to construction activities for the SAWS bore pit.
The bore pit intersects a portion of the mapped
Acequia Madre within South Alamo Street (Figure
16). Based on the disturbances encountered during
the Pole 17 excavations and the proximity of the
bore pit excavations, SWCA consulted with the
SA-OHP to suspend monitoring of Pole 18.
SWCA drafted a letter to the THC for approval to
terminate monitoring investigations on Pole 18,
and the THC concurred on October 8, 2014.

excavations. Overall, no definitive evidence was
encountered in the project area that could be
associated with the Spanish Colonial or the
Republic of Texas eras. All work within the
project area was conducted within extensively
disturbed deposits predominantly dating to the
early-to-mid-twentieth century.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted
additional cultural resources monitoring of a
construction project along S. Alamo Street from
Probandt Street to Pereida Street in Bexar County,
Texas. Construction activities consisted of the
removal and/or replacement of 38 electrical poles
along S. Alamo Street from Probandt Street to
Pereida
Street.
Of
these
38
pole
removal/replacements, 14 required archaeological
monitoring due to the proximity of the historic
Acequia Madre and its associated desague that
traverses the length of the project area along S.
Alamo and Wickes streets. One pole replacement,
Pole 18, was not monitored.

SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify historic properties within the pole
replacement project area. Based on the results of
the monitoring efforts, the excavations within the
S. Alamo Street Drainage project had no effect on
significant cultural properties and no further
archaeological work is recommended.

The work performed by SWCA included in-depth
historical and archival research followed by
intensive archaeological construction monitoring
in an effort to identify, record, and characterize
any extant historic resources or deposits within the
project area, with a focus on the Spanish Colonial
period when the acequia would have been
constructed and in use, and on mid-nineteenth
century resources.
The archival review determined that the Acequia
Madre and its associated desague, constructed
between 1718 and 1744, are mapped along S.
Alamo and Wickes Streets, respectively. A double
streetcar track is mapped along S. Alamo Street
throughout the project area. The southwestern end
of the project area has been a center for industry
since at least 1896. Based on Sanborn Maps,
multiple residences are mapped northeast of the
San Antonio River.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was
performed from March 21–27, 2014. The
excavations of the pole replacements revealed
disturbed contexts with traces of the streetcar
foundations, possible lithic materials, and a
concentration of red brick fragments observed
within some pole locations. The lithic materials
were considered isolated finds due to the lack of
diagnostic materials, the lack of evidence of
features, and that no other artifacts or features
were encountered that date earlier than the early
twentieth century. No evidence of the acequia or
desague was observed during the pole replacement
