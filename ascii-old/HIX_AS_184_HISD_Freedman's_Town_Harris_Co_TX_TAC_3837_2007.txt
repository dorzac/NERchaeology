Abstract

ABSTRACT
Between May of 2005 and October of 2006, Hicks & Company undertook an
extensive archeological research project in advance of construction of the
Houston Independent School District’s (HISD) new Gregory Lincoln School in
Houston, Harris County, Texas. The project involved archival research, a GPR
survey, archeological testing, analysis and monitoring of a ten-block area in
downtown Houston as part of HISD’s efforts to comply with the Antiquities Code
of Texas. The investigations focused on determining whether graves were present
in the project area and sought to document historic archeological remains
associated with a late nineteenth and early twentieth century community,
comprised primarily of African Americans and Italian immigrants, in Houston’s
4th Ward. Archival research determined land use, ownership and occupation
history for each lot of each block in the project area. The GPR survey
documented no graves within the areas sampled and was generally inconclusive.
Archeological testing consisted of 55 Gradall trenches and 32 square meters of
test units and documented a number of features pertaining to early twentieth
century African American households. No intact features pertaining to Italian
American residences and stores were investigated. No graves were identified
either through testing or subsequent monitoring.
Investigators assigned
trinomials to each block investigated (Sites 41HR1008-10017). Subsequent
analysis has revealed some specificity with respect to consumption patterns
among African Americans in the early twentieth century. None of the sites
investigated were determined eligible as State Archeological Landmarks and the
project was allowed to proceed with no further investigations.
All artifacts from the project were saved and cataloged, but due to the redundant
nature of many of the artifacts, only representative or diagnostic pieces were
permanently curated. The designated curatorial facility for this project is the
Center for Archaeological Research in San Antonio. All project related field
notes, photographs, specimen inventories, and saved artifacts will be
permanently stored at that facility.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT
SUMMARY
On behalf of the Houston Independent School District (HISD), Hicks & Company
(H&C) undertook a multidisciplinary archeological research, survey, and testing
project in Houston’s 4th Ward in advance of the construction of the new Gregory
Lincoln School. The property to be developed is bounded by Dallas and Gray
Streets on the north and south, and by Genesee and Taft Streets on the east and
west. The property owned by HISD includes the site of the already existing
Gregory Lincoln Elementary School, covering a total of about 16 acres and 14
blocks of varying size and shape. Though HISD owns 14 blocks proposed for
redevelopment, the actual project area included only 10 blocks. Blocks 34, 35
and 38 of the Boercher’s Extension of Castania, Blocks 1-6 of the Powars
Southside Addition, and one triangular shaped block known as Alden Place were
investigated archeologically.
The existing Gregory Lincoln School, built in the 1960s, covers the northernmost
four blocks of the property to be redeveloped; consequently, excavations did not
take place there. The school track covers two blocks located just south of Robin
Street (Block 34-35 of Boercher’s Extension of Castania and part of Alden Place
where it overlaps with Block 35); these were investigated archeologically. The
remaining eight blocks were vacant at the time of investigations (Alden Place,
Blocks 1-6 of the Powars Southside Addition, and Block 38 of Boercher’s
Extension of Castania). Though these blocks once held houses, apartments,
businesses and churches, all the buildings on them, except for the commercial
Settegast Building (at Gray and Genesee) and the Gregory Lincoln School
facilities were demolished in 2002, in anticipation of the planned construction.
Archeologists investigated all of the vacant blocks.
The surrounding neighborhood is best characterized as a historic residential
inner city community, lightly mixed with commercial, religious, and public
facilities.
Its proximity to downtown has recently made it attractive to
developers for the potential land value new buildings would create.
Consequently, a large portion of the 4th Ward has been redeveloped with high
rises, urban townhouses, and increasingly chic businesses.
Prior to the 1980s the 4th Ward was considered a slum by many in Houston’s
planning and development community. Most community members were low
income African Americans who rented their homes; though a few African
American families did own property. In fact, Houston’s 4th Ward has been called
the “mother ward” for African Americans. After the Civil War, thousands of
recently emancipated slaves came to Houston and settled there at what was
then the western edge of the city. Within this neighborhood, blacks built homes,
established churches, schools, fraternal organizations and businesses that
provided goods, services, social and religious support to an emerging community
that Houston’s white politicians mostly overlooked when it came to city services
and development. The entrenched racism of the Jim Crow era made Freedmen’s
Town, according to one resident, “like a city within a city.” During the 1980s, 40
blocks of 4th Ward known as Freedmen’s Town after the emancipated blacks who
lived there, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; the western
edge of that district abuts the Gregory Lincoln project area.
The project, which represents the culmination of many years of preservation
efforts on the part of community members, and research on the part of

Chapter 1 - Introduction and Management Summary

historians and archeologists, consisted of an initial phase that included lot by
lot archival research and ground penetrating radar survey. The results of both
those efforts were coordinated through the Texas Historical Commission in
August 2005. The archival research, conducted by Janet K. Wagner & Company
(JKW&Co) revealed the land ownership and use history for the area between
Saulnier, Gray, Taft and Genesee Streets. Land ownership history of the
northern two blocks was eliminated from research, due to the fact the school
currently covers this area (and two additional blocks), and no archeological
investigations were to be conducted under the current scope of work. This
research together with previous reports undertaken in 2001 and 2003 indicated
that the project area had the potential for archeological resources. Specifically,
the reports provided circumstantial evidence for the potential for human
remains to be present within the HISD property. According to local oral
accounts, the project area contained the remains of Post-Civil War era soldiers.
The research reports provided some circumstantial evidence to support this
claim, but offered no definitive proof. The most likely location for these remains,
according to verbal accounts and background research was within Alden Place,
Block 1 of the Powars Southside Addition, or under Andrews Street.
Additionally, JKW&Co’s lot by lot report gave evidence for several 1860s
occupations (the Tilghman, Bawsel, and Stanley families). Urban subdivision
and development occurred between 1890 and 1930, and included residences,
businesses and churches, which continued to thrive until the property was
purchased by HISD in the late 1990s.
In July 2005, Hicks & Company hired Anthony & Brown consultants to conduct
the GPR survey, which covered only a sample area of high probability for
unmarked graves. Despite poor weather conditions over the three days on
which the survey was conducted, the GPR survey plotted a number of
anomalies. However, the overall patterning of these anomalies did not match the
typical signature produced by large cemeteries. Nevertheless, theoretically it
was possible that some of the anomalies could represent isolated burials, and so
it was recommended that these be investigated as part of the subsequent testing
effort.

Chapter 1 - Introduction and Management Summary

Based on this work, H&C developed a testing plan that would not only target
areas of high probability for historic burials (based on research, oral accounts,
and the GPR survey), but also assess the archeological remains of houses,
businesses and churches associated with the 1860 through ca.1940 period.
Using a coding system, the testing plan selected certain blocks or portions of
blocks to be tested (Figure 1-2). Five different cultural resource types were
identified in the plan: burials, owner-occupied residences, tenant-occupied
residences, businesses, and churches. The plan called for Gradall trenching to
occur in the targeted areas. Trenches dug in areas targeted for structural
remains would be shallower, while trenches dug in areas targeted for burial
remains would be deeper in order to expose outlines of grave shafts that may
have been truncated and covered by fill during subsequent development. Test
units were to be used to further define and explore archeological features found
during the initial trenching. Overall the testing plan called for the excavation of
between 45-50 Gradall trenches, and 30-35 square meters of test units. During
the month-long testing project, archeologists excavated 55 trenches, and 32
square meters of test units. With permission from the THC, seven of the
trenches were excavated using a backhoe with a toothless bucket. Overall, it is
estimated that 2,209 square meters of soil were mechanically excavated during
the project, with trenches and test units, planned, profiled and documented
photographically.

Chapter 1 - Introduction and Management Summary

Trench and test unit investigations found no human remains. Nor were any
definitive archeological remains found from any of the earliest occupations,
including the Tilghman family, who were former slaves and occupied Lots 8-10
of Block 34 from 1867 to the early twentieth century. Investigators noted no
evidence of the Stanley and Bawsel occupations of the 1860s. Trenches typically
revealed 40-50 centimeters of cultural debris overlying sterile clays. Cultural
debris ranged in date from early twentieth century to circa 2000. There were
few intact pre-1940s archeological surfaces throughout the project area. Most
trenches included a mix of modern and early twentieth century debris mixed
together in an ill-defined occupation zone with no stratigraphic separation.
However, relatively intact and isolated pre-1940s surfaces were found on Lots 2
and 3 of Block 2, Lot 6 of Block 2, Lots 4 and 5 of Block 4, and Lots 3-5 of Block
5. These were investigated by means of test units. Trenches that revealed
possible intact pre-1930s surfaces that were not investigated by means of test
units included Trench 53, on Lots 3 and 13 of Block 4, and Trench 4 in Alden
Place (formerly Block 35). Due to time and budgetary constraints it was
necessary to prioritize areas to investigate, and these two areas, while containing
possible intact early twentieth century surfaces and artifact scatters, either
lacked definable features, or demonstrated modern debris admixture that gave
them less priority than other areas.
Fifty-three formal features were recorded during the trenching. Features were
numbered 1-54; Feature 32 was initially recorded as a post hole feature in Alden
Place, however, subsequent investigation warranted its removal from the feature
list. Overall the types of features recorded during the project were mainly
foundation elements and trash pits. Foundation elements from structures that
clearly post-dated the 1930s (such as large concrete beams, slabs, and piers)
were noted in trenches, but were generally not assigned feature numbers.
Likewise sewer pipes, water pipes and electrical infrastructure were not given
feature numbers but were documented in trenches and test unit notes.
Approximately 56% of the trenches excavated contained buried infrastructure,
and buried water and wastewater lines were observed in virtually every block
investigated.
Of these 53 features, 36 pertained to households or areas investigated through
test units. Most features were architectural, either brick piers, or wooden posts.
Of the seven pit features recorded during the project, only one, Feature 16,
appears to have been a clear, intentional refuse burial created between 1910
and 1920. Feature 16 was located behind the main house on Lot 2 of Block 2,
owned and occupied by Walker Spillman and his wife, Lucy. This one feature
measured approximately 1.9 meters in diameter and was 40 centimeters deep.
It was lined with sheet metal at its base and top. The artifacts recovered from it
include numerous whole bottles, large plate fragments, broken doll parts, pieces
of jewelry, cut animal bone, wagon parts, horseshoes, and various other
household debris. The feature contained a number of unbroken bottles
suggesting that this feature was an intentional burial of material that was no
longer wanted or usable. Given the fairly consistent date of the artifacts, which
fall roughly between 1910 and 1920, it is possible to correlate the trash pit with
known residents.
A second feature, Feature 37 may have been part of an intentional refuse pit,
but likely was either disturbed by a demolition and subsequent rebuilding
episode, or was part of a larger sealed debris bearing surface created when the
original home on that lot was replaced with a new dwelling.
Whether
intentionally placed or the byproduct of demolition and construction, Feature 37
represented a sealed artifact deposit. Several other features (Feature 13, 30, 31,

Chapter 1 - Introduction and Management Summary

and 33) were recorded as pits but subsequent investigation showed that these
were likely not intentional. Rather they represented small concentrations or
scatters resulting from various demolition processes.
Whether they were part of an intact context, or simply random urban debris
scatter, artifacts were found on virtually every block of the project site.
Therefore site numbers were assigned to each of the ten blocks investigated
during the project. Alden Place was recorded as 41HR1008. Block 1 of Powars
Southside Addition was recorded as 41HR1009, Block 2 as 41HR1010, Block 3
as 41HR1011, Block 4 as 41HR1012, Block 5 as 41HR1013, and Block 6 as
41HR1014. Block 34 of Boercher’s Extension of Castantia was recorded as
41HR1015, Block 35 as 41HR1016, and Block 38 as 41HR1017 (Figure 1-3).
Though these trinomials serve as each block’s official site designation, areas will
be discussed in this report primarily by their legal descriptions (Block and Lot)
rather than site trinomials since these trinomials themselves are completely
divorced of the historic context this report seeks to integrate.
Test unit investigations concentrated on five basic household groups on three
blocks of the project area. On Block 2 (41HR1010) of Powars Southside
Addition, archeologists investigated two households groups: two tenant-occupied
shotgun residences on Lot 3, and the owner-occupied Spillman residence on Lot
6. Deposits associated with the Richardson household were investigated on Lot
5 of Block 4 (41HR1012). The Young and Starks household was investigated on
Lots 3-5 of Block 5 (41HR1013). These five households will form the major units
for comparison in subsequent sections of the report.
Due to community opposition to HISD’s site selection for its two new schools,
and the potential for human remains, fieldwork was intended to integrate public
outreach and involvement to create as transparent a process as possible. Dr.
Fred McGhee was hired to facilitate that effort prior to and during investigations.
Prior to investigations a neighborhood advisory committee was formed as a
consulting party in the event burials were uncovered during the project. Project
plans were presented at a series of meetings that were attended by members of
this committee as well as HISD trustees and city council members. Dr. McGhee
recruited Yasmin Najera from Booker T. Washington high school to assist with
the archeological investigations on Saturdays. Ashlei Kenedy from University of
Houston assisted on two afternoons. Volunteers from the Texas Archeological
Society Beth Aucoin and Frank Binetti worked on site during the week of
October 4, 2005. In addition Dr. McGhee conducted public tours on October
8th, and October 22nd. While it was initially proposed that members of the
advisory committee be allowed to visit the site freely, the site’s construction
managers Gilbane Building Company due to liability reasons, requested that
only project participants enter the site, unless accompanied by Dr. McGhee, the
Principal Investigator, or a Project Archeologist. Members of the advisory
committee nonetheless filmed and photographed the progress of the
investigations through the chain link fence surrounding the project site.
Though invited to attend the tours on October 8th and October 22nd the
committee members declined.
The GPR survey took place in July 2005. Field investigations for the trenching
began on September 20, 2005. However, Hurricane Rita compelled investigators
to abandon the work mid-week and return to Austin with the millions of other
evacuating Houston. Trenches excavated to that point were refilled to avoid
having them flood and also to prevent loose soil and debris from flying into
nearby windows. Investigations resumed on September 28, 2005 and continued
until the end of October.

Chapter 1 - Introduction and Management Summary

Rachel Feit functioned as Principal Investigator, Jodi Skipper served as Project
Archeologist leading up to and during investigations. However, prior grantfunded research commitments prevented Ms. Skipper from continuing as project
archeologist after investigations were complete; consequently Mason Miller and
Bradford Jones took over Ms. Skipper’s role as Project Archeologist, helping the
PI conduct analysis and complete the report. In the field, Mason Miller assisted
with field direction and oversaw mapping in addition to designing and
maintaining the project database. Brad Jones directed the lab analysis and
curation for the project. Suzanne Smith assisted with artifact analysis, curation
and database management both in the field and after investigations completed.
John Clark served as a key consultant both in the field and during the artifact
analysis (Figure 1-4). Hedy Justus provided expert osteological identification for
faunal material from selected lots. Crew consisted of Doug Molineu (crew chief),
J. Robert Van de Grift, Rebecca Sick (crew chief), Chad Lefever, Sean Buchner,
Carolyn Keagal, Jason Smart, and John Lacantro. Field investigations took
place between September 20 and October 28, 2005.

The project falls under the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) because it is located on
land owned and controlled by a political subdivision of the State of Texas (HISD).
Hicks & Company conducted the project under TAC Permit Number 3837. An
interim coordination report, summarizing the results of field investigations, and
providing recommendations vis à vis State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
eligibility of the archeological deposits was submitted on November 22, 2005.
This report recommended that none of the sites investigated were eligible for
listing as SALs. It recommended that monitoring for burials be completed
during earthmoving activities associated with construction.
In a subsequent phase of work, Hicks & Company developed a monitoring
strategy that involved partial on-site monitoring. As part of that effort, the Hicks
& Company Principal Investigator met with the construction contractors prior to
commencement of the site preparation work to provide some background on the
project and to share concerns with the contractors over the possibility of finding
human remains during their site excavation work. During that meeting, Hicks

& Company discussed with the contractors what those remains might look like,
if found, and what to do in the event of an accidental discovery of human
remains. 20 copies of a booklet were distributed that provided not just visual
and written guidance about what sorts of archeological remains the contractors
might expect to find, but also a notification protocol should any human
interments actually be uncovered.
Additionally, Hicks & Company subcontracted with HRA Gray & Pape, based in
Houston, to make weekly inspections of the site. They too received background
documents and necessary instructions in the event of accidental discoveries. An
HRA Gray & Pape Project Archeologist, Rebecca Sick, was familiar with the site
already, since she had previously served as a Hicks & Company Crew Chief
during the 2005 testing. HRA Gray & Pape’s inspection reports were sent to the
Hicks & Company Principal Investigator weekly. Their final letter is attached
along with photos of the construction work.
During the construction, which lasted from June 16 to October 27, 2006,
neither monitors nor construction personnel encountered any evidence of
human skeletal material, coffins, coffin hardware, or soil stains that would
otherwise indicate the presence of an historic human interment (see attached
letter). It was recommended that HISD’s compliance obligations under the Texas
Antiquities Code were complete for the blocks within the HISD property located
between Robin, West Gray, Genesee and Taft Streets. The THC concurred with
this recommendation on December 18, 2006, adding that once the existing
Gregory Lincoln School, occupying the northernmost four blocks fronting Dallas
Street, was scheduled for demolition, that HISD should initiate discussions with
them regarding the level of effort that would be required under the Texas
Antiquities Code. Future investigations, if warranted, should be conducted
under a separate scope and permit.
This draft final report integrates the results of the archival research phase of the
project into a complete historical background section detailing history, use,
development and key patterns elucidated by various data sources.
The
background sections draw not just on J.K.Wagner’s 2001, 2003 and 2005
studies but also on additional primary and secondary research undertaken by
Hicks & Company staff over the course of investigations. J.K. Wagner’s 2005
report is included in its entirety on the attached data CD at the end of this
document. All of the archival research pertinent to in the areas and households
investigated has been synthesized and is included the background sections in
this report. Succeeding Chapters of this report include Site Setting and

A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY
During the writing of this report, the authors debated considerably over
terminology, particularly with respect to race. Which is more appropriate,
African American or black, Anglo-American (Italian American, French American,
Euro American, etc.) or white? Though terms such as African American are more
formal and carry fewer pejorative connotations, they are often clumsy to say and
do not really appropriately describe the critical dichotomy so often implied in
discussions of race. In that sense, black and white seem to be the favored terms
for most people when discussing race in America. Ultimately, both the formal
and informal terms have their uses, and the authors decided to use African
American and black interchangeably, depending on which term seemed to best
fit the context in which they were writing. The term white is used to describe
Caucasians, except in cases where more ethnic specificity was demanded. In
those circumstances specific categories of white Americans are described as
Italians or Jews, for instance.
Another type of terminology that may vary is that having to do with land
subdivisions. The Powars Southside Addition is often shortened to the Powars
Addition, and Boercher’s Extension of Castania is often shortened to the
Boercher’s Addition. Within those subdivisions individual blocks are typically
referred to as Block 34 or Block 2, for example, rather than by their full legal
description (eg. Block 2 of the Powars Southside Addition).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors of this report would like to thank the project management team,
Richard Lindsay, Meredith Smith, and John Risher, at HISD and Gilbane
Building Company for their patience during this difficult process. Paula Arnold
of Arnold and Langrand Communications was extremely helpful in facilitating
public meetings and guiding all project participants through what was at times
and emotional project for many who were involved. Finally the Freedmen’s Town
Advisory Committee also deserves thanks for its continued vigilance in ensuring
that project goals were appropriately defined and implemented.
Dr. Carol McDavid and Dr. Grey Gundaker offered advice and insight during the
writing of this report. J.K. Wagner & Company, David Brown and Dana
Anthony, and the team at HRA Gray & Pape in Houston deserve thanks for their
assistance and research. Project participants that also deserve thanks include
Carolyn Keagle, Rebecca Sick, Hedy Justus Doug Molineu, J. Robert Van de
Grift, Chad Lefever, Sean Buchner, and Jason Smart. Suzanne Smith is to be
commended for her excellent management of the artifacts and project database.
Finally, Dr. Fred McGhee deserves special acknowledgment for his persistence
and his unrelenting activism for the Freedmen’s Town community. Without his
help, this project would not have been possible.

CHAPTER 2 SITE SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT
By Mason Miller
The HISD project area lies within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province, which encompasses the area along the North American Gulf Coast
west of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain to northeastern Mexico (Fenneman 1938).
The proximity to the Gulf of Mexico has significantly influenced the geologic and
cultural histories of the region. In geological terms, this area is relatively young
with general soils in the project area characterized as urban variants of Bernard
series clays and clay loams (Bg) overlying Pleistocene-era Beaumont clays (USDA
1976; BEG 1982).
The project area is situated in the Austroriparian Biotic Province (Blair 1950)
within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes region, a narrow (60-80 miles wide) strip of
low coastal sands with frequent streams, marshes, grasslands and occasional
woodlands (Gould et al. 1960; Correll and Johnston 1979). While the project
area is urban and thus carries a distinctly varied population of plants and
animals, more natural environments in the region are generally dominated with
tall grasses such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), eastern gamagrass
(Tripsacum dactyloides) and gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) as well as
varieties of oak (Quercus spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) trees and weeds and herbs
such as western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) and yankeeweed (Eupatorium
compositifolium; Thomas 1975), Animals within natural environments in this
region include the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), the fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylivlagus floridanus), the Texas rat
snake (Elaphe obsolete lindheimerii), the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) and
the mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos; Gould 1975).
Harris County as a whole is considered to have a humid, subtropical climate
with typically warm summers and mild winters. Warm, moist breezes from the
Gulf help to maintain high humidity and moderate temperatures. Average
annual rainfall is approximately 48 inches with an average relative humidity of
73 percent. The average annual temperature is nearly 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
ranging from average lows of 39 degrees in January to average highs of 95
degrees in July. The growing season generally lasts 270-300 days per year, with
the first freeze occurring in late November and the last freeze in early March.

CHAPTER 3 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
By Rachel Feit

DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSTON’S 4TH WARD AND FREEDMEN’S TOWN
In 1837, Houston’s founders, John K. and Augustus Allen, acquired two leagues
of land on Buffalo and White Oak Bayous from John Austin, the cousin of
Stephen F. Austin, and incorporated a town to be named after General Sam
Houston, hero of the Texas Revolution. They divided the nine-square mile town
site into four geopolitical districts called “wards,” following the same system
used in New York’s Manhattan. Under this political system, a mayor was
elected, along with two aldermen from each ward as representatives. Later city
planners added two additional wards. In 1905 a commission system of
government in which aldermen were elected at large, replaced the ward system.
However, the wards, as geographical subdivisions of the city, have endured in
Houston’s collective self-image. People in Houston still refer to wards today to
describe location and neighborhood character (Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1
wards.

PROJECT AREA

The Gregory Lincoln project area is located in Houston’s 4th Ward, known as the
“mother ward” among African Americans because it has been home to a
significant black population since just after the Civil War. The project area
abuts the Freedmen’s Town National Register Historic district, which as Maxwell
(1997) points out, is actually south of the earliest Freedmen’s Town subdivision
that formed from the Hardcastle Subdivision. In 1866, Garrett Hardcastle
subdivided 21.8 acres of land he owned on the south side of Buffalo Bayou and
sold the lots mainly to newly freed slaves, who began pouring into the city
following emancipation (Wagner 2005). The neighborhood soon became known

13

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

as Freedmen’s Town (aka Freedmantown and Freedmanstown). Following the
Civil War, economic hardships made many white landowners eager to sell their
land. At that time, much of the land at the western edge of 4th Ward was
undeveloped, occupied mainly by residents who owned large tracts. Additional
areas adjacent to the Hardcastle Subdivision were divided and these too were
predominantly settled by African Americans. During the 1860s and 1870s, the
growth of Freedmen’s Town was facilitated by Reconstruction policies and
programs initiated by the Freedmen’s Bureau, which opened an office in
Houston. After Reconstruction ended, the neighborhood continued to flourish
largely without the help and planning of white-dominated government,
businesses, and organizations. The 4th Ward remained predominantly African
American well into the twentieth century, despite targeted, publicly sponsored
redevelopment programs such as roads and a whites-only housing project that
isolated the neighborhood from Houston’s downtown and claimed much of the
original Hardcastle Subdivision (Harol 1999).
The endurance of the Freedmen’s Town community in the face of this
programmatic marginalization is attributable to the considerable effort
Houston’s African American leaders exerted to control the growth and
development of their community. Early on freed slaves organized churches and
fraternal organizations (the United Order of Odd Fellows and the Ancient Order
of Pilgrims were particularly strong among African Americans in Houston and
both erected impressive buildings during the early twentieth century) to provide
financial, social and cultural support to the thousands of black immigrants
arriving from rural areas of Texas. Schools, businesses, and newspapers
provided education and services that were largely neglected by the white
population (Beeth & Wintz 1992).
In 1885 Jack Yates founded the Houston College, later to become Texas
Southern University to educate Houston’s African Americans. Yates also served
as Pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church from 1869 to 1891 (McCullough 1996).
Under Yate’s leadership, the church expanded its membership and rose to
become an anchor of the Freedmen’s Town community (Beeth and Wintz 1992).
Together with the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church he helped raise money to
purchase Emancipation Park in the 3rd Ward as the only public space for
Houston’s African American community (McCullough 1996).
During the same period, Richard Allen was another key figure in Houston’s 4th
Ward black community. As a slave he learned carpentry and engineering,
single-handedly designing the home of Houston’s mayor, J.R. Morris. After
emancipation, he became a contractor, building one of the city’s first bridges
over Buffalo Bayou, and winning city contracts to build city sidewalks and
construct other municipal projects. He worked for the Freedmen’s Bureau in
1867 and was elected to the Texas Legislature in 1869, where he served as chair
of the Bridges and Roads Committee (Pitre 1992). He was instrumental in the
founding of the Gregory Institute, which was intended to train teachers; and in
1879 he designed and built the Antioch Baptist Church, which today is on the
National Register (Beeth and Wintz 1992). Early in his political career, Allen
developed a working relationship with Republican James Tracy, which he used
to further his own political aims. His political goals were often times enigmatic
with respect to the larger African American population in Houston, as he was a
strong advocate of an organized African American Exodus to Kansas. Many
accused him of serving nothing but his own ambition with his support of an
Exodus. Despite his ambiguous political maneuvers, Allen’s access to the white

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

14

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

dominated chambers of Houston’s ruling class made him an important
spokesperson for black interests throughout his life (Pitre 1992).
After Allen’s death in 1911, Clifton Richardson emerged as a critical voice for the
African American population in Houston. He founded the Houston Informer in
1919 and served as the newspaper’s principal editor until 1929. His regular
editorials urged Houston’s African Americans to reject white discrimination by
boycotting white-owned businesses and public transportation where city
ordinances required separate seating for blacks and whites. He publicly
criticized the poor quality of housing and the lack of urban amenities provided to
the black population in Houston. Most importantly his paper served as the most
widely read source of information for the black community.
By the mid thirties, Houston was about one third African-American with a
parallel society and economy. The 1896 Plessy vs. Ferguson case set the legal
precedent for Jim Crow laws in America. On a local level, state and city
ordinances segregating schools, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and requiring
separate seating on public transportation made racial segregation the de facto
means of social organization in Texas (Wintz 1984). In the thirties, racial
apartheid became more entrenched with poor whites and the police targeting
African Americans (Johnson 1991). A 1929 City Master Plan wrote that “The
chief racial problem centers about Negroes (Hare and Hare 1929).” It further
noted that “these Negroes are a useful and necessary element in the population
and suitable areas with proper living and recreational facilities should be set
aside for them. Because of long established racial prejudice, it is best for both
races that living areas be segregated (Hare and Hare 1929).” Although African
Americans in Freedmen’s Town had been effectively operating separately from
white society since emancipation, the community nevertheless found it difficult
to thrive under the system of institutionalized racism that pervaded the city.
Over time, discriminatory practices such as imbalanced wage distributions, poll
taxes that contributed to political disenfranchisement, and unequal access to
services and capital created a permanent African American underclass in
Houston (Wintz 1984). Though the 4th Ward Freedmen’s Town initially evolved as
a mixed income community, with over 25% owner-occupancy, over time owner
occupancy declined. By the mid-1980’s fewer than 5% of Freedmen’s Town
residents owned their homes.
The neighborhood became increasingly
ghettoized, as absentee landlords neglected basic maintenance of properties.
Black businesses had difficulty developing due to lack of capital, indifference on
the part of whites, and even the feeling on the part of some blacks that black
businesses were gouging their customers (SoRelle 1992). Furthering the erosion
of community cohesion, after the 1950s, many African American land-owners
with means chose to move away from Freedmen’s Town, to newer suburbs or
other parts of town. While segregation lasted, black-owned businesses were
“self-sustaining,” according to Gladys House (House 2004). However, after legal
segregation was defeated, the community-based incentives for black
entrepreneurship flagged.
All of these forces converged to make the integrity of historic Freedmen’s Town
vulnerable by the 1980s. It was this very vulnerability that eventually
contributed to the widespread destruction of many of Freedmen’s Town’s historic
structures over the past 15 years. The current Gregory Lincoln project is yet
another example of the rapid redevelopment of the Freedmen’s Town and 4th
Ward resources. Though the school redevelopment project will ultimately
benefit many 4th Ward children, the price is a growing loss of the historic
Freedmen’s Town social landscape.

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

PROJECT AREA BACKGROUND- NEIGHBORHOOD EVOLUTION
The project area stands outside the western edge of the NRHP-listed Freedmen’s
Town District. The study area was technically outside the city limits until about
1907. Consequently, it was lightly occupied until the turn of the century, when
it was subdivided into lots and blocks. Today, the project area comprises three
legal subdivisions—Boercher’s Extension of Castania, the Powars Southside
Addition, and Alden Place—all of which were developed after 1894. While the
majority of residents in the project area were black, a significant Italian presence
was established by the early twentieth century1. The Italians primarily owned
groceries and meat markets and typically lived on lots adjoining their business.
African Americans, many of which owned their homes, typically worked for
others outside their places of residence.
Land Ownership, Development, and Litigation 1837-1922
Prior to the turn of the century the project area consisted of several larger tracts
of land, each with its own curious history of ownership. Litigation and
conflicting land claims over ownership occurred at a number of different times
between 1837 and 1925, complicating land use and development throughout the
project area, often at the expense of the area’s poorer residents.
The details of history and ownership have been provided in several reports
produced by J.K. Wagner and Company (2001, 2003). The most recent (Wagner
2005) and comprehensive study pertaining to this neighborhood was produced
prior to testing and contains lot by lot ownership and occupation history for the
entire project area since urban subdivision occurred. This section will briefly
summarize the salient issues pertaining to land use, ownership and pretwentieth century development in the project area based on Wagner’s research.
The land comprising the project area was patented by Obedience Smith in 1838
as one-sixth of a headright league (approximately 738 acres), and later
subdivided as Lot 39 of the Smith tract (Wagner 2001, 2005). The Obedience
Smith headright subdivisions were large tracts ranging from 30 to over 100
acres of land. Many were poorly surveyed. Confusing land rights, in 1837—one
year before the original Obedience Smith headright league Survey was filed-Sam Houston purchased 30 acres along the San Felipe Road overlapping what
would become Lot 39 and Lot 40 of the Obedience Smith Survey, and built a log
cabin there. He likely never filed his deed, or waited until much later to file it,
and consequently, when the Smith Survey was filed in 1838, the overlap
between the properties was not recorded. Houston’s 30-acre tract was oriented
to the Old San Felipe Road, which at that time contained a bend that ran
slightly to the southwest; while the Smith tract was oriented toward the cardinal
directions. The southwestern corner of Houston’s tract cut into the Obedience
Smith Lot 39, taking approximately 2.5 acres from it (Figure 3-2).

1 Built dates for structures were established using a combination of Sanborn Maps, census records, tax records, and
deed records, and have been estimated as closely as possible. Since many land sales were purchased through bond
for title sales and since absent landowners often did not pay taxes on built structures, tax records are not always a
reliable indicator of building dates. Thus other lines of evidence, such as census records, city directories, or Sanborn
maps were also considered.

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

Though the Smith family lived on their 1/6 league, they did not live in the
project area. Their home(s) was located east of the current study area.
Obedience Smith died in 1847 and the Smith property became the subject of
extensive litigation that wasn’t fully resolved until 1866. The issues of that
litigation appear to have been related not just to internecine land feuds and
conflicting land transactions over time, but also to the overlap between the
Houston and the Smith properties. The heirs of Obedience Smith finally emerged
from that suit with a residue acreage totaling approximately 15 acres, and the
remainder of the original Obedience Smith acreage sold to others, including
former surveyor, Will Powars who surveyed the land for the Smiths (Wagner
2001, 2005).
What is relevant to this project is that in 1866, Will Powars surfaced from the
Obedience Smith heirs’ lawsuit with clear title to 12 acres covering the study
area. These tracts were located south of the current Andrews Street (Figure 33). Meanwhile, Powars had previously sold five acres to Fred Stanley (July 26,
1864) who, according to deed records, built a home on his land (Wagner 2001).
This land was located between what is currently Mason, Genesee, Gray and
Andrews Streets. Following the lawsuit Powars then sold six acres to Minor
Bawsel in April of 1867. That land was situated west of the Stanley tract,
roughly between Mason, Taft, Gray and Andrews. Bawsel likely intended to
build a home on his land, but both he and his wife were dead by September 14th
of that same year, so they may not have had time to complete it. A house on five
acres, however, is mentioned in the probate record of Stanley’s death (Wagner
2001). It is not clear where they were buried, however, records note that they
were buried in metal coffins. Eventually, both the Stanley and the Bawsel tracts
reverted back to Will Powars (Wagner 2001, 2005).
Curiously, following the Smith lawsuit, Powars also believed that he owned land
north of Andrews Street as well. This he attempted to subdivide and plat in
1866, selling three lots to a former slave named Gus Tilghman (Wagner 2005).
Before any additional land sales could take place, however, John Boercher
stepped forward as the rightful owner of 10 acres (located north of Andrews
Street) he had acquired from W.R Baker and Gertrude Tankersly. Boercher
continued to own that property (minus the Tilghman land) until his death, using
it as a cattle feed lot (Wagner 2001, 2005).
Upon Boercher’s death, a second lawsuit took place in 1894. This lawsuit
involved the heirs of John Boercher, Camille Cline, together with the heirs of
Will Powars against Henrietta Heubner, Charles Huebner, Edna LeFebre, and
John LeFebre. At the crux of the lawsuit was ownership of the entirety of Lot 39
(of the Obedience Smith Survey) in the project area. Ultimately, this case
resulted in a decision that divided the property among all of the claimants,
though the Boercher and Powars heirs emerged with the lion’s share of the land.
This suit facilitated the subdivision and further development of the project area
(Wagner 2005). The land once owned by Boercher (located between Andrews,
San Felipe [aka Dallas], Genessee and Taft Streets) became the Boercher’s
Extension of Castania Subdivision. The area once owned by Powars (minus the
triangular intrusion made by the Houston Ranch and still legally unresolved)
became part of the Powars Southside Addition. One oddity in the new
subdivision of the Powars Southside and Boercher’s Extension of Castania was a
small block (Block 38), composed of just two and half lots, belonging to the
Boercher’s Extension of Castania but residing within the geographical
boundaries of the Powars Southside Addition (Figure 3-4). The authors of this
report speculate that this Boercher’s Extension block was likely created within

the Powars Southside Addition after the 1894 lawsuit, in order to compensate
the Boercher heirs for the loss of the three lots that Powars mistakenly sold to
the Tilghman family in 1867.

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

Finally, in 1924 a third major lawsuit took place with respect to land in the
project area. This suit involved the 2.5 acre triangular piece of land from the
Houston Ranch that had overlapped into Lot 39 of the 1838 Obedience Smith
Survey. That 2.5 acre tract had never been developed, no doubt in part due to
the property’s ambiguous chain of title, but also in part due to the its unusual
shape. The 1924 lawsuit involved Martha McMaster and the heirs of George
Baker, who purchased the Houston Ranch in 1843, against 12 other claimants
who believed they already owned property in Lots 39 and 40 of the Obedience
Smith Survey subdivisions (which overlapped the Houston Ranch). The lawsuit
pertained to 46.33 acres of land that included the 2.5-acre tract in the current
project area. Ultimately the court decided that the Baker heirs had the most
right to the land, and the claimants who believed they owned property in Lots 39
and 40 of the Smith Survey lost their suit. The Baker heirs then sold 34.83
acres to the Guaranty Realty and Investment Company, who eventually
developed it as Alden Place (Wagner 2005). The 2.5-acre triangular tract within
the project area was developed shortly after that as Lots 1 through 16 of Alden
Place. Worth mentioning is that the residences built there were occupied
exclusively by whites (Wagner 2005). Most residences were brick two-story
apartment buildings, in the typical Houston four-plex style (Archi-technics/3
2002). However, several brick single-family homes were also constructed; one of
those was owned by the Pizzitola family, who resided in the neighborhood for
many years.
A noteworthy aspect of the 1924 lawsuit is that it apparently also affected
property owners in Block 6 of the Powars Southside Addition whose land fronted
Taft Street. Due primarily to poor surveying on the part of Will Powars, those
landowners lost 18 feet on the western edge of their properties in the lawsuit,
causing the loss of buildings and residences that faced Taft Street (Wagner
2005). City directories and Sanborn Fire Insurance maps reflect the changes
wrought by the lawsuit. Residential structures were present on Lots 1-4 of
Block 6 in the Powars Southside Addition from around 1905 through the first
half of the 1920s. However, these structures were demolished by 1925 to make
way for apartment buildings and commercial structures (Figure 3-5). Lot 5 of
Block 6 held an early location of the 2nd Pleasant Green Baptist Church, but this
too, along with residences on the same lot was gone by 1926, replaced by a gas
station and an apartment complex.
Though the three lawsuits within the project area spanned almost 80 years, the
issues they sought to arbitrate effectively stemmed from poor record keeping,
poor surveying, and poor management with respect to land claims during
Houston’s early years. Not only was there considerable overlap between the
original Houston Ranch property and the Obedience Smith Survey, but
subsequent land partitions (many by Will Powars himself) were sloppily done,
causing boundary disputes. Complicating matters was the fact that land sales
were often filed well after the time they really took place, either through
negligence or due to shady bond for title sales. All of these forces fed directly
into the necessity for legal arbitration to resolve ownership matters. It is
relevant for this particular project that in the majority of cases the small
landowners lost out in these legal battles. This is a pattern that persisted well
after urban subdivision was established.

African American Occupation and Community Development 1870-19452
Aside from the tentative Stanley and Bawsel (who were white) occupations of the
1860s, the first family to occupy the project area was the African American
Tilghman family. In 1867 Gus Tilghman, a 43-year old former slave purchased
three lots from Will Powars, who was then attempting to subdivide land he
thought he had purchased from John Boercher (HCDR 4/360 in Wagner 2005).
Tilghman was from Maryland and was brought to Texas as a slave sometime
around 1849 or 1850. It is not clear when the Gus Tilghman family first built
on their property. The 1870 census lists Gus and his family living in the 3rd
Ward. According to the 1880 census, however, his wife and children were living
in 4th Ward on Lots 8-10 of the Castania Subdivision (later to become Boercher’s
Extension of Castania). Gus had passed away by that time. The family on Lots

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

8-10 consisted of Gus’ wife Maria, his daughter Sallie (19), son Jacob (23),
Jacob’s wife Louisa Williams, and Louisa’s sister Mollie. Another daughter
named Adeline lived elsewhere. None of the family members were literate, since
they signed all legal documents with an “X”.
Things apparently did not go well for Tilghman heirs—Jake, Adeline and Sally-after Gus’ death. Jake mortgaged his 1/3 share of the property to William
Crank in 1882 as part of a loan. That loan was apparently paid off in 1885, but
Crank nevertheless filed a suit against Jake in 1891. In 1885 all three heirs
sold Lot 10 to Richard Mason. Then in 1890, Jake made a formal deed
exchange with his two sisters, Sally Patton and Adeline Reed partitioning the
property. After that, Sally owned Lot 8, Jake owned Lot 9 and Adeline owned
Lot 10. How that was possible after all three heirs sold the land to Richard
Mason is not altogether clear. Jake then sold Lot 9 in 1891 to William
Alexander to pay off his debt to William Crank. Jake died in 1893 leaving no
will.
Meanwhile Sally and Adeline, apparently unaware that Jake had sold his lot,
proceeded to sell off Lots 8 and 9 to T(J?).L Britton in exchange for Lot 10
(HCDR 79/27, 28 in Wagner 2005) which Britton had acquired from Richard
Mason just two weeks earlier (HCDR 76/631 in Wagner 2005). This happened
in 1894, right around the time the lawsuit was taking place between the
Boercher and Powars heirs against the Huebners. Then in September of 1895
Sally and her husband deeded Lot 10 back over to Britton for $50 (HCDR
84/317 in Wagner 2005), who now owned Lots 8-10 of Block 34 in the
Boercher’s Extension of Castania Subdivision.
Census records and city directories show that Sally Patton and members of the
extended Tilghman family continued to occupy at least one of the lots until
1895. The 1895 city directory shows Sally Patton living at 1704 Andrews Street,
probably on Lot 10. However, by 1900, according to the US census, Sally Patton
had moved to 1610 Robin Street, which was on the neighboring block to the
east. Curiously, a 1901 sale of Lots 9 and 10 from Sally Patton and Lucy
Williams to Ed and Leddie Malavansos, suggests some double-dealing may have
been at work. Being illiterate, perhaps the Tilghman heirs were unaware of the
full implications of their previous land transactions.
Or perhaps they
themselves were attempting to trick the absentee Malavansos family. Whatever
the case Malavansos purchased Lots 9 and 10 from Patton and Williams for
$100 on April 6th (HCDR 130/47 in Wagner 2005). Though Britton may have
attempted to make his claim on Lots 9 and 10, the fact that the Malavansos paid
taxes on Lots 9 and 10 (while Britton apparently did not) ultimately worked in
their favor. In 1908 the City of Houston awarded the land to Ed Malavansos for
payment of back taxes (HCDR 221/150 in Wagner 2005).
The true chain of legal transactions surrounding these three lots may never be
fully understood. However, the records are full enough to suggest that the
Tilghman heirs, who worked at various low wage professions, and who were
illiterate, may have been trying to use their land as security for loans, and
ultimately this caused them to lose all of their property through perhaps less
than legitimate means. Fires, the 1900 flood, or other catastrophes may have
caused the destruction of their homes, while the means to rebuild was outside
their financial reach. The possibility that T.L. Britton attempted to take
advantage of the Tilghman heirs must be acknowledged here. The Britton name
(sometimes Theo, sometimes T.L.) appears as grantor on a number of other
deeds and mortgages throughout the project area, according to Wagner’s 2005

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

research, including ones on Blocks 2 and 5 of the Powars Addition. Based on
tax records and deed records in Wagner’s 2005 research, Britton was clearly
involved in many transactions involving not just mortgages, but also tenant
housing and possibly bond for title sales. In any event, the Tilghman family was
forced to leave the property their father purchased by 1900.
Whatever
structures the family may have built were probably gone by that time too.
Widespread residential and commercial development of the project area began in
earnest around 1900, right around the time the city of Houston expanded its
boundaries westward to encompass previously undeveloped land. This was a
time, according to Beeth and Wintz (1992), when the black population was
expanding rapidly and developers were building middle-class subdivisions for
blacks on the fringes of established neighborhoods such as Freedmen’s Town.
The individuals who were instrumental in the subdivision and development of
the project area included Will Powars Jr. and his mother Mary Ruby, Camille
Cline, George Hermann, E.B and Florence Cushing, and to a lesser extent,
investors such as H.N. Jageman, John Dorrance, Robert Herndon, and T.L
Britton. They were all white, according to US census records, and did not live
in the immediate neighborhood, though some did live elsewhere in the 4th Ward.
Property records documenting liens held by construction and plumbing
contractors (Richard Allen Plumbing held liens on Block 3, Lots 4-6 for instance)
suggest that in some cases multiple homes on a single block were built
concurrently, with indoor plumbing from around 1910. This was different from
other parts of Freedmen’s Town where “surface privies [were] still ubiquitous in
many sections occupied by colored residents, while drainage [was] extremely bad
in most of these sections…(Richardson 1928).”
At the outset the majority of the residents who purchased and occupied the
subdivided property in the project area were black, though a significant number
of Italians also owned and lived in this part of 4th Ward. Unlike Italian
landowners, black residents often made land purchases through bond for title
sales. These land transactions were essentially owner-financed sales in which
the purchaser received the title to the land once they had paid off the total
amount. In the interim, the seller would continue to pay taxes on the land and
hold the deed.
However, the final deed transferal did not always take place, or often took place
well after the mortgages were paid. For instance, Charles and Carrie Williams
purchased their property on Lot 8 of Block 2 in the Powars Addition through a
bond for title sale. City directories and census records show that they resided at
1708 Ruthven as early as 1906. However, they did not receive a deed from Will
Powars Jr. until April of 1930 (HCDR 830/720 in Wagner 2005), two weeks
before they sold their property to an Italian named Gaspare Venezia. The
neighboring Spillman family may also have purchased through a bond for title
contract. Though their deed from the Powars estate for Lots 6 and 7 of Block 2
in the Powars Addition was dated 1911, mortgages, deeds of trust, and even a
lawsuit suggest that they occupied the property earlier than that. Less fortunate
with his bond for title contract was Dee (Dan) Curry, who received a deed on Lot
3 of Block 4 from Will Powars in the Powars Addition in 1909 for a purchase
price of $1000. Tax records indicate that a structure was on that lot earlier, so it
is likely that Curry and his family lived on the property before that time. He sold
the same lot less than three years later for only $800 to H. Holland who appears
to have had investment interests in adjoining Lots 1-2 in the same block since
before 1909. It is probable that many other residents suffered the same fate as
Mr. Curry—purchasing property through unscrupulous bond for title sales that

24

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

resulted in a financial/property loss due to skeletal record keeping and
misleading contract terms. Since most bond for title sales were not officially
recorded in the Harris County Deed Records until after the final payment was
made, identifying them all is problematic.
Nonetheless, the records are
sufficiently contradictory, and record of litigation is complete enough to imply
that this practice was occurring with regularity.
Irrespective of whether they were property owners or merely tenants, the
primary residents in the project area from 1900 were black. Sanborn Fire
Insurance maps from 1907 to 1955 indicate that black residents typically lived
in one-story wood frame homes, set on pier and beam foundations. Rental
houses were built in the shotgun style, while owner-occupied homes tended to
be larger and built on a T-plan, square or modified L-plan with front and back
porches. Most adult women worked. Typically they did so as laundresses,
seamstresses, cooks, or as servants for another household. On Block 34 within
the project area, for instance, of the 13 households with adult women in them in
1910, 11 of them worked; and all but two of those worked as laundresses from
the home. On Block 2, also in the project area, in 1910 there were 10
households with adult women in them and half of them worked. Laundering
and sewing from the home was the most common occupation for African
American women in the project area, and it is likely that this endeavor offered a
certain amount of financial and social independence for the women who engaged
in it (Mullins 1999). Unlike working for a private family, the women who took
outside laundering and sewing into their homes set their own schedules, pay,
and rate of production, while still managing a household.
Men’s professions were more highly varied but typically encompassed low wage
generalist professions such as porters, warehouse laborers, mill workers,
longshoremen, delivery drivers, mechanics, or construction workers.
The
majority of African American men and women worked for others rather than in
their own businesses between 1900 and 1930. Consequently, there were few
businesses in the project area that appeared to be black-owned and operated
during the early part of the twentieth century. One notable exception was a
meat market run briefly by Samuel Hudson on Lot 6 of Block 34 between
approximately 1906 and 1911. However, he did not own the property from
which he ran his business; an Italian American named Joseph Danna did, who
operated a grocery store there.
This pattern has been observed elsewhere (and for other times) in Freedmen’s
Town. According to Maxwell (1997), in 1870 over 60% of African Americans
worked at unskilled manual labor and service jobs, whereas only 10% of whites
in Houston worked at such jobs. Meanwhile, while almost 50% of whites worked
as tradespeople, in manufacturing, or as shopkeepers, less than 10% of blacks
worked at these professions. Beeth and Wintz’s (1992) statistics are even
starker for 1880, indicating that 84% of African Americans in Houston worked
at unskilled labor and service oriented professions, while only 9.1% held skilled
jobs. And while black business ownership and participation did increase in
Houston during the twentieth century, the businesses they opened “tended to be
service establishments oriented toward the black community” (Beeth and Wintz
1992). Within the project area during the 1920s and 1930s a number of blackrun businesses did emerge and included restaurants, a hat shop, beauty shops,
an icehouse, and a barber. Most of these businesses were operated on property
owned by whites. There were a few notable exceptions to this, however.
Seamstresses and laundresses formed a unique sort of entrepreneurial network

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

probably patronized by the white community, as did Houston’s jitney drivers
during the second decade of the twentieth century.
Churches entered the project area during the early twentieth century,
concurrent with development. The earliest church in the project area was
probably the 2nd Pleasant Green Baptist Church. According to a 1924 Sanborn
map for the project area, the church was located at the corner of Taft and Gray
on Lot 5 of Block 6 in the Powars Addition (Figure 3-5). Tax records and deed
records indicate that a church owned that lot beginning in 1905 (HCDR
195/197 in Wagner 2005). The plat map indicates the church had heat, stoves,
lights and electricity. However city directories also suggest families may have
been living at the rear of that lot from around 1910. This may be the result of a
mistake with respect to house numbering in the city directories. What is certain
is that the church was destroyed in 1926 and that by 1930 the church had
moved to Lot 8 of Block 4, where it remained until it was demolished in 2003.
That church served as important focal point for the community according to
local residents. Worth noting is that the 2nd Pleasant Green Baptist Church’s
location, first on Block 6, then on Block 4 was within or near the blocks that
contained the highest concentration of black owner-occupied lots.
This
connection suggests that owner occupants not only anchored membership, but
also helped promote the development of churches in their communities. One
other church was less permanent. The Union Tabernacle Church was located
on Lot 9 of Block 34 from around 1921 to 1925. That church was probably
associated with the Union Hospital, located across Genesee Street.
A
contributing factor to its impermanence could be that most of the residents who
lived near that church were tenants, and by the 1930s, most of the property
owners in that portion of the project area were white absentee landlords.
Children under the age of 15 within the project area were almost universally in
school, according to census records. Next to churches, schools were the most
important community institutions in Houston’s 4th Ward (Beeth and Wintz
1992). Remembering the 4th Ward environment of the 1970s, Darryl Patterson
stated, “our parents made sure we had a good education. You had to obey. You
had to do your duties….you had to do your church activities” (Patterson 2004).
Jacqueline Beckham recalled a neighborhood that was like a “small town within
a small town.” 4th Ward and Freedmen’s Town in particular, was a place where
“you had nosy neighbors…everybody knew your business.”
It was a place
where residents would sit out on their front porches and feel protected by the
constant buzz of activity (Beckman 2004). Gladys House and Darryl Patterson
echoed the same sentiments. “West Dallas was just lined with different types of
cafes, lounges. It was just a fun time for African Americans…we were selfsustaining (House 2004).” “We had a nurturing neighborhood,” according to
Patterson (2004).
That the project area was part of a stable and cohesive community is reflected in
the owner and occupancy patterning. Though tenancy tended to be less
permanent when owner occupancy, in many cases extended families rented
houses or rooms on adjacent or nearby properties. This may have been the case
with the Forshay family. John Forshay rented a house on Lot 1 of Block 1 in
1920, while an Elvina Forshay rented a house on Lot 7 of neighboring Block 35
with Addie Conway, according to the 1908, 1912 and 1917 city directory.
Meanwhile, the same Addie Conway (25) and a Viola Forshay are listed in the
1910 census as living on Block 2, Lot at 1711 Andrews. The census shows that
Addie’s 5-year old son, Lochett Conway, and Viola Forshay’s son Jesse lived

there
with
them.
During
the
same
year
a
sixteen-year old Isabella Forshay lived at neighboring 1715 Andrews (Wagner
2005). What this suggests is that families attempted to stay in proximity to each
other, even as they moved from house to house. Black property owners who
owned more than one lot typically rented to other family members to form
extended family compounds.
Longtime black owner occupants of the neighborhood included Walker and Lucy
Spillman (Lots 6-7, Block 2 of the Powars Southside Addition), Ellen Darling (Lot
10, Block 2 Powars Southside Addition), George Russau (Lots 9 and 10, Block 3,
Powars Southside Addition), Louis Richardson and his family (Lot 5, Block 4,
Powars Southside Addition), and the Starks family (Lots 4-5, Block 5 Powars
Southside Addition) among others. The Jones (aka Jonas) Starks family appears
to have been one of the first owner-occupants in the Powars Addition within the
project area, building a house on Lot 4 possibly as early as 1902. The family
later purchased Lot 5 in 1907, from investor T.L. Britton who acquired the
property from the African American Easter family, who in 1910, according to
census records (US census 1910), rented a home elsewhere in 4th Ward. City
directories and census Records show Celia Starks, a widowed freed slave from
Louisiana, as the head of a household (Jonas Starks died shortly after
purchasing Lot 4) at 1518 Mason Street in 1910. That household included her
three unmarried daughters Pauline, Hattie, and Addie, and two grandsons. Also
living with them was Celia’s recently married daughter Lula Starks White and
Mike White. One of Celia’s sons, William Starks (b.1876), lived nearby on Lot 4
of Block 33 (1715 Saulnier) of the Boercher’s Extension of Castania with his wife
Daisy and their son George Mitchell. A cabinetmaker by trade, he was one of
only a handful of skilled African American trades people reported for the project
area. He also owned his home, which he purchased sometime before 1909
through what appears to be a bond for title sale from George Hermann. By
1920, William Starks’ wife had died, Starks had sold his property to Alonzo
Fennel, and he was living with other Starks family members on Lot 5 of Block 5.
Their story is in many ways iconic of the neighborhood and its development over
time. Heads of households who had some means, purchased contiguous lots
and built homes for their extended families, or to rent to other tenants. A
typical household might have three generations from several branches living in it
at once. Land often passed from generation to generation over the course of 50
years as the family continued to occupy the original houses.
In a similar circumstance, longtime owner-occupant Mary Brady (later Rainey)
originally settled on Lot 4 of Block 3 in the Powars Addition around 1910 with
her husband John, a bricklayer. John’s age was unknown; Mary was born in
1879 in Louisiana (US census 1910, 1920). Though John died shortly after
purchasing the property, Mary continued to support herself and her daughter
Marcie (born in 1913) as a laundress. Mary’s 25-year old brother David Ivory
from Louisiana also came to live with them and the pair took in boarders to
supplement their income. In 1920 there were twelve people living at 1715
Ruthven (Lot 4) comprising members of three families and three generations.
Mary eventually married one of those boarders—Henry Rainy—a 46-year old
widower, also from Louisiana, who worked as a laborer at the public works.
Mary and Henry Rainy lived and owned Lot 4 through the 1950s, opening their
house to various relatives, including a Troy Ivory who resided in the house in
1950. Troy was probably Mary’s nephew and David Ivory’s son; he was listed as
a businessman on Poll Tax Records.

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

On that same block two other families also established extended multi-family
compounds. The Robinson family purchased Lots 5 and 6 from Will Powars
through what appears to be a bond for title contract around 1902; and the
Russau family owned Lots 9 and 10 from around 1920. Louis and Pearl (aka
Phoebe) Robinson originally lived at 1411 Mason on Lot 6 with their two
daughters and one son, then later built a newer house at 1719 Ruthven on Lot
5, where they lived until at least 1939. Louis worked as a longshoreman.
Meanwhile they rented two other houses they built on Lots 5 and 6 to other
families through the 1940s and 1950s. In 1930 the Robinsons listed their total
wealth at $15,000, which made them one of the wealthier families in the
neighborhood (US census 1930). On the same block, George and Leah Russau
lived at 1418 Genesee (Lot 10), and rented houses at 1702, 1704 and 1706
Cleveland (Lots 9 and 10) to their grown sons, and to other families. George
worked as an ice peddler; he listed his wealth in 1930 as $6,000 (US census
1930). After George’s death in the 1940s, ownership of the two lots was split
between his wife and three sons William, Jessie, and Robert who continued to
pay taxes on the property through 1950.
These particular instances reflect a specific pattern of ownership for many
African American families who made their homes in Houston’s 4th Ward. It is
one defined by deliberate long-term land tenure among landowning families.
More importantly, almost all of the long-term owner occupants supplemented
their income by taking in boarders, or building additional houses on their
properties for their extended families and other tenants. Based on these and
other records, it can be inferred that many African American families who sold
property after only short periods of ownership usually did so not by choice, but
because circumstances prevented them from continued ownership. Evidence of
debt, fire, ambiguously written bond for title contracts, and lawsuits appear all
too frequently in the deed, tax, and census records.
The long-term demographic trend is extremely telling in this regard. In 1915 all
but two households in the project area were black (the Dannas and the
Trapolinos are the two white households); and of the approximately 67 Lots in
the project area, African American families owned and occupied 29 of them (or
43%). By 1930, the number of lots within the project area had increased to 83
and only 22 (or 25%) of them were owned by African Americans. In 1930 still
the majority of the project area residents were black. The only whites living in
the project area were those that rented apartments in the recently developed
complexes along Taft Street, and six Italian American families. Notably, in 1940,
the neighborhood demographics remained virtually unchanged, with African
Americans holding the same 22 of 83 lots within the project area (Figure 3-6).
The precipitous drop in ownership status among African Americans between
1915 and 1930—a time when intensive development of the project area was
taking place-- reflects the volatile environment in which African Americans
attempted to acquire property and economic security during that period. It
appears that those who managed to retain their property beyond 1930 held onto
it through succeeding generations, no doubt as a part of an economic safety net
for their families.
Significantly, the decline in black owner-occupancy between 1915 and 1930
corresponds also to a rise in tenant occupancy and absentee landlordism
throughout the project area. Though black lot owners did often rent to tenants,
they also lived on that same or adjacent property. This was not always the case
with white lot owners. Whites accounted for almost all of the absentee

landowners in the project area. However, a handful of white families did live
and own property in the project area and these were all Italians.

American-owned lots are shaded.

Italian American Occupation and Community Development 1896-1945
The Italian presence and influence in the 4th Ward is an intriguing aspect of the
neighborhood’s development. It is a topic that few historians have explored with
any rigor (Harol 1999). Italian land ownership in the 4th Ward began in the late
nineteenth century and continued well into the 1990s (Harol 1999). Italians
began immigrating in large numbers to Texas in the 1880s, and continued at the
same pace until roughly World War I, during what Belfiglio (1985) called the
second wave of Italian Immigration. Most of the Italians who entered Texas

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

29

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

during this period came from southern Italy where economic conditions were
dismal. The agricultural system was failing, modern public works amenities
were virtually non-existent, and fewer than 10% of the adult male population
was able to read or write (Belfiglio 1983). Almost all of these immigrants were
farmers or unskilled laborers. Italians purchased land disproportionately in
minority communities and in outlying areas of Houston, such as the 3rd and 4th
Wards in part because land was inexpensive in these areas. With the help of
mutual aid societies, they opened small businesses, primarily groceries and fruit
markets. These endeavors required a relatively small outlay of cash and minimal
training. In 1906 there were 57 Italian owned groceries in Houston out of a total
Italian population of roughly 350 individuals. In Houston, Italian owned
groceries accounted for 13% of the total. In places like Galveston and Beaumont,
this percentage was much higher (50% and 28% respectively, Belfiglio 1983).
This pattern has been observed in other communities, such as Austin, where
Italians owned groceries and ice houses in the Red Light District (Feit et al.
2003) and in Austin’s small Freedmans community in Clarksville (Wood 2007)
The earliest Italian landowner in the project area was Guiseppe Danna who in
1896 purchased Lots 6 and 7 of Block 34 (Boercher’s Extension of Castania)
from Camille Cline for $400 (HCDR 91/574). He built and operated a grocery
store on Lot 6 from roughly the turn of the century to 1923. He lived in an
attached dwelling on Lot 7, and built at least one rent house that he leased to
African Americans. Eventually he sold one of his lots to his daughter (or sister)
Louise Scalvino (née Danna) who owned the land into the 1950s, presumably
until the Houston Independent School District purchased the entire block and
constructed the new Gregory Lincoln School. According to city directories, she
did not live on that property.
The Dannas were not the only Italians to purchase and live on property in the
project area. Other Italian families that owned and occupied property included
brothers Joe and Frank Pizzitola and their families, the Verdinos, the Billeris,
the Russos, and the Trapolinos (Figure 3-7). All of these families owned
groceries or small businesses located on corner lots.
These businesses
doubtless served both the black and white residents in 4th Ward, and relied on
black labor as well as patronage (Maxwell 1997). The Italian families who lived
in the project area were typically first generation immigrants who came to
Houston between the 1880s and 1920s. Over time, the children of those first
generation immigrants, and many other Italian families, such as the
Giammalvas, Venezias, or the Russos became absentee landowners of property
that they rented out to African American tenants. By 1950, Italians owned
collectively more property in the project area than any other ethnic group (see
Figure 3-6). In 1925 Italians owned 49% of the lots in the project area. In
1946, they owned 57% of the lots. The largest landowners were the Trapolinos
who at one time owned 10 lots scattered throughout the project area. Their
property contained primarily tenant houses, except the corner lot (Lot 1) on
Block 38, on which their grocery store and meat market was located.
According to Anthony Pizzitola, land ownership among Italian immigrants “was
like an insurance policy during old age (Pizzitola, personal communication
2005).” In an age where pensions, 401k’s and Medicare were absent, Italian
immigrants purchased land for economic security. This perception was not
dissimilar to that held by black families in the project area. The difference,
however, was that Italians appear to have been much more successful at
acquiring and retaining multiple parcels. More than likely, this had something
to do with discriminatory practices such as Jim Crows laws, poll taxes,

discriminatory hiring practices, and predatory bond for title sales made to
African Americans that consistently affected the ability of blacks to succeed
economically.

Italian meats. The sign above the scale reads “this store is owned and operated by
a friend, neighbor and tax payer in your community”.

Over time, increasing disenfranchisement affected the ability of African
Americans to influence and control the development trajectory of the
neighborhood. The trend toward absentee land ownership strengthened from
1930 to the end of the twentieth century. Accompanying this trend was a
corresponding decline in the condition of many properties and the overall
condition of streets and other urban infrastructure. In the project area, many
properties were poorly maintained by the 1990s just prior to demolition (Figure
3-8). Streets were potholed and were notoriously ill-drained in times of wet
weather (Richardson 1928).
That Italian land ownership contributed to the disenfranchisement of African
Americans has been suggested in other literature about Houston’s 4th Ward-­
specifically during the 1980s and 90s crises over several major redevelopment
projects, including the Allen Parkway Village, in the heart of Houston’s
Freedmen’s Town. There too, Italian American absentee landlords controlled a
large part of the land and were able to act in concert to promote redevelopment,
from which they stood to benefit economically (Harol 1999).

Housing in 2002. This house was built by Jones and Celia Starks around 1900.

Nevertheless, their role in shaping Houston’s 4th Ward and the project area was
nuanced. Despite growing economic control over the neighborhood, and a
corresponding decline in occupancy, Italian Americans, like African Americans,
retained close emotional ties to the 4th Ward. Anthony Pizzitola, whose parents
lived on Lot 10 of Alden Place from 1925, and whose extended family owned
businesses and residences close-by, recalled a neighborhood where the screen
door and windows were always open. “We never locked the door except at night
(Pizzitola 2004).” Jack Passante had similar memories of his boyhood in the 4th
Ward. Like so many other Italians, his family owned a grocery store that was
patronized mainly by African Americans. He played football in the streets of the
4th Ward with black kids and attended the public school in the 4th Ward
(Passante 2005). In the project area, black and white kids played baseball
together in the undeveloped triangular tract to the east of Block 1 of the Powars
Southside Addition. “I mean you didn’t knock on someone’s door. You just got
your ball and bat, and your Booger or whoever…[said] ‘let’s go play some
baseball’ and then all of a sudden you had a whole team (Pizzitola 2004).” Long­
time 4th Ward resident Jerald Taylor echoed these sentiments when he mused,
“a lotta people have histories here (Taylor 2004).”

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
By Mason Miller
Archeological investigations in the vicinity of Houston’s 4th Ward District have
uncovered a variety of archeological sites attributed to both historic and
prehistoric periods. Given the study area’s generally improved, urban setting,
the overwhelming majority of these sites were documented through regulatory
clearance work and salvage archeology operations ahead of construction projects
within the downtown area.
A few others were brief surveys conducted by

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

32

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

avocational archeologists. This section summarizes the more prominent field
investigations that have occurred within approximately 4,800 meters of the
current field excavation area.
Archeologists surveyed a short stretch of White Oak Bayou from Cole Creek to
West Road in the winter of 1956. As part of this survey, archeologists
documented two scantily-recorded archeological sites along the west bank of
White Oak Bayou. Though very little information is available for these sites, a
brief reference to samples collected (soil and shell samples) indicates that at
least site 41HR116 was a prehistoric site. In 1976, a survey in Buffalo Bayou
Park (along the park’s namesake waterway) revealed a small early twentieth
century Anglo-American dumpsite/scatter with a variety of materials including
brick, ceramics and metal, that indicated an multiple, varied users rather than
that of a single family.
During the 1980s, a large number of archeological sites in the area were
documented for city projects and private construction. Archeological volunteers,
working ahead of a large office building construction project on Main Street
excavated a multi-component prehistoric to modern occupation site in 1984
(Site 41HR409). Prehistoric components to the site consisted of lithic debitage
and tools, and historic materials included standard varieties of ceramics, metal
and glass. The site was recommended for inclusion on the NRHP. Before
construction of the Museum of Texas History in Sam Houston Park, east of the
4th Ward, students from Rice University surveyed and tested Site 41TV425, the
Long Row and Rose Garden areas in conjunction with HABS documentation.
Excavations for the project unearthed late nineteenth century building materials
and artifacts such as brick, glass bottles and faunal remains as well as buried
utilities, and demolition debris from pre-1950s construction in the area. While
the museum was ultimately constructed, portions of the site were preserved for
later interpretation. Finally, Site 41HR575, the Diverse Works/Market Square
Site, was investigated by Roger Moore as a doctoral dissertation project. The
project was located immediately south of Whiteoak Bayou, approximately 3,200
meters northeast of the 4th Ward District. The site contained a broad variety of
urban commercial and residential debris resulting from continuous occupation
from the 1830s through its excavation in 1984. Occupational debris was found
in a series of overlapping strata including direct evidence of 1860 and 1888 fires.
The site was later listed on the NRHP and neighboring extant buildings (the
Foley and La Carafe Buildings) are contributing components of the larger Main
Street/Market Square National Register District.
Other notable investigations of the 1980s included the testing of a Civil War-era
munitions dump and later urban occupational site at the Trimble Site
(41HR508) near the present-day Toyota Center, approximately 3,200 meters east
of the HISD testing location, and survey of World War I’s Camp Logan
(41HR614) for the City of Houston’s Memorial Park to the west. In addition,
subsurface survey of an urban city block in anticipation of construction of The
Children’s Museum of Houston was also conducted during this time. Within
this survey area, archeologists found materials dating to the post 1920s
(41HR637 and 41HR638, located approximately 4,800 meters south of the
current project area). A final 1980s archeological investigation in the region
involved the survey and testing of a turn-of-the nineteenth century railroad
depot and residential district for Houston’s Metropolitan Transit Authority,
approximately 3,200 meters east of the current project.

Chapter 3 – Historical Background

Archeological survey and testing excavations in the 4th Ward’s Block 12 (Site
41HR787) were completed in 1996 for regulatory construction clearance of the
Houston Criminal Justice Center. During the extensive archival and field
investigations (hand excavation and backhoe trenching), researchers focused on
pre-1870s features and documented buried residential surfaces up to five
meters deep. Among the myriad finds of the target period are those attributed to
prominent local historical figures including Houston’s 1850s mayor in Lots 6, 7
and 12 and the architectural remains of Sylvia Routh’s residence. Ms. Routh
was rare antebellum free African American woman who owned a small,
successful mercantile ship fleet.
During the same period, PBS&J archeologists and historians investigated a
cemetery and the original site of Freedmen’s Town located in Allen Parkway
Village (41HR886) housing project. A significant portion of Freedmen’s Town
had been demolished in the 1940s to construct Houston’s first housing project,
at that time intended for white veterans. By the 1990s most of the residents of
Allen Parkway Village were African American and the 1940s structures were in
poor condition. United States Housing and Urban Development sought to
demolish those housing projects as part of a proposed mixed income housing
revitalization project. However, the housing project was built over the heart of
the nineteenth century Freedmen’s Town community and also overlapped the
site of the Third New City Cemetery dating to the late nineteenth century. Along
with some evidence of construction-related disturbance, survey and monitoring
investigations at the site revealed numerous intact period features including
privies, cisterns, foundation elements and refuse pits as well as a complement of
historic debris relating to the nineteenth century Freedmen’s Town occupations.
While the historic Third New City Cemetery was also known to exist at that
location, project planners did not anticipate significant numbers of burials to be
located within the project APE as 1940s land clearing and construction for the
San Felipe Courts apartments had documented the removal of more than 900
burials.
No burials were found within the surveyed area and the THC
recommended for the project to proceed with monitored construction.
Subsequent utility placement monitoring adjacent to the project area however
revealed human remains that would later be tallied at approximately 400 burial
features near the northwest corner of the project area. Human remains,
primarily identified as African American, were examined and excavated, and
studied by physical anthropologists, then slated for reburial in a cemetery
memorial in the Allen Parkway Village’s northeast corner.
Finally, archival and field survey of 11 city blocks in Houston’s central business
district, approximately 3,200 meters east of the current project area revealed
more than 130 features attributed to the city’s “Quality Hill” neighborhood (so
named due to its association with well-to-do families). Investigators focused
their efforts on pre-1870s features, notably in the footprint of the modern
Minutemaid Park. The investigations revealed numerous residential tracts
containing a variety of residential and yardscape features. Later analysis
revealed that households tended to have relatively expensive ceramics and glass.
The absence of agriculture-related items suggested a predominantly urbanized
merchant-class citizenry in this location, not one dependent on the surrounding
land.

CHAPTER 4 PROJECT HISTORY AND FRAMEWORK
THE CASE FOR BURIALS AND CEMETERIES
By Rachel Feit
During the planning phases for this project, the possibility was raised that
human remains could be present within the project area. This possibility
originated with local landowner and resident reports that they learned from their
parents or older relatives that there were graves somewhere in the area.
Anthony Pizzitola reported that his father had been told in 1925 not to build his
home on a certain lot near Andrews Street because there was a cemetery there
(Personal Communication 2005, Wagner 2005). Later Lucinda Campbell stated
in an interview that she had been told that Buffalo Soldiers were buried under
the brick portion of Andrews Street (Campbell 2004). Others corroborated the
statement that they had heard about burials in the area, but the exact location
of them was not necessarily consistent. Terry Lee Howard, for instance, had
been told by Lottie White (who is a descendant of the Starks family that lived on
Block 5 fronting Mason Street) that there were graves in the neighborhood, but
he heard that they were under the Gregory Lincoln School track, which is a little
to the north of Andrews Street. Darryl Patterson gave the same location
(Patterson 2004) in an interview. Based on this information, and a history in the
4th Ward of similar situations (PBS&J 2002), the potential for human remains
was thoroughly researched through several background studies completed in
2001, 2003 and 2005.
The studies conducted by Janet Wagner found no direct evidence to support the
claim.
However, her research did reveal some circumstantial evidence
suggesting that burials could theoretically be present within the project area.
Wagner’s research indicated that the City of Houston had a number of “missing”
cemeteries and burials- that is, reports of interments in unspecified locations
around the city. These include a missing city cemetery that was closed in 1839
when a yellow fever epidemic caused enough deaths for the cemetery to become
full; the burial of Sam Houston’s secretary on his 30-acre ranch overlapping the
project area; and the graves of a number of individuals who died in Houston in
the 1830s whose actual interment locations are not known (Wagner 2005).
Most significantly, in her 2003 report (Wagner 2003) Wagner visited the National
Archives in Washington D.C. and found evidence of a post Civil War Union
soldier cemetery in Houston, whose precise location was unspecified. NARA
documents give the general location as “near city cemetery,” which is located on
Dallas Street in the 4th Ward. The cemetery would theoretically date to around
1867, when the Union army still occupied Houston and could contain a number
of burials of both Union soldiers and prisoners of war. Given local reports of
Buffalo Soldier burials in the project area, which was just outside the western
edge of Houston until 1907 and which is “near city cemetery,” it was reasonable
to suspect that the missing Union soldier cemetery and the reputed Buffalo
Soldier burials somewhere in the project area could be one in the same.
The fact that the triangular piece of land (Alden Place) representing the corner of
the Houston Ranch remained undeveloped until the 1920s lent further credence
to support the argument for a cemetery in the project area. The possibility of
finding human remains was sufficiently plausible that regulators and
investigators designed the field investigations to specifically address this
possibility. The project incorporated a GPR survey, planned for extensive

35

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

Gradall trenching, incorporated excavators with a background in human
osteology, and ensured that a clear protocol was outlined for the discovery of
human remains. The goals of the project then were twofold: to determine
whether graves were present and to investigate potential late nineteenth and
early twentieth century remains. Most importantly, the project was designed to
involve the local Freedmen’s Town community in the project planning process,
which had first expressed concern over HISD’s site selection.

AFRICAN AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY AND THE GREGORY LINCOLN
PROJECT
By Jodi Skipper
Houston’s 4th Ward has been the site of radical redevelopment initiatives since
the 1990s, forcing many African American residents from their homes. Notable
projects that have occurred in the 4th Ward and in Freedman’s Town in
particular include public projects such as the Houston Criminal Justice Center
(1996), the Allen Parkway Village Redevelopment (1998), redevelopment on
Blocks 28 and 29 of the Castania Subdivision (2002), and many privately funded
condo, loft and town home developments (1998 to present). These projects often
resulted not only in the demolition of historic homes and resources, but also in
the physical displacement of African Americans (and some other ethnicities as
well) from a neighborhood that had been largely black since the Civil War. In
the case of Allen Parkway Village, redevelopment also required removal of more
than 400 unmarked African American burials, the names and records for which
had been lost during the 1930s. This sense of displacement coupled with a
growing sense of loss of significant black heritage resources in the 4th Ward led
to an increased sensitivity toward development among many residents. When
HISD acquired the Gregory Lincoln property by means of eminent domain,
opposition to the project among many black 4th Ward residents was acute.
Many believed, as was the case in Allen Parkway Village that there was a
possibility for unmarked burials, as local lore had indicated burials nearby. The
archeological study thus attempted to consider the voices of residents and black
community leaders who felt that their heritage and their physical remains in
Houston were rapidly being erased. In this sense, the project required a multi­
disciplinary approach, integrating archival research, oral history, public input
and public outreach efforts. In so doing, it drew heavily on the models
developed during previous studies where African American burials were
disinterred prior to development.
This section summarizes the theoretical underpinnings of African American
archeology, particularly with respect to public engagement and describes some
of the relevant previous investigations that informed this project from its
conception. This section is not intended to summarize all research on African
American archeological sites that has taken place in Texas, but rather is meant
to discuss the particular projects and problems that helped shape the Gregory
Lincoln testing project.
African Diaspora Archeology Background
An interdisciplinary approach to the study of the lives of enslaved Africans and
African Americans has increasingly become integral to the field of historic
archeology. This African American archeology, sometimes referred to as African
diaspora archeology (e.g. Singleton 1999), records some undocumented lifeways
of African diasporic populations in the Americas and how they relate to “the

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

36

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

European colonial experience…” (Singleton 1999:1), namely in the United States
and the Caribbean. A more holistic African diaspora archeology which, in name,
would be more inclusive of African diasporic populations outside of the western
hemisphere has not yet been realized, although many African diaspora
archeologists are aware of this gap in the field (Orser 1998). One reason that
the western hemisphere exhibits more studies in African diaspora archeology is
that cultural, educational, and political movements (e.g. Civil Rights, Black
Power, and African American studies) have caused researchers of various
backgrounds to examine the roles of blackness in the creation of archeological
sites. This examination did not come naturally.
Early African American research projects were based largely on the analyses of
material evidence at ante-bellum plantations, with attempts at denoting class
and status, while the day to day life experiences of black communities were
often neglected (e.g. Otto 1977). Later studies attempted to interpret African
diaspora sites using multifarious perspectives, including acculturation,
creolization, and resistance studies (Bower 1985; Deetz 1996; Ferguson 1985;
Geismar 1982; Handler and Lange 1978). These studies were analyzed through
material culture coupled with the use of oral, historical, and ethnographic
resources as supplementary interpretive tools. Most of these methods were
utilized to analyze the life ways of enslaved Africans without much identification
of the “gray” areas-- that is post slavery sites inhabited by newly freed persons
which could not be so easily identified as African American occupied sites, due
to artifact similarities to White tenant farming sites and other sites inhabited by
poor whites (Singleton 1985), or other African influenced sites outside of the
period of enslavement. As research interests developed and became more
complex, so did the areas of study.
By the late 1990’s, Charles Orser (1998) referred to four wide-ranging topics that
African diaspora archeologists generally consider: 1) the material identification
of African identity, which explores the famous Herskovits-Frazier debate on
whether African diaspora populations maintained African cultural traits outside
of African boundaries, and whether these traits can be identified in artifacts; 2)
the archeology of freedom at maroon sites (e.g. Palmares in Brazil and Fort Mosé
in Florida), or New World enslavement resistance sites, which may reveal
cultural survivals of African political and economic systems and syncretisms of
New and Old World traditions; 3) how race and racism, as opposed to ethnicity,
influence archeological interpretations and socio-historical contexts; and more
recently, 4) the relevance of archeological research to non-archeologists—that is
people who may not directly participate in archeological interpretations, but may
be affected by what the interpretations mean, as descendant communities and
other interested parties.
African Diaspora Archeology and the Public
The analyses of African diaspora archeological sites and the development of this
field have been influenced by the contributions of sociologists and other social
scientists that have made significant strides in the research of otherness, with
explorations of authority and representation and insider-outsider research
(Warren and Twine 2000). Although sociologists and cultural anthropologists
faced the tasks of working with African American descendant communities,
historical archeologists had largely avoided these relationships prior to the
controversial recoveries of sites like the African Burial Ground and The Dallas
Freedman’s Cemetery, in which engagements with descendant communities and
other local publics were enforced (Blakey 1998; Coughlin 1996). These projects

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

37

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

occurred at the height of research debates surrounding the impending 1990
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and showed
that African American descendant communities expressed some of the same
concerns as descendant Native American communities. They also introduced
the politics of government and community involvement into the archeology of the
African diaspora in the United States.
In the early 1990s, some historic archeologists began to stress the need for
members of the field to question how racism influences research and examine
how individual and personal reflexivity could help to challenge this racism, by
asking researchers to think about social responsibility and ensure that their
research did not serve racist interests (Franklin 1997; Potter 1991). The
examinations of racial subjectivities are the basic tenets for reflexive and critical
archeologies and an un-reflexive archeology is likely to happen when members of
descendant groups are excluded from all aspects of archeology, including the
conception of research questions, excavation, data analysis, and interpretation.
Researchers who at first did not examine their own position with respect to the
groups being studied, began to question some of their own presuppositions,
their assumed objectivities, and attempted to involve the interested public. In
this way, the Freedman’s Cemetery and African Burial Ground projects
significantly contributed to changes in the way that African diaspora
archeologists think about their research.
The Freedman’s Cemetery
The Freedman’s Cemetery was the “principal burial ground for virtually every
African American in Dallas between the years 1869 and 1907” (Davidson
1999:1) and became the final resting place for over 7,000 of those residents.
During the 1940s, highway building efforts paved over nearly one acre of the
Freedman’s Cemetery site.
At this point, most of the laws protecting
archeological sites were not in place and those sites inhabited by
underrepresented populations were continuously at risk. The significance of the
Freedman’s Cemetery would not be examined until the 1980s when “… a
preliminary walking survey of threatened cultural resources performed by the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) identified the remaining intact
portion of Freedman’s Cemetery” (Davidson 1999:1). The black community in
Dallas saw Freemen’s Town as a central symbol of African American history in
the community and wanted to preserve it (Peter 2000). The descendants’ efforts
to preserve the community began in 1989 with Black Dallas Remembered, a
nonprofit organization established to preserve and promote black Dallas history.
Black leaders warned that widening the North Central Expressway would impact
the cemetery site. After TxDOT archeological staff confirmed through survey
and research that the freeway had been constructed over hundreds of graves,
black leaders rallied to prevent further disturbance. There were other issues
debated surrounding TxDOT’s proposed excavations and removal of the burials,
including whether it was necessary to expand the highway in the area, how
archeologists previously handled removal of “graves goods” and why the greater
black Dallas community had not been initially involved in many decisions
surrounding the excavation.
Though TxDOT went ahead with the highway expansion, after much initial
debate and community outrage, TxDOT formed a close partnership with the
Dallas Park Board and executed a Memorandum of Understanding with various
black community members, including Black Dallas Remembered that guided the
investigations and further research. As part of the Section 106 and TAC

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

38

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

compliance effort, TxDOT undertook the removal of more than 1500 bodies.
These were relocated on land that had become a public park and playground in
1965. The original property received a state historical marker for the site, and a
memorial was constructed for those interred in the cemetery. Shortly after the
discovery of the Freedmen’s Cemetery in Dallas, another cemetery site with a
similar story would gain national attention.
The African Burial Ground Project
The African Burial Ground Project in New York City gained national attention
when, in 1991, the US General Services Administration (GSA) began to dig
foundations for the construction of a 34-story federal building in Manhattan
(Coughlin 1996; Blakey 1998). This former burial ground for New York’s
enslaved Africans began to attract local and national attention, when the project
was halted by the detection of skeletons at the site and local African
descendants began to question the GSA’s intentions. They were concerned
about where the bones were going, who would handle them, and saw a definite
need for African American scientists to be involved with the project from start to
finish, and joined together to have the site properly memorialized (Then I’ll Be
Free to Travel Home, 2001). Along with holding the GSA responsible, many
African Americans also blamed the majority white archeology team from City
University’s Lehman College for much of the problems.
Although the
archeologists were doing the work that the GSA hired them to do, they were
caught between the GSA, who often utilized them as scapegoats, and the African
American community who saw them as partners with the GSA. Maria Franklin
(1997) suggests that “archeologists are blamed because most of them have not
given black society much reason to feel that archeology should be important to
them.” She goes on to say that archeologists must still try to remain as neutral
as possible in these conflicts.
Working with Descendant Communities
Following the Freedman’s Cemetery and African Burial Ground projects, some
African diaspora archeologists began to openly question “how racism conditions
[their] discipline and, in so doing, how an unreflective archeology is fed right
back into a racist society without challenging it” (Franklin 1997:40). They also
became aware of their own attitudes with respect to the groups being studied,
personal objectivity, and consequently, attempted to involve the interested
public (Blakey 1990; Forman 1994; Franklin 1997; Jameson 1997; Leone etal.
1987; McGuire and Paynter 1991; Potter 1991; Tchen 1994). Through this
responsiveness, archeologists like Carol McDavid instituted research methods
and defined frameworks for working with diverse and more inclusive publics.
During her research at The Levi Jordan Plantation Site in Brazoria, Texas,
McDavid defined her “publics” as “the descendants of Levi Jordan, the
descendants of the African-Americans who lived on the site, other European
Americans, African-American members of the surrounding region, community
leaders, local educators, people interested in history and archeology, academics
who study history and archeology, and others” (1997: 115). McDavid’s research
resulted from the excavation and study of the Levi Jordan plantation conducted
by Ken Brown and his students at the University of Houston, which began in
1986. Research at the site led to various understandings of the complex
relationships between researchers and publics, including how “…descendants
have begun to realize that their lives can be changed by the ways that other
people tell their family histories, and they are, increasingly, demanding a voice

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

39

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

in presenting the archeologies and histories of their ancestors (McDavid 1997:
115).”
Unlike Brown’s extensive examination of the Levi Jordan Plantation, some
research is limited by the constraints of private Cultural Resource Management
(CRM) and government firms “who frequently are not principally interested in
anthropological research…”(LaRoche and Blakey 1997: 92), even though the
researchers may be.
Many “projects are often launched in response to
immediate needs, rather than as part of an overall objective or plan” (McDonnell
2002). “Generally CRM archeologists need have little academic preparation or
interest in African-American research” (LaRoche and Blakey 1997: 92) to
excavate African diaspora sites, but a recognition of the importance of this
preparation, even via outside resources, has increased within the past ten years.
According to Jameson (1997), a CRM archeologist, “how [archeologists] involve
the public in the rich fabric of the American experience is one of [the] great
challenges as [they] enter the twenty-first century”.
The Houston Independent School District (HISD) Gregory Lincoln/HSPVA Archeological
Testing Project and its Multiple Approaches
The HISD undertook the construction of two schools in the historically
significant 4th Ward neighborhood, and, as a public entity, was required to
comply with the Texas Antiquities Code. Community involvement at this site was
particularly complicated, because the largely black population previously
suffered and continues to suffer from systematic marginalization and neglect
from civic leaders and planners. In recent years, the neighborhood has
undergone a radical urban renewal, as developers capitalize on the
neighborhood’s proximity to Houston’s downtown. This location made the land
some of the highest valued real estate property in the nation. Many residents
have been caught up in battles with wealthy developers, government agencies,
and their supporters over the fate of the residents’ properties. Local white
residents distrusted government entities that seemed to abuse the rights of
eminent domain without following proper due diligence procedures. Many local
black residents also distrusted white-dominated public agencies for these and
other reasons, and were even more anxious about archeological work in the
community. This was partially due to the fact that previous projects such as the
1998 Allen Parkway Village redevelopment ignored the voices of some local
residents who claimed early on that the project area contained possible graves of
African Americans, moving ahead with construction at the very epicenter of the
historic Freedmen’s Town community. In so doing, not only were historic
domestic archeological remains of early Freedmen’s Town homes largely
overlooked, but more than 400 African American burials were moved with very
little input from local residents and descendants. Several years later, the
wounds from Allen Parkway Village were still raw when HISD announced its
plan to build a new Gregory Lincoln Elementary and High School for the
Performing Arts on 4th Ward property that had been home to hundreds of
residents. Local oral history had indicated a strong likelihood for burials to be
present within the project area.
Some local residents supported the belief that graves were located in the area
and local historical researcher Janet Wagner’s study of the site “concluded that
the possibility of the existence of a cemetery could not be ruled out” (Wagner
2001). By the summer of 2004, representatives of the HISD, the THC, Gladys
House of the Freedman’s Town Association, outraged citizens and leaders who
oppose the destruction of Freedman’s Town historic sites by private interests,

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

Andrea Hinckson of Senator Rodney Ellis’ office, Damien Brockmann of Rep.
Garnet Coleman’s office, and Anthony Pizzitola, a discontented former
homeowner on the acquired HISD site formed a neighborhood advisory
committee. Eventually a consensus was reached on how to proceed with the
project and manage the potential archeological issues, by hiring a preservation
consultant to develop a research design and associated scope of work,
conducting an in-depth lot-by-lot archival analysis of the entire project area, and
record oral history interviews of some residents of the Fourth Ward area. After
reviewing the research design and scope of work, the THC also “outlined a broad
five-phase historic preservation program which reflected the input of various
stakeholders” (Letter dated June 28, 2004 in McGhee 2004).
The HISD hired Dr. Fred McGhee of Fred L. McGhee & Associates as community
liaison to the project. McGhee wrote the overall research design for the project
and conducted oral interviews with local residents. Oral histories interviews
were not acquired simply for documentation and salvage anthropology, but to
assist with the mapping of former locations, as done by public historians like
Dolores Hayden who employed a similar method called cognitive mapping to
examine the former sites of non-extant structures through the recollections of
several underrepresented groups in a project in Los Angeles, California. Hayden
collected oral histories which described how associated communities
remembered particular locations, realizing that information derived from locals,
as well as other sources like newspapers and tax records, could be invaluable.
Hayden (1995:24) mentioned that oral history “accounts like these begin to
make it possible to map spatial segregation for the larger African American
community: not only streets and neighborhoods, but schools, hotels, stores, fire
stations, swimming pools, and cemeteries would be some of the places to
examine.” McGhee prepared for the 2005 archeological testing project with the
premise that archeology should evoke participation from multivocal and diverse
sources, ranging from small town community elders and historians to university
educators and legislators, and that archeologists should work with the
community to decide which comments and suggestions would best fit the overall
scope of work and research objectives. The goal of the archeological testing was
to determine whether graves and other archeological features were present, and
to evaluate those features with respect to NRHP and SAL eligibility criteria.
Beyond compliance, the project also sought to establish much needed baseline
data for African American sites in Houston. Using archeological and historical
evidence, the project sought to chronicle the African American experience in
Houston, and provide a conduit for the residents (and descendants of residents)
of the neighborhood to engage with their own history. This project was a tedious
and significant effort, not only because particular attention was devoted to
community outreach, but because the project focused on historical periods and
communities (Africans, African Americans, and the Southern urban poor) often
overlooked in historic archeology research. Hicks & Company was hired to
excavate the property in the summer of 2005.
McGhee, an African American maritime archeologist and historical
anthropologist, acted as public liaison for the project designed to create
narratives of the 4th Ward Freedmen’s Town community, and functioned as a
speakers bureau in response to media, academic, and public inquiries.
Archeology was uniquely positioned to create such narratives, since the material
culture data gathered from excavations often serves as the only record of
minority communities.

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

In the Gregory Lincoln project, the reciprocal and complementary relationship
between the oral history narratives and archeology supported the theory that
archeology provides “a critique on the texts of oral history that is distinct from,
but related to, both the written past of the documentary record and the
narrative past of present memory” (Purser 1992:27) and that oral history
narratives can assist in the analysis of past material culture by identifying
“…how specific objects were once produced, distributed, and consumed in local
contexts long gone” (Purser 1992:32).
Community Involvement
The Gregory Lincoln archeology project was by nature a community approach.
Prior to the start of archeological testing work, FLMA and the Hicks & Company
Principal Investigator, Rachel Feit, briefed the final THC approved Testing
research design to the community advisory committee in a public meeting. The
research design outlined a burial plan of action, in case burials were located,
which included ongoing site monitoring by trained osteologists and a
prearranged notification to affiliated parties, in the case that burials were found.
The community advisory committee was to take on the role of functioning as a
burials treatment advisory committee, charged with advising the preservation
professionals and project archeologists on spiritual and protocol matters. The
committee would concern itself with basic questions such as site access and
control, religious visitation by interested parties, and potential scientific analysis
of the human remains, if found. These concerns would be incorporated into the
subsequent burial treatment plan.
Project managers also agreed to give
community members controlled access to the site one half day a week, during
which FLMA would be available to give tours to interested persons at this time.
Project archeologists, government officials, and community members began this
phase of the Freedman’s Town project with a belief that many issues are
unavoidably entangled in projects examining African Americans and other
members of the urban poor in America. The various groups associated with the
project did not always agree on what exploratory courses to take or how to take
them, but realized that open forums and spaces for communication may help to
avoid confrontations that may impede project development, as well as the
preservation of narratives pertinent to the lives of local residents. It also fostered
community involvement through public tours, meetings, lectures, and
internships, signifying that the great strength of a community-based approach
to public history “is that [it] gives power to communities to define their own
collective pasts…because often people…are the best authorities on their own
pasts” (Hayden 1995:49).
Politics and the Public
Unavoidably political projects do not always play out as well as all parties intend
and the Gregory Lincoln project was no exception. Once the testing excavations
began, many community residents continued to distrust the HISD and
archeologists. In addition to periodic media coverage of the project, some
residents publicly protested the project just outside of the project boundaries,
videotaped various aspects of the excavations, and questioned archeologists
about project methodologies, which had been discussed and established prior to
the beginning of the excavations. In a move that reinforced local antagonisms,
HISD’s site manager decided to minimize and restrict community visitation at
the site, causing residents to feel that HISD and project archeologists did not
honor their commitment to community participation. Though this decision was

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

42

Chapter 4 – Project History and Framework

made due to safety and liability concerns over unrestricted access to a
construction site, many local community members felt intentionally excluded.
Although evidence of residential occupations was recovered, no evidence of a
cemetery was confirmed. Some residents blamed archeological methods for this
lack of evidence. Exploratory trenches were excavated with a Gradall, and some
felt this method lacked the required precision to locate graves. Others criticized
archeologists for not excavating the trenches sufficiently deep to find graves and
grave shafts. It seemed to archeologists that some people wanted to stop the
project for personal reasons, and endeavored to do so by questioning motives
and undermining the archeologists’ credibility.
It is problematic to disconnect good from bad intentions in projects that have
complexities stemming from over a century of political, racial, and class
differences. As Fred McGhee once stated, “it’s like the 4th Ward has been in an
abusive relationship with the city for years.” The political structures in Houston
and other U.S. cities have not been fair to poor and minority property owners
who often become easy targets in property rights debates. Similarly, the field of
historic archeology has historically not been fair or unprejudiced when it comes
to working with the same groups. Recent critical theories have assisted many
archeologists in efforts to become more perceptive and open-minded about their
prejudices when dealing with groups who are not like them. Archeologists and
other parties who are involved in African diaspora sites who think that public
archeology projects are quick and uncomplicated processes will likely be deeply
disappointed. Public archeology projects that attempt to be inclusive will
require work on all parts. Descendant communities are not obligated to agree
with archeologists simply because archeologists invited them to participate and
it is unreasonable for archeologists to think that they will please all members of
the communities. Archeologists must genuinely want to work with descendant
communities, because they think that their opinions are important, not simply
to fill some void in an academic genre.
In complex projects such as these, where diverse political, public and private
interests are at stake, archeologists are often on the front lines and are identified
with developers. They may have to deal with descendant communities whether
they want to or not. It is better to be prepared for these interactions, rather than
be hopeful that they will not occur. The potential negative consequences arising
from gaps in communication are probably far greater than those arising from
those that try to respect the opinions of various parties. Although the Gregory
Lincoln project did not run easily, the effort to engage the community made the
project a more complete one.

Chapter 5 – Methodology

CHAPTER 5 METHODOLOGY
By Rachel Feit & Bradford M. Jones
Targeted areas that were investigated included all areas of high probability for
human remains plus selected residences (both owner-occupied and tenantoccupied), businesses, and churches. Archeologists used a Gradall to expose
targeted areas (Figure 5-1). Gradall trenches were placed in such a way so as to
catch specific features. For instance, in areas where a possible cemetery was a
primary concern, trenches were dug roughly north to south, since historic
burials are generally placed along an east-west orientation. These trenches were
typically one to two meters deep and were dug into Pleistocene Beaumont clay so
that grave shafts, theoretically, would be visible within the walls and base of the
trench (Figure 5-2). Within residential or commercial lots, trenches were placed
through the center of lots to expose foundation features, wells or cisterns.
Trenches were also placed along the backs of lots and behind dwellings to
expose privies, and trash pits. Investigators placed more trenches in areas that
appeared to have isolatable archeological remains, while fewer were placed in
areas where disturbance or temporally mixed deposits were apparent.

Chapter 5 – Methodology

Investigator Recording Trench 7

The methodology called for Gradall trenching to be used for identification
purposes, followed by test unit excavation to be used for further definition and
refinement of data. It was anticipated that archeologists would excavate 45-50
Gradall trenches (of approximately 10 meters in length each) across the project
area. In fact, H&C excavated 48 Gradall trenches, and then excavated an
additional seven trenches using a backhoe with a toothless bucket for a total of
55 trenches. The seven backhoe trenches, not in the original research design,
were approved by the THC after 48 Gradall trenches had been excavated, and
provided additional exposures of high probability areas not originally covered by
Gradall trenching. The backhoe trenches were excavated double-wide for an
average width of about 1.4 meters. Most Gradall trenches were excavated one
bucket wide (1.5 m). Gradall and backhoe trenches varied in length from nine to
over 50 meters in length, with most trenches clustering around 19 meters in
length.
Features within the trenches were flagged, assigned a number and hand plotted
onto a trench map. Each trench was then numbered, mapped, profiled for
stratigraphy, photographed, and recorded on standardized forms. The corners
of each trench and each feature were mapped using a Total Data Station (TDS).
The total station established an arbitrary coordinate system across the project
area, with the main datum located at the 1,000(x), 1,000(y) point inside the
fence at the corner of Taft and Gray. Base elevation (z) was 100 meters.

Thirty two square meters of test units were excavated on the site. The size of the
test units were measured in metric increments of 1m2 or 2m2 (15 1x2 meter
units and two 1x1 meter units). These units were placed in areas containing
possibly intact archeological surfaces or features (Figure 5-3). Each unit was
excavated in 10-centimeter levels with the exception of overburden removal,
which occurred in Test Units 1-6, 20, and 19, where the upper sediments clearly
contained mixed, modern cultural debris. Recording and excavation procedures
that applied to all hand-dug units included the following:

Investigators recorded the results of each excavation unit on
standardized forms.
Sediments from each unit were screened through 1/4 inch wire mesh.
Data were established for vertical control of each of the test units and
these were electronically mapped with a TDS. Depths within the test
units were taken relative to the fixed data, using a string with a line level.
The top and bottom corners of each unit were mapped using a TDS. The
TDS was also used to map some artifacts and features in place.
Relevant profiles, plan maps and photographs were made of each unit.
All hand excavated units and features were dug to culturally sterile
sediments.

Figure 5-3

Investigators Working on Lot 3, Block 2

The total amount of sediment excavated during the investigations covered
approximately 2,241.24 square meters, which means that approximately 7.2% of
the total sediment across the project area was investigated. This far exceeded
the amount originally proposed (1-1.2%) in the research design.
Artifact processing occurred during field investigations and continued after
fieldwork concluded. During fieldwork, H&C set up an onsite laboratory located
in a vacant building on the HISD property (Figure 5-4). The artifacts from the
55 trenches and 17 test units were initially sorted in the laboratory and
catalogued into the following ten categories based on the their material
composition: faunal, floral, ceramic, glass, metal, mineral, textile, synthetic,
composite or unknown.

The further separation of the artifact collection into functional categories was
conducted based on a general set of categories first established by Stanley South
(1977).
However, as many researchers have subsequently acknowledged,
South’s categories are too broadly defined, being based on material culture from
eighteenth century rural sites, and do not generally reflect the range of things
used and discarded by late nineteenth century and early twentieth century
urban dwellers. Thus investigators modified the functional coding system to
incorporate categories of objects developed during previous projects (cf. Feit et al
2003). The functional categories and examples of the types of items are as
follows:

and undecorated ceramic fragments were photographed and set aside for
eventual discard (Figure 5-5). H&C’s two-person lab team was not able to
complete the initial sort of all artifact bags in the field, and so the unanalyzed
bags were taken back to the H&C lab for completion.

An Example of Discarded Material

All artifacts were catalogued and sorted, and entered into the project’s Microsoft
Access database. Based on our analysis and cataloging, the total collection
consists of 32,455 individual artifacts. These artifacts include a large sample of
ceramic, glass, metal and faunal remains as well as smaller amounts of
synthetic, mineral, floral, textile, composite and artifacts of unknown material
type or function. Of these 26,973 artifacts, or 84% of the collection, have been
removed for discard as they represent non-diagnostic or redundant artifacts.
Those items that were not initially designated for discard, such as whole bottles
and ceramics, items with diagnostic marks of manufacture, faunal materials, or
unique items in the collection, were further analyzed and upon re-evaluation
some of those too were discarded, as they represented a redundant set. Artifacts
that were selected for curation were properly marked and documented according
to curation standards at the Center for Archeological Research in San Antonio –
the designated curatorial center for the project materials. Artifacts were
originally assigned bag provenience numbers based on the order in which they
were excavated in the field. Following trinomial designations, however, the
artifacts were assigned permanent bag provenience numbers according to site
(block) number. The project database contains a record of each artifact with its
initial and permanent bag number.
Diagnostic attributes of each artifact were recorded and wherever possible, the
type of object, dates, and place of manufacture were ascribed to the artifacts.
Individual artifact data is presented digitally on a CD by material type,
functional types and provenience within Appendix E. Faunal material was sent
to Leeanna Schniebs for identification. Her report is included in Appendix B.

H&C archeologists excavated a total of 55 trenches (48 Gradall and 7 Backhoe)
across ten city blocks (Figure 6-1).
Taking into account their general
dimensions (length, width, maximum depth) this equates to approximately 2,200
square meters (3,150 cubic meters) of sediment investigated across the study

Trenching was designed to meet the general goals of the project which were: 1)
to determine whether a cemetery or isolated human remains existed within the
project area, and 2) to recover archeological data about the early twentieth
households and 4th Ward community. Archeologists observed no intact graves,
grave outlines, or disarticulated human remains in any of the trenches. The
investigations did however locate a large number of isolated architectural
features and occasional occupational surfaces. All but six (Features 30, 36, 40,
and 42-44) of the 49 features recorded during investigations were unearthed and
identified during the trenching phase of investigation. Investigators dug eight
trenches to a depth of between 30 centimeters and 1 meter (1-3.28 ft); 19
trenches were dug between 1 and 1.50 meters (3.28-4.9 ft); 22 trenches were
dug to a depth of greater than 1.50 meters (4.9 ft; 8 of those trenches were
deeper than 6.5 ft). Trenches that targeted burials were generally excavated to a
depth of 1.5 meters (5 ft) or more. Trenches that targeted historical residential
and commercial features were typically shallower—often less than a meter (3ft.).
While the depth of each trench varied depending upon the potential resources
targeted and the actual stratigraphy encountered, the general trenching
methodology followed the same sequence. The project PAs or PI monitored all
trenches during excavation, making notes on standardized forms and flagging
features for later recording. Following excavation, each trench was drawn in
plan view and profile, paying particular attention in mapping features and other
artifacts, intrusive utilities and the general stratigraphy of the trench.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Virtually every trench contained some evidence of modern use including
construction fill, landscaping/grading and buried utilities placement. Through
trenching it was readily apparent that Alden Place, Blocks 1, 3, 6 and all areas
north of Andrews Street contained very little in the way of intact early twentieth
century surfaces (Figures 6-2 through 6-5). Trench profiles in these areas
demonstrated clearly marked construction zones and temporally mixed deposits
directly overlying sterile clays.
Prior to Hicks & Company’s involvement in the project JK Wagner and Moore
Archeological Consulting predicted that there could be up to four feet of fill
across the project area, laid down in order to improve drainage in the flood
prone 4th Ward area. However, Hicks & Company’s investigations determined
that no such fill was present. Construction fills were noted in areas where
nineteenth and twentieth century houses were demolished, then built over. For
instance, on Block 5, Trenches 28, 30 and 37 documented a thin layer of ashy
and sandy mortar overlying a layer of brick rubble. The ashy sandy mortar
zone, was buried approximately 30 centimeters below this surface and was no
more than 5-10 centimeters thick. This was likely placed over the demolition
zone for an earlier structure, in order to level the ground before the next
construction episode. However, for the most part all archeological remains were
found between 10-60 centimeters below the surface, lying directly atop
indigenous Beaumont clays.
Thirty-one of the trenches examined contained subsurface utility lines. These
utilities included terra cotta and cement sewer pipes, water, wastewater and gas
lines, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wastewater and electrical lines. Two water
lines in Trenches 5 and 34 were active (unmarked following Dig Tess
assessment) causing trenches to fill with water before the lines could be capped
off. While some of the utilities, such as the buried electrical lines encased in
PVC, were clearly very modern, others—such as the 1.5-inch iron and 6-inch
clay water and sewer pipes—appear to date to before 1940. The extent of buried
utility lines attests not only to widespread sub-surface impact throughout all
parts of the project area, but also a certain level of infrastructure present
throughout the project area since the early twentieth century.
While trench profiles demonstrated a relatively unique land use sequence
corresponding to each lot of each block, they nevertheless revealed a consistent
underlying indigenous stratigraphy, with five to 30 centimeters of dark brown
upper humate soils (10YR3/2-4/3) and recent construction fill. Secondary
layers of culturally modified soils mixed with indigenous sediments (typically the
most artifact and feature-rich sediments of the area) continued to a depth of
anywhere from 30-60 centimeters before transitioning to a distinctly dark gray
brown to black compact clay that extended to depths of 80-120 centimeters.
Occasionally, a few artifacts were still found in the upper five centimeters of this
dark gray brown clay, however, in much smaller numbers. From there, the
dense black clays gradually transitioned into 10YR6/1 gray mottled (10YR6/8)
and olive brown (2.5Y4/4) sterile, compact Beaumont clay that extended beyond
the maximum trench depth. The contact point between the dark gray brown
clay and the Beaumont clay undulated considerably throughout the project
area, with natural iron staining occurring in the upper gray brown clay at dips
and humps.

The investigations recorded 53 features (Table 6-2). Most of these features were
identified through trenching, though a few were recorded during test unit
investigation. Areas where there appeared to be a concentration of intact early
twentieth century features together with period artifacts were identified for
further test unit investigations. These areas were located primarily on Blocks 2,
4 and 5 of the Powars Southside Addition.

Archeologists noted that early twentieth century archeological contexts (Blocks
2, 4, and 5: Trenches 10-11, 27, 31, 33) were characterized by a distinct, ashy
or charcoal-laden pale gray lens 20-30 centimeters below the surface (Figure 66). In Trenches 4 and 51, archeologists isolated the historic remnants of Robin
and Andrews Streets (respectively), noting a thin sheet of densely-packed
crushed shell 15-20 centimeters buried ten centimeters below the ground
surface (the possible Robin Street remnant was classified as Feature 6). Other
trenches showed similar lenses of crushed shell (i.e. Trenches 33, 53, and 46)
that were likely driveways, alleyways, or placed as fill.
Figure 6-6
Trench 21. Brick scatter and grayish cultural soil can be seen in
upper 30 centimeters.

Trenching revealed that intact archeological surfaces were fewer than initially
anticipated across such a large site area. This probably had to do with
overprinting from continuous occupation, redevelopment, and recent structure
demolition.
Moreover, historical archeological surfaces and features were
entirely limited to the upper 50 centimeters of sediment (most often the upper
35 centimeters), generally resting just above the dense, sterile clays. The
majority of the features recorded during trenching comprised foundation piers
and post molds, which often lay in straight lines across the trenches providing
information about structure and fence locations. Areas where there appeared to
be intact features or sealed early twentieth century artifact contexts were flagged
for test unit investigations. Test units were placed in or near trenches 10, 11,
14, 33, 27, 28 and 31.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Due to time and funding constraints, several trenches could not be investigated
that contained features or dense artifact scatters. Trench 53 (on Block 4) and
the western edge of Trenches 28, 30 and 31 (on Block 5), for instance, contained
abundant pre-1930s artifact debris in a broad, shallow sheet refuse lens (Figure
6-7). These trenches extended along the back of house lots, suggesting that this
debris was part of a rear yard garbage accumulation. Though these contexts
could have yielded ample interpretable artifacts, investigators simply ran out of
time during field investigations and could not explore them further. Moreover,
in the absence of any formal disposal context in these areas, the integrity of the
deposits was questionable. Another area that appeared to have contained intact
house foundation features (Feature 5) was Trench 4 on Block 35, under the
track. This area could not be investigated in detail, because the trench had to
be covered over at the onset of Hurricane Rita, which interrupted the first week
of investigations. The trench was subsequently never reopened, in part due to
the fact that HISD asked that the Gregory Lincoln Elementary students be
allowed to have access to a portion of their playground during investigations.
On any project of this size, where time, cost, and logistics are an issue, the
Principal Investigator must make choices to prioritize the work. Given that
intact remains were found elsewhere in the project area, the features in Trench
4 lost some of their priority.
During trench excavations, investigators collected a sample of artifacts from
each trench, especially those that could be temporally, culturally, or historically
diagnostic. For example, investigators collected molded plastic teddy bear
barrettes from under the Gregory Lincoln School track because these tend to be
diagnostic of the pigtails often worn by African American girls in the second half
of the twentieth century; investigators collected bottles or decorated ceramic
fragments because they tend to be time and place diagnostic; and investigators
collected items such as Bic pens, beer cans, electrical fan parts, or even paper
ribbon since they clearly date the soil deposits in which they were found to after
1950. Artifact discussion by trench is provided below.
Though no actual human remains or graves were located during the project,
archeologists did unearth an inscribed cement headstone fragment and a marble
church plaque within Trench 28 on Lot 5 of Block 5. The concrete headstone
fragment is inscribed with “Died … 29 …” and is very likely a twentieth century
grave marker (Figure 6-8). The marble fragment appears to be a church
dedication plaque or something from a baptismal font dating to 1925 (inscription
reads “…n, one, Baptism/…issionary/…Church/…u 1, 1925/….ns.” Figure 69). Both artifacts were found during trenching, as fragments in the upper 30
centimeters of sediment from Trench 28. The concrete marker was found among
other debris just above a series of concrete sewer lines running down the length
of the trench within the same sediment that contained plastic, modern can
fragments, and a 1961 and 1974 penny. The marble plaque fragment was
pulled directly from the wall of Trench 28 buried 10 centimeters below the
surface (Figure 6-10).

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Plan and Profiles of Trench 53

As a result of these discoveries, investigators placed additional parallel trenches
on Lot 5 to uncover possible graves. No human remains or anything resembling
a grave shaft was found in the sediments located below these artifacts or on Lot
5, leading investigators to conclude that both the cement headstone fragment
and the marble plaque fragment were pushed onto the lot as part of a demolition
episode on some other nearby property. The lot behind Lot 5, for instance, was
owned by the 2nd Pleasant Grove Baptist Church until 1925 when a lawsuit
forced all property owners facing Taft Street to relinquish their claim on property
there. Subsequently, the lot became a gas station. Four buried petroleum
storage tanks were removed from that lot in January 2005. It is possible that
these fragments were part of the church, or in storage within the church and
pushed onto Lot 5 of Block 5 during its demolition, which would be consistent
with the date on the marble plaque fragment. Another possibility as to how these
two fragments came to be placed on Lot 5 is that they were included as part of
some incinerated fill that was identified in not only trenches but also test units
on Lot 5 buried between 27 and 38 centimeters below ground surface. In any
case, investigators found no graves in any of the four trenches or two test units
on Lot 5, and for that matter, found no graves anywhere within the project area.

ARTIFACT RECOVERY FROM GRADALL TRENCHES
Owing to the exploratory nature of the trenching, artifacts from Gradall trenches
were collected in an unsystematic fashion subject to the observations of the
monitor and the visibility of the artifacts in the matrix. In general, trench
monitors collected examples of diagnostic, unique or otherwise notable items or
bulk samples from screened buckets. Table 6-3 shows the recovery of artifacts
by analytic class for each backhoe trench. As a result the recovery of artifacts
and artifact categories is biased, but nonetheless very informative on the general
temporal components present in each area as well as the overall integrity of the
deposits. The following provides a descriptive summary of artifacts collected
from the trenches by blocks and lots. Individual artifact data is presented in
Appendix E.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Trenches in Alden Place (41HR1008)
Alden Place was largely undeveloped until 1925, when it was divided into 15 lots
oriented toward Taft Street. Development within Alden place consisted of a mix
of commercial structures, single family residences such as the Pizzitola
residence on Lot 10, and brick 4-plex apartment buildings. An exception,
however, appears to be those lots that were once located in Block 35 of
Boercher’s Extension of Castania. Block 35 was initially subdivided into 10 lots
around 1900 and houses were on them in the early twentieth century. However,
the western edge of this block overlapped with the 2.5-acre triangle of land that
was once a part of the Houston Ranch 30-acre tract. The overlap between this
tract and the land that had already been divided as Boercher’s Extension of
Castania was resolved during a 1925 lawsuit that ultimately provided clear title
to the individuals who owned land in the former Houston tract, rather than
those who owned land on Block 35. After the 1925 lawsuit, Lots 4, 5, 6 and 7 of
Block 35, which specifically overlapped the Houston Ranch were redeveloped as
part of Alden Place. Post 1925 land use on those Alden Place lots (Lots 12-15)
that overlapped with Block 35 consisted of commercial structures that included
barber and beauty shops, a restaurant and a dry cleaner (Wagner 2005).
Investigators dug 21 trenches in Alden Place. Due to the fact that this area
remained largely undeveloped until after 1925, Gradall trenching efforts focused
primarily on the search for burials, which were reportedly under the Gregory
Lincoln school track, under Andrews Street, or near the Pizzitola residence on
Block 10. Thus the trenches in Alden place were typically deeper than trenches
placed on other blocks in the project area. Artifact recovery from trenches
excavated in Alden Place included a range of artifacts relating to primarily the
later periods of project area occupation. The diagnostic artifacts recovered
generally date to the post 1940’s period. Overall the material is dominated by
architectural debris, glass and ceramics. In several of the trenches, no artifacts
were recovered due to the very low density or clearly modern nature of the
artifacts. No artifacts were collected from Trenches 3, 6, 7, 15, 36-40, 49 and 55
in Alden Place.
Trench 2- Lot 13/14
Trench 2 contained a small collection of 13 artifacts that pertain to materials
from a possible pre-1925 occupation of Lots 13/14, when this area was first
subdivided as Block 35. The most common artifacts were likely associated with
kitchen activities and included non-diagnostic glass shards (n=4), a fragment of
porcelain and pieces of animal bone (this material was not analyzed). A piece of
saltglazed stoneware pottery with incised decoration on the exterior surface was
likely part of an ornamental flower pot. Artifacts related to clothing and
personal grooming were limited to a metal belt buckle and a plastic barrette.
Though the residences have long since been demolished, a soft paste brick was
collected and would have likely pertained to brick piers or a pre-1925 house
structure. In addition, a square iron rod with nails, and a metal hook both of
unknown function were recovered.

Trench 4- Lots 13/14/15
As was the case with Trench 2, only a small collection of artifacts (n=9) was
made from Trench 3 and these are predominately artifacts associated with
residential occupation. Glass and ceramics were the most commonly collected
items and included a clear glass shard, a clear whole bottle with an embossed
neck reading “2½ oz.”, a fragment of a plain whiteware cup, and a piece of
porcelain with a blue transfer print design (Figure 6-11). Seven pieces of
animal bone were also found. A slightly curved fragment of stained glass was
recovered, perhaps a decorative item of a home such as a lamp. Items of a more
personal nature included the mouth piece of a pipe stem, and a pink and orange
colored marble. Though it cannot be certain how they came to be there, two
pennies were also recovered, one dating to 1941 and the other to 1961. In
addition a piece of metal was recovered.
Trench 19- Lots 9/10
Fifteen artifacts were collected from Trench 19. The majority were pieces of
architectural debris including a pulled wire nail, a fragment of sewer pipe,
window pane glass and four pieces of machine cut wood. A brass plate was also
recovered with the inscription “uckner 403 HP Fresno California,” that may
pertain to a sprinkler. Of particular interest is a fragment of a yellowware
ceramic serving bowl with sponge applied blue decoration. This ceramic sherd is
likely a mid to late nineteenth century artifact, but was no t in situ, probably as
a result of site demolition. It may have been an heirloom piece owned by the post
1925 occupants, or it could be trash deposited from adjacent earlier
occupations. Another fragment of a whiteware ceramic serving bowl was also
recovered. Finally, a very corroded horse shoe was also collected.
Trench 9- Lots 9/10
Trench 9 excavation resulted in the collection eight artifacts, the majority of
which were items generally related to the kitchen. The ceramics recovered are
serving dishes and include two pieces of whiteware, one of which had transfer
printed decoration, a fragment of semi-porcelain that appears to be from a
decorative vase, and three pieces of salt glazed stoneware. The base of a thick
aqua colored bottle was collected with a prominent “V” mark, the maker of
which is not currently known. In addition a single cut nail was found in the
back dirt.

Trench 52- Lots 9/10
A small but eclectic mix of modern and early twentieth century architectural,
kitchen, recreation and household type items were collected from Trench 52. A
nearly complete aqua colored pepper sauce bottle with a sloping collar finish
manufactured in a three part mold and finished with a lipping tool, with a hand
tooled finish was found that bears a “2” on the base. The base of a manganese
bleached footed glass vase was also recovered. These glass items were found in
association with the leg of a wood stove, a pulled wire nail, and two golf balls of
clearly more recent vintage (one is marked "4 MAXFLI XS TOUR"
"ELASTICORE").
Trench 16- Lot 9
The excavation of Trench 16 uncovered mostly architectural materials including
a piece of window pane glass, a spelter tack, a strip of corrugated metal, a pulled
wire nail, and aluminum or spelter metal ring. An overall fastener of aluminum
or spelter was also found.
Trench 17- Lots 7/6
A small collection of nine artifacts was collected during the excavation of Trench
17, which crosscut Lots 7 and 6. Glass was the most common material type
collected and consisted of five pieces of window pane glass, an unidentified
bottle fragment, and a complete aqua colored 6 ½ oz. Dr. Pepper soda bottle
with a crown cap manufactured in an automatic bottling machine (ABM). A
single clear glass marble with a blue swirl was also recovered. Finally a
miscellaneous piece of corroded and rusted metal was recovered that showed
evidence of having been welded.

Trench 18- Lot 6
Trench 18 was located solely in Lot 6. Seven artifacts were collected from this
trench, the majority of which are architectural elements of houses. These
elements included parts of an electrical light socket constructed of metal, plastic
and attached wood, as well as two shards of window glass. The other material
collected included an indeterminate piece of plastic and a fragment of a green
glass bottle base with a partially preserved makers mark that reads “05, A”.
Trench 41- Lots 1/2
This trench is located in Lots 2 and 1. A collection of 31 artifacts was made
during the excavation of Trench 41, the majority of which were related to
architectural elements of the building once located on this property. Pulled wire
nails (n=16) were the most abundant architectural artifact, followed by window
pane (n=4) and asbestos tile (n=4). In addition, a brick and two pieces of floor
tile were recovered. One tile was terracotta and the second a hexagonal piece of
semiporcelain. Two pieces of shell and two pieces of cut bone are likely food
remains associated with the occupation of the structure, and a fragment of lamp
glass and a glass bottle are likely to be as well. The bottle is manufactured in an
Owens ABM and is composed of clear glass (arsenic bleached) and bears a
makers mark on the base reading “L-G,” which is the mark of Liberty Glass from
their Sapulpa, Oklahoma plant, and would have been produced between 1946­
1954 (Lockhart 2000).
Trench 44- “The Triangle”
Six artifacts representative of kitchen, personal, and architectural functional
aspects of life were recovered from Trench 44. The most common artifacts were
associated with kitchen contexts and included a spoon with a filigree handle, a
light green Automatic Bottling Machine soda bottle and the neck of an arsenic
bleached clear glass milk bottle with an external threaded finish. More personal
effects included a clear exterior threaded Vaseline jar and a cold cream jar of
white milk glass. A soft paste brick with the name LUCAS impressed was the
only architectural item collected.
Trenches in Block 1, Powars Southside Addition- 41HR1009
Block 1 of the Powars Southside Addition was platted around 1900 as a partial
triangular block between Alden Place, Mason Street, Cleveland and Block 38 of
the Powars Southside Addition. It consisted of six lots facing Mason Street (See
Figure 1-3). The earliest of these to be developed were Lots 1 and 2, which had
houses on them according the 1907 Sanborn Fire Insurance map. These were
shotgun houses occupied by African American renters, among them a John
Forshay, who had family members living on neighboring Block 2 and Block 35.
The 1924-1950 Sanborn shows that Block 1 was completely developed with
residences. Only one owner-occupied residence was on Block 1. This was the
home of Joe Russo, who built a home on Lot 4 sometime before 1920. By 1930,
the Russos had moved elsewhere and were renting the house to African
American tenants. The Gradall trenches placed on this block during the survey
and testing project primarily focused on the search for burials, since this area
was considered to be high probability for graves. Three trenches were placed on
this block—Trenches 42, 43 and 46. No artifacts were collected from Trench 46.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Despite residential occupation beginning around the turn of the century, the
trenches on this block yielded no intact features or discrete artifact contexts.
Trench 42- Lots 4/5
Five artifacts were collected from Trench 42. These artifacts included three
bottles and a knife that fall into the kitchen functional category, and a metal
pipe that is an architectural aspect of a now demolished structure. The knife
has a stainless steel blade with a wooden handle and is probably a steak or
regular kitchen knife. The bottles are body shard fragments with no diagnostic
markings. One is brown/amber, one is aqua and the final light blue. The
surfaces of the latter two examples are solarized. The pipe appears to be a
portion of interior plumbing made of brass or a copper alloy.
Trench 43- Lot 6
Only three artifacts were collected from Lot 6 in Trench 43. This included a
horseshoe fragment and a spelter bucket. In addition a rectangular concrete
footing pier (51 x 31 x 9 cm) was found. The surface retains mortar residue
marking a cinderblock footprint (40.5 x 19 cm) with two quadrangular areas
devoid of mortar in the interior. Overall there is a low density of artifacts
associated with the occupation of this block, and in general the artifacts are too
recent to have been collected or lack any contextual integrity.
Trenches in Block 2, Powars Southside Addition- 41HR1010
Block 2 of the Powars Southside Addition was developed around 1900. It
consisted of 10 lots bounded by Andrews, Genesee, Ruthven and Mason Streets.
It is not entirely clear when the first structures were built on this block, since
many of the occupants were tenants, and those who were landowners appeared
to have purchased property through bond for title contracts. However the 1907
Sanborn map shows that all but one lot (Lot 7) had residences on them in that
year. Lots 2-5 held shotgun houses occupied by tenants. The remainder of the
houses were owner-occupied. By the middle of the 1930s, however, the tenant
houses on Lots 2-5 had been demolished, or possibly burned in a fire. An
apartment complex was built there afterward. Gradall trench exploration on
this block focused primarily on remains from the tenant houses, the owneroccupied Spillman residence on Lot 6, and the owner-occupied Newton
Residence on Lot 9. This area was considered to be low probability for burials,
since it appears to have been one the first blocks developed. Hence, trenches on
this block were typically shallow, with a maximum depth of about one meter.
Investigators dug six Gradall trenches on Block 2. Trench excavations in Block
2 encountered some of the richest artifact deposits within the project area.
These trenches documented a large collection of artifacts associated primarily
with early twentieth century tenant house dwellings (Trenches 11, 12, 45; Test
Unit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6) in Lots 2-5, and the Spillman property on Lot 6. These
deposits contain large amounts of architectural debris, a good deal of which no
doubt was created by the subsequent razing of the property, as well as
thousands of items related to both the residential occupations and the types of
employment engaged in by the inhabitants. Unlike most site contexts where the
mixing of the early occupational deposits with modern trash indicated serious
disturbance and constrained interpretation of the artifact assemblage, in Block
2 the assemblage appears relatively discrete and reflects the practices of it’s
early twentieth century inhabitants. Because of the significance of these

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

70

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

deposits and the subsequent placement of a large number of test units, more
time will be expended on the description of these trenches than others in this
chapter.
Trench 10- Lots 3/4/5
Eight hundred and ninety-one artifacts were collected from Trench 10. These
reflect a wide range of activities and contexts associated with the residential
occupation of the block in Lots 3, 4, and 5. Architectural and kitchen related
materials dominated the assemblage, but a number of more personal artifacts
provide interesting texture to the site history.
As noted, a large number of artifacts (n=446) were functionally related to the
now razed architecture of the block. Numerically nails were the most common,
with 383 of the artifacts being pulled wire nails and only three cut square nails.
Broken window glass was also common, with 36 shards recovered, three of
which are thick plate glass. More general structure elements included five
bricks, a piece of floor tile, a tar shingle, and an asbestos tile. Wood was also
recovered including a clearly machine cut piece that had been burned. Evidence
of internal plumbing was present in the form of a bathtub faucet with attached
piping and a fragment of a toilet. Electricity seems to have been available as
indicated by the recovery of an electrical cord, wires, and a porcelain insulator.
Unfortunately the trench context of these artifacts makes assigning them to a
particular time period difficult.
Household furnishings were represented by decorative glass artifacts. Five
shards of glass appeared to pertain to glass bowls or plates. Most were clear,
but two were of a pinkish glass and another is a purplish hue, this last perhaps
a result of the exposure to sunlight of a manganese bleached fragment. Another
glass object was recovered that looked like a decorative attachment to a
chandelier or lamp cover. Fragments of a marble tabletop were also recovered in
this context.
Items related to personal grooming and health made up an important
component of the materials collected. A number of glass bottles by virtue of
markings or their finishes seem to have been medicines. These include a clear
prescription bottle with the marking “antiseptic” on it, a prescription finish of an
amber colored bottle, and a complete thin flask shape clear bottle made in an
automatic bottling machine for Illinois Glass. The side of the bottle is embossed
with “THE NAME St. Joseph’s ASSURES PURITY.” St. Joseph’s was produced
by the Gersetle Medicine Company in Chattanooga, Tennessee from 1890-1920,
and also New York, Memphis, San Francisco after 1920 (Fike 1987: 147, 149).
Though a triangle is visible on the base the date is not clear, though it does not
appear to be made of Manganese bleached glass, which situates its date of
manufacture roughly post 1918 (Figure 6-12). A small white milk glass
container with an exterior threaded finish marked “MENTHOLATUM REQ
TRADE MARK” is clearly a medicine bottle, probably for Vick’s. Ten additional
milk glass container fragments likely were mentholatum or cold crème jars. Ten
fragments of at least one small cobalt blue bottle with a triangle in a triangle
maker’s mark on the base was collected and may be a small perfume type
container. A clear glass eyedropper was also recovered as well as homeopathic
vial with a cork stopper remaining in the mouth.

Other personal items that may be related to grooming include a plastic
toothbrush handle that reads “VAL-U”, possibly an artifact of more recent
vintage, and a fragment of a mirror. What appears to be a small metal compact,
likely for makeup was also recovered. A small whetstone may have been used for
sharpening a razor or within the context of the kitchen. Other personal items
included a number of pieces of jewelry (Figure 6-13). These included a very
worn pin/broach made of spelter, two glass and one ceramic bead, and bent
piece of metal filigree that may have originally been part of a ring or other
ornament. Seven marbles were found. Five were of glass with a range of swirled
colors, a sixth was made of unglazed white bisque, and the seventh is a brown
Bennington marble made of salt glazed stoneware. Benningtons were
manufactured between the period 1880-World War I (Carskadden and Gartley
1990:57). A single fragment of a celluloid pipe stem indicates that tobacco use
was something the occupants of the site also engaged in.
A good deal of clothing related artifacts (n=23) were also found, especially
buttons. Nine of the buttons are made of shell and the tenth of plastic. Other
clothing related objects included two metal belt buckles, a collar straightener,
and ten pieces of leather shoe sole.
A number of tools were also recovered including two machine bolts, a washer,
and three lengths of iron wire, one of which had been bent into a hook on the
end. A spark plug and threaded pipe fragment imply automobile maintenance
on the premises.

Metal Artifacts from Trenches on Block 2.

From Top to Bottom, Left to Right: Hot Comb (Bag 3-5); Whistle Part (Bag 11-9); Door Knob (Bag 12-5);
Chain Links (Bag 11-8); Rhinestone Setting (Bag 2-32); Pill Box (Bag 47-7); and 2 Buckles (Bags 4-9, 18-96).

In terms of functional categories, a large number of artifacts were assigned to
the category of kitchen. These are principally glass items, which indicate use in
kitchen related activities or are of unclear function, many are likely fragments of
bottles of various sorts. Also ceramics were represented alongside a few metal
artifacts such as a knife. The recovered kitchen glass was predominately clear
in color (n=191) and of these clear fragments 177 lacked any diagnostic features
or markings. Fifteen shards were aqua in color (13 no diagnostic features), eight
were amber/brown, none of which were marked or diagnostic, and four were
green, one with a marking. Several different finish types were present in the
collection, the most common of which is the exterior thread cap. One is a
complete blake variant bottle type. None of these examples had identifiable
maker’s marks, though all are of clear glass and manufactured using an
automatic bottling machine. Two had numbers on the base, but research has
not clarified what these may signify. Patent finishes were present on two of the
artifacts. One was a complete clear bottle manufactured in an Automatic Bottle
Machine that was marked “DR PRICE’S DELICIOUS FLAVORING EXTRACTS”.
This company was manufacturing flavoring extracts as early as the 1870s and
80s and through at least 1910 in Chicago. The maker’s mark on the base
identifies the bottle maker as Illinois Bottling Company and dates the time of
production between 1912 and 1927, though the lack of purpling of the glass
would seem to indicate it may be post World War I (Lockhart et al. 2005). The
other patent finish bottle is only a neck fragment, but may also be an extract
bottle. The neck and finish of a clear automatic bottling machine bottle with a
slightly flaring mouth and reinforced ring was recovered. A single example of a
clear glass crown cap finish was found, likely from a soda bottle. Another
probable soda bottle is represented by a body shard with an applied color label
(ACL) that is now illegible. Finally a single example of a blob top finish was
recovered. This bottle fragment is aqua in color and may represent an older
bottle, but is too incomplete to make temporal judgment. Several other glass
fragments were of interest. These included a fragment of molded glass that

73

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

flares and appears to be part of a clear glass pitcher or large mug, a body shard
of a clear salt or pepper shaker with molded rectangular designs on the body, a
thick clear glass lid labeled “…T KNIFE A…PRESTO” on the edge. The only other
marked glass with diagnostic significance was the base of a green glass bottle
marked with an Owen-Illinois maker’s mark that bears a “3” in the location for
date which places the period of manufacture at 1933 or 1943 (Lockhart 2004).
The ceramic component related to kitchen activities consists of 61 specimens
and is primarily white ware (n=46), with much smaller amounts of porcelain
(n=9), salt glazed stoneware (n=6) and a single piece of yellowware. The
dominant mode of decoration is transfer printing, though the majority of sherds
are undecorated. Many of the sherds are too small to identify the type of serving
vessel they represent (ie. Plate, bowl, etc.). Of those that are identifiable there
are three plate fragments, two of which have transfer print designs. A porcelain
saucer, cup, and fragment of a tea pot are also in the collection, possibly pieces
of a single set. The cup has an Asian inspired blue transfer print garden scene.
Fragments of a salt glazed stoneware vessel appear to be portions of a container.
Other kitchen related items include a knife, a fork, and a possible kitchen tool
that is heavily corroded and thus difficult to identify.
Finally there were nine items that are not easily classified within any of these
categories, and were described as miscellaneous. These include metal and
plastic objects with no clear functional use, or items of composite materials that
were unable to be linked to any known activity.
Trench 11- Lots 2/3 (tenant houses)
A total of 278 artifacts were collected from Trench 11, including many examples
of architectural material, kitchen material, clothing, personal effects, and other
artifact types. These artifacts represent a large cross sample of materials
primarily associated with the early twentieth century domestic residences that
were present in this portion of the site until it was razed to construct
apartments, probably sometime in the 1930s or 1940s.
Architectural materials are common and likely pertain to the remains of the
homes standing here prior to episodes of demolition that occurred on the site.
Pulled wire nails are the most common piece of architectural equipment
collected, accounting for 61 examples. Much less common are cut nails, of
which only two examples are recorded. In addition a tack, screw and three bolts
were recovered. Three bricks were collected as well as a chunk of concrete
mortar. Three window glass shards were also found which have two different
thicknesses. In addition a fragment of a ceramic sewer pipe and an electrical
connector was also recovered.
Household decorations and furnishings constitute a small portion of the
collected materials. These include two fragments of an incised and polished
terra cotta flower pot and an open mouthed glass top/stopper of a decorative
glass urn with a molded 8 petal design on the top. A part of a metal iron was
also recovered.
In this trench items of a more personal nature included a single drilled and
polished wooden bead and a similar red plastic bead with incised lines. A glass
marble and a broken porcelain piece from a tea service bear testament to the
often silent lives of children in the archeological record. A fragment of a clear

74

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

glass tube was also recovered that could be part of a pipe stem, though this
determination is provisional. A small knob and shaft assembly look to be a part
of watch assembly.
A number of buttons were also recovered. The majority (n=3) were made of shell
and a fourth was of copper or bronze. Items associated with grooming included
three fragments and one whole milk glass cold crème jar. Also recovered in this
trench was an iron straightening comb (See Figure 6-13). Considering the
occupants of the houses were black, this artifact represents a particular piece of
material culture that reflects the specialized hair styling habits of the
inhabitants.
Several artifacts were items clearly associated with the functional aspects of the
kitchen such as ceramic dishes and animal bone remains. These include 38
pieces of ceramic, of which 29 were sherds of undecorated plain whiteware
dishes. One whiteware sherd is differentiated by having a green glaze. Seven of
the ceramics were porcelains, including a miniature cup with a transfer printed
design. There was a single example of a clear glaze yellowware. The dietary
artifacts consisted of 20 pieces of animal bone, also likely debris associated with
the kitchen.
Ninety glass fragments were recovered that pertain to kitchen or medical related
activities, the majority of which were non-diagnostic body shards. Clear glass,
presumably manufactured through arsenic or selenium bleaching, was the most
common, comprising 68 of the specimens. Of these specimens 54 were body
shards that lacked any markings or elements that could be used to identify the
type of bottle. Marker’s marks were present on four of the bottles. Two bear an
“I” within a triangle indicating they were produced by Illinois Bottling Company
(Lockhart et al 2005). One artifact is a rectangular shaped basal fragment and
another is a small melted reinforced bead bottle with a “1/2” (no doubt for
ounces) marked on the side and probably a small medicine bottle. The
production date range for these two bottles is between roughly 1915 and 1929,
before Illinois merged with Owens (Lockhart et al 2005:2). A single bottle bears
the combined Owens-Illinois mark with a date mark of “2”, which indicates a
possible date of 1932 or 1942, though a lack of a “.” following the “2” strongly
favors 1932 (Lockhart 2004:2-3). Another bottle bears a diamond inside of a
triangle with a “3” to the right, also an Owens-Illinois mark, that dates to 1933
or possibly 1943 (Lockhart 2004:2-3). Several other bottles bear marks that are
temporally diagnostic or indicate function or are indecipherable. A polygonal
shaped bottle base and body fragment bears the mark “ADE IN U.S.A.” which
can date the bottle to a period of production no earlier than 1906. Two other
bottles bear “BB” and “TTLING” on their respective shoulder and base. Two
additional threaded finishes were noted on clear glass fragments. Two refitting
fragments of a blake variant I pickle/preserve jar were also in the collection. In
addition there is a single example of a packer lip finish on a neck and body
fragment of a rectangular blake variant I body.
A clear glass base bears the mark “Hygeia 8”. Hygeia bottles were first
manufactured in 1894 as nursing bottles. These wide mouthed nursing bottles
with fitted rubble nipples were easier to clean than earlier models, hence their
inventor named them after the Greek goddess of health (Baby Bottle Museum
2007). The 8 likely indicated that this was an 8-ounce baby bottle.
The remaining glass is less informative. Nineteen fragments of brown/amber
glass were recovered, but none bore marks and only one was not a body shard.

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

75

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

This single piece is a concave basal fragment. These pieces are tentatively
presumed to be beer or possibly medicine bottles given their color. Two pieces of
refitting light blue glass were recovered. The rim shard has a thin incised line
under the lip on the outside. This may be a piece of glassware or a dish. A
single unmarked dark green bottle body fragment was found, which based on
the color may be part of a wine bottle. Finally a single body shard of light green
glass was recovered in Trench 11, but it bore no markings. Overall the glass
fragments, then, appear to be an assemblage dominated by Illinois or OwensIllinois manufactured clear glass, typically preserve/pickle and medicine bottles,
with some possible beer and wine bottles, in other words an assemblage likely
typical of kitchen or bathroom refuse.
Based on the dating of diagnostic elements the assemblage is clearly situated
within a time frame from nineteen-teens through the 1930s or 1940s.
Trench 12- Lot 3
Only a small collection of artifacts was made in Trench 12 relative to Trench 11
to the north. These artifacts included a single pulled wire nail, nine pieces of
animal bone, a fragment of a clear glazed whiteware plate, the glazed semiporcelain ceramic head of a doll or figure, and a clear glass vial.
Trench 45- Lots 2/3/4/5
Trench 45 contained a mixture of debris representing both artifacts from the
tenant houses and the subsequent apartment complex that was built during the
1930s or 1940s. The excavation revealed a series of brick piers relating to the
earlier tenant houses. These were shallowly buried under only 1-15 centimeters
of soil. Architectural materials were recovered that appear to be related to the
later structures on the site. These include four porcelain insulators, two
fragments of a porcelain toilet, a steel pipe and copper coupling of a waterline,
and a single framing nail.
Other artifacts were principally personal in nature or associated with the
kitchen. A single fragment of decorative glassware appears to be part of a cake
plate or candy dish. Two ink bottles were recovered, one an igloo shape and the
other conical. This latter example had a mold number marked on it that reads
“G14”. A pen was also found, though this may be quite recent. Similar to other
trenches in Block 2 a sizable number of medical items were found including a
Vaseline jar and a Vicks bottle with the lid still attached. Interestingly an iodine
(or gentian violet) bottle marked with a B was recovered with a small dropper
still inside. This bottle is post-1906 minimally as it bears marks of an automatic
bottling machine. Two fragments of a clear graduated prescription bottle were
recovered with “BLUE RIBBON” marked on the base, “QUALITY” on the shoulder
and “PURITY” on the heel.
Kitchen related artifacts were most common, comprising primarily glass and
ceramic artifacts. Ceramic artifacts that were collected are limited to four pieces
of a green fiestaware bowl, one undecorated whiteware shard, two fragments of
unidentified hard paste ceramic and a piece of porcelain. Two soda bottles and
a beer bottle were recovered. The beer bottle is clear, but retains a Miller Beer
paper label, and the accompanying maker’s mark – a B in a circle – most likely
pertains to the latter years of the Brockway Glass Company (Lockhart 2000).
One of the soda bottles is light green with a red silk screen and an OwensIllinois maker’s mark as well as the word “Duraglass”. The Duraglass mark

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

76

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

identifies the bottle as being produced after the 1940’s (Lockhart 2004). The
other bottle is a green Sprite bottle base marked with “Shiloh Nat’l Military
Park.” Though the accompanying maker’s mark is a “C” inside a circle and
corresponds to a Chattanooga, Tennessee bottle manufacturing plant that
produced bottles as early as 1927. A series of commemorative Sprite bottles
featuring National Parks was produced from 1961 through the early 1970’s
(Museum of Beverage Containers and Advertising 2003). Two condiment bottles
were also collected. A pepper sauce bottle manufactured by Knoxx Glass Co. (J
inside a Keystone) has a date range of 1932-1953 based on the maker’s mark
(Myinsulators.com 2007), and a Catsup bottle base with ribbed sides is
manufactured using manganese bleaching, suggesting it was manufactured
before World War I. In addition to these items, a fragment of clear tumbler and
two other clear bottles with no discernible markings were also collected.
A single piece of cut animal bone and a piece of shell were also collected.
Trench 14- Lot 6, the Spillman household
Trench 14 was located in Lot 6 of Block 14 on property owned by the Spillman
family from before 1910 to 1945. Excavation of the trench encountered six
concrete architectural piers presumably associated with residential structures
on the lot and a large trash pit (Feature 16) (See Test Units 7/19 below). From
Trench 14 a limited number of artifacts were collected. These included a small
number of architectural items including a pulled wire nail, a silver plated brass
door knob, two pieces of fence hinges, and a brick. Six pieces of bone were
recovered a 6 oz Dr. Pepper bottle, and 12 pieces of glass, three of which look
burned. An Adams Extract bottle with lid still attached was also collected. Two
plates of porcelain, one with a green underglaze and an unreadable maker’s
mark was found along with four pieces of plain whiteware. A single basal corner
of rectangular blake variant bottle was found that may be a medicine bottle.
The handle of a power tool was found, but it is not clear if this has any
relationship to the early twentieth century occupation. Finally, a 1961 penny
was found.
Trench 13- Lot 9
Ninety-six artifacts were collected during the excavation of Trench 13 that
indicated a deposit of mixed demolition debris and residential refuse generally
dating from the mid-1930’s at the earliest but also containing many clearly later
artifacts. Among the artifacts were architectural debris including pulled wire
nails (n=3), window glass (n=2), shingles (n=1), and brick (n=2) likely associated
with demolition. Kitchen related materials constituted the bulk of the recovered
artifacts with 55 specimens. The majority of these are clear glass (n=41) plus
four pieces of brown glass. Temporally diagnostic glass artifacts include a
complete clear external threaded extract bottle with an Owen’s Illinois maker’s
mark that places the period of manufacture after 1940. Another clear shard has
the word “Duraglass”, another Owen’s Illinois trademark used between 1940­
1954. The other temporally diagnostic shard is a fragment of a brown/amber
liquor bottle which partially retains the federally required embossing “FEDERAL
LAW FORBIDS SALE OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE”, present on bottles produced
from 1935 until at least 1964 (Society for Historical Archaeology 2007a) No
artifacts possessed characteristics indicating any dates earlier than the mid­
1930’s. Additionally two porcelain and two plain whiteware fragments were
collected. These appear to be fragments of plates. One of the porcelain sherds
has a transfer decoration with red flowers, blue vines, and gold outlines, and the

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

other has blue decoration. Other kitchen related materials included a likely
modern plastic candy wrapper, three pieces of plastic containers, and two pieces
of a Bakelite cooking utensil. Dietary materials included two pieces of cut
animal bone and two pieces of shell.
Other artifacts were from more general household functional contexts such as
personal, grooming, education, recreation, tools and transportation. Personal
items consisted of two synthetic beads that may have been from pieces of
jewelry. Clothing artifacts were limited to three shell buttons, a plastic snap and
a plastic hanger. These latter two clothing artifacts appeared modern as did a
plastic pen with “Sweet Grass Steak…” visible on the side (education) and the
plastic comb (grooming). Tools and transportation, a plastic and metal cap of
unknown function and a radiator cap respectively, were very likely modern. The
recreation items were interesting but probably quite recent, consisting of mainly
children’s items such as a glass marble, swing set chains, plastic doll parts, and
a whistle, but also including three fragments of a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye
camera. The camera was manufactured between 1949 and 1961.
Trenches in Block 3, Powars Southside Addition (41HR1011)
Block 3 of the Powars Southside Addition was developed around 1900. It
consisted of 10 lots bounded by Ruthven, Genesee, Cleveland and Mason
Streets. The eastern half was largely undeveloped until after 1910. One family,
the Grady family appears to have owned Lot 4 and a built a shotgun home on it
by 1907. It was replaced in the 1920s by a larger square plan home. A second
family, the Robinson family purchased Lots 5 and 6 and built residences on
these lots as early as 1911, according to tax records (Wagner 2005). Both
families continued to live on these properties through the 1950s. The east half
of Block 3 was developed by 1924, primarily with shotgun tenant housing. The
1924-1950 Sanborn Fire insurance map shows that Lots 8 and 9 were still
vacant. Gradall trench excavations on this block, like Block 2, targeted
primarily residences from the early twentieth century—namely those associated
with the Robinson and Brady households. This block was considered to have
low probability for burials.
Gradall trench excavations in Block 3 identified a relatively light scatter of
primarily post 1920’s material culture. Collected and analyzed artifacts were
overwhelmingly of the architecture and kitchen functional categories.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts clearly post date the mid 1920’s and much of the
material though not easily pinned down in time appears to be of more recent
vintage than that.
Trench 20- Lots 4/5
Artifacts from Trench 20 included architectural items consisting of a sewer pipe
fragment marked “San Antonio, Texas” – likely its manufacturing locale, an
ACME brick possibly made in Fort Worth (it has “FORT” marked on it) and a
porcelain electrical insulator. Kitchen remains included a spoon, glass and
ceramic. Two pieces of porcelain and a single sherd of plain whiteware, both of
indeterminate vessels and lacking maker’s marks, were the only ceramics
collected. Two green bottle fragments were recovered, one with a “C” in a circle
dating it to the post-1927 period, and four clear glass bottles including an RC
Cola bottle, a 10 oz. Coca Cola Bottle, and a large bottle fragment of Gallo wine.
The Coca Cola bottle is labeled “no deposit, no return” placing its manufacture
no earlier than the mid-1930’s. Other artifacts of a similar nature included a

pop top Fanta Red Soda can and a brown glass bottle with its aluminum lid still
intact. A piece of a milk glass container was recovered that is likely from a cold
crème jar. A Gerber baby food lid was recovered with holes punched in it,
suggesting that perhaps a child used it to hold bugs. The arm of a porcelain doll
was also recovered that also bespeaks of children. A single poker chip, made by
Astor, indicates games possibly played by older folks. Finally, several
miscellaneous artifacts including an indeterminate wire and metal piece, a
double-A battery and wrench.
Trench 21- Lots 4/5
Trench 21 contained a nail and a plastic wire cover. One whole bottle and seven
fragments of clear glass and three fragments of green glass were also recovered.
The complete clear glass bottle was a whole Lea & Perrins Worstershire sauce
bottle made in an automatic bottle machine, but lacking more specific
manufacturing data. Of the remaining fragments, only one bore a maker’s mark
bearing a B, indicating it was produced by the Brockway Glass company
between 1933 and 1988. A piece of metal wire and an unidentifiable piece of
metal rounded out the collected artifacts.
Trench 22- Lot 6
Artifacts collected from Trench 22 included a small collection of clear glass
(n=15) and an intact milk glass Ball canning lid that reads “GENUINE ZINC CAP
FOR BALL”, all of which appear to pertain to kitchen type associations. An
intact green Star Bottling Company bottle was recovered. Star Bottling was a
local Houston, Texas company that was in business from the late 1879 through
the early twentieth century (Carlson 2002). This bottle dates to the latter period.
In addition, a piece of porcelain and a piece of shell – likely oyster – were also
recovered.
Trench 23- Lot 8/9
The only artifact collected from Trench 23 was a horseshoe.
Trenches in Block 4, Powars Southside Addition (41HR1012)
Occupation of Block 4 may have occurred as early as the 1860s when Fred
Stanley purchased five acres from Will Powars. He likely built his residence
near the southern edge of the block and lived there briefly before selling back to
Will Powars. More intensive development of Block 4 of the Powars Southside
Addition occurred around 1900, when it was formally subdivided. It was
bounded by Cleveland, a narrow alley forming Genesee, Gray, and Mason
Streets. Larger than the other blocks in the Powars Addition, it consisted of 13
lots arranged in an unconventional fashion. Lots 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 faced
Cleveland Street. Lots 7-10 faced Mason, and Lots 3, 11, 12, and 13 faced
Genesee. A small alley, known as Victor Alley ran from Genesee to Mason along
the north edges of Lots 3 and 7. Lots facing Cleveland and Genesee Street
appear to have developed first, with a mix of owner occupants and tenants.
While most of the residents were black, the Italian Verdino family did own and
live on Lot 1 at the corner of Cleveland and Genesee, where they operated a
grocery from around 1916. They built rental houses on the back of their
property that they leased to black tenants. Other early property owners
included the Richardson family, who owned Lot 4 and the Smith family, who

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

79

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

owned Lots 12 and 13. These families were living on this block by 1910.
Around 1931 the Pleasant Green Baptist Church was built on Lot 8 where it
continued to operate into the 1950s. A large commercial building, now known
as the Settegast building, was built in the 1930s and covers portions of Lots 10
and 11.
Gradall trenching on Block 4 targeted primarily the Richardson and Smith
households, and the Church on Lot 8. Trenching operations in Block 4
involving three trenches (33, 34, 53) uncovered deposits typical of demolished
residential structures across the project area and two features (Features 37 and
38). Artifact recovery heavily favored kitchen and medical type items and pieces
architectural debris. Though more recent artifacts were found mixed with older
materials in most site contexts, the best-preserved deposits were identified in
trenches 33 and 53 where dense deposits of artifacts primarily from the 1920’s
and 30’s were identified. Test Units 8, 9, 10 and 11 were placed in Trench 33 in
an effort to evaluate the integrity of the site components and acquire a controlled
sample. No artifacts were collected from Trench 34 on lots 7 and 8 where a
previously unidentified and active waterline was accidentally hit during the
trenching, resulting in the abandonment of the trench.
Trench 33 – Lots 4/5
The materials collected from Trench 33 reflect the types of artifacts associated
with a residential occupation of Block 4, particularly the Richardson house. The
artifacts are primarily datable to periods of manufacture in the 1930’s or later,
though earlier artifacts were found. Trench 33 was oriented east-west and
crossed both Lots 4 and 5. Remnants of the once standing architecture were
represented by two porcelain electrical insulators, a ceramic tile fragment, a
piece of linoleum, and piece of pvc pipe of unknown function.
Much more typical of the collected artifacts was a variety of glass, ceramic, bone,
metal and synthetic artifacts associated with containers, dishes, utensils and
remains of eating. Ceramics were not heavily represented in the trench
collections, with only three pieces collected that included two white ware pieces
– one of which is a plate fragment – and a stoneware basal fragment with a white
interior and a black exterior glaze. Glass was very common, though only a few of
the more diagnostic pieces were reserved during trenching. These included 15
shards of clear glass, two manganese bleached purpled fragments, and two
green fragments. Two of the clear specimens were liquor bottles with exterior
threaded closures made in an automatic bottling machine. Both bore “HALF
PINT FEDERAL LAW FORBIDS SALE OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE”, which can
be used to date the bottles to the period between 1935-1964. On the base of one
was a maker’s mark of a “T” inside a circle. Other temporally diagnostic clear
bottle fragments included a circular base with an Owen-Illinois maker’s mark
with a “3” to the right that suggests that the bottle was likely manufactured in
1933 or possibly as late as 1943. Another circular base fragment has a Hazel
Atlas maker’s mark (A inside an H), which can date the bottle to the period
1920-1964 (Myinsulators.com 2007).
The remaining clear glass artifacts
consisted of unidentifiable body shards (n=6) and the necks of five similar
bottles with exterior threaded closures-- one of which still retains its metal cap-that lack any product or manufacturing details. The two green bottles likely date
to a similar period as the previously discussed clear fragments. One specimen is
a neck fragment with an exterior threaded closure (ABM) and the other is the
base of an Ernest and Julio Gallo Wine bottle produced in Modesto California.
This last artifact also reads “Refilling Prohibited”, which likely minimally dates it

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

80

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

to the mid 1930’s. Of note is a basal fragment of a canning jar that may be older
than the previously discussed material (Figure 6-14). The incomplete base
reads “K….CO SAND SPRINGS OKLA, AUG 31 PATENT 1915”. Based on the
patent date of 1915 and the manganese bleaching of the glass, it can be
surmised that this jar was manufactured in a short window of time between
1915 and about 1918. The manufacturer is likely to be the Kerr Glass
Manufacturing Company, as they had a plant in Sand Springs, Oklahoma at
this time (Myinsulators.com 2007). Though it is unknown what may have been
contained in the bottles, the artifact suggests the possible presence of earlier
contexts in Trench 33. An interesting glass plate made of milk glass was also
recovered, the rim of which exhibited burning. Other kitchen related artifacts
included a fork and spoon and a plastic bottle cap. Finally four cut animal bones
were collected.

Other artifacts related to grooming, medical and clothing included a bone
toothbrush handle, a small, clear, graduated rounded prescription bottle and a
boot heel. The bone toothbrush handle has 6 double rows for bristles and is
marked “1005 Scientific” and “PURE BRIS…STERILIZED MADE IN NAR…”. Two
glass marbles were also found here and two pieces of a Playdough lid – no doubt
a more recent addition to the archeological deposits of the site.
Other artifacts recovered included a metal bolt and metal sheet and a
functionally indeterminate object of metal, wood and vinyl or plastic.

Trench 53- Lot 2/3/13
Trench 53 was a long trench oriented north-south and crosscutting Lots 2, 3,
and 13. The trench was placed behind several early twentieth century houses
that once faced Genesee Street. Artifacts recovered from this trench represented
but a small portion of what appeared to be a laterally extensive scatter of
materials that date from the early twentieth century into the last few decades. In
general the artifacts reflect the residential character of the occupations,
consisting of a large quantity of architectural, kitchen, personal, grooming and
medical type items.
Collected architectural remains included three bricks, roof and floor tile, lumber,
and a piece of plate glass. Household/furniture items included a purpled
decorative glass container – perhaps a candy bowl or vase – and an aluminum
and iron oscillating fan. The fan, though old, appears to post-date the 1950’s.
A couple of artifacts – a milk glass cosmetic container and a bottle of Hind’s
Honey Almond Cream - were associated with the grooming habits of the
residents (see Figure 6-14). This latter artifact is clear and nearly complete,
manufactured in an automatic bottle machine and rectangular in shape with an
external threaded finish. The front panel is recessed and embossed to read
“HINDS HONEY AND ALMOND CREAM A.S. HINDS Co. PORTLAND MAINE
U.S.A”, and the maker’s mark on the base reads “A.S. HINDS CO 1121 0”. This
product was produced from the 1890’s until the late 1940’s. Owing to the ABM
manufacturing style and the clarity of the glass, this specimen likely dates to the
1920’s or later (Fike 1987: 92). In addition several other medically related bottles
were collected including a complete, clear ABM graduated prescription bottle
manufactured by Owen-Illinois with a 1939 production date, a cobalt blue Vick’s
Mentholatum jar, a clear Vaseline jar fragment, and a brown/amber triangle
ABM bottle with a patent finish and “POISON” embossed on 2 sides.
A single glass bead was found that appears to be a decorative item.
As was typical of most contexts, items functionally related to the kitchen
dominated the recovered artifacts. Glass artifacts included nine clear glass
specimens, two aqua, one purpled, one green, and one brown/amber. Two of
the bottles were liquor bottles. One liquor bottle is only a clear base of a flask
base marked with a W with a crown over it, and the other is a brown ½ pint
JoJo flask with an external threaded finish and elaborate embossing. This last
bottle has “FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS SALE OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE” on
the shoulder, with an “N” in a square on the base that identifies the maker as
Obear-Nestor Glass Co. (Lockhart 2000). Because Obear-Nestor manufactured
bottles with this mark as early as 1915 and it continues in use today, the closest
the temporal placement the bottle can be assigned is the period from
approximately 1935-1964 when federal law mandated the use of the above
phrase. An aqua colored and heavily weathered ABM brandy finish bottle neck
may also be from a liquor bottle. Two pickle or preserve jars were collected. One
is a complete clear ABM Colombia preserve pickle jar (probably for holding
olives) with an Illinois Pacific Glass (IPG) maker’s mark in a triangle that
situates the date of manufacture to the period between 1925-1930 (Lockhart
2000). The other is a round mouthed external thread ABM jar with a hexagonal
body cross section. The maker’s mark is “C with a tail on the bottom” in a
diamond, a current unknown maker’s mark. Other collected bottles include a
small, clear external thread finish bottle with “5” on the base, a neck with of a
clear double bead finish bottle, three small shards of clear glass (one is an

external thread finish fragment), and a green crown cap soda/beer bottle.
Finally a single piece of manganese bleach glass was found, the technology of
which situates the artifact as pre-World War I in date. This artifact is from the
base of round-bottomed bottle, with the word “TRADE M” embossed near the
base and an unknown maker’s mark.
In addition to glass, 17 ceramic sherds were also collected during the trenching
that pertain to dishware associated with the kitchen. These included seven
pieces of whiteware, five pieces of porcelain, three pieces of yellowware, a
fragment of stoneware and one piece of an unidentified type. Five of the
whitewares are undecorated and consist of three plate pieces and a cup and one
unidentified. Two additional pieces have a blue decal printed floral pattern with
thin blue lines on the inner lip. All but one of the porcelain fragments were
decorated. These included a cup with a gold appliqué band under the cup rim,
a piece of a scalloped plate with a green, red, and brown painted design near the
rim, an edge molded piece hand-painted in red, and finally a fragment with a
maker’s mark that is incomplete with and reads “HAND R AI” with a leaf design
(Figure 6-15). The three yellowwares included one very small sherd and two
fragments with a blue slip with deeper blue speckling. The only stoneware was
a single handle of a salt glazed piece of crockery. Other kitchen related
materials included a metal skillet, a range top cover, and a plastic fork. Dietary
materials consisted of two pieces of shell and 21 pieces of bone.

Aside from an unknown chunk of metal, a chain, and a sanding disk, some
additional materials of interest that were recovered. These included more recent
recreation items – a pair of Mr. Potatohead feet, a metal wheel possibly from a
pair of skates, and the spring or hitch component of a wagon and a horseshoe.

Trenches on Block 5, Powars Southside Addition (41HR1013)
Block 5 of the Powars Southside Addition was developed around 1900. It
consisted of just five small lots bounded by Cleveland Street, Mason Street, Gray
Street and Taft Alley. This block was one of the earliest of the Powars Addition
to be developed, with houses and residences appearing right around 1900.
Unlike most of the larger blocks in the Powars Addition, Block 5 was entirely
black owner-occupied until 1927. The Starks/White family owned Lots 4 and 5
at the corner of Gray and Mason Streets, the Young/Williams family owned Lot
3, the Burkes/Jones family owned Lot 2 and the Turner family owned Lot 1.
Lots 2-5 remained owner-occupied well into the 1950s (Wagner 2005), and the
Starks house on Lot 4 was still standing in 2002. Isaac Turner sold Lot 1 to an
absentee landlord, Charles Butera in 1927. Sometime during the 1950s, the
second Starks house on Lot 5 was demolished and an apartment complex was
built over the lot.
Gradall trenches on this block targeted mainly the Starks/White and
Young/Williams households on Lots 3-5, and produced ample remains from the
1900-1950s period. A single trench placed across Lots 1 and 2 found no intact
surfaces or features pertaining to the residences there. Though this area was
originally considered low probability for burials, due to its early settlement date,
a concrete headstone fragment and a piece of a marble church plaque found in
the upper portions of a trench on Lot 5 resulted in intensive, deep trenching on
this block to explore for possible graves. No burials were found. Intact
foundation piers were recorded in Trenches 27, 28 and 29. Artifact collection
from trenches was primarily architectural and kitchen related items, particularly
glass artifacts, similar to those recovered from other intact occupation surfaces
across the site. Temporally diagnostic artifacts were limited but those collected
suggest a mix of early twentieth century material and items of more recent
manufacture. Of particular interest in these trenches was the recovery of several
concrete slabs, a fragment of an apparent tombstone, and a marble plaque
possibly related to a church located on the adjacent Block 6 between 1905 and
1925. The exact function of the concrete slabs is uncertain, though most
appear to be footing piers for cinderblocks. With the exception of one example all
are rectangular and solid, and six bear traces on the surface of mortar in the
form of cinderblock prints (Figure 6-16). The exception is one that is slightly
different sized, more ornate in the sense that the edges are beveled and it also
has a central perforation. This last example found in Trench 28 may be a base
for mounting a plaque or headstone, but this remains conjecture.
Trench 47- Lots 1/2
Trench 47 was oriented east-west and was located on the northern end of Block
5, cross cutting Lots 1 and 2. Trench 47 yielded an assemblage of artifacts that
pertain to principally the period between World War I and World War II. The 15
collected artifacts were primarily items functionally related to kitchen contexts
(n=8). These kitchen artifacts included two pieces of ceramic: a transfer print
decorated sherd of a whiteware plate and portion of a green fiestaware bowl.
Fiestaware was manufactured in 1936 and continued through the late 1960’s
and thus this could be no earlier. The collected glass containers associated with
the kitchen include two standard soda bottles and four other fragments. One
selenium-bleached fragment is a rectangular shaped bottle base with a “J” in a
keystone. This mark is from the Knox Glass Co. and was utilized between 1932
and 1953, though since the use of selenium as a bleaching agent was
discontinued during World War II it is likely from the 1930’s or early 1940’s.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

The remaining two glass artifacts include a complete lime green soda bottle with
an Anchor Hocking maker’s mark placing the period of production between
1937-1977 and a green rectangular shaped body shard with no diagnostic
attributes.
Figure 6-16

Cement Blocks

Other artifacts recovered include three pieces of animal bone, a milk glass
cosmetic container with a ribbed exterior, a plastic ring of unknown function
and a battery core.
Trench 27- Lots 3/4/5
Trench 27 was a long north-south oriented trench that crossed Lots 3, 4 and 5.
Though a series of features were identified in Trench 27 that pertain to early
twentieth century residential occupation in Block 5, the only artifacts collected
during the trenching operation were two large rectangular concrete slabs of
roughly 50 x 30 x 9 centimeters in size, buried under 40 centimeters of
sediment. One has beveled edges.
Trench 28- Lot 5
The excavation of Trench 28, an east west oriented trench in Lot 5, uncovered
both residential occupation debris as well as two rectangular concrete slabs, an
engraved marble plaque and a fragment of a concrete tombstone (see Figure 68). The tombstone fragment is perhaps the most significant find in this trench.
On the surface of the concrete slab between incised guidelines are the words in
semi script “Died,” and below “29.” In addition to the concrete headstone
fragment, a corner portion of a marble church plaque was also recovered (see
Figure 6-9). While there is no record of a church having been located on this
property, historical research does indicate the Second Pleasant Green Baptist
Church was located on the adjacent Lot 5 of Block 6. Recovered in the same

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

trench were two rectangular concrete slabs. One is nearly identical one found in
Trench 27, with similar angled corners and dimensional measures of 50 x 30 x 9
centimeters. The other is distinct. With dimensions of 72 x 24.5 x 10
centimeters this specimen is longer and slightly narrower and thicker than other
examples. Furthermore it has narrow rectangular opening in the middle that
appears to be intentionally molded, not cut out from the solid block. Both the
outer edges and the interior edges of the opening are beveled. While these were
initially thought to be headstone bases given their association in the same
trench with the headstone and the church plaque, later examples found in other
trenches contained clear concrete block impressions. In addition, their context,
laying flat 40 centimeters below the ground surface and dug into the Beaumont
clay indicated that they were more likely footing piers for the later apartment
building on Lot 5.
In addition to these artifacts, a small number of other materials were collected
that likely pertain to the early twentieth century occupations of the block. These
included a cut nail, a piece of window glass, and a terra cotta floor tile, all
architectural remains. Kitchen items included six sherds of plain whiteware, a
fragment of a salt glazed stoneware crockery container, and a brandy finished
brown/amber glass bottle neck (Figure 6-17). Possible dietary remains
consisted of a single piece of shell. A clear glass perfume bottle stopper (Figure
6-17) was also recovered, as was a portion of a harmonica.
Trench 30- Lot 5
The only artifacts collected from Trench 30 were four rectangular concrete slabs
very much like those collected from Trenches 27 and 28. All examples have a
cinderblock "footprint" of concrete mortar. Evidence of a cinderblock footprint
on each side of one example suggests possible reuse.
Trench 31- Lot 5
Trench 31 was another east-west trench located on the northern edge of Lot 5.
The artifact assemblage collected bespeaks primarily a residential occupation
with significant mixing of temporal components, likely a result of subsurface
disturbance related to utility line placement and demolition. Temporally
diagnostic artifacts suggesting a broad range of time represents the turn of the
twentieth century through the post 1940’s period.
Three more of the rectangular concrete slabs were encountered in this trench,
two of which bore mortar traces in the form of cinderblocks.

(Bag 11-4); E) Extract bottle (Bag 31-3); F) Brown bottle frag. (Bag 11-5); G) Decal decorated porcelain
(Bag 32-3); H) Stoneware (Bag 11-3).

In addition to the concrete blocks, other architectural artifacts included three
fragments of window glass. Household/Furniture items included a terra cotta
flower pot fragment and two pieces of lamp glass, one of which is molded and
frosted. They appear to be light bulb fragments. Also present in low numbers
was a single education/communication artifact – a slate fragment, two pieces of
unknown synthetic material without clear functional applications, and what
appears to be a lid to part of a tool constructed of a composite of glass and
metal, but of unknown purpose. A piece of glass tubing was also found which
may have been a part of a urinal, a baby bottle or had some medicinal use.
Items functionally related to the kitchen were the most numerous but limited to
glass and ceramic artifacts. Two of the glass shards are dark green and likely
pertained to a wine bottle, and two were brown/amber, perhaps fragments of a
beer bottle. Eight shards are clear glass without any discoloration suggesting
arsenic or possibly selenium bleaching. Five of these lacked any diagnostic
features to determine manufacture or function, but two were glass jars. One is
a body shard of a round canning jar with Ball embossed on the side and the
other is a round jar with a “I” in a circle, a mark that identifies the manufacturer
as Owens-Illinois, but this maker’s mark does not begin appearing on bottles
until 1954 (Myinsulators.com 2007). The “Ball” mark is not useful for dating as
it appears on bottles produced by the company throughout its production period
from the late 1880’s until 1988 (Myinsulators.com 2007). Two shards of
manganese bleached glass without makers’ marks were recovered. Based on the
technology these probably date to the period from the late nineteenth century
until World War I. Ceramics included two pieces of porcelain: one a transfer
decorated cup and the other a thick fragment of a possible storage vessel. The
last glass artifact is the base of a thick aqua colored soda bottle in the “torpedo”
shape (Figure 6-17a). Since only the base was recovered, it can only be
generally dated to the period between 1870-1910 when these types of bottles

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

were commonly being manufactured in the United States (Society for Historical
Archeology 2007b). Four pieces of a hard paste ceramic of an unknown type
were also present. These consisted of a plate base fragment, two body sherds,
and a scalloped rim with transfer print that had been burned.
Finally, dietary items consisted of 11 pieces of animal bone and one piece of
shell.
Trench 29-Lot 4
The excavation of Trench 29, principally in Lot 4, resulted in the collection of a
small number of kitchen, clothing and architectural items. Architectural
remains were limited to a single brick fragment with residual mortar, no doubt a
remnant of a demolished building. Three buttons were also collected, each of a
different material: metal, shell, and plastic. Kitchen related materials included
ceramic, glass and a plastic wrapper of recent origin. The two collected pieces of
ceramic consist of a non-diagnostic fragment of whiteware and a whiteware plate
fragment with transfer print decoration. Eleven glass fragments were recovered,
eight of which were shards of clear glass from unidentifiable bottle or vessel
types. Two pieces were from brown/amber bottles. The final glass artifact
collected was an ABM extract bottle with a packer finish manufactured by
Illinois Glass between 1916 and 1929 based on the maker’s mark of an “I”
within a diamond. Because the artifact is clear and lacks discoloration typical of
manganese bleached glass, this bottle likely dates to the period between World
War I and the termination of this particular maker’s mark in 1929. On the front
panel this circular bottle is embossed with the product information: “DR
PRICE’S DELICIOUS FLAVORING EXTRACT”. This single temporally diagnostic
artifact likely dates the deposits to around the 1920’s period.
Trenches on Block 6, Powars Southside Addition (41HR1014)
The history of Block 6 is in some ways representative of the development
trajectory for the larger 4th Ward. Block 6 of the Powars South Side Addition
was platted around 1900 as a partial block containing just five lots facing Taft
Alley or Taft Street. Owner occupants made up the earliest residents on Lots 2
and 3, purchasing land from Will Powars Jr. and building homes before 1910.
Tenants occupied Lots 1 and 4 after 1910. An important structure on this block
was the Pleasant Green Baptist Church, which was built sometime between
1900 and 1910 on Lot 5 at the corner of Taft and Gray Streets. This church
anchored the neighborhood and likely contributed to its growth. However, in
1925 a legal dispute occurred that involved not only the ownership of the 2.5­
acre corner of the Houston Ranch tract overlapping with the Powars Southside
Addition, but also the western limits of the Powars Southside Addition below
this tract. When Powars Sr. surveyed the land that would become the Southside
Addition, he apparently drew the western boundary 18 feet too far to the west,
encroaching on the adjoining parcel (then Lot 40 of the Obedience Smith
Survey). The 1926 lawsuit was resolved in favor the plaintiffs, and the owners
and tenants of Block 6, including the church were forced to move. Their houses
were demolished shortly after that and apartment buildings and a gas station
were built on Block 6 (Wagner 2005).
Three trenches (32, 35, 50) were excavated in Block 6 of the Gregory Lincoln
project area. The trenches targeted mainly graves on Lot 5, since the church was
known to have built on this lot in the early years of the twentieth century. A
portion of a headstone and a fragment of a church plaque found on the

adjoining Block 5 (Lot 5) further bolstered the claim that graves could be present
in this area. However, extensive post 1930s disturbance was known to have
occurred on this lot. A gas station was built here in the 1930s, and prior to
investigations, several underground petroleum storage tanks along with
surrounding soils were removed for remediation. Trenches 32 and 35 yielded no
significant artifacts. In Trench 50 a small collection of artifacts primarily related
to architectural elements were collected. These included three fragments of
sewer pipe, a soft paste carpet brick and a relatively modern paint can lid. In
addition a metal stove lid lifter was collected as well as a heavy metal cap of
unknown function. The artifact recovery from Block 6 lacks strong temporal
indicators and suggests little in the way of intact deposits related to any early
twentieth century occupations.
Trenches in Block 34, Boercher’s Extension of Castania (41HR1015)
Block 34 contained the earliest African American residential development in the
project area. Will Powars Sr. first attempted to subdivide and sell lots from this
block in 1866. Thinking he owned land north of what is now Andrews Street, he
sold three lots (Lots 8-10) to Gus Tilghman, a former slave, and his family. The
Tilghman family was living there by 1880, according to census records. At that
time none of the other parts of the project area were occupied. However, as with
so many of Powars’ attempts at subdivision and land sales, he misunderstood
the limits of his property, and the lots he sold to the Tilghman family were
actually not owned by him, but by John Boercher, who owned ten acres between
Andrews and Dallas Street. In 1894, following a lawsuit, the area was replatted
as Block 34 of Boercher’s Extension of Castania. Surprisingly, the Tilghman
family retained a hold on their three lots, occupying them until around 1900.
Block 34 consisted of ten lots, and was bounded by Robin, Genesee, Andrews
and Mason Streets. Aside from the Tilghman family, the earliest resident
appears to be Guiseppe Danna, an Italian immigrant who purchased Lots 6 and
7 in 1897 and built a grocery store on the corner of Andrews and Mason. He
lived on that property until the 1920s, when title passed to his daughter, Louise
Scardino. Development along the north half of Block 34 occurred before 1910
and consisted entirely of tenant-occupied shotgun houses. The Union
Tabernacle Church, likely associated with the Union Hospital across Genesee
Street, was located on Lot 9 from 1920 to 1924. During 1960s, all of the houses
and buildings on this block were demolished and the Gregory Lincoln
Elementary School track was built.
Located in the Gregory Lincoln School track, and near the Union Hospital, this
area was considered to have some potential for burials. Gradall trenching on
Block 34 focused primarily on the search for graves, and household remains
associated with the Tilghman family.
Trenches thus targeted Lots 8-10
specifically looking for Tilghman remains, and other lots in the search for
graves. Trenches on this block tended to be 1.5 meters to more than two meters
deeps. Six trenches were excavated in Block 34, and collections of artifacts were
made from Trenches 1, 26, 48, and 25. No collections were made from Trenches
23 and 24. The trenches, particularly Trench 1, produced a significant number
of artifacts related to the residential occupations of the project area, but
suggested a mixing of later material, likely as a result of episodes of demolition,
reconstruction and school use that occurred on the site. This block is currently
the location of the Gregory Lincoln School track.
The most commonly
represented functional categories were kitchen and architectural, though
clothing, dietary, grooming, education, personal, recreation, tools and

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

89

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

miscellaneous categories are all represented. Overall, the artifact recovery from
Block 6 lacked strong temporal indicators and suggests that the residual
deposits associated with the residential occupation of the block are no earlier
than the World War I period.
Trench 1- Lot 5
The largest collection of artifacts on Block 34 was made from Trench 1, which is
an east-west oriented trench located in Lot 5 in the general area behind two
domestic houses. The structures were apparently present on early twentieth
century Sanborn maps. The artifacts do not provide good chronological
indicators, suggesting only a twentieth century occupation, likely post dating
World War I.
Twenty-one architecture or household related artifacts were collected that are
likely related of these early structures. These artifacts are principally pulled wire
nails (n=12) and a single cut nail. Four additional pulled wire duplex nails for
framing may be related to the construction of these or later structures. In
addition to nails a soft paste terra cotta floor tile and a paving brick were
recovered. The paving brick is marked with “COFV’L VIT B & T”, a mark that
identifies the brick as a paver produced by the Coffeyville Vitrified Brick and Tile
Company in Coffeyville, Kansas (Connelley 1918). The company produced bricks
by the late nineteenth century and continues in business today. Another object,
what appears to be a porcelain light bulb base with an external threaded end
and an orange plastic lens held in place with a metal plate embossed with
“BUSS”, is probably a form of circuit breaker. The only other household related
item is a mousetrap spring.
Items of a more personal nature included two glass marbles for recreation, and a
rusted watch part. Clothing articles included a cloth covered metal button and a
metal belt buckle. A milk glass cold cream container was the only item
functionally related to grooming recovered. A fragment of a clear Vaseline jar
and a clear vial of unknown use were recovered and classified as medically
related items.
Aside from a washer, two miscellaneous pieces of metal and a piece of melted
plastic, the remaining artifacts were all dietary or related to kitchen activities.
Kitchen related items made up a total of eight collected artifacts. Among these
were three refitting pieces of a salt glazed stoneware container, a molded
whiteware plate rim, and a small porcelain condiment bowl with an overglaze red
transfer print in an oriental design. Three glass artifacts included a clear neck
fragment of an ABM manufactured bottle with a brandy finish, a clear fragment
of a Ball canning jar, and a rose/orange colored fragment of an unidentified
glass container. Other kitchen related artifacts included a sardine can opener
and a portion of a broken steel spoon. In general these artifacts are only slightly
useful for dating and suggest a minimally post-World War I period of occupation.
Finally one piece of animal bone was the only dietary related artifact.

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

Trench 25- Lots 3/8
Trench 25 was oriented east-west and was excavated in the northwestern corner
of Lot 8 of Block 34, adjacent to what may have been a garage associated with a
house on the southern half of the lot. The only artifact collected during the
excavation of this trench was a single fragment of a porcelain serving vessel with
transfer decoration.
Trench 26- Lots 4/5
Trench 26 was a large trench excavated immediately to the north of Trench 1 on
Lot 5 and extending into the western half of Lot 4. Only two glass artifacts were
collected. The first was a body shard of a milk glass jar, likely a cosmetic jar.
The second is a likely clear beverage bottle with reinforced bead finish.
Trench 48- Lot 5
Twelve items were collected from Trench 48 that indicate activities related to
architecture, education, dietary, kitchen, miscellaneous, recreation and tool
functional categories. The only two artifacts related to architecture collected
from the trench were a pulled wire nail and a fragment of window glass. Most
likely these pertain to the now razed houses. A mechanical pencil bearing the
inscription “Diamond Medal Diplomat Pencil”, likely produced by the German
maker Diplomat, was recovered, though this appears to be a relatively recent
artifact, probably something an elementary school student dropped. A metal
band was collected and categorized as Miscellaneous in terms of function. A
machine bolt was the only tool. A single glass marble was also recovered. The
five artifacts functionally related to the kitchen included two aluminum screw
caps, an unmarked base of a clear glass bottle, and one sherd each of semi
porcelain and whiteware both of which are undecorated and unclassifiable in
terms of vessel form.
Trenches on Block 35, Boercher’s Extension of Castania (41HR1016)
Block 35 of Boercher’s Extension of Castania was first subdivided in 1894 as a
block of 10 lots, however four of those lots (Lots 4-8) conflicted with the 2.5-acre
corner of the old Houston Ranch Tract. City directories and tax records suggest
that tenant houses were on Lots 4 and 8 prior to 1920; and it must be assumed
that the minimal development that occurred there in the early twentieth century
was razed around the time the decision was rendered in the 1925 lawsuit
resolving the legal ownership issues over those conflicting parcels. Lots 2, 3 and
the east half of Lot 8 were developed by 1907, according to the Sanborn map for
that year. The remaining lots held houses by 1920, and all but one was a black
tenant-occupied shotgun house. Martino Billieri owned Lot 1, where he built a
grocery and home (Wagner 2005). During 1960s, all of the houses and buildings
on this block were demolished and the Gregory Lincoln Elementary School track
was built. Only one trench was excavated on this lot and this trench was
intended to look for remains associated with the Billieri grocery on Lot 1, and
possible graves.
Trench 5 was excavated in Lot 1 of Block 35 within an area circumscribed at the
time by the Lincoln-Gregory School Track. Artifact collection was very limited
and demonstrates a mix of artifacts of architectural, kitchen and miscellaneous
functional categories that are in most cases post 1940’s. All but one of the
artifacts are related to Feature 4, a small metal lined pit filled with glass. Of the

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

91

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

glass recovered, the most diagnostic is a fragment of a 1950’s 6 ounce Coke
bottle. In addition the base of a brown bottle marked with “5 quart” and “19”,
perhaps a large beer bottle, was collected. Other artifacts collected from Feature
4 included a pulled wire nail, a metal handle of unknown function and a modern
plastic zip tie. Another clear bottle that was solarized was collected outside of
Feature 4.
Trenches on Block 38, Boercher’s Extension of Castania (41HR1017)
Block 38 of Boercher’s Extension of Castania was platted in 1894 as a small
block containing just two and a half lots. Located south of Andrews street, and
otherwise bounded by Mason Street, Block 1 of the Powars Addition, and Alden
Place, Block 38 physically resides in the area occupied by Powars Southside
Addition subdivision. This strange partitioning likely was done to compensate
John Boercher for the three tracts Will Powars mistakenly sold to Gus Tilghman
in 1866. Development on this block first occurred prior to 1910 on Lot 1, when
several rent houses were built to face Mason Street. These were occupied by
African Americans. In 1917 Louis Trapolino purchased all the lots in the block
and built a grocery and a home on the corner of Mason and Andrews Streets (see
Figure 3-7). He continued to lease rental houses to tenants on the other lots
through the 1950s. Gradall trenching in this area targeted both the Trapolino
Grocery and possible graves. Trenching in Block 38 included 5 trenches – 8, 54,
46, 42, 43, but the only artifacts collected were from Trenches 54 and 8 on the
north end of the block.
Trench 54- Lot 1
Artifacts recovered from Trench 54 clustered within the architectural and
kitchen functional categories with a few other categories represented, in this
case education, dietary, transportation and miscellaneous. Temporal indicated
represented by general glass making technology suggests a post World War I
date for the materials and deposits investigated.
The 11 architectural artifacts recovered included five pieces of asbestos tile,
porcelain plumbing (n=1), terracotta floor tile (n=1), a marble floor tile or
countertop fragment (n=1), a piece of window glass, a large pulled wire nail, and
a piece of caulking. A piece of what appears to be Bakelite plastic that has
melted and incorporated pieces of charcoal was described as an unknown
miscellaneous artifact.
The functional category of transportation is represented by a rubber tire
mounted on a wood and metal rim (16 centimeter interior diameter). It is unclear
to what exactly this artifact would have been affixed, perhaps a cart or similar
type conveyance.
The education/communication functional category was represented by a plastic
pen with metal parts and a label reading “NALCO”, an artifact of clearly recent
vintage.
The remaining artifacts were glass, ceramic and plastic and are all serving
vessels associated with kitchen related activities. Two pieces of undecorated
whiteware were collected that could not be reconstructed as to vessel form. Four
glass artifacts were analyzed. Two are brown/amber glass, one of which has an
exterior threaded finish. Another was a piece of green bottle glass, and the last
was a clear base of a wine bottle that read in embossed print “WINE”. None of

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

these glass or ceramic artifacts bore maker’s marks. Finally, a texture fragment
of a tall cylindrical cup was collected.
Trench 8- Lot 2
Trench 8 proved the most productive trench in Block 38, with a total of 74
artifacts collected. Similar to those from Trench 54, they are primarily
architecture and kitchen artifacts with several grooming, dietary,
household/furniture, medical, miscellaneous, and recreation items present.
Overall the materials appear to be related to the Trapolino store and residence,
with a number of temporally diagnostic artifacts bracketing the deposit between
the mid-1920’s through as late as possibly the early 1960’s.
Architectural materials collected included a soft paste red brick marked
“Houston Reds” and four pieces of a marble door handle that refit along a center
metal axis.
A piece of porcelain with a corroded metal wire in the center was assigned to the
Household/Furniture functional category as it was believed to be a fragment of
an electric lamp. Other artifacts that could not be assigned to a functional
category but may have relation to architectural or household/furniture
functional categories were a thin gauge wire attached to a metal loop and a slab
of green slate. Also a form of household/furniture, but classified as recreation,
was a faceplate fragment for a radio.
A single milk glass cosmetic container with an embossed design on the bottom
(apparently decorative, not diagnostic) was the only artifact of the grooming
category. A single complete clear ABM manufactured Vaseline jar was recovered
and classified as medical. A brown/amber Purex bottle was also recovered that
once contained bleach. The Purex brand in such bottles were most common
during the 1930 to 1950 period (Bottlebooks.com 2000).
Kitchen-related materials are represented by glass or ceramic artifacts. Ceramics
include three sherds of undecorated whiteware, which are not assignable to a
particular vessel type, and a piece of whiteware with a blue floral transfer
printed design. Two sherds of a yellowware plate were also recovered, and a rim
fragment of crockery with a thick blue glaze and a molded triangle pattern along
the exterior side. While excavating Trench 8, investigators documented a large
concentration of jar glass buried approximately 15 centimeters below the
surface. Thirteen glass kitchen bottles or fragments were collected from this
trench; seven of them appear to be storage jars. Among these are six fragments
or vessels that are clear and are what appear to be canning or storage jars with
wide mouths and external threaded finishes and one that is a smaller possible
condiment jar. Of the wide mouth jars, five have maker’s marks. Two are both
marked with “H” over an “A” – indicating the Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. – situating
the date of manufacture between 1923 and 1964 (Myinsulators.com 2007). A
third is another wide-mouth jar with an external threaded finish, and a maker’s
mark: “3 rivers”. This likely identifies the maker as The Three Rivers Co. in
Texas, and if so, establishes the date of production in the period between 1925­
1937 (Toulouse 1971: 494). Another is a complete jar with an “I” inside a circle
marking the Owens-Illinois Company, but a mark that post dates 1954. The
final wide mouth jar is also manufactured by Owens-Illinois, and based on the
presence of “3” to the right of the maker’s mark could date to the period between
1933 and 1943. In addition to wide mouth jars a small storage jar, possibly a
condiment jar, with square shoulders and a collared ring lip, but no maker’s

Chapter 6 – Results of Gradall Trench Investigations

mark was recovered. Other clear glass artifacts recovered include an oval basal
fragment, a neck fragment with ABM marks, a wine bottle base with a flat
bottom embossed with the word “wine”, and a whiskey jar with an external
threaded finish. This last artifact is interesting as it is embossed with the
American Medical Spirits Company logo (AMS Co.), a logo first used in 1928 to
legally
sell
prescribed
liquor
during
the
prohibition
period
(www.bottlebooks.com). In addition two brown/amber colored glass artifacts
were recovered. One is a handle off of a jug. This may in fact be a portion of a
bleach container such as the Purex bottle described above. The other is an oval
shaped bottle with a crown cap and fancy embossing, but lacking any identifying
marks. This may be a whiskey or liquor bottle.
The final functional category represented by the artifact recovery is dietary. In
Trench 8 this was represented by a single piece of animal bone.

CHAPTER 7 RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS –
TEST UNITS
By Rachel Feit and Bradford M. Jones
Archeologists excavated 32 square meters of test units. Fifteen 1x2 meter test
units were excavated and two 1x1 meter units were excavated. Archeologists
excavated the test units in 10-centimeter levels. Test units were placed around
feature areas, or on blocks containing isolatable late nineteenth or early
twentieth century surfaces. Test units were concentrated mainly on three
blocks—Block 2, Block 4 and Block 5 of Powars Southside Addition. These test
units investigated five main household groups. Test Units 1-6 were placed at
the back Lot 3 of Block 2 in an area of backyard sheet refuse associated with
pre-1940 tenant housing. Test Units 7 and 19 were placed on Lot 6 of Block 2
over a trash pit that contained concentrated debris buried by members of the
Spillman family. Test Units 8-10 were placed over a possible refuse pit on Lot 4
of Block 4, associated with the Richardson family. Test Unit 16 was placed near
the front of Lot 3 of Block 5, relating to the Young family. Finally, Test Units 17,
18, and 20 were placed at the front of Lots 4 and 5, owned by the Starks family.
Two additional units were excavated in Alden Place to investigate small, shallow
trash concentrations. These last two units yielded only a small amount of
cultural material, most of which was modern. The following discussion will
organize the results of the test unit investigations by household group, since
these were the primary units used to compare material culture data.

TEST UNITS ON BLOCK 2 (41HR1010)
Lot 3, Tenant Houses
Records indicate that a row of tenant-occupied shotgun houses occupied Lots 2­
4 between roughly 1907 and the middle 1930s (Figure 7-1).
Though tax
records and deed records do not record the presence of structures at that
location, the 1907 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map does show that houses were
located on every lot of the north half of Block 2. Two of these houses on Lot 3
were investigated by means of six test units placed toward the back of the lot,
while trenching also revealed foundation elements of the tenant houses at the
front of Lots 2, 3 and 4. Trenches 10, 11 and 12 at the rear of these lots
revealed what appeared to be a discrete surface containing pre-1940 artifacts,
brick foundation elements, and wooden posts (Features 9-14, 30, 36, 42-44, 50­
54) associated with two tenant-occupied shotgun houses (1711 and 1713
Andrews Street).
In 1910 Charles Smith lived at 1711 Andrews Street. He had five lodgers living
with him: Addie Conway (25), Addie’s 5-year old son, Lochett Conway, Viola
Foshay (49), Foshay’s son Jesse (18), and Gertrude Richardson (13). Only Smith
and Jesse Foshay worked, both at generic laboring jobs. Interestingly, a sixteenyear old Isabella Foshay lived at neighboring 1715 Andrews during the same
census year, while a John Forshay [sp?] lived at 1314 Beecher in 1916. This
pattern of family dispersal over just a few blocks suggests that while the Foshay
family may not have had the means to obtain their own lodgings so that they
could all remain together, they nevertheless choose lodgings that would allow
them to stay in proximity.

Sanborn Fire Insurance Map.

Next door to the Smith household was the family of William Chatman (35), who
lived with his wife Mattie (32) and their two children, Hazel (3) and Alexander (2).
William worked as a waiter, while Mattie worked as a dressmaker3 from the
house (Wagner 2005).
By 1920 the inhabitants of both houses had changed. Nicie Levinston (56) lived
in the house at 1711 Andrews with two lodgers, Andrew Coffer (27) and Simon
Ridley (38). Nicie worked as a laundress out of her home, while her lodgers
worked in an oil mill and as a carpenter. Emma Turner headed the household
at 1713 Andrews. She is listed in the 1920 census as a 23-year old laundress
who worked from her home. She lived with her daughter Ruby (8) and had two
boarders Ed Lewis and Charles Whitehead. Ed worked as a deliveryman for a
grocery, while Charles worked as a waiter in a hotel. Following a break in the
occupation record during the 1930s, which likely represents the time during
which the shotgun houses were demolished, a new set of apartments was built.
These remained standing until 2002. It is worth speculating about why the

3

Wagner’s 2005 report gives her occupation as a laundress, but according to the 1910 US census she was a
dressmaker.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

tenant shotgun houses were demolished on Lots 2-4 of Block 2. Investigations
point strongly to a fire. The majority of the assemblage is burned and evidence of
a fire was observed in each of the test units placed on Lot 3.
Six 1x2 meter test units were placed within Trenches 10 and 11 at the rear of
Lot 3 of Block 2 (Figure 7-2). The six test units in Trenches 10 and 11 revealed
a thin stratum of cultural material mixed with ash and charcoal. This stratum
varied in thickness and in depth but generally underlay a zone of dense charcoal
or sand and overlay sterile dark gray brown clay (10YR2/1). Burning was
evident throughout Trenches 10 and 11 stratigraphically above and within the
zone of cultural material. In all test units the depth of cultural material
extended to no more than about 30 centimeters below ground surface (99.95).
Figure 7-2

Plan View of Trenches 10 and 11

Setup for the test units on Lot 3 involved cleaning the exposed surfaces within
Trenches 10 and 11, in order to define the outlines of possible trash pits, privies
or pertinent structural features. The trenches were divided into three areas
(Areas 10a, 10b, and 11a), which were mapped and then cleaned using trowels,
brushes and shovel scraping in order to define possible features. Once each
area was cleaned, six test units were placed around features.
Because of the large number of artifacts (n=4,281) collected during the
excavation of areal scrapings 10a and 10b and their relatively equivalent
elevations and contexts, the artifacts are simply summarized as a group in this
section (Table 7-1). As a group these artifacts present a broad spectrum of

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

97

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

artifacts associated with the residential occupation of the lot, especially during
the early decades of the twentieth century. Although two episodes of structure
demolition affected the primary integrity of the archaeological contexts, the
admixture of more recent materials was surprisingly light and the assemblage
appears to reflect the practices of the occupants of the tenant houses and the
abandonment conditions of their homes. Ultimately the material from these
contexts compares favorably with that recovered in Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 that were
all excavated within these scrapings to better record the early twentieth century
occupation surface associated with the tenant housing.
In terms of artifact recovery, architectural items are the most common
functional class recovered (n=2392) (Table 7-1).
The high number of
architectural materials is in large part due to the 1,976 rusted pulled wire nails
that were collected during the course of the excavation in addition to floor tiles
of various types (n=9), bricks or brick fragments (n=6), asbestos tile (n=8),
copper wiring (n=3), cut nails (n=13), a porcelain door knob, window glass
(n=245), lumber (n=4), metal pipe and a spigot, sewer pipe (n=3) and various
staples, wingnuts, etcetera. The kitchen related artifacts were the next most
common consisting of 1098 glass, ceramic, or metal items. The 862 glass
shards and bottles consisted of 745 clear, 45 brown/amber, 28 green, 16 aqua,
12 manganese bleached examples, as well as nine white milk glass canning
liners, one clear glass peg stopper and one piece of cobalt glass. Broken down
by type the 206 sherds of ceramic consisted of whiteware (n=105), porcelain
(n=40), yellowware (n=2), an unknown orange paste ceramic (n=2), an unknown
white paste ceramic with a square shape and cream slip, Guanajuato Majolica
(n=1), and brown Bennington glaze stoneware (n=1). In addition to pottery and
glass, other kitchen related items included 22 metal closures for screw top and
crown cap containers, a large steel spoon, three bottles or can openers, a tin
can, the pouring lid of a syrup bottle, and part of stove. Dietary items in the
form of cut animal bone (n=218), shellfish shells (n=29) and nuts or seeds (n=7)
were also commonly recovered from these units and are for the most part likely
food debris associated with the tenant houses. Household/furniture materials
included lamp glass (n=4), part of an electric lamp (n=1), seven pieces of
ornamental glass, electric plugs (n=2), a drawer pull, and 17 sherds of terra
cotta pottery that are likely to be flower pots. Items related to the activities of
the inhabitants included a variety of artifacts associated with the personal
(n=18), grooming (n=19), medical (n=16), economic (n=4) clothing (n=108), and
recreational (n=34) functional categories. Notable among the personal items was
the recovery of a cowboy pin (now decapitated), a child sized ring, three fake
rhinestones, and the pieces of eyeglass frames that have been melted. Clothing
was the largest functional category related to personal habits collected and was
overwhelmingly composed of buttons. These included forty-seven buttons of
shell, 16 of metal, two of wood, and 24 of plastic. The other clothing objects
included a belt buckle, three collar studs, eight shoe parts, and six pieces of cut
and treated leather of unknown function. Finally, recreational items were found
in some number, all of them children’s toys and the majority of them marbles.
The marble collection contained four ceramic marbles – two of which are
Benningtons – and 23 glass marbles and one that appears to be a synthetic
material. Other artifacts include three pieces of porcelain figurines (one is a
horse), the base of a tin soldier, a plastic toy boat, and another hard to identify
painted tin object believed to have been part of a toy.

Temporally diagnostic artifacts of glass and ceramic were limited but strongly
suggest a primarily 1920-1930’s date consistent with the dates of the tenant
houses. Datable glass included an aqua colored glass bottle with “I.G. Co.”
embossing, that references the Ihmsen Glass Co. from Pittsburg Pennsylvania,
that manufactured glass in the late nineteenth century (Lockhart et al 2005).
Another bottlemark recorded from the assemblage is an “H” inside a square.
This mark was used by Hemingray Glass Company of Muncie IN around 1924­
1935 (Myinsulators.com 2007). Four basal shards have the “I” in a diamond in a
circle mark of the Owens-Illinois Glass Co., allowing the manufacture date of
these bottles to be placed between 1929-1954. An undecorated porcelain plate
fragment was marked “MCNICOLS CHINA”, which identifies this piece as a
recent piece produced after 1959 by D.E. McNicol Pottery, Clarkesburg, West
Virgnia (Lehner 1988:291). An undecorated whiteware sherd bore a “ROYAL
IRONSTONE CHINA” maker’s mark with a portion of a unicorn and crown
design. This mark can be attributed to the W.H. Grindley & Co. and was
produced between 1891-1925 (Kowalsky and Kowalsky 1999: 215).
Test Units 1 and 2
Test Units 1 and 2 were placed adjacent to each other in Trench 10 (Area 10b)
around Feature 11, a brick feature originally interpreted as a house foundation
pier, but which may in fact be part of a walkway or porch support pier. The top
of the brick feature was visible at the opening level of the test units (Figure 7-3).
Test Units 1 and 2 were in dug three levels to a depth of 99.875. Test Unit 2 was
then dug an extra level to a depth of 99.785. Level 1 of both units contained a
very large mass of burned and rusted nails, wood, charcoal, burned brick, and
various demolition debris clustered in the northern portion of the units. A water
pipe ran through Test Units 1 and 2 along a roughly east-west trajectory south
of the densest concentration of burned demolition debris. The water pipe
overlay sediment mixed with ash, charcoal, metal, and other artifacts,
suggesting that the installation of the pipe actually post-dates the demolition of
the shotgun homes. Artifact density decreased in Level 2 of both units, as soil
graded into sandy clay, laden with charcoal, some ash and cultural material.
Test Unit 1 contained a small wooden post (Feature 44) placed vertically within
the densest mass of burned metal and nails. The post extended to a depth of
only 100.035, ending in Level 2. Test Unit 1 also contained a small irregular
shaped pit feature (Feature 30) first observed at the base of Level 2, underneath
the mass of burned nails, wood, brick and ferrous material. This small pit was
filled with mainly loose, charcoal-laden sediment, a large quantity of nails
(n=37), coal clinkers (n=19), lantern glass (13) and some burned ceramic and
bottle glass.

Test Unit 2 contained a small vertical stake located approximately 20
centimeters from the south wall of the unit. The stake extended below the level
excavated. Recovery of cultural material, in the form of artifacts and features
dropped to almost zero in Level 3 of both Test Units 1 and 2.
The artifacts recovered in Test Units 1 and 2 totaled 5745 specimens that
included almost all of the functional categories employed in the analysis (Table
7-2, 7-3). The artifacts strongly reflect the residential nature of the site, but also
show indications of economic occupations of the tenants, many of whom were
laundresses. The artifact density and diversity is highest in Level 1 and both
drop significantly over the course of the next three levels.

As was the case in most contexts across the site, artifacts functionally related to
architecture were the most numerous, accounting for 3662 items or almost 59%
of the collection. Chief among the types of architectural items recovered were
pulled wire nails (n=3273) and window glass (n=227). A small collection of cut
nails (n=43) was also recovered. Other architectural artifacts included bricks,
floor tile of various types, lumber – some of which is burned, shingles, sewer
pipe, concrete, miscellaneous lengths of pipe, asbestos tile, drywall, electric
wiring, hinges and other difficult to identify metal pieces. The presence of a wide
range of construction materials including wood with the nails in mixed contexts
strongly suggests that some of this material is debris from the demolition of the
tenant houses that once stood on the property. However, the drywall was
probably demolition debris from more recent apartments.
Another 101 artifacts classified as household/furniture represent fragments of
the accoutrements of the interior and exterior lived environment. Most of these
were either fragments of ornamental glass objects (Figure 7-4) such as vases
(n=39), lighting fixtures (n=3), lampshades (n=31), or flower pots (n=21). In
addition other artifacts collected included the end of an electric plug (n=1), a
drawer pull knob (n=1), mousetrap springs (n=2), a door hook (n=1) and a
lightening whelk shell. The recovery of 19 clinkers in Level 3 suggests the
presence of a coal burning stove or heater.
A total of 1,209 artifacts identified as being functionally related to the kitchen
were recovered from the excavation of Test Units 1 and 2. The recovered
artifacts were manufactured primarily from glass (n=987), ceramic (n=196),
metal (n=20), synthetic (n=5) and plant materials (n=1). Artifacts produced from
synthetic materials (i.e. plastic) were all closures including three internally
threaded lids, a lid to a tube of some sort and the top of a salt and pepper
shaker. The plant material artifact was likely a paper liner of a cap or possibly a
label. The metal artifacts included a knife, possibly of brass, part of a spoon,
the corroded handle of can opener, a metal turn key for an item such as a
sardine can and 16 closures. The closures were mostly from crown cap bottles
(n=10), but one was from a mustard jar that retained a still legible paper label
reading “TRY DELICIOUS KRAFT MUSTARD CREAMY SMOOTH”. Glass was by
far the most abundant type of kitchen related material found and was composed
of primarily clear (n=860), brown/amber (n=64), green (n=20), aqua (n=13), pink
(n=1), light blue (n=14), manganese bleached (purpled) (n=11), and selenium
bleached (yellowed) (n=2). Shards of unidentifiable storage and utility glass
wares predominated the assemblage. Among the identifiable fragments were

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

101

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

pieces of drinking glasses, a graduated measuring cup, a glass stopper, wine
bottle fragments, and a green glass plate. Most artifacts were identifiable as
being manufactured using automatic bottling machines and were consistent
with periods of production from the 1920’s-1930’s. The 11 pieces of manganese
bleached glass suggest at least a small component of glass artifacts that predate
the 1920’s. Few pieces had maker’s marks, though two bottles had the name
“BALL” embossed, and another two bore Hazel-Atlas maker’s marks. These four
artifacts likely all represent glass canning jars. The ceramic assemblage was
dominated by undecorated fragments of whiteware (n=129), with smaller
samples of decal (n=4), hand painted (n=1), and transfer printed (n=5) pieces of
whiteware. Porcelains accounted for a total of 43 specimens and yellowware
(n=1), salt glazed stoneware (n=1), majolica/loza corriente (n=1), and
unidentified (n=2) made up the rest. Clearly related to the kitchen material was
the recovery of 274 pieces of animal bone and 33 pieces of shell. An additional
32 fragments of nuts and seeds including a peanut shell, pecans, and
watermelon and pumpkin seeds were also recovered, but it is less clear to what
degree some of these represent food remains as opposed to naturally occurring
plants and which, if any, are modern. All told, the kitchen related materials and
the dietary materials present a diverse collection of artifacts that included both
items necessary for preparing as well as serving and eating food, that dates to
the 1920’-1930’s period occupation of the site.

fragments (Bags 49-2, 47-18); C) Rose-colored decorative glass fragment (Bag 50-6); D) Clear glass

kitchen glass (Bag 22-5); G) sugar bowl fragment (Bag 37-14).

Items that would have been used for personal care (medicine, grooming),
recreation, arms, or presentation (jewelery, clothing) were common. The most
common of these types of artifacts were pieces of clothing (n=85). Though cloth
is generally not preserved, a large number of buttons presumably from shirts,
dresses or pants were (Figure 7-5). These consisted of 34 shell buttons or
fragments, 21 plastic buttons, a single button each of glass, metal, and ceramic.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

In addition two studs, one a plastic collar stud and the other a metal stud of
unknown function, three buckles or strap adjustors, one zipper, four pieces of
leather, 16 fragments of shoe soles or heels, and the remains of silk stockings
were all recovered. Two safety pins were recovered in the first level. The high
occurrence of buttons from these units and the similar high numbers of buttons
found in the associated trenches and in Test Units 3-6, stand out because
buttons were not nearly so common in other excavated contexts. The women
who lived in the tenant houses worked as laundresses and seamstresses. These
buttons could have been lost off garments during the course of the washing, or
were removed and replaced.
Figure 7-5

A Sample of Buttons from the Tenant Household Units.

A number of jewelry items were also recovered here (Figure 7-6). This included
24 beads of glass, plastic or ceramic of various sizes and colors, a broach with
three parallel bars decorated with three rhinestones, a floral design broach/pin
(n=2), a thick gold wire bracelet, and a small white rabbit charm. An interesting
artifact was a 1st Lieutenant’s bar pin. Other personal affects included parts of
three watches and a watchband, a key chain, two keys (1 fragmented), and a box
lid of spelter relief decorated with images of a Dutch table scene showing a figure
pouring from a pitcher.
Eighteen artifacts were believed to be related to personal grooming of the
residents. Among them were eight fragments of milk glass containers,
presumably fragments of cold crème containers, and a complete clear glass
external threaded bottle embossed with “JERGEN”S LOTION” on the base. Other
grooming items included fragments of a straight razor (n=6), a blue synthetic
toothbrush fragment with black bristles, a lipstick tube with red lipstick inside,
and one-half of a round compact case with the hinge and writing partially visible
but indecipherable.

A collection of 17 artifacts was classified as medical in nature. Sixteen were
glass, the most easily recognizable of which were petroleum jelly jars. Six
fragments were from 8 sided clear glass jars, which bore embossing identifying
them as containing petroleum jelly manufactured by the Plough Company and
sold under the Moroline name (Figure 7-7). Moroline was first marketed in
1931, providing a maximum age to the bottles (Treasure Chronicle 2003). The 8
sided form is the original bottle style. Only one had a maker’s mark, a “I” in a
circle in a diamond with the number 7 to the left and right. This is an OwenIllinois mark likely indicating a 1937 date of manufacture. Another two glass
bottle fragments contained the better known Vaseline brand produced in
Chesebrough, New York. Another small complete patent medicine of clear glass
(ABM) has the name of the Phenique Chemical Co. embossed on the shoulder
(Figure 7-7). Phenique Chemical Company (also known as Campho-Phenique)
was a manufacturer of medical goods, most notable the antiseptic CamphoPhenique. The remaining bottles were assigned to the medical category based
on their bottle type. Three are cobalt blue in color, a coloration often seen on
medical bottles such as Bromo-seltzer, and the remaining two are clear glass
identified based on their finishes as Patent Medicine bottles. One has evidence
of hand lipping tool and the other is an automatic bottle machine. The

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

remaining three artifacts are two fragments of a vial or dropper, one of which is
clearly burned, and the other is a plastic closure for an internally threaded
bottle or vial.
This last artifact has “BM BRISTOL-MEYERS COMPANY”
embossed on the top, indicating it is probably from a medicine container of an
unknown sort.

(Bag 37-13, Unit 3).

Compared to other excavated contexts, there was a high number of writing
utensils excavated here. These were principally fragments of pencils (n=13),
though 15 fragments of a slate were recovered that may have some relation to a
piece of chalk. An odd piece of hard rubber with a form reminiscent of a glue
spout was also tentatively assigned to the education/communication category.
Children’s recreational activities are indicated by the recovery of 11 marbles (9
glass, 2 ceramic – 1 is a Bennington), a broken plastic toy soldier (in two parts),
and three pieces of a broken porcelain doll (Figure 7-8).

Evidence for arms included two .38 caliber shells, as well as a lead slug that had
been fired.
There were a number of tools in the collected artifacts including files (n=2), a
screwdriver, a metal gear, an unknown machine part, a rubber band, but
artifacts assigned to this category were primarily miscellaneous wire (n=39),
machine bolts (n=3), machine screws (n=19), chain (n=2) and washers (n=4).
Many of the other miscellaneous items for which no clear function could be
discerned may be tool parts, auto parts, or architectural items.
Test Units 3 and 4
Test Units 3 and 4 were placed also placed in Trench 10 (Area 10a) adjacent to
each other near Feature 9, which was first identified as a possible brick
foundation pier, but later excavation indicated that if had been a pier, it was
badly disturbed (Figure 7-9). A more likely explanation is that it, along with
Features 10-12 was part of a rear yard walkway. The three bricks that
comprised Feature 9 were not associated with any sort of intact structure and
were resting on an earth surface of dark brown sandy clay (Strat 13). One brick
was a marked Thurber paving brick, while the two other unmarked bricks also
appeared to be paving bricks. A wooden post (Feature 36) was found in the
southwest corner of Test Unit 3 in Level 1. This feature extended to a depth of
32 centimeters (99.788) below ground surface. An iron pipe crossed Test Unit 3
from north to south at an elevation of 99.995. Both Test Units 3 and 4 revealed
a noticeable scatter of mussel shell at the base of Level 1 and in Level 2. This
scatter consisted of primarily whole shells distributed across a surface whose
elevation was at roughly 100.075. Artifact recovery continued in Level 2 but
dropped noticeably in Levels 3 and 4. Test Unit 3 was terminated at the bottom
of Level 4 (99.795), and Test Unit 4 was terminated at the base of Level 3
(99.875).

Figure 7-9

Feature 9 in Test Unit 3

Similar to results from excavations in Test Units 1 and 2, excavators recovered a
large and diverse sample of artifacts (n=2,850) associated with the residential
occupation of the Lot during the early twentieth century, primarily in the upper
20 centimeters, with a rapid decline throughout the lower levels (Table 7-4, 75). Overall the most common functional category is architecture (n=1224)
followed by kitchen (n=1092). In general terms the diversity of the collection
decreases with depth, particularly between Levels 2 and 3, and the only
categories present in all levels are architecture, dietary and clothing.
Interestingly, in level 2 the relative amount of kitchen related materials is higher
than that of the architecture, a reversal of the general trend observed in Test
Units 1 and 2 and on the Spillman property. Because the artifacts were all
recovered from a single occupation zone without clear internal stratification the
artifacts are described as a group. Specific information concerning individual
artifacts by level and unit are presented in Appendix E.

The architectural artifacts are primarily pulled wire nails (n=955) and a much
smaller quantity of cut square nails (n=38). Broken window glass was also quite
common (n=143) as were whole and broken pieces of construction and paving
bricks. Only one brick had legible markings, a Thurber paving brick, which
came from Feature 9. Additional artifacts such as asbestos tile, porcelain
insulators and miscellaneous tile and wire were comparable to those identified
in Test Units 1 and 2.
Household type materials totaled 111 items. These included primarily lamp
glass and lighting parts, many of which appear to be related to electrical light
systems. In addition, fragments of decorative glass were fairly common and 13
pieces of terra cotta pottery from flower pots were recorded. A doorbell and a
mousetrap were also included in this category (Figure 7-10). Seven clinkers
presumably represent the use of a coal heater.
Artifacts functionally related to the kitchen (n=1092) and dietary habits (n=208)
constituted a large bulk of the material recovered from Test Units 3 and 4. Most
of the kitchen materials consisted of unidentifiable shards of glass from various
drinking or storage containers. The vast majority of the glass is clear (n=667),
with much smaller numbers of aqua (n=59), amber/brown (n=58), manganese
bleached/purple (n=19), green (n=18), and pink (n=1). Based on the color and
its relationship to bleaching technologies, the majority of the clear glass likely
postdates 1918 when manganese bleaching was no longer employed for making
clear glass (Figure 7-11). Of the glass bottles and jars, two were classifiable as
pickle/preserve jars – including a Mason jar fragment, and two as milk bottles.

Five clear glass peg stoppers and two pieces of cut glass, perhaps a cake stand,
were also noted. Ceramics were another large category of artifact from the
kitchen category. These artifacts included 145 pieces of whiteware, of which
seven had transfer print decoration and six had decal, 95 pieces of porcelain
including three with transfer decoration and one with a gold gilt band, and 12
pieces of salt glazed stoneware crockery (Figure 7-12). Other kitchen related
artifacts included five fragments of eating utensils (4 are handles, 1 is a
complete fork), a can opener fragment, a bottle closure, a cork and two
fragments of a wooden bowl. The dietary elements consisted of 180 pieces of
animal bone, 26 shells, and two pieces of eggshell.

traps or clothes pins (Bags 23-8, 18-124); D) Drawer pull (Bag 18-26); E) Door bell (Bag 47-6); F) Receipt
holder (Bag 11-1).

Personal items (n=16) were represented by broken pieces of jewelry including
beads of glass, ceramic and plastic, two pins or broaches (n=2), a broken chain
(n=3), a fake faceted gemstone, the back of a ladies watch and a key. Medical
and grooming items accounted for 11 and 27 items respectively. Medical items
were largely unidentifiable to specific medicines or uses, and are represented
primarily by recovered bottles with prescription finishes and graduated marks
on the bodies. Grooming materials were primarily inferred from pieces of broken
milk glass that are commonly utilized for salves or creams. However, of
particular interest was the recovery of a metal hot comb fragment in Level 1 of
Test Unit 3. A celluloid comb was also recovered.

fragment (Bag 6-5); R) Bottle base with maker’s mark (Bag 17-30).

Clothing items were relatively common, accounting for 61 of the artifacts. Like
Test Units 1 and 2, the majority of the clothing items are buttons (n=38), with
the majority being shell (n=23), followed by porcelain (n=9), metal (n=5) and
glass (n=1). Three collar studs were also identified, along with several buckles
and pieces of miscellaneous shoes. This concentration of buttons and collar
studs similar to that seen in Test Units 1 and 2 is likely a material expression of
the resident laundresses’ trade and the types of discarded artifacts generated in
its practice.
Recreational items (n=3) associated with children’s activities (see Figure 7-8)
included a Bennington marble, a stoneware marble and a fragment of a
porcelain doll. One of the few instances of tobacco use is represented in this
unit by the recovery of a snuff bottle fragment. Only two items were found that
could be assigned to the educational category, and these were both fragments of
a possible writing slate.

Items pertaining to the categories of tools, transportation and arms were also
recovered in Test Units 3 and 4. None of the 19 artifacts classified as tools could
be described as such in the traditional sense. Instead the collection consisted of
only screws, bolts, washers, hooks, or similar objects. Three items were
recovered that were related to transport, including two possible spark plugs.
Arms were represented by five artifacts, all of which are bullet slugs or casings,
though none were sufficiently well preserved to determine caliber or
manufacturer. Fifty-nine artifacts, mostly of metal, were assigned to the
miscellaneous category because they were too damaged to be placed in a more
precise functional category.
Test Units 5 and 6
Test Units 5 and 6 were placed adjacent to each other in Trench 11 (Area 11a)
on Lot 3 to investigate Feature 13. Feature 13 was thought to be a potential
refuse pit or privy, but was later determined to be a localized pocket of ash
within the larger debris context comprising the back of Lots 2 and 3 on Block 2.
Whole oyster shell was recorded at the base of level 1 and in level 2 of both units
at an elevation of between100.089 and 99.989. Test Unit 6 contained a high
density of bone at the base of Level 1 (100.089), and was confined mainly to the
southern portion of the unit. Feature 20, a small concentration of ash, glass,
and ceramic was observed at the base of Level 1 and straddled Test Units 5 and
6.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

Relative to the units in Trench 10, Test Units 5 and 6 are approximately a meter
south of Test Units 3 and 4 and positioned within Area 11a. Though not far
from Test Units 3 and 4, there was a much lower quantity of material culture
recovered in both Area 11a (n=1235; Table 7-6) and in the units (n=1034;
Tables 7-7 & 7-8) with some significant differences in the proportions of
functional categories. Most evident in the units is the lower percentage of
architectural debris recovered in these units relative to the kitchen debris. As
was the case for Units 1-4, architectural and kitchen related artifacts were the
most numerous functional categories. However, unlike in Test Units 1-4, where
architectural items were the largest category, in Test Units 5 and 6 the kitchen
materials comprised 39.4% of the collection while architectural materials
accounted for only 24.5% of the total recovery from those units. This trend is
present throughout all four excavation levels.
Also notable is the high
percentage of animal bone (22%) relative to these two categories and the overall
lower diversity of other classes of material compared to other units associated
with the tenant housing. Though speculative, it may be that this area is more
intact in terms of demolition-related deposition than the units in Trench 10,
since it is spatially further away from the tenant houses, though admittedly not
by much.

Architectural debris (n=304) recovered in the unit is typical of other units, with
pulled wire nails (n=232) dominating over window pane (n=19), and cut nails
(n=12). Other artifacts included roof tiles (n=6), floor tile (n=), brick (n=11), sewer
pipe and miscellaneous screws and wire.
Worth noting is that household/furniture items are nearly absent from these
test units-- only a piece of a lampshade or lamp glass was recovered. This is
quite different from Test Units 1-4, and may be a factor of the increased distance
of this trench and these units from the actual structures. Other artifacts that
would be anticipated to be in the assemblage based on the results of the
excavation of Test Units 1-4 are also largely absent. These include personal
items such as jewelry or accessories, for which in Test Units 5 and 6 only a
single bead and the metal portion of a purse were recovered. Other items
associated with grooming and medical care are represented by a total of 21
items. Of these, only one item, a hard plastic enema syringe, was classified as
medical. The remaining 20 items are primarily shards of milk glass (n=17), a
possible electric razor part, and two pieces of a plastic hair comb. Recreational
items were limited to a single glass marble. Education/communication items
were represented only by a pen and a pencil. Clothing was also lightly
represented by eight items, all of which are buttons: six shell, one glass, and one
plastic. The other items that may have been the personal articles of the
inhabitants included a single .38 caliber cartridge, and four tools including two
file fragments, a machine bolt and a machine screw.
The kitchen (n=408) and dietary (n=228) categories were well-represented in this
unit. The glass was overwhelming clear in color (n=239), with much lower
quantities of brown/amber (n=23), aqua (n=8), green (n=7), manganese bleached
(purple) (n=3) and cobalt (n=1). In general few vessel types could be positively
identified with the exception of three basal fragments of what appear to be glass
tumblers all of which bear the mark “No. 72 PAT. IN. US. DEC. 22. 1903 JULY.
17.1906” on the base (Figure 7-10). Several of these same glasses were
recovered in the general Area 11a excavation. Though this does not necessarily
indicate the date of manufacture for the actual artifacts, it does clearly notate
that this was produced post 1906. Other identifiable glass artifacts included a
fragment of a Ball mason jar and an extract bottle. The only identified finish
was a ball neck patent, with evidence of manufacture using a hand lipping tool.
The ceramic artifacts included primarily undecorated whiteware fragments
(n=87). Only one piece of whiteware was decorated and this was a transfer print
decoration. Undecorated porcelain sherds accounted for 29 artifacts and an
additional three sherds had transfer print decoration. Finally, two sherds of a
terracotta pottery were grouped within the kitchen functional category, though
these may be pieces of flower pots given the paste type. The faunal assemblage
consisted of 164 pieces of animal bone, many with saw marks, and 64 fragments
of shell.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

As noted, the assemblage from the excavation contexts in Test Unit 5 and 6
differed from Test Units 1-4 in quantity and diversity. This difference may be a
factor of location, as it is further from the footprint of the tenant houses. This
suggests that this deposit is more typical of a pre-demolition assemblage
associated with habitual rear yard refuse disposal. Based on the variety of
kitchen and dietary items present, it would appear that this area served as a
defacto refuse dump for bone and shell as well as general trash from the
kitchen.
Summary of Tenant House Investigations
Overall, the trenches and six test units on the north half of Block 2 revealed
what was interpreted to be brick piers or walkway fragments and general refuse
associated with early twentieth century shotgun housing. The archeological
context for these features, though very shallow, was relatively pristine due to the
fact that after the houses were demolished, an apartment complex was built on
the site that covered the remains under concrete and asphalt pavement.
The brick features (Features 9, 10, 11, 12) investigated by Trench 10 and Test
Units 1-4 were all made of red brick and several appeared to be paving bricks.
Feature 10 was rectangular and arranged two rows of three bricks each laid side
by side, with a single brick and a half brick laid across one of the short ends.
Feature 9 represented three paving bricks laid side by side; while Features 11
and 12, were also arranged with three bricks lying side by side. As these were
recorded in trench profiles only, however, it is not known whether they share the
same morphology with Features 11 and 12. All four brick features were on Lot
3, but probably pertain to two different houses or yard spaces.
Two certain brick foundation piers were at the front of Lot 3 (Features 52 and
53) in Trench 45. These piers were rectangular in shape and arranged as a 16 x
12 inch perimeter of bricks surrounding a single brick (Figure 7-13). These
show evidence of having been burned. Three additional piers, Features 50, 51
and 54 were also recorded in Trench 45 at the front of Lots 2 and 4 and these
represent the other tenant houses that were known to be present in the early
twentieth century. Six wooden post remains (Features 14, 36, 42-44) found in
Test Units, 1, 2, 3, and in Trench 11 could represent the remains of rear
porches, fences, or some other yard feature associated with the dwellings.
Artifacts from Test Units 1-6 reflect a minor overprinting of early twentieth
century deposits with later materials such as plastic items and appear indicative
of archeological deposits formed from the accumulation of material from daily
activities carried out on site and the effects of the demolition of the shotgun
houses and subsequent reoccupation of the lots. The upper levels of these units
contained large amounts of architectural materials including both round and
square nails, bricks, window pane and other structural elements such as
porcelain insulators, fragments of light fixtures and door knobs. In addition, the
material collected from Trench 10 and Test Units 1-4 in particular revealed a
highly diverse assemblage.
Fragmented ceramics were abundant and
predominately of whiteware, porcelain, and terracotta with a small sample of
yellow ware and English majolica. Glass shards were also abundant and
included both window and bottle glass. The presence of manganese (1870’s­
1917) and selenium (1915-1930’s) bleached glass are consistent with the dates
of habitation of the shotgun houses, and the recovery of a substantial amount of
bone material and personal items such as clothing parts, comb fragments, a

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

toothbrush, glass and ceramic marbles and an embossed metal box attest the
domestic character of the occupation. The tenant context produced 224 buttons,
which is far and away a greater quantity of buttons than was found in any other
part of the site. This elevated button density reflects the profession of the early
twentieth century tenants. Both censuses and city directories show that the
women who occupied these properties between 1900 and 1930 worked as either
laundresses or seamstresses from the house. The wrought iron base of a sewing
machine table was recovered adjacent to Feature 14, in Area 11a of Trench 11.
Figure 7-13

Trench data from Trenches 10, 11 12, and 45 also suggests that the artifact
scatter associated with the shotguns was much denser at the rear of the lots
than the front. This is not surprising; other researchers have noted this same
pattern of artifact discard (Wright 1997) for urban sites in Texas. Privies, trash
pits and general domestic refuse are often found toward the back rather than
the front of house lots. However, the considerable artifact scatter at the rear of
lots, coupled with the absence of a discrete discard context (such as a privy,
well, or a trash pit) bears some consideration as to whether that scatter was
intentional or merely the product of demolition processes.
The material from Test Units 1-6 and Areas 10a, 11a, and 10b alone comprised
approximately 46.7% of the total artifact recovery during the project. Many of
the artifacts found from Test Units 1-6 revealed evidence of burning. Pockets of
burned nails, wood, and ash were observed throughout the test units and
trenches. Test unit notes, artifact patterning and the distribution of types

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

115

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

suggest that the houses burned while they were still occupied. Or it is also
possible that residents were first expelled, leaving a great deal of personal effects
or garbage behind, then the houses were intentionally burned. Either scenario
would explain the very significant quantity of refuse in the absence of an
apparent intentional disposal context. Whether this theory is correct or not, it
seems clear that much of the artifact scatter probably derives from postoccupation earth and debris-moving activities associated with demolition of
original structures prior to new construction. Thus, though the context for the
scatter was sealed, the specific placement of many of the artifacts may not have
been intentional.
Nevertheless, despite the considerable amount of abandonment debris, it is also
quite likely that the rear yards were regularly used for household refuse disposal
to a certain extent. Intact concentrations of whole oyster shell were found at a
consistent elevation and pressed into the surface at the base of Level 1 of Test
Units 3, 4 and 5. Also, artifact recovery below an elevation of 100.075 shows a
pattern of rapid decline with depth, suggesting that this elevation was probably
the ground surface at the time of occupation. Moreover, a very large quantity of
bone was recovered from Test Units 1-6 and Areas 10a, 11a, and 10b,
representing hundreds of meals.
This amount of bone could not have
accumulated in a single abandonment episode.
Lot 6- The Spillman Household
Two units (Test Units 7 and 19) were placed on Lot 6 of Block 2 within a large
trash pit or privy (Feature 16) associated with the main house located on that lot
(see Figure 7-1). This lot was an owner-occupied property from before 1910
until 1945. Though tax and deed records document the Walker Spillman family
at 1720 Ruthven from 1911 on, the Spillman family are actually documented at
this location in the tax records and in city directories from 1910. Their house is
documented at this location on the 1907 Sanborn. Thus it seems reasonable to
assume they probably purchased their property through a bond-for-title contract
which wasn’t recorded until 1911. The house appears to have been built before
1907. Walker Spillman was an express wagon operator, who lived with his wife
Lucy in a one-story house at 1720 Ruthven. Lucy worked as a nurse for a
private family. While this is speculative, it may be that Walker Spillman was
one of Houston’s early jitney drivers. The jitneys were privately owned cars that
competed with the electric streetcar line. They evolved as a result of Houston’s
1903 City Ordinance requiring segregation of black and white passengers in
streetcars. Out of protest, black Houstonians, who worked as wagon drivers
and drayman already, boycotted the streetcar line and started their own
transportation services to serve the black community. The jitneys grew so
successful in fact, that by 1919 the Houston Electric Company (who operated
the streetcars) complained publicly that the jitneys cost the company nearly
$400,000 a year. By 1923, the Houston City Council made jitney operation
illegal (Dressman 1992). Jitney driving was highly respected in the 4th Ward,
not only because it was one of the few entrepreneurial endeavors in which
blacks could successfully compete against white businessmen, but also because
it represented a very effective form of resistance to repressive Jim Crow
ordinances.
The records suggest that Lucy and her husband purchased Lots 6 and 7
through a bond for title transaction with Will Powars. The actual deed transfer
was recorded in 1911 (HCDR 281/137 in Wagner 2005), though it is clear from
city directories, Sanborn fire insurance maps and census records that the

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

116

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

couple lived there before then. The couple lived in the house until Walker died
sometime around 1912 or 1913. After that Lucy remarried William Burroughs
and moved to a different house on the same lot, facing Mason Street, and rented
the main house facing Ruthven to other tenants. Lucy died in 1945 and the
property passed to Frank Hart, who may have been a son-in-law or other
relative, as census records show that a Murphy Hart was one of the tenants who
lived at 1720 Ruthven (US census 1930). The lot was vacant in 2002 with no
standing structures on it.
Test Units 7 and 19 were placed on Lot 6 in an L-formation separated by a 30­
centimeter baulk (Figure 7-14). These units exposed the southeastern and
southwestern edges of Feature 16, which formed a roughly circular 1.9-meter
diameter trash pit, approximately 40 centimeters deep. The test units were dug
in roughly ten-centimeter levels down to the base of Feature 16. Feature 16 was
buried under approximately 22 centimeters of sediment containing a mix of mid
to late twentieth century debris. No traces of the original house itself were noted
in the trench (Trench 14) that exposed Feature 16. Relative to the residence at
1720 Ruthven, the pit was placed in what was the original back yard space.
Sanborn maps indicate that the configuration of the house changed over time.
The 1907 maps shows an L-shaped house with the rear wing on the east side.
The trash pit was probably dug in what would have been the rear courtyard
space formed by the L. In contrast, the 1925 Sanborn shows that original rear
wing was demolished and a new rear wing was built on the east side of the
house (see Figure 7-1). The trash pit is located partially under this new rear
wing, which must have been built after the pit was closed. Conveniently this
provides a good terminus ante quem of 1925 for the deposits within Feature 16.
This corresponds well to the artifact content.
Feature 16 (and Test Units 7 and 19) was perhaps the most productive of all
features excavated during the project. Its size, depth, and artifact content
indicate that it was surely an intentional burial of debris. The debris consisted
of household refuse within a basin shaped pit (Figure 7-15). The pit (Feature 16)
appears to have been metal lined at the bottom and possibly the top, though the
metal was badly corroded at the time of excavation. It is possible that the debris
was placed in a metal drum of some sort, then burned before it was buried. The
non-artifact fill of Feature 16 was characterized by loose ashy, charcoal-laden
and rust-stained soil dug into hard-packed, dark gray brown clay. The types of
debris found in Feature 16 (Test Units 7 and 19) included numerous whole
bottles (medicine, liquor, extract, milk, pickle, perfume, snuff, etc., some with
stoppers in them), reconstruct-able ceramic dish fragments, a whole stoneware
whiskey/cider jug, horseshoes, jewelry, buckles, buttons, shoes, china doll
parts, can fragments, a rubber bladder, cut bone etc. Much of the material had
been burned. All of the debris dates to roughly 1900-1920 and likely correlates
to a period when Walker and Lucy Spillman lived in the house. The base of the
pit was recorded at a site elevation of 99.8514 meters.

Feature 16 Partially Excavated

Although both units were excavated separately, because both units were focused
on a single open pit feature which does not appear to have discernible internal
vertical or horizontal patterning, artifact discussion will combine the results of
the two excavations. In general the pit contained a very mixed assemblage of
artifacts from architectural and different household contexts. Breakdowns by
unit and level are provided in Appendix E and in Tables 7-9 and 7-10. Based on
the artifact assemblage the pit appears to have formed relatively quickly perhaps
following the remodeling of the house.

Artifacts functionally related to architecture were the largest category recovered
in the test units with 2490 items identified as such. The majority of these
artifacts are pulled wire nails (n=1835), window glass (n=526), and cut nails
(n=430). In addition, brick fragments, porcelain and stoneware tile,
miscellaneous wire, hinges, sheet metal and wood were also recovered. Artifacts
counts were highest in Levels 1 and 2 and gradually decreased with depth.
The next largest category of artifacts recovered were those functionally related to
the kitchen. This included both whole and fragmented glass jars, bottles and
drinking vessels was well as many pieces of porcelain, whiteware and stoneware
ceramics in a wide variety of patterns. Additional artifacts such as a fork, spoon,
and metal and celluloid bottle closures were also collected from Feature 16.
Glass and ceramic items are the most useful for understanding the age and
consumption patterns of the occupants of Lot 6 and in providing inferences on
the social processes behind the construction of the pit.
The glass appears to span a period of time from the late nineteenth century
through the 1920’s. The total counts from the feature are 630 shards of clear
glass, 59 of manganese bleached, 115 of aqua, 13 selenium bleached, 21
green/dark green, 60 brown/amber, one light pink, one cobalt and 59 pieces of
carnival glass. The temporal indicators come from the bottles or fragments that
have maker’s marks or other diagnostic information. For example two clear
ketchup bottles were recovered that bore the brand name of Curtice Brothers
Co. Preservers, Rochester, NY (Figure 7-16). The Curtice Brothers Company was
established in the 1860’s, but the Berney Bond Glass Co. (B&B Co.) maker’s
mark on the complete bottle dates the artifact to the period between 1905-1930
(Myinsulators.com 2007). A complete brown liquor or beer bottle with a sloping
collar finish and mold seams that extend midway up the bottle neck indicating
use of a lipping tool was recovered. The base of the bottle has the maker’s mark
“SB & G Co.” on it. This stands for the Streator Bottle and Glass Company, who
manufactured bottles between 1881 and 1905 before merging with the Adolphus
Busch Company in 1905 (Soda Traderz 2005), dates entirely consistent with the
manufacturing method. More evidence for nineteenth or early twentieth century
artifacts is present in the form of general technological applications. In terms of
glass, manganese bleaching, which accounts for the purple color of many
originally clear bottles, was no longer in use by the end of World War I in the

United States. As noted above, 59 of the glass artifacts have a purpled color
indicative of manganese bleaching. A number of the bottles also have mold
seams that do not cross the lip, indicating that they were not produced in the
automatic bottling machines introduced in 1906 that became the primary
means of manufacturing glass bottles. Other bottles do however bear the seam
over lip indicating manufacture after 1906.

Brothers ketchup bottles (Bags 78-5, 67-7).

In terms of the types of products represented by the glass, from the sufficiently
complete samples a significant component are condiment jars – such as
ketchup, mustard – and storage jars typically associated with prepackaged
cured vegetables such as pickles or olives. Other identifiable bottle types were
wine bottles, beer bottles, and bottles for spices or flavoring extracts.
The ceramic data is more complex and similarly represents a generally broad
temporal range, likely reflecting the tendency for households to collect ceramics
through generations. In total there were 440 pieces of ceramic representing
undecorated and decorated whitewares, porcelain, yellowware, and stoneware.
Decorations and decorative modes within the assemblage are diverse, with at
least 21 different patterns represented, including transfer patterns, handpainted, and decal overglaze applications. In general the vessel forms are
individual serving dishes – plates, cups, bowls – with some more elaborate
serving dishes present. Interestingly, there is a broad array of patterns
represented in blue (including flow blue) or green and red, many of them very
close in style, that taken together suggest that the ceramics were acquired
piecemeal as opposed to in large sets (Figures 7-17 to 7-20). Among the
collected pieces are seven pieces of salt glazed stoneware including a nearly
intact jug (Figure 7-21). Five other pieces of stone ware could be identified as
Rhennish, belonging to a container with a fitting lid.

Maker’s marks and patterns were identified in the collection that provide some
measure of temporal placement. For example, seven fragments of plain
whiteware plates were marked with a Shenango Pottery Company from New
Castle Pennsylvania stamp that can situate the period of manufacture between
1906-1936 (Lehner 1988: 419-420). Another three fragments of whiteware
contained a partial maker’s mark sufficient to identify the manufacturer as
Grindley and to situate the time frame between 1880-1914 (Lehner 1988: 215).
Another three sherds of plain whiteware were found with a “HOMER LAUGHLIN,
THE ANGELUS” stamp that can be dated to 1909 (Gates & Ormerod 1982: 134
cited in Tennis 1997: 32). Red transfer printed whiteware was found with a
“PORCELAIN ROYALE” stamp that indicates it was manufactured by the W. E.
Corn company in England circa 1900 (Kowalsky & Kowlasky 1999: 164).
Another undecorated plate sherd of whiteware was found bearing the maker’s
mark of “SEVRES”, a company producing ceramics in Liverpool, Ohio with this
mark from 1900-1912 (Lehner 1988: 415). Fragments of a light and dark green
transfer printed French porcelain were recovered, some marked with a Haviland
stamp on the base that situates the period of manufacture between 1893-1930
(antique-china-porcelain-collectibles.com). It is very similar to a more complete
Haviland mark identified on another plate fragment which reads “Haviland,
France, Haviland & Co, Limoges” dating to the same late 1890’s to 1930’s period
(see Table 2 in Appendix A).
Related to kitchen items are the dietary patterns of the inhabitants revealed by
the bone and shell materials left in the pit. It consisted of 415 pieces of bone
with 18 pieces of mostly oyster shell.
Other elements of the residential occupation reflected in the artifacts reveal
information on the household items, fuels, and more personal spheres including
clothing, personal adornment, medical, grooming, recreation, education, and
tobacco use. One hundred and ninety-four artifacts were recovered that

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

124

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

appeared functionally related to the physical environment of home. The most
common were very thin curved shards of glass (n=126) from glass lamp shades,
chimneys or covers, which may have been associated with electrical or gas
lighting devices. Given the potentially earlier date of occupation of this lot, it is
worth noting that lamp chimney glass from kerosene lanterns is particularly
prevalent and may indicate that electricity was not initially available to the
Spillmans. Several of the shards are colored, molded or textured for decoration.
Four are glass pendent pieces possibly from a chandelier or similar type lighting
fixture. Additionally, three more artifacts were believed to be pieces of broken
lighting fixtures or lamps including a probable switch, porcelain body fragment
and a piece of plastic of uncertain function. Fourteen fragments of ceramic
(n=3) and glass (n=11) items which appeared decorative as opposed to functional
were recognized in the collection. Among them were molded pieces of glass that
may be pieces of vases or candy dishes. Though it is not certain whether they
would have been in the house, or more likely outside, 42 pieces of pottery were
identified as flower pot fragments. Additional artifacts including a small hinge
from a piece of furniture, two metal furniture legs, a porcelain knob or button,
and a metal latch and hanger were all recovered.
The pit feature yielded 61 pieces of coal or clinkers, suggesting that coal burning
stoves or heaters were being used in the house.
Several clothing items were recovered from the pit. The most common were 32
pieces of a shoe or more likely soles. In addition 17 buttons were found (5 shell,
1 plastic, 6 glass, 5 porcelain), six metal fasteners – perhaps for overalls, four
belt buckles or fragments, and one safety pin. Several items were recovered that
may have been personal adornment items. These include three beads (2 glass, 1
ceramic), two pieces of what appears to be a bracelet of metal and synthetic
material, two pieces of a plastic barrette, watch parts, and ten pieces of the
frame and clasp of a small purse. A piece of lead framing was also found that
may have been from a similar purse or other item.
Medical and grooming habits are revealed by a series of artifacts. Items clearly
related to grooming included two different toothbrush parts. One is a celluloid
body with no markings, and the second is broken bone tooth brush handle and
head. The handle has the words “ENGLAND, Dr. T. McGork, Calv” incised in the
surface. Another likely grooming item is a square brown glass bottle with the
neck broken off, that resembles a hair tonic or shampoo bottle (Figure 7-22).
This specimen has a maker’s mark of “WT & Co.” embossed on the base
identifying the bottle manufacturer as the Whitall Tatum Company, which
utilized this form of mark from 1857 until 1901 (Lockhart et al 2006). The first
date is far too old for the bottle, but the final date does set a maximum age of
manufacture. The other grooming related items are seven fragments of small
milk glass jars, presumably once holding crèmes or salves. A complete clear
glass bottle is typical of an oval shoe polish bottle (Putnam 1965:64). Closely
related functionally are items categorized as medical in use. All the medical
items comprise a collection of 50 glass bottles and fragments of various sorts.
The majority were classified as medical based on their finish type or the bottle
shape and embossing. For example prescription finishes were common
accounting for 11 of the finishes. Others are graduated with measures embossed
on the side. Several were categorized based on the presence of identifying marks
on the body of the bottle. Seven are clear glass bottles or fragments that
contained Vaseline and bear the “CHESEBROUGH MFG CO” mark embossed on
the side. Three are Bromo-Seltzer bottles sold by the Emerson Drug Company,
in Baltimore, MD. Both of these companies sold nationally, as did the other

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

bottle with product information, an aqua union-oval shaped bottle with a
reinforced bead finish applied with a lipping tool that had “POND’S EXTRACT”
embossed on the side panel. Based on the finish treatment the bottle appears to
date to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. One of the more
interesting bottles is a clear blake variant bottle with a lipping tool applied finish
embossed with the HOENKE’S PHARMACY name on the side panel. Hoenke’s
Pharmacy was a local Houston business, and this bottle is the only pharmacy
bottle recovered during the project that could be linked to a particular local
establishment (Houston city directory 1915). Like the glass assemblage
associated with the kitchen, the glass medical bottles are representative of a
wide range of time stretching from the late 1800’s through the 1920’s based on
the presence of various glass bleaching technologies (manganese, selenium, and
arsenic bleaching) and the different finish types (hand lipping tool and
automatic bottle machine). Unfortunately only a limited number provide clear
indication as to their contents, the remainder no doubt having contained a wide
variety of elixirs, lotions, or medicines. One interesting object collected was
melted rubber tubing and very fragmentary pieces of a rubber bag, which
investigators believe to be part of an enema apparatus.

Other functional categories recovered in Feature 16 that are only lightly
represented include arms for which a single shell was recovered, but which was
too damaged to determine caliber or brand. Recreational items included a single
black checker, found in the upper portion of the feature and possibly out of
context, 15 sherds of a porcelain doll one of which is labeled partially with the
name Germany, and four marbles – two glass, one ceramic shooter and a
Bennington marble. Evidence of activities broadly construed as functionally
associated with education/communication were represented by 31 fragments of

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

126

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

a slate (possibly one specimen). The other educational item was a pencil, but
this may not be associated with the pit as it would found in the top of the
feature and looks relatively modern. Finally, tobacco use was suggested by the
recovery of four fragments of a likely snuff bottle.
A final group of recognized functional categories represented in the feature were
tools, economic, and transportation. A single 1935 penny was recovered at the
top of the feature and which may be out of place. Tools were most clearly
represented by a small saw blade and a file. Other tools, or artifacts assumed to
have likely functioned as tools, included a possible tub handle, a water spigot,
bolts and several other metal and plastic artifacts that had characteristics
similar to tools. Several artifacts are related to transportion, which may have
some significance with respect to Walker Spillman’s profession as an express
driver. These include two horseshoes, a harness buckle, hitch, and two other
artifacts of uncertain function that all appear related to wagons or carriages.
Also recovered were two possible spark plugs (Figure 7-23).

E) Hitch part (Bag 67-9); F) Horseshoe (Bag 83-1).

There were a number of artifacts labeled as miscellaneous or simply unknown.
For the most part these artifacts consisted of pieces of deteriorating metal. Metal
was common in the pit feature and appears to have been deposited in bulk in
the pit, possibly even lining the bottom. Much of it is simply corroded blobs,
others are likely tool fragments and possibly parts of machines or carriages, but
simply too deteriorated to distinguish. Other pieces of plastic and occasional
glass and ceramic were also present. None could be securely identified as to
functional class or item.
One aspect of the collection not yet discussed but pertinent to an understanding
of the feature is that many of the artifacts were burned. Though burning is not
complete across the collection, many of the ceramics and glass displayed
discoloration typical of burning and a piece of architectural wood was definitely

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

127

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

burned. The rubber tubing was also clearly melted, implying that once
deposited, the materials were at least nominally burned, perhaps to get rid of
more perishable garbage, or to reduce the size.

TEST UNITS ON BLOCK 4 (41HR1012)
Lot 5- The Richardson Family
Two 2x1 meter test units (Test Units 8 & 9) were placed on Block 4, Lot 5 in
what appeared to be a heavy artifact concentration (Feature 37) and near to a
brick foundation feature (Feature 38, Figure 7-24). A third test unit, Test Unit
10 was placed adjacent to Test Units 8 and 9, however, it was not excavated.
Lot 5 contained a house, built around 1908, that was owned by the Richardson
family (Figure 7-25). Richardson purchased the lot for his house in December
of 1905 (HCDR 184/22). Sanborn maps depict the house on the 1907 map.
However, based on tax records that show a jump in value between 1908 and
1909 it can be inferred that the house may not have been completed until
around 1908. In 1910 Louis Richardson (40) worked as a laborer in a grain
house with his son Willie (18). A second son, Larkie (20) worked in a rice mill.
Louis’ wife Annie (37), stayed home with her other three children, Louis Jr. (13),
Maud (17), and Claudia (3). In 1920 Louis gave his profession as “preacher” in a
church; though he apparently did not preach at any of the nearby Churches,
according to the 1915 and 1922 city directories (Houston city directory 1915,
1922). In 1920, the only child that remained at home was Claudia. Louis’
mother Anita, a midwife, lived with the family, as well as Louis’ brother
Berryman (US census 1920). Louis and Annie lived together on this lot through
most of the 1920s. However, the 1930 census indicates that a divorced woman
named Annie Richards lived on the lot during that date. It is possible that she is
the wife of Louis Richardson, and that the difference in the names is a
transcription error on the part of the census taker. She sold the property to
Claude (possibly daughter Claudia?) M. Davis in 1935. A comparison of the
photographs and footprint plans for the most recent structure on Lot 5 with the
1907 Sanborn maps indicates that the most recent structure was not the
Richardson’s original dwelling.
Test Units 8 and 9 were placed in what first appeared to be a shallow trash pit
(Feature 37) located at the eastern edge of the lot. Test Units 8 and 9 were
adjacent to each other and oriented east-west. A third test unit (Test Unit 10)
was placed along a north-south axis to the west of Test Units 8 and 9. This unit
was not excavated, however. Test Units 8 and 9 revealed that what was initially
interpreted as being a pit (Feature 37), but may in fact have been an artifact
scatter associated with a living/demolition surface that pre-dates the most
recent structure located on that lot and also pre-dates the installation of certain
wastewater infrastructure. Test Units 8 and 9 both revealed a 6-inch ridged
concrete pipe running north-south through the eastern edge of the test unit at
an elevation of 99.8847-99.7597. A 1.5 inch cast iron water line was located
approximately 18 centimeters above this (100.0597). Test Unit 8 also contained
a concrete foundation in the southeast corner, attesting to the lot’s
redevelopment following the original construction (Figure 7-26). The trash
scatter, as observed in the profiles of both Test Units 8 and 9, is a thin 5-10
centimeter lens (elevation 99.9547-99.8547) of brick fragments with a very high
density of bone and cultural debris buried under approximately 20 centimeters
of modern overburden. Cultural debris was also noted around and just below
the wastewater pipe, and is no doubt associated with excavation of the pipe

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

trench. Most of the material in the cultural lens appears to date to the pre-1940
period. The upper levels of both units showed some intrusion of plastic, metal
and glass artifacts of more recent vintage such as a screen printed “Joya” soda
bottle and a 1977 penny. Sterile gray brown clay lay below the cultural lens and
both test units were terminated at a depth of 43 centimeters below the unit
datum (99.7547).
Figure 7-24

Plan View of Trench 33 Showing Test Units 8-11

In total 4,675 artifacts were collected from Test Units 8 and 9. These artifacts
represent a diverse array of artifacts and architectural debris. Overall,
architectural debris is the most common class of artifact recovered (n=1806),
followed fairly closely by faunal remains (n=1304) and kitchen material (n=1104)
(Table 7-11, 7-12). Compared to other test units excavated across the site, the
amount of faunal material recovered in Test Units 8 and 9 was notable for its
prevalence, suggesting that the units may have encountered an area of bone and
kitchen refuse located in the rear of the Richardson house. The high number of
materials functionally related to the kitchen and the recovery of coal and
clinkers tentatively support this assumption.

As previously stated, artifacts functionally related to the architecture that
existed on the site are abundant in Test Units 8 and 9. Unlike other contexts
where nails predominate, window pane was the most common architectural
artifact with 756 shards of varying thicknesses. Pulled wire nails were still
common, numbering 669 specimens, with an additional 6 cut nails. Other
common architectural artifacts included porcelain insulators (n=17), bricks
(n=13), floor tiles, roof tiles (n=7), and a variety of other artifacts such as sewer
pipe, a light base, hinges, construction wood, etcetera. In terms of occurrence,
architectural artifacts spike (as do most other artifact classes) between 100.055­
99.955 meters, though they continue to be present throughout the levels.
Artifacts assigned to the functional category of household/furniture numbered
85, again with a spike between 100.055-99.955 meters. These artifacts are
principally shards of lamp glass (n=64), but includes drawer pulls, hinges,
decorative glass, latches, and four pieces of terra cotta pottery - likely pieces of
flower pots. Notable in terms of the lamp glass is the prevalence of what appears
to be chimney glass from kerosene lamps. Fuel, in the form of coal and clinkers,

was also recovered, particularly from the lower elevations of the units, and
indicates the use of coal powered heating devices within the context of the
household (Figure 7-27).

weight (Bag 12-6); F) Necked cartridge case (Bag 8-9); G) Metal button (Bag 17-4); H) Drawer pull (Bag
10-5).

Other artifacts that would be parts of the household assemblage associated with
the personal activities and needs of the occupants are less common than
observed during the excavation of the tenant house or Spillman units. Only two
artifacts associated with educational or communication activities – a pencil
ferrule and a fragment of slate – were recovered. Jewelry was nearly absent
except for a single plastic bead. The other personal artifacts present in the
sample were three keys. On the other hand, children’s toys remains were typical
of other contexts, with a stoneware shooter and a glass marble recovered, as well
as the hand and head of a porcelain doll. Four pieces of a porcelain children’s
tea set was also recovered. Adult (or possibly children’s) recreational activities
were represented by a lead weight for fishing, a fragment of a harmonica and a
plastic pipe stem. A single copper shell casing marked “centerfire” represents
the arms category. A number of artifacts classified as tools were also recovered,
though the majority are nuts, wire, or bolts, a burned plastic handle of a tool
such as a screwdriver was present.
Clothing remains of the occupants are sparse with only 15 artifacts recovered;
13 of them were buttons. These are primarily of plastic with only two being
made of shell and one of metal. The predominance of plastic buttons over shell
or porcelain in this collection suggests that this assemblage may be somewhat
later than then that of Spillman or tenant house contexts. The remaining
clothing items included a fragment of a cloth belt and a metal snap.
Artifacts associated with the medical and grooming needs of the occupants are
also relatively low in quantity, accounting for 10 and 30 artifacts respectively.

The medical artifacts consisted of 11 glass artifacts and a single plastic enema
syringe (Figure 7-28). The glass artifacts included six shards of brown/amber
glass with portions of embossing that was sufficient to determine that they were
fragments of a Vaseline jar. The other artifacts were all clear glass from two
body shards from different paneled medicine bottles and a neck with a round
prescription finish manufactured using a lipping tool. The artifacts associated
with grooming were primarily fragments of white or light green milk glass
containers (n=25) that may have held lotions or cosmetics. Additional artifacts
included four fragments of a plastic toothbrush with the name “Goody” on it and
a burned plastic comb.

Dietary and kitchen related artifacts were present in substantial numbers.
From a comparative perspective to other excavated test units across the site, the
recovery of 1,304 pieces of faunal material was noteworthy. The collection
included 944 pieces of bone and 328 pieces of shell. Though bone and shell
were regularly recovered in excavation units, Test Units 8 and 9 were the only
contexts where the amount of faunal material exceeded that of most other
artifact categories. The presence of the shell in elevated quantities may in part
be a factor of a possible surface paved with oyster shell observed in nearby Unit
11 in the same trench. Supporting this observation is the prevalence of the
oyster shell in the upper 30 centimeters of excavated deposits where it is more
common than bone, but quickly decreasing in number and in proportion to the
bone with depth. The general elevation range of the elevated shell counts ­
100.285-100.055 meters – is slightly higher but roughly equivalent to the
deposit in Test Unit 11 recorded at 100.236-100.036. The bone, however,
remains distinctively high in occurrence and must reflect refuse disposal
patterns of the residents of the property. Consequently a portion of the shell
may be food refuse as well.

This pattern of onsite trash disposal is also reflected in the large kitchen
assemblage. In total 1,104 artifacts were recovered that were functionally
associated with activities that would have occurred in the context of the kitchen.
By material type these can be divided into 1,026 glass artifacts, 57 ceramic, 11
metal and 10 synthetic. Unlike other artifact classes, glass is most common in
the upper 16 centimeters of the unit (n=468). This upper level contains 326
clear, 111 brown/amber, 27 green, one aqua and one yellow (selenium bleached)
shards of glass. Among the many fragments of glass are soda and wine bottles
such as a Joya bottle made in Mexico, a Coca-Cola bottle of more recent vintage,
a clear bottle with a paper label and two green wine bottles, one of which bears
the name of the Gallo Wine Company. In general the oldest glass artifacts from
the upper level do not appear to predate World War I as there is a lack of
manganese bleached glass, and one bottle bears an Owens-Illinois makers’ mark
situating its period of manufacture between the years 1932-1943. Another
fragment of a brown bottle reads “eder…or…re”, likely portions of the statement
“Federal law prohibits sale or reuse of this bottle” required on liquor bottles after
prohibition until 1964. Glass recovered from 100.155-100.055 meters was
similar in color patterns and age to those in the uppermost zone with 158 clear,
33 brown/amber, 34 green, and four light blue shards. Once again these were
mostly unidentifiable fragments with some identified as soda and wine bottles.
Temporally diagnostic attributes were limited to an Owens-Illinois maker’s mark
on a brown bottle base dating the artifact to the period between 1932-1943 and
a liquor bottle, this time clear, embossed with the words “…rbids sale...”. The
glass from below 100.055 meters in the units – the same general level as the
possible shell paving - appears to include shards that are older in date though
still mixed with glass from the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. This includes 16 shards of
manganese bleached glass that predates World War I. Other glass colors
include 16 brown/amber, 253 clear, 13 aqua, five green, 13 light blue and two
blue-green shards. These last two shards of blue-green glass have a Japanese
looking design showing a man with a whip. In general the type of vessel could
not be clearly identified from the fragmented remains, though a piece of drinking
glass and a glass stopper were among the specimens. The other notable
artifacts were three shards of a brown oval bottle with an elaborate embossed
design on the body of what appears to be wheat. Also visible were the words
“Bros”, “onnie”, and sville KY”, this last probably denoting Louisville, Kentucky
as the location of the product’s manufacturer. Overall the bottle has the look of
a liquor bottle.
The ceramic sample from the units was not nearly as robust, consisting of only
57 artifacts, most (n=50) found between an elevation of 100.055-99.955 (n=50).
Interestingly, this small sample contained a large percentage of decorated sherds
including 24 pieces of whiteware with transfer decoration (including two with
flow blue transfer decoration), one whiteware with decal, one whiteware with
green sponge, a piece of English majolica, one fragment of a ceramic with a
Bennington style glaze and an unknown thin sherd with thick glaze on both
sides (Figure 7-29). In addition six pieces of stoneware were recovered with salt
glaze decoration, and undecorated piece of yellowware and 22 pieces of
undecorated whiteware. Eighteen of the transfer printed whitewares are of the
same plate that has a green design and a partial maker’s mark that can only be
read to say “made”. Interestingly, none of the ceramics were of porcelain. In
general, the fragments are of plates and saucers.

The other kitchen related artifacts consisted of 11 artifacts of metal including
closures and eating utensils and a complete 12-ounce Lite Beer can with a pop
top of obviously recent vintage (it was located in the upper 16 centimeters in the
zone of greatest disturbance). Additionally, nine pieces of a single plastic
container and a plastic wrapper were recovered as well.
Finally, 247 artifacts of various types of materials were recovered throughout the
course of the excavations that could not be clearly identified. As a result these
artifacts were classified within the functional category scheme as miscellaneous.
Descriptions are provided in the appendix.
Lot 4, Test Unit 11
Test Unit 11 was located at the eastern end of Trench 33, approximately four
meters from Test Units 8 and 9. Test Unit 11 was technically on Lot 4, not
owned by the Richardson family. Investigators placed Test Unit 11 on the edge
of Lot 4 around a mid to late twentieth century brick foundation pier (Feature
38), which was one course high. The pier, observed in the first level of the test
unit excavation, consisted of two rows of four bricks laid side by side, held
together with Portland cement. The bricks were fired dark red and were
perforated with four holes each. This test unit revealed an upper stratum of
temporally mixed mid to late twentieth century debris overlying a thin lens of
crushed oyster shells (Figure 7-30). The crushed shell lens formed a layer of
consistent thickness under the brick foundation pier, suggesting that the shell
was laid down to level the surface, prior to construction of the new brick pier, or
after an initial demolition event. It may also have been part of an unpaved
driveway. A thin (ca. 5-10cm) lens of early twentieth century cultural material
including small samples of clear, cobalt blue and brown glass, white ware,
porcelain, coal and metal artifacts underlay the shell. This lens likely relates to
two early twentieth century tenant house that were built on this lot as early as

1905. The debris from these houses and the Richardson occupation occurs
within roughly the same absolute elevation range. The recovery of a single piece
of plastic from the lowest level suggests possible admixing, or could have come
from the walls above. Test Unit 11 was dug in four 10 centimeters levels to a
total depth of 43 centimeters (99.8344) below the unit datum.
Artifact recovery within this unit was much lower than that observed in Test
Units 8 and 9 (Table 7-13). As already discussed, an interesting feature of Test
Unit 11 was a dense layer of shell in Level 2 that appears to be a portion of a
prepared surface, perhaps a walkway or drive. In general terms, the artifacts
from beneath the shell tended to be slightly older in age than those recovered
from above, though disturbance is prevalent across this site and evidenced
within the test unit by plastic sheeting recovered in the lowest excavation level.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

Overall the recovery of artifacts by functional category indicates that the Test
Unit 11 assemblage is not only relatively small compared to some other
excavation contexts – only 580 artifacts were collected, but fairly limited in
variety. The greatest variety of artifacts was encountered in the upper 2 levels
above the shell surface, a zone clearly subject to more disturbance and the
inclusion of more modern materials than in the levels below the shell, or
approximately 101.036 meters.
Architectural artifacts were the second most numerous class of artifact
recovered, totaling 173 items. These artifacts are concentrated in the upper two
levels above the shell and include a variety of artifacts including pulled wire
nails (n=56), various unmarked bricks (n=11), window pane glass (n=11),
ceramic sewer pipe (n=4), metal pipe (n=1), floortile (n=1), screws (n=2), a bolt
(n=1), and sheetrock (n=7). Below the shell layer only pulled wire nails (n=72)
and a single brick fragment were recovered. In terms of the relative ages of the
artifacts associated with the deposit above and below the shell, it is notable that
the upper deposit is not only richer with what is likely demolition debris, but
contains sheetrock which is generally absent from older contexts (but also
present in Test Units 8 and 9). The presence of architectural materials below
the shell may be mainly material associated with earlier phases of site
demolition or represent intrusive elements.
Kitchen (n=130) and dietary (n=194) related artifacts make up the bulk of the
collected artifacts. Oyster shell is especially prominent in the upper two levels,
likely associated at least in part with the shell layer in Level 2, though perhaps a
combination of debris associated with food consumption. Though present in
very low levels, bone is present in all levels, though highest in Levels 2 and 3.
The bone is from a mix of animals typical of foodstuffs such as pig and chicken
(see Appendix B). The non-dietary kitchen related materials are clear (n=85),
brown/amber (n=20) or green (n=9) shards of glass, a small sample of
undecorated whiteware (n=5) and porcelain (n=2), 3 aluminum pull tabs, two
aluminum cans including a Miller beer can, and three metal bottle caps. The
majority of the artifacts were recovered in the upper two levels (93%), the same
levels in which aluminum cans clearly demonstrated the presence of modern
materials. None of the glass or ceramic artifacts had diagnostic features
indicative of manufacture prior to the 1930’s or 1940’s. Of the ceramic artifacts,
six appeared to be sherds from plates and the seventh was not sufficient to
make a determination. Though no clearly modern glass or ceramics were
recovered from below the shell, there is no certain manner in which to date the
time period of these scant remains.
The remaining artifacts recovered were of a variety of functional categories and,
with the exception of fuels, were overwhelming found in the upper two levels.
From the upper two levels these artifacts included a penny (no date discernible),
a single synthetic button, a plastic lid of a glue bottle, a metal figurine wing and
a decorative metal box fragment (both classified as household), a single small
bead, two stereo cables, a glass marble, a piece of film, a plastic washer, and a
sparkplug tester. Many of these articles were clearly modern such the glue
bottle lid and the stereo cables. In addition, 50 artifacts were collected from the
upper two levels, many of them plastics, that were too fragmented to identify
function and were subsequently classified as miscellaneous items.
Nine
miscellaneous artifacts were recovered in the lower two levels which, with the
exception of a piece of plastic sheet suggesting mixing, were of glass or metal.
The only other artifacts from these lower two levels were a plastic handle of a
tool, a metal receipt holder (economic), and nine pieces of coal. These latter nine

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

pieces of coal may indicate the use of coal powered heating devices in the earlier
homes located on this lot. It is worth noting that in this unit and in Test Units 8
and 9, coal or clinkers were all found to be present at the lowest levels in the
highest concentration, likely indicating that coal powered heating devices were
routinely cleaned out in the areas behind the residences during the early periods
of residential occupation.

TEST UNITS ON BLOCK 5 (41HR1013)
Four 2x1 meter test units were placed on Block 5 (Figure 7-31). Test Unit 16
was placed in Trench 27, between Features 24 and 25 on Lot 3; Test Unit 17
was also in Trench 27 and excavated around Feature 21 on Lot 4; Test Units 18
and 20 were excavated on Lot 5 in between the baulk between Trenches 28 and
31. These three lots were all owner-occupied by the Young (Lot 3) and Starks
(Lots 4 and 5) families. Eliza Young and Celia Starks, the family matriarchs,
were both former slaves, born in 1845 and 1850 respectively. They are listed in
tax records as owners in 1908 and in the 1910 census as residents. Their
sprawling families included members from three generations, whose
descendants continued to own the properties through 1950.
According to census records and city directories, in 1910 Eliza Young headed
the household at 1514 Mason Street (Lot 3). She lived with her so Fred (16 or
18), daughter Elizabeth (31) and her son in law Grant Williams (32). Tax records
starting in 1908 suggest that the Young family had already built a house at this
location and had probably been living there since shortly after 1903, which is
the year the lot was purchased (HCDR 153/464). Grant and Fred worked as
laborers. By 1920 Fred Young had married. Fred and Belle Young still lived at
the house with Lizzie and Grant and their daughter Etta (14). Lizzie cooked for a
private family, Belle worked as a chambermaid and Fred worked as a chauffeur
for a private family. By 1930, Fred and Belle divorced. Fred, a World War I
veteran, still lived with Lizzie and Grant.
The Starks family purchased Lot 4 of Block 5 first, building a house on Lot 4
possibly as early as 1902 which is the date when Jones (Jonas) Starks
purchased the vacant lot from Will Powers Jr. and his mother Mery Ruby (HCDR
143/322). Lula Starks (Celia’s daughter) later purchased Lot 5 in 1907 from
investor T.L. Britton who acquired the property from the African American
Easter family, who in 1910, according to census records, rented a home
elsewhere in 4th Ward. It is likely that Easter had attempted to purchase this
property through a bond for title contract from Mary Ruby and Will Powars, but
when she failed to complete payment Britton acquired the property.4 The 1907
Sanborn map does not include this block. City directories and census records
show Celia Starks, a widowed freed slave from Louisiana, as the head of a
household on Lot 4 (Jonas Starks died shortly after purchasing Lot 4) at 1518
Mason Street in 1910. That household included her three unmarried daughters
Pauline, Hattie, and Addie, and two grandsons. Also living with them was
Celia’s recently married daughter Lula Starks White and Mike White. Three

4

Wagner’s 2005 states in the report (page 3-31) that Lula Starks may have purchased the lot through a bond for title
contract from Easter. However, tax records and deed transactions recorded in the appendix of the same report
suggest that Easter may have built a house then forfeited it back to T.L. Britton in 1907. Britton then sold it to the
Starks family. The price of the purchase, $650, suggests a house was already on the lot.

daughters worked as cooks, and Lula worked at a steam laundry. Mike worked
as a laborer in a rice mill.
By 1920 Lula and her husband were living on Lot 5 at 1520 Mason Street with
their three sons James (19), Moses (17), and Rudolph (5), and a daughter Lottie
(9). Mike worked as a fireman with the railroad, James as a porter and Moses
as a chauffeur for private family. Meanwhile, Celia’s two widowed sons, Will (37)
and Edward (28) and a married son Alexander (28) lived at 1518 Mason in 1920.
Will worked as a cabinetmaker, while the two other sons worked as chauffeurs
for private families. Members of the Starks family continued to live and occupy
this property through the late twentieth century.
It is probably not a
coincidence that by 1920 most of the men who lived on Lots 3-5 of Block 5
worked as chauffeurs, and it seems likely that members of the two extended
families actively used these local family networks to secure jobs.
Lot 3, the Young Household
Test Unit 16 in Trench 27 was dug in three levels to a total depth of depth of 40
centimeters below the unit datum (site elevation of 99.8575). Features 24 and
25 (Figure 7-32) located at the southwest and northwest corners of the unit,
respectively were both brick piers approximately 21x12.5 inches (53x31.75cm),
and two courses deep (elevation at base was 100.0575). The two piers are of
identical construction, made with flat faced, red paste brick, forming a rectangle,
arranged with whole bricks joined end to end around the perimeter of the pier
with a single brick and half brick in the center (Figure 7-33). Feature 23, also
on Lot 3 was constructed in the same manner, and was likely part of the same
structure.
Incidentally, Features 18-22 and 26-29 on Lot 4 were also
constructed in the same manner, suggesting that the two structures were built
at the same time. Given the long-term occupation of both families and
discernable employment ties between family members, it may be that the Young
and Starks family had connections prior to their occupation of Block 5. The
original structure on Lot 3 was still standing in 2001—one of the few original
structures in the project area-- though with significant modifications.

Test Unit 16 artifact recovery totaled 1025 items, the majority of which (81%)
were located within Level 1 of the excavations, with very limited recovery in
Levels 2 and 3 (Table 7-14). Throughout the excavation of this unit, artifacts
likely associated with the occupations from the first half of the twentieth century
were found mixed with later and some clearly modern artifacts suggesting that
demolition and rebuilding on the site had comprised the overall integrity of the
deposits. However, notable in this unit was the very large sample of kitchen
related artifacts relative to other functional classes, particularly architecture
which is typically the most common artifact class encountered in excavation
contexts, and which can be interpreted to indicate that this unit sampled a
trash deposit associated with a residence. Evidence for more personal activities
such as grooming, medical, personal, education/communication or recreation
are absent or poorly represented, reinforcing the relatively restricted nature of
the associated residential debris compared for example to that recovered
associated with the Tenant housing on Block 2. This may have something to do
with unit placements, as well. This unit was placed at the front of the house lot,
while the units on Block 2 were placed at the back of the lots.

As previously noted the quantity of architecturally related items (n=290)
recovered from the unit was low relative to those related to the kitchen. The
most common architectural artifacts recovered were window glass (n=132),
pulled wire nails (n=76), tar paper shingles (43), and lumber (n=28). Additional
artifacts included chunks of concrete (n=2), corrugated metal (n=2), a brick, a
porcelain fragment perhaps related to the bathroom installations, a staple and a
screw.
More generalized artifacts associated with the household/furniture included 19
pieces of synthetic twined carpet, four fragments of a mirror, a single piece each
of ornamental glass and lamp shade, and finally two sherds of terracotta pottery
that appear to be fragments of flower pots. Three pieces of coal found in Level 1
may indicate that the residences were heated by coal burning stoves.
Materials functionally related to the kitchen, and to a much lesser degree dietary
items, were common in the upper portions of the unit. Glass was the most
common material type collected in this category, constituting 434 of the kitchen
artifacts, and ceramics accounting for another 13. Glass color types are
primarily clear (n=275), with brown/amber (n=124), green (n=29), yellow
(selenium bleached; n=2), aqua (n=1) and light blue (n=1) rounding out the
collection. Though the two shards of selenium bleached clear glass suggest a
general period of manufacture between the late nineteen teens and the early
1940’s, the majority of the glass is too fragmented to identify either the types of
containers or the manufacturing method and almost all lack diagnostic
attributes. Those few that do possess diagnostic marks date to the period after
1950. The small selection of ceramics are a mixture of whitewares (n=3),
porcelain (n=8) and a sherd of English majolica (n=1). None of the porcelains
were decorated, however one has a portion of a maker’s mark visible that reads
“irabea”. This partial maker’s mark is likely to be from the Mirabeau pattern
produced by Haviland from 1889-1931 (Haviland Online 2007). Two of the
whiteware fragments are decorated, one with a transfer print of a garden type
scene and the other with a brown painted band around the rim of a plate. The
remaining artifacts associated with the kitchen consist of a variety of plastic or
metal artifacts almost all of them plastic wrappers, plastic utensils, straws,
Styrofoam cups, and aluminum cans or pop tops. These latter artifacts are very
recent in age, but are mixed throughout the excavation levels clearly indicating
disturbance. The dietary elements number 40 specimens, with 24 being pieces
of animal bone and 16 pieces of shell.
The other identified artifacts include a number of functional categories including
items associated with the personal habits or activities of individuals. For
example, clothing was represented in the collection by the recovery of three
buttons, two pieces of fabric which based on their preservation are likely to be
very recent, a portion of a pin of some sort, a metal snap and a possible belt or
strap piece made of synthetic fibers. Two plastic beads were the only possible
pieces of jewelry recovered. Education/communication related activities were
indicated by a modern plastic pen cap, four pieces of black chalk, and five pieces
of slate that are likely to be from a writing slate. Recreational activities of both
children and adults are evidenced in the recovery of three glass marbles, a
plastic cowboy figurine, a poker chip and a piece of vinyl long play record. A
filter to a cigarette was recovered from Level 1. Additionally a piece of a parking
brake assembly from a recent model car (transportation), two washers (tools), a
1982 penny and 126 items that could not be positively identified were all
collected during the course of the investigation.

Lot 4, the First Starks Household
Test Unit 17 was dug around Feature 21, also in Trench 27. This test unit was
placed on Lot 4, however, owned by the Starks family. It revealed a stratum of
brick demo debris at an elevation 100.1187. Three stamped bricks, each with a
different maker’s stamp and a variety of unmarked brick types were found
among the brick debris. In the next level below this brick debris, was a zone of
primarily pre-1950s cultural material within a charcoal flecked matrix
(100.1187-100.0187). Artifacts recovered included glass fragments (manganese
bleached bottle, blue bottle, aqua bottle, window, and milk), nails, a horseshoe,
a bullet, a brass band, a writing slate, ceramics, cut animal bone and shell.
However, a few modern items such as one piece of plastic and some lime green
bottle glass were also recovered from this level suggesting that not all of the
artifacts were intact.
Only a portion of Feature 21 was uncovered along the east wall of this test unit.
It appeared to be constructed in the same manner as Features 22-24, with two
courses visible in the wall of the unit and a base elevation of 100.0387. Eight
other brick pier features-- Features 18-20, 22, and 26-29—were also identified
on Lot 4 of Block 5 in Trenches 27 and 32 (Figure 7-34). The Lot 4 piers were
all constructed in the same manner as those features on Lot 3, indicating that
the two structures on Lots 3 and 4 were built at the same time, by the same
builder. The brick pier features form an L-shape, which is consistent with the
plan given on Sanborn maps for the structures on Lots 3 and 4. However, the
Sanborn maps for this block do not fully correspond to the most recent land
divisions, the result of Powars poor surveying, changing land use, and
subsequent lawsuits which probably altered lot boundaries.
One additional feature was found in Trench 27 on Lot 4 that appears to have
been related to the house that once stood on that lot. Feature 39 (Figure 7-35)
was identified as a brick walkway remnant, one course high, constructed of half
and whole scavenged bricks. The walkway was covered with loose brick rubble,
like that observed in Test Unit 17. Investigators removed this rubble within the
trench to uncover Feature 39. Several different stamped bricks were apparent in
the walkway. The different brick types used in the walkway suggest that it was
built after initial construction from bits and pieces salvaged from various
sources. The location of Feature 39, near the northern edge of the structure on
Lot 4, suggests that the walkway led to an entrance, though it may also have
been a side walkway.
The artifacts recovered in Unit 17 indicate that a sheet midden of trash
associated with early through recent twentieth century occupation of the lot is
present. The integrity of the deposits appears to be compromised by the effects
of later twentieth century overprinting. Artifacts from Test Unit 17 were very
limited in number (n=250) and variety, and concentrated in Level 1 (Table 7-15).
Typical of units in this part of the project area, artifacts classified as belonging
to the architectural (n=144), kitchen (n=61) and dietary (n=19) functional
categories dominated the assemblage of recovered artifacts. Additional artifacts
were limited. The architectural items included 82 pulled wire nails, 61 shards of
window glass, three pieces of ceramic floor tile, three bricks or brick fragments,
two shingles and one each of wood screws, bolts, and staples. All the bricks
possess different and at least partially visible maker’s marks (“ROESBECK”,
“…SAP”, “BUT…”. The kitchen related artifacts consisted of glass (n=54),
ceramics (n=5), a plastic wrapper and a tin can fragment. The glass artifacts

included 22 pieces of clear glass, 25 shards of green glass, three shards of
brown/amber, two shards of light blue, and two shards of manganese bleached
(purpled). The manganese bleached shards, one a handle of a beer mug, are
likely to date to a period from the late nineteenth century until approximately
1918. Other temporally diagnostic features only consisted of a single maker’s
mark – a J inside a keystone – that identified the manufacturer as the Knox
Glass Co., from the period between 1932 to at least 1953 (Myinsulators.com
2007). Of the fragments collected two more could be identified as likely
pertaining to a soda bottle and a wine bottle. Of the five ceramics collected, two
are pieces of white porcelain, one of which has a partial maker’s mark on the
base that reads “le china”, but which is insufficient to identify the maker. In
addition, three pieces of undecorated whiteware were collected, two of which are
part of a saucer. The recovered dietary artifacts, themselves part of the larger
general kitchen assemblage, included 13 pieces of bone and six pieces of shell.

transportation (n=1), and 16 artifacts classified as miscellaneous owing to their
fragmented state or poor preservation. The arms category is represented by a
single conical bullet cartridge. The only piece of clothing was a single shell
button. The tentative identification of two pieces of slate as writing implements
establishes
the

with
education/communication. The identification of the grooming and medical
categories are likewise tentative, with grooming represented by three shards of
milk glass presumed to be from a cream or salve jar and a light green ABM
manufactured bottle neck with a rounded prescription finish likely to have been
a container of a medical product. The single personal item is rather interesting
as it is a metal ring (Figure 7-36), probably brass. Unfortunately, the band has
no inscriptions and it is not clear the age or function. The final artifact, a
fragment of a horseshoe, is classified as functionally related to transportation.

Lot 5, the Second Starks Household (Test Units 18 and 20)
Test Units 18 and 20 were excavated on Lot 5, which was also owned by the
Starks family. According to tax maps, Sanborn maps, and census records, a
dwelling was built on this lot in the first decade of the twentieth century.
However, based on a comparison of the 1907 Sanborn map and the 2002
demolition plans, the dwelling that was standing on this lot in 2001 was
probably not the original structure. Archeological excavations of Test Units 18
and 20 bore this out, revealing two generations of structures on the lot. Test
Unit 18 was excavated around a square brick foundation pier feature, Feature
40 (Figure 7-37). The pier was constructed slightly differently from those found
on Lots 3-4, with the bricks forming a 21x21-inch (53x53cm) square rather than
a rectangle, implying that Feature 40 was not part of the same construction
episode that produced the original structures on Lots 3-5. The pier was three
courses deep (base elevation 100.1432); the upper course likely encircled some
sort of post, as it was filled with sandy paste mortar. A number of eroded wood
fragments were found with the matrix nearby.
Notably Feature 40 was placed over a layer of ash and sandy mortar (ca.3-5cm
thick). This ash and mortar layer, exposed in the profiles of Trenches 27, 28,
and 31 (Figure 7-38), extended along the entire length of Lot 5. Excavation of
Test Unit 20, toward the center of Lot 5 revealed that the ash and mortar lens
overlaid a lens of dense brick demolition debris (Feature 41). This lens of brick
debris (Feature 41) likely represents the first dwelling on Lot 5. Feature 40 then
represents a pier foundation from the most recent standing structure, which
was probably built sometime between 1930 and 1950, based on pre-demolition

photographs. The ashy sandy mortar layer strongly resembled incinerated fill
(not uncommonly used as fill in other parts of the city), and may have been laid
down intentionally to level the original demolition surface before the next
building episode took place.
Artifact recovery from both Test Units 18 and 20 revealed that the upper 27-38
centimeters of gray brown silty clay sediment contained post-1950s debris
including plastic, beer bottle screw tops, soda and beer can fragments,
composition shingles and two pennies (1961 and 1974), among various other
artifacts typical of construction and household debris. This more recent material
was, however, found mixed with clearly older materials such as a fragment of a
manganese bleached ball neck patent bottle. Older material was found isolated
within the loose ash and mortar sediment upon which Feature 40 was built.
Investigators found an 1897 nickel, a porcelain button, some cut animal bone,
and a number of nails (both wire and square) within this ashy matrix of Test
Unit 18. Within Test Unit 20, the same matrix contained slate roof tile
fragments, window glass, a brown glass snuff bottle fragment, milk glass, copper
wire, a large rusted hinge (possibly part of a window hinge) and a number of very
rusty wire nails. Even fewer artifacts were recovered from the brick demo layer
(Feature 41, elevation 100.1081) directly underlying the ash and mortar. These
included a few rusted nails, a door hinge, and possible salt glazed brick
fragment. No artifacts were recovered from either test unit below an elevation of
100.0281.

Artifact recovery from Test Unit 18
One thousand eight hundred and fourteen artifacts were recovered during the
course of excavation of Test Unit 18 (Table 7-16). The artifacts reflect the both
the residential nature of the occupation and the different phases of building that
occurred. Artifacts span the period from the early twentieth century when the
first residential structures were built through 2002 when a second group of
buildings constructed during the 1940’s was demolished. In light of the
construction history of the block and based on the stratigraphy of the unit
observed during excavation, the artifact discussion will distinguish between
artifacts collected in Levels 1-3 and those from Levels 4-5 though some mixing of
older and newer materials is evident, especially in the upper levels. This level
distinction is mirrored in the artifact recovery by small spike in the total artifact

recovery by level in Level 4 which is mostly a factor of increased architectural
artifacts recovered that likely pertain to the demolition of earlier structures on
the lot.

The artifacts recovered in the upper three levels included 555 items classified as
functionally related to architecture, the majority of which are window glass
(n=284) or pulled wire nails (n=134). The remaining architecture artifacts
collected and sent to the lab included bricks (n=3), porcelain fragments probably
related to bathroom fixtures (n=5), plate glass shards (n=6), concrete (n=5),
lumber (n=11), sewer pipe fragments (n=4), composite tar shingles (n=95), corner
molding (n=5), linoleum tile (n=2) and a screw. Additional brick and concrete
artifacts were identified during the excavation of the Levels 1-3, but these were
described in the field and not sent to the lab.
In general, artifacts associated with household decoration or furniture were not
well represented in the upper three levels. The 36 artifacts of this category
consisted in part of 19 pieces of lamp glass, a piece of non-kitchen related
porcelain and a key broken into two pieces. Of more interest was the recovery of
14 pieces of terra cotta and whiteware pottery that likely represent flower pots
used as either indoor or exterior decoration. The whiteware example has hand
stenciled decoration with images of six pointed stars and leaves within a banded
rim executed in brown, gold, dark green and light green. Three pieces of coal
were also collected that may have been used as fuel for interior heating devices.
Clothing was not well represented in the collection except for the recovery of 13
buttons (9 shell, 1 glass, 2 ceramic, 1 metal), 2 brass grommets and a metal belt
buckle. Personal adornments were also sparse but consisted of an interesting
set of items all recovered in Level 3. These included a cylindrical ceramic bead
and a beaded key chain fob, but more interestingly a black (possibly enameled)
filigree ornament of uncertain use and a ring with an empty stone setting that
had the word “NEMCO” stamped in the interior of the band. Though research
has not been able to clarify who were the producers of rings stamped “NEMCO”,
several pieces available for sale are all 1920’s and 1930’s art deco rings that,
while distinct from example collected in this unit, are likely of similar age and
vintage. Grooming related artifacts were not well represented in the collection
either, consisting only of five shards of milk glass that are presumed to

represent fragments of cold crème or salve jars. Medical related items were also
low in number (n=4) and consisted of three cobalt blue glass shards belonging to
a small exterior threaded medicine bottle and a single neck and finish of a
manganese bleached ball-neck patent medicine bottle manufactured with a
lipping tool. This artifact is interesting in likely having been manufactured
around the turn of the twentieth century, and being considerably older than
many of the other artifacts in the upper levels, suggesting that the deposits in
this portion of the site clearly had early twentieth century occupation though
they have been seriously impacted by subsequent demolition and reconstruction
of the lot.
Artifacts related to possible activities engaged in by the inhabitants include a
single bullet casing marked “W.R.A. Co 38 WC F”, indicating this is a .38 caliber
bullet was manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Tools
included three nuts, a spring, a washer, a wire, a machine bolt, and a screw that
terminates in an eyehole. Education/communication type activities were hinted
at by the recovery of a paperclip broken into two pieces. Artifacts with an
economic function, in this case four pennies found distributed throughout
Levels 1 and 2, are stratigraphically reversed relative to their dates. In Level 1
the two pennies were marked 1938 and 1957, while in Level 2 the two pennies
are marked 1961 and 1974.
The last two categories of functionally identifiable artifacts present in Levels 1-3
are dietary (n=49) and kitchen. Dietary remains were limited in terms of
quantity and consisted of 34 pieces of animal bone, 14 pieces of shell, and a
single seed. Kitchen remains were overwhelming glass (n=375) or ceramic (n=41)
artifacts, though a number of metal artifacts particularly aluminum cans, metal
closures, plastic wrappers and a six pack ring were clearly modern or very
recent in age indicating mixing of different components. These more recent
artifacts were found mixed throughout the levels. The glass assemblage was
composed of 265 clear, 33 green, 56 brown, 11 manganese bleached, and 10
aqua colored shards, the majority of which were too fragmented to record data
pertaining to vessel form or manufacturing method. Nonetheless, with the
exception of the 11 shards of manganese bleached glass the glass assemblage is
probably mostly from the 1930’s through the present day. Partial confirmation
of this can be ascertained from the only marked glass artifact from these levels,
a small fragment of clear glass with the partial word “FEDE” marked on it. This
mark likely is a portion of an embossed labeled indicating that “FEDERAL LAW
PROHIBITS”…” a phrase required of liquor bottles following the end of the
Prohibition period. The ceramic assemblage is quite varied including porcelains
(n=14), whitewares (n=24), yellowwares (n=2) and stonewares (n=1), nine of
which are decorated. The decoration of the whitewares ranges from full deep
colored glazes that appear relatively modern (n=2), to transfer print (n=1) and
decal decoration (n=2), to what appears to be handpainted designs (n=2). The
sherds of porcelain, from plate, cup and saucer fragments, included an example
with a transfer print designs of what appears to be a Japanese garden scene
executed in blue, one plate with a brown banded rim, and another with a decal
design in yellow, green and red (Figure 7-39). Unfortunately none of the pieces
contained identifiable maker’s marks.

Finally, 41 miscellaneous items of ceramic, metal, plastic, and composite
materials rounded out the artifact recovery in Levels 1-3. These artifacts were
simply too fragmented or deteriorated to confidently assign to functional
categories.
The artifact recovery from Levels 4-5 totaled 605 artifacts, though the majority –
83% were recovered in Level 4. Again architectural artifacts were the
predominant functional category. The variety of materials was less than the
upper levels, with pulled wire nails predominate (n=306), followed by window
glass (n=20), shingles (n=15), and single examples of caulk, molding and wire.
Notable for its presence in these lower deposits are cut square nails (n=9) which
were absent from the upper deposits and possibly an indication of the older
nature of the deposit. Household/furniture items were again limited in number
(n=9) with only lamp glass being recovered. No evidence of fuel materials was
found in these levels.
Likewise personal type items were only sparsely represented with the recovery of
three porcelain buttons (clothing), a melted harmonica part (recreation), and a
washer (tool). An 1897 Liberty Nickel found in Level 4 were notably much earlier
than the coins found in Levels 1-3.
Aside from the 80 artifacts that were too deteriorated or fragmented to positively
identify, kitchen and dietary artifacts were the only other functional category to
be represented by significant collections. The dietary recovery was in fact fairly
small with only 6 pieces of animal bone and two pieces of shell recovered. The
kitchen material was more significant with 30 pieces of glass and three pieces of
ceramic. The glass included 18 clear fragments, two green, two manganese
bleached and eight brown. Again as was the case with the material in the upper
levels, no identifiable maker’s marks were found and the material was very
fragmented making identification of bottle type or manufacturing difficult with
the exception of the manganese bleached glass relatively datable to the late
nineteenth or early twentieth century. In addition to the glass and ceramic, six

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

pieces of plastic wrapper (including a Corn Chips bag) were found in Level 4 that
are clearly modern and indicate at least minimal mixing of the deposits.
Artifacts from Test Unit 20
Similar to Test Unit 18, a distinct break was observed in the stratigraphy of Test
Unit 20 below Level 2. Overall artifact recovery was much lower in this unit 1005 artifacts were recovered during the excavation, 89% from Level 1 above the
break, but the artifacts do not appear to indicate a better preserved earlier
deposit in this unit (Table 7-17). In Unit 20 this lowest level was filled with
bricks and only a few artifacts that included nine pulled wire nails and a slab of
miscellaneous metal.

Artifacts from Levels 1 and 2 consisted of primarily kitchen related glass
artifacts (n=229) and ceramics (n=64). Clear glass was the most common, with
137 specimens, the majority of which are tiny fragments of containers. Only
one, a blake shaped base, had a marker’s mark – an I in a triangle – that
identifies the maker as Owens-Illinois and situates the period of production
between 1929 and 1954 (Lockhart 2004). None of the 36 brown/amber or 17
green pieces of glass were helpful in determining the date of the deposit, though
several dark green pieces of glass are likely wine bottle fragments. Also of note
was a single fragment of a green glass plate. Among the collection of aqua
colored glass (n=28) the recovery of a blob top finish likely indicates an late
nineteenth or early twentieth century date of manufacture and suggests this
artifact is part of the early phase of occupation. Similarly the manganese
bleached glass (n=11) can provide a relative temporal frame of reference between
1880 and 1918 for production indicating the presence of early materials. The
ceramic assemblage from the same levels is relatively varied with both plain and
decorated whitewares (n= 45) and porcelain (n=3), as well as a sherd of
yellowware and several unknown ceramic (n=15) sherd types (Figure 7-39). As
was the case in Test Unit 18, no examples were found that had maker’s marks,
and though yellowwares generally date to the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, it is difficult to fix the time of production for these wares. In fact at
least one of the “unknown” ceramics is likely a fragment of a green Fiesta-ware
plate, meaning the date of production is relatively late beginning in the 1940’s
and continuing into the early 1970’s.
Among the whitewares 41 are
undecorated, and two have an appliqué gold band on the rim, a third has a blue
field on one side and the other is a piece of a saucer that has a red, black, green
and blue decal floral design with a gold appliqué band on the rim. Interestingly,
a porcelain sherd was also recovered with a nearly identical design and
appliqué, suggesting that they were purchased independently in order to match.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

Another very small fragment of porcelain with a transfer printed green, dark
green, and blue design with a gold band and may have been a part of the same
general set. The final porcelain sherd is undecorated. It is worth considering
that the prevalence of ceramic sherds in this unit with gold bands may reflect a
conscious choice on the part of past residences to collect pieces decorated in
this fashion. Other pottery of note included five ceramic sherds of unknown
type that are parts of a tea pot with molding and hand painted decoration. The
other kitchen related artifacts were two metal pop tops of recent origin and an
aluminum tin can fragment. In addition, dietary debris consisting of 47 pieces of
bone and seven shells was recovered that are likely remains of food consumed
within the households. In general then, the kitchen assemblage suggests that
debris associated with the functioning of residential households had been
accumulating in this portion of the project area since the early twentieth
century, but that these deposits are mixed with more recent occupations.
Other artifacts recovered included 17 artifacts classified as household/furniture.
These consisted of 12 pieces of lamp glass, two glass beads that are likely
chandelier or lampshade decorative elements, a fragment of an ornamental glass
vase and once again more terracotta pottery sherds (n=2) from a flower pot. Two
pieces of coal and 11 clinkers provide more evidence of the use of coal powered
heating devices in the homes.
A variety of items of personal adornment or indicative of people’s activities were
recovered. These included five shell and two ceramic buttons and a metal
eyelet, all artifacts likely to be from clothing. A ceramic bead may also be a
clothing adornment or a piece of personal jewelry. Four shards of milk glass
and a single piece of cobalt blue glass are the only tenuous remnants of the use
of grooming or medical products. The recreational activities of children are in
evidence by the recovery of a single glass marble and a jack. A shotgun shell cap
was found in this unit as well. An electrical connector, a metal knob and a
metal ring were all interpreted as relating functionally to tools used by the
residences. A metal artifact that resembles a battery connector terminal was
classified as a transportation related artifact. The recovery of 41 pieces of slate
may be a possible indicator of the use of slates in education/communication
contexts, or alternately these may be pieces of slate roof tiles; unfortunately they
are too damaged to positively determine their functional application. Another
314 artifacts were collected that could not be identified or assigned to functional
categories based on their condition.
Objects more definitely used as elements in architectural constructions were of
course commonly recovered in Level 1 and 2 during the excavation of the test
unit, and are reminders of the disturbed nature of the deposit as a consequence
of demolition over the course of the site history. These artifacts are primarily
window glass (n=72) and pulled wire nails (n=40), though it is interesting that
only in the upper level were cut nails recovered. Nine cut nails were collected in
total. Other architectural artifacts included sewer pipe (n=1), shingles (n=12),
metal water pipe (n=1), copper wire (n=5), lumber (n=2), a staple (n=1), and three
brick fragments. These fragments do not constitute all of the brick recorded in
the unit. One fragment is marked as a Ferris brick, which were produced in
Ferris, Texas by the twentieth century and were a major industry there and are
commonly found in Texas sites (Texas State Historical Association 2006).

TEST UNITS IN ALDEN PLACE (41HR1008)
Two additional 1x1 meter units were placed in two possible trash pit areas in
Trench 41 in Alden Place (Figure 7-40). Test Unit 12 was placed so that it
bisected Feature 33, initially thought to be a trash pit filled with mid-century
debris. Test Unit 13 was placed near the southeast corner of Test Unit 12 so
that it bisected another trash pit or possible privy, Feature 31. Excavation of
both units, however, revealed them to be less than feature-like. Feature 33 was
simply a thin pocket of loose matrix with a slightly different texture from the
surrounding dark gray brown clay. Feature 31 was simply a thin pocket of
crushed shell that appears to have been deposited erratically throughout Trench
41. Artifacts from these units, including the features, consisted of mainly
rusted metal and nails, brick fragments, mid-century tile fragments, cut animal
bone and various small broken fragments of glass and ceramic, most of which
was temporally non-diagnostic or post date 1950. Test Unit 12 was dug in five
levels to a total depth of 64 centimeters below unit datum (99.9838), while Test
Unit 13 was dug in five levels also to a depth of 64 centimeters below the unit
datum (100.0053). The base of both units was culturally sterile.

Chapter 7 – Results of Field Investigations – Test Units

Artifact recovery from the five levels of Test Unit 12 was limited to 115 artifacts
(Table 7-18).
The majority of the artifacts are related functionally to
architectural elements and consist of a mix of materials including bricks (n=11),
dry wall fragments (n=7), pulled wire nails (n=43), ceramic pipe (n=1), asbestos
tile (n=13), mortar (n=2), and concrete (n=2). These materials were found
throughout Levels 1 through 4, but were absent from the last level. The
remaining artifacts were limited in number and from a small range of functional
categories. Ten artifacts were associated with the kitchen. These included
seven pieces of glass (2 clear, 3 brown/amber, 1 aqua, 1 yellow) and two pieces
of undecorated whiteware. Though none of the pieces bore diagnostic markings,
the one yellowed shard of glass is likely selenium bleached and relatively datable
to the period between World War I and World War II. Closely associated with the
kitchen material are the 14 pieces of dietary materials that consisted of nine
pieces of bone and five shell, probably oyster, fragments. Items associated with
the household or furniture consisted of five pieces of probable lampshade glass
and a piece of coal that may have been associated with heating. Items reflecting
the personal activities of the occupants included the heel of a shoe and the rim
fragment of an amber colored snuff bottle.

From Test Unit 13, 198 artifacts were recovered from five excavation levels
(Table 7-19). In general the material appears to be architecturally related
artifacts (n=87) mixed with a low density of materials associated with primarily
mid twentieth century residential occupations of the site (Figure 7-41). As was
the case with the artifact assemblage from Test Unit 12, the architectural
material included a variety of artifacts including sheetrock (n=7), concrete (n=2),
brick fragments (n=10), sewer pipe (n=2), wire (n=2), a tack (n=1), window pane
(n=13) and above all else pulled wire nails (n=31). These artifacts were most
concentrated in the upper three levels and decreased significantly in the lower
two levels consistent with decreasing artifact recovery across other artifact
categories by level. The only other significant quantity of artifacts recovered was
functionally related to the kitchen and dietary patterns. Kitchen related
artifacts were, with the exception of a single sherd of a decal decorated
whiteware plate, represented by non-diagnostic glass shards (n=39). By glass
color these could be broken down into 23 clear specimens, 12 brown/amber,

and four green. None of these pieces were sufficiently intact to determine
manufacture method or exact bottle type, and none had writing or maker’s
marks. Nonetheless, the general colors and condition of the glass suggest that
on the whole the bottles were produced after the 1930’s and possibly quite
recently. The dietary artifacts were primarily small pieces of shell (n=17) and
four pieces of bone. Other identifiable recovered artifacts included a money clip,
a bullet casing, three tools (2 washers and a bracket), a hook and furniture foam
stuffing, a shell bead, a fragment of a clear graduated bottle, a ceramic marble,
and a fragment of a brown glass snuff bottle similar to that observed in Test
Unit 12. Thirty-nine other artifacts were collected that were too fragmented or
deteriorated to assign to a functional category or identify what they were. Most
of these were rusted metal fragments.

CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF
RESULTS
By Rachel Feit

ASSESSMENT OF RESEARCH DESIGN WITH FINAL RESEARCH
GOALS
At the beginning of the project, the research goals for the archeological testing
were articulated in the Research Design. In addition to locating unmarked
graves, the testing project was to focus on the household and commercial
development of a primarily African-American, though to some degree multiethnic, community in Houston. The Research Design sought to address the
following specific issues:
 Foodways—what types of food remains were present in the project area
and what can these reveal about the predominant food preferences and
cuisines in the neighborhood?
 Could the material culture and remains be linked to known occupations
and if so, do they reflect the social, economic, and racial composition of
the community?
 Were religious artifacts and remains present on the site and if so, what
could they indicate about religious practice in the neighborhood?
 Based on a comparison of the material remains between this
neighborhood and rural archeological sites of the same time period,
would it be possible to determine differences between the urban AfricanAmerican experience and the rural African-American experience during
the Jim Crow era?
 How was Houston’s Freedmen’s Town similar to other Freedmen’s Towns
in Texas and the United States?
 What could the identifiable remains tell us about the neighborhood’s
social and economic ties to the rest of Houston? In other words, what
could locally produced artifacts such as medicine bottles, soda bottles,
tokens, etc. tell us about patterns of purchasing and consumption?
 Does the archeological record reflect the higher density population
characteristics and the historic lack of infrastructure in Freedmen’s
Town?
These questions were admittedly ambitious. Only a best-case scenario vis à vis
archeological remains could have begun to address all of these issues, and it
was understood that once the testing was complete that the specific research
goals of the project would have to be refined, based on actual results.
In terms of the household and commercial archeology, only a small portion of
the targeted areas contained isolatable archeological surfaces or features. It was
found that most of the project area contained temporally mixed cultural debris
dating from the 1950s to the twenty first century, with few intact older surfaces
that could be excavated archeologically. As a general rule, lots that contained
pre-1930s structures that were still standing in 2002, contained no evident early
twentieth century surfaces or isolatable early twentieth century artifacts.
Though the structures themselves may have dated to as early as 1900, the
surrounding yards contained much later debris. This was the case, for instance
with Lot 9 of Block 2, where investigators found foundation remnants from a one
story house (Feature 15) built as early as 1902 when John Wesley Newton and

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

157

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

his wife bought the property, and resided there until 1925. The house was still
standing in 2002. However, the associated debris around the foundation
elements included a plastic dinosaur head, tin foil, a modern plastic pen, a
1950s Brownie camera, plastic ribbon, bottles, and nails among other items
representing the period between 1940 and the present day. These were
scattered together with no discernable stratigraphy. Test unit and trench
profiles also provide fairly definitive evidence for extensive disturbance and
temporal mixing within the upper 20-50 centimeters of sediment throughout the
project area. Only those areas where there was a structure that had been
demolished and then built over contained isolatable early twentieth century
surfaces or features.
Across the project area, archeologists documented shallowly buried
archeological deposits. Though up to four feet of fill had been predicted by JK
Wagner and Roger Moore of Moore Archeological Consulting prior to Hicks &
Company’s involvement in this project, Hicks & Company did not document
intentional fill zones, save for those created by demolition and subsequent
construction episodes.
These tended to be thin, varying between 5-20
centimeters in thickness.
The best archeological surfaces were found on lots that had contained early
twentieth century structures that were demolished by 1940 and then replaced
by newer buildings, or where lots were simply left vacant for a long period of
time. On Block 2, Lots 2-4 and 6 contained isolatable archeological surfaces and
features; Block 4, Lot 5 appears to have contained a thin living/demo surface
related to early twentieth century occupation, and Block 5, Lots 4-5 also
revealed pre-1950s archeological surfaces associated with features. Even these
intact areas cannot be fully compared to each other as they represent different
disposal contexts for each household. Lots 3, 12 and 13 on Block 4 also
appeared to have contained a discrete artifact-bearing surface. However, this
area was not intensively excavated.
Thus the sample size and variation for the interpretable remains collected
turned out to be extremely limited. The areas where intact archeological
surfaces and features were excavated through test units, included two tenantoccupied lots and four owner-occupied lots. No intact features or artifact
concentrations were noted from lots that held churches, or businesses, though
several church related artifacts (a headstone fragment and a church plaque
fragment) were noted in highly mixed and disturbed contexts on Lot 5 of Block
5.
Based on the analyzable remains found, it may be difficult to form definite
conclusions about Houston’s Freedmen’s Town. The archeological remains from
the HISD property may contribute to a database on Houston’s Freedmen’s Town,
but cannot stand as a microcosm for it. Nevertheless, the remains can begin to
establish a baseline for some of the questions laid out in the research design.
For instance, foodways can be partially addressed through an analysis of the
faunal and other material remains found on Blocks 2, 5, and 4.
Similarly, economic ties to local businesses, the greater Houston area, national
and international networks can be addressed particularly through analysis of
the Feature 16 material, and to a lesser extent through the Block 4, Block 5,
and Block 2, Lots 2-3 material. Comparison of the material collected from

different households within the project area could reveal noteworthy trends
about consumption and disposal patterns among residents.
Likewise, it is certainly possible to compare this dataset as a whole to other
urban (in Houston and outside Houston) archeological sites of the same period.
Finally, questions about infrastructure are viable, based on information
recorded in trenches, test units, and the artifacts recovered.

FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION
The Landscape of the Neighborhood- development, infrastructure and architecture
One of the important research issues of this project, and an issue that
particularly fascinates the Principal Investigator, is development and
infrastructure.
How these facets of urban life manifest themselves
archeologically and the ways in which archeological evidence allows one to
reconstruct past built environments in order to assess quality of life is one of the
more germane topics historical archeologists should consider when doing urban
investigations. The 10-block area investigated as part of the Gregory Lincoln
project area emerged as a residential neighborhood in the early years of the
twentieth century, following resolution of property ownership issues and
litigation that spanned nearly seventy years. Located at the edge of the city, the
project area comprises three separate subdivisions—Boercher’s Extension of
Castania, Powars Southside Addition, and Alden Place-- two of which were
developed roughly concurrently. The Powars Southside Addition in particular
appears to have been part of a subdivision intended in large part to cater to the
4th Ward’s swelling black population. Will Powars Jr. a civil engineer who lived
in the 4th Ward with his mother Mary Ruby5 was instrumental in the subdivision
and planning of this property, though to a certain degree the neighborhood
evolved opportunistically. This is evident when looking at the early twentieth
century subdivision boundaries for Blocks 4, 5 and 6 of the Powars addition.
The western edge of Block 6 for instance, protrudes into the street, while the
eastern edge of Block 4 aligns slightly west of north, allowing only a narrow
alleyway for Genesee Street (Figure 3-5). Poor initial surveying and haphazard
land planning ultimately led to a1925 lawsuit that caused the residents of Block
6 to lose their properties.
Houses
The project area was a mix of homeowners and tenants. The earliest residents
however, appear to be homeowners who purchased property directly from
Powars or one of his associates and built houses during the first decade of the
twentieth century. Homeowners typically built L-plan, T-plan, or square plan
structures centered at the front of the lot. Meanwhile tenant-occupied housing
was built exclusively by white landlords between the 1905-1920 period. Tenant

It is amusing to note that in the 1900 census Will Powars gave his profession as “civil engineer,” while in later
years he described his profession to census takers as “real estate.” While speculative, the shift in later years perhaps
reflects a loss of idealism, as Powars resigned himself to making money over building communities.

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

houses tended to be built in the shotgun style and placed two to a lot6.
Photographs of structures standing as of 2002 and Sanborn fire insurance maps
confirm that all of the pre-1925 homes were built as one-story wood-frame
houses, set on pier and beam foundations. The only homes that were made of
brick or masonry were those that faced Taft Street and were developed in the
Alden Place Triangle after 1925. These brick homes and apartments, notably,
were all occupied by whites, while the rest of the neighborhood, (with the
exception of the Italian grocers) was black.
Of the 53 total features found, 25 were house foundation features from pre­
1930s structures. And of these 25 foundation features, only 17 were actually
within contexts containing isolatable early twentieth century archeological
material. House foundations from pre-1930s structures were all constructed in
the pier and beam fashion, with the piers of red paste flat-faced brick. Notably,
piers from different structures were constructed in different styles, no doubt
reflecting the idiosyncrasy of their builders.
Brick piers tended to be
rectangular, with just one or two courses of each pier remaining for
archeologists to record. Beyond that, investigators noted at least four distinct
pier styles used on structures or groups of structures that appeared to have
been built concurrently.
Thus the archeological and archival evidence together indicates that the
observable built environment displayed a certain degree of heterogeneity,
typifying organic growth. Other nearby blocks in the 4th Ward that were
developed roughly concurrently display a more unified pattern of development.
The 1924 Sanborn showing Block 37 of Boercher’s Extension of Castania-­
bordered by Dallas, Mason, Saulnier and Taft (it is one of the blocks under the
existing Gregory Lincoln School)-- for instance, indicates eleven lots of
identically sized and shaped structures, suggesting that almost the entire block
was developed concurrently and by the same builder. This is not the case with
the area investigated during 2005. Though much of the project area was
subdivided and platted concurrently, development took place sporadically and
inconsistently. A review of property sales, census records, and tax records
confirm that development proceeded in a haphazard fashion after 1900. A
material example of this random development is Andrews Street, which was
paved with brick up to Mason Street, then was paved with shell, as revealed in
Trench 51, between Mason and Taft Streets. Alleyways were also paved with
shell if they were paved at all. Feature 6, a layer of crushed shell found in
Trench 4 under the track, represented Robin Street, which must have remained
unpaved through the 1960s. A shallowly buried shell layer noted in Trench 53
shows that Victor Alley (on Block 4 of Powars Addition) was also paved with shell
well into the twentieth century.
Infrastructure
The fact that the neighborhood developed organically to a certain degree does
not mean it lacked urban amenities and infrastructure. The neighborhood
developed at a time when progressivism was taking hold in Houston. The
population surge followed by a rapid urbanization that engulfed Houston during

It has been argued that shotgun style houses represent a variant of traditional West Indian dwellings brought to this
country by freed Haitians during the nineteenth century (Vlach 1986). However, worth noting is that all of the
shotgun housing in the project area was built by white absentee landlords, not black owner-occupants.

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

the post-Civil War era forced civic leaders to face the need for efficient public
transportation, and effective distribution of electricity, gas, and water. And
while these services were often inequitably distributed among the city’s residents
(especially to minority populations), extension of urban amenities steadily
increased throughout the wards during the last decades of the nineteenth
century (Platt 1983). However, management of utilities by the private companies
that owned them was often negligent and irresponsible. For instance, in 1894 a
fire engulfed the St Joseph’s infirmary and an entire residential block, killing
two nuns and leaving many more homeless. The blaze could have been
controlled were it not for a water pressure failure in nearby hydrants (Platt
1983).
In 1899, in the wake of the crisis over Houston’s inadequate water supply, the
city’s progressive mayor hired an urban planner from New York. The planner,
Alexander Potter developed a comprehensive plan to connect existing sewer lines
into a central treatment plant that would serve 16 square miles. Aiming to put
an end to Houston’s public health and environment problems, the plan also
called for tying together several different utilities that would supply the city with
water, wastewater, electricity and trash disposal amenities. Though it initially
stirred excitement among council members, the plan met with strong opposition
among the city’s business leaders, especially those responsible for existing utility
corporations, since it required them to uphold minimum service standards or
risk not being paid by the city. Though Potter’s plan was never realized, the
momentum for environmental and municipal reform continued over the next six
years. By 1906 the city of Houston had purchased the 30 year-old privately
owned water works in an effort to comply with a District judge ruling that the
city cease discharging wastewater into the bayous. The result of that purchase
was improved water and wastewater amenities throughout the city (Platt 1983).
The project area appears to have been one of the early 4th Ward neighborhoods
to benefit from this new spirit of urban planning. Excavations across the 10 city
blocks revealed not a single cistern, well, or backyard privy (a modern concrete
well associated with a pump house in Alden Place was documented, but it was
not related to any of the early twentieth century households). This contrasts
sharply with other investigations in Houston. For example, Shawn Carlson
found two wells, 13 below ground cisterns, seven privies and five trash pits
during the investigations of the Houston Ball Park (Carlson 2002). The
particular neighborhood was developed earlier than the current project area and
the Ball Park investigations demonstrated that most of those buried trashbearing features were abandoned and sealed by the first decade of the twentieth
century.
Admittedly it is possible some of those features may have been missed, since the
entire project area was not actually stripped. Or it is possible that residents
used above ground cisterns to provide water for their households. However,
trench placement, size and numbers were such that if there had been extensive
private waste and water infrastructure (ie. wells, cisterns, privies) used on these
lots, investigations would have provided some evidence of them. Instead, given
the large number of clearly pre-1950’s utility lines (56% of the trenches
contained buried infrastructure) documented throughout the project, it is
reasonable to conjecture that water, wastewater and garbage disposal
infrastructure was in place at the time of development. A 1929 planning report
for the City of Houston showed that sewers and sewerage disposal had been
widely implemented throughout the city, which had built 480 miles of pipe, 14
plumbing stations, 5 sewage disposal plants and 136 miles of storm sewers

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

(Figure 8-1, taken from 1929 Hare and Hare Master Plan). Maps within the
plan suggest that sewerage was present in the project area and that municipal
water was available to at least part of the project area.
Figure 8-1

1929 Hare and Hare Map showing Water Utility Coverage.

Property records for homes on Blocks 2 and 3 of the Powars Addition document
that a number of different households granted mortgage liens to Richard Allen
Plumbing around 1910. Significantly, Richard Allen was a noted African
American architect, builder and politician who designed the Antioch Baptist
Church and many other significant buildings in Houston prior to 1900. Though
he died in 1911, it is possible that his son or one of his daughters may have
continued the building business under the name Richard Allen Plumbing. All of
these transactions are recorded in the same volume (HCDR 261 in Wagner 2005)
suggesting that the company contracted with multiple homeowners
simultaneously to install water and wastewater lines (or perhaps even build
homes) within the neighborhood. A record of a sewer easement at the corner of
Genesee and Andrews granted to private developer Ray Branham sometime
around 1925 (HCDR 608/154 in Wagner 2005) indicates that infrastructure
improvements were likely ongoing during the first 30 years of the twentieth
century.
Electricity generally became available to Houstonians after 1894 when the
Houston Gas Company organized the Houston Electric Light Company (Young
1912). Electricity was probably available to the project area’s residents, though
it appears likely that some households still owned or used kerosene lamps well
into the twentieth century. The 1924 Sanborn Fire insurance map, for instance,
shows that electricity was installed in the 2nd Pleasant Green Baptist Chruch, as

well as the short-lived Union Tabernacle Church on Andrews Street. Though
lamp glass from kerosene lanterns was found in most intact pre-1940s contexts
that were excavated, the amount was perhaps less than if the residents had
relied exclusively on such items for lighting. During the Capitol Extension
investigations in Austin, for example, hundreds of pieces of lantern glass were
recovered from several contexts that reflected the period between 1875-1900. A
kitchen cellar (Feature 5) on 41TV1553 contained 982 fragments of lantern
glass, and a cellar (Feature 7) on 41TV1554 contained 1,878 fragments of
lantern glass. By contrast, most test units in the current project area contained
just a few fragments of lantern glass (Table 8-1) if they contained any at all.

Block 2 of the Powars Addition yielded the most significant amount of lantern
glass. This was recovered from Test Units 7 and 19 (N=93 and 29, respectively)
in Feature 16 (Lot 6 of Block 2). As an intentional refuse disposal pit (1910­
1920) associated with some of the earliest project area residents, it can be
assumed that items within it were discarded there after breakage or after they
had outlived their use-life. A relatively large quantity of lantern glass was also
recovered from Test Unit 3 on the same block (Lot 3 of Block 2), behind a series
of shotgun rental houses. However the same level also yielded electrical light
bulb parts. Plugs, wires, sockets, or other electrical parts were recovered from
this same general context in the surrounding Trench 10. Hence, it can be
inferred that residents probably still used kerosene lanterns in conjunction with
electrical appliances and lighting.
It is difficult to assess to what degree organized refuse collection was in place as
part of the neighborhood infrastructure. Rat skull elements were recovered from
Trench 10b (Block 2, Lot 3) and Test Unit 9 on Block 4. Mousetrap parts found
from test units and trenches on Blocks 2 and 34 suggest that rodent control
may have been a problem for area residents, particularly in tenant housing. A
poison bottle recovered from Trench 53 at the rear of Lots 3 and 13 on Block 4
also attests to the need to control household pests. Since rats are typically
attracted to areas where open refuse is allowed to collect, this may indicate, but
does not necessarily prove, that uncovered waste was a problem in the project
area.
Certainly by the 1920s the City of Houston offered waste management services
to urban residents, though whether these amenities were extended to the 4th
Ward is not known. As part of his 1899 plan for the city of Houston, Alexander
Potter recommended the construction of an incinerator to manage the increasing
quantity of garbage produced by the city’s residents.
That city-operated
incinerator was built and in operation by 1920. It was located just a few blocks
north of the project area, at the corner of Gillette and Hobson (Bullard 1983).
However, how garbage made its way to that incinerator and whether trash

163

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

collection services were organized and offered to black residents of 4th Ward has
not been determined as part of this study. Only one intentional trash pit,
Feature 16, was found and excavated. This particular feature was located in the
yard of Lot 6 of Block 2. The artifacts within the feature have a range of roughly
1890 to 1920, indicating that disposal and burial probably took place after
1920, a time when organized waste collection may have been in effect, but when
older residents perhaps still clung to more individualized disposal habits. Many
of the items in the trash pit appear to have been burned intentionally before
burial. The presence of this feature may point to the fact that the neighborhood
had an inadequate refuse disposal system and therefore residents resorted to
burning and burying trash in their yards. However, the fact that only one such
feature was found across the entire project may be more reflective of individual
habits. In Austin, for instance, where universal municipal garbage collection
was not well organized until the third decade of the twentieth century, garbage
pits, privies, wells and cisterns containing material from the 1920s, 30s, and
even 1940s are quite common on urban archeological sites (Feit and Jones
2006). By extension, if effective waste management was unavailable to the
Houston area residents, one might expect to find more than just one refuse pit
and a few mousetrap parts in the 10-block project area.
Yards
Though investigators recorded few examples of intentional refuse pits in the
project area, field observations and notes coupled with trench profile and artifact
recovery indicates that backyards were probably used for refuse disposal to
some extent. This is not unusual and has been noted in other archeological
contexts (Wright 1997).
During the nineteenth century, backyards were
regularly used for trash disposal in cities throughout Texas. However, with the
advent of municipal waste disposal, urban residents backyards were no longer
required for this purpose. In the Gregory Lincoln project area, it seems that
residents practiced both formal and informal rear yard refuse disposal into the
1930s and 1940s, though informal disposal seems to have been more prevalent.
Informal refuse disposal is the practice of discarding trash on the surface of
yards in an non-patterned manner, while formal refuse disposal suggests
intentionality, either in the form of a deliberate disposal pit, or a discrete
location where trash is habitually placed. The trenches behind the tenant
houses on Lot 2, Trench 53 on Lots 3, 12, and 13 of Block 4, and the western
edge of Trenches 28 and 30 on Lot 5 of Block 5 all contained dense artifact
deposits likely corresponding to informal rear yard refuse disposal (Trench 10 on
Block 2, however, also contains debris almost definitely associated with
demolition). Though artifact content was high in these areas, there was no
discrete disposal context, suggesting that residents simply tossed some debris,
such as bone and broken glass, into their back yards. Feature 37 on Block 4,
associated with the Richardson household, may also have been a scatter
resulting from informal refuse disposal, since it was very shallow and did not
appear to have clear limits. The Spillmans’ backyard refuse pit was located
behind the house at 1720 Ruthven, and this feature was the one clearly
confined refuse disposal pit found in the project area. Its limits were defined
and possibly lined with metal; its contents appeared to have been intentionally
burned. In the Spillman case, not only was trash intentionally burned and
buried, it was then permanently sealed under portions of the house during a
remodeling. However, confinement in this manner appears not to have been the
prevailing means of backyard refuse discard.

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

The use of backyards for refuse disposal links back to the question of waste
management infrastructure. Was the habitual use of backyards for refuse
disposal the result of poor waste management infrastructure in the 4th Ward, or
was this simply habitual behavior on the part of the residents?
The investigations documented few permanent decorative yard features, such as
garden borders, walkways, or ancillary structures. To a certain degree, this is
probably a function of limited time and too few trenches that would allow for
those things to have been identified. However, a number of blocks were clearly
overprinted by modern land use and demolition activities, and it is unlikely that
these shallow surface features would have survived. Feature 39 represents the
only certain permanent yard feature recorded during the project. This was a
brick walkway composed of half and whole bricks leading up to the
Starks/White residence at 1518 Mason Street, on Lot 4 of Block 5. Constructed
of mis-matching bricks gathered from multiple sources, none of them actually
corresponded to the bricks used for the related house piers, suggesting the
walkway was added after initial construction. Its positioning suggests that it led
from the street to the front porch.
Test Units 1-4 on Block 2 behind the tenant houses contained possible yard
remnants such as posts or brick features. These (Feature 9-12, 36) may
represent the remains of walkways, fence posts, or laundry line posts. However,
their precise function remains unknown. These too may attest to a similar yard
development pattern. Many of the bricks recorded for Features 9-12 were
paving bricks, and were different from those bricks used to build the structure
foundations at the front of the lots. Again this suggests that random materials
procurement took place after initial house construction. More generally, it is
evidence of the evolving and changing aspect of project area yards and houses.
Residents improved their yards with materials they gathered from various
sources, as they were acquired. In this way yards likely evolved organically and
informally.
This is not to suggest that project area residents ignored yard and household
maintenance. On the contrary, data suggest that project residents had specific
aesthetic sensibilities. One artifact class is revealing about neighborhood
character in this respect, both inside and outside of houses. Flower pot
fragments were surprisingly abundant throughout the project area (Figure 8-2).
Potted plants are items that can be telling about quality of life and aesthetic
choices. They are non-essential household items. Yet their low cost, portability,
and the plants’ potential edibility, may make them attractive to highly mobile
and low income families, who desire to decorate their homes and yards, but do
not have the stability or total control over their residential property. In his study
of African American yards, Richard Westmacott (1992) notes the pervasiveness
of potted plants in African American rural yards in the South. While this may
be a factor of transience to some extent, Westmacott, as well as others have
suggested that plants in pots also tie into a distinct social outlook shared by
many African American gardeners. For instance, Westmacott noted a marked
preference among the gardeners he interviewed for many different types of
flowers (this sort of preference was less common in white yards), arranged in
separated spaces, with no formal patterning. Building on Westmacott’s work,
Grey Gundaker identified a consistent pattern of encirclement and enclosure in
African American yardscapes that define thresholds and boundaries, and
“mediate movement from one area of the property to another (Gundaker and
McWillie 2005).” According to African American gardeners she talked to, plants
in pots not only beautify space, they also serve to delineate space, separate the

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

wild from the cultivated, and create a separate specific environment for each
plant (Gundaker, personal communication 2007).
Figure 8-2

Flower Pot Fragments from the Spillman Trash Pit.

Based on artifact recovery, it would seem as though project area residents relied
heavily on potted plants to beautify their surroundings, delimit space, and/or
provide supplemental produce. Terracotta flower pot fragments were found to be
associated with virtually every household investigated except those within Alden
Place, whose residents were white. Block 2 was particularly prolific in this
regard. Feature 16 alone (Test Units 7 and 19), associated with the Spillman
household, yielded 49 flower pot fragments (many from the same pot), while the
area behind the shotgun tenant houses on Lots 2-4 of the same block yielded
over 60 fragments.
Flower pot fragments were also associated with the
Richardson occupation of Block 4 and the Starks household on Block 5. All
told, there were approximately 135 flower pot fragments collected from just four
blocks, likely representing between four and six households of the project area.
During the Guy Town project in Austin, which investigated a racially mixed late
nineteenth-early twentieth century neighborhood less than half that amount
was found from an equivalent number of blocks representing approximately six
to seven households (Feit et al. 2003). This data strongly suggests that many of
the project area residents kept plants in pots, either for decoration or food.
Moreover the distribution shows that this practice was universal, with only a
slightly higher incidence of this artifact class in tenant-occupied versus owneroccupied households. It seems reasonable that the tenant-occupied households
may have relied more heavily on potted plants not only to beautify their homes
and yards, but also, as Gundaker argued, as a means to delineate household
boundaries and backyard space.
It is possible, though certainly not proven by this study, that flower pots may be
more likely to appear on black household sites than white household sites. For
instance, during the Alamodome investigations in San Antonio, archeologists
investigated both black and white (mainly German) households. Notably, the

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

166

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

investigations revealed flower pot fragments in all of black households, while
only one of the white households yielded these artifacts (Wright 1997). Flower
pot fragments were recovered from the Alonzo Pennington (an African American
blacksmith) occupation near Austin’s Capitol (Parsons 2001); while nearby
wealthy white households such as those on Site 41TV1554, held none (Thomas
1996).
Foodways and Household Practice
Faunal material and home butchering
The faunal material from all test units was analyzed by LeeAnna Schniebs. The
complete results are presented in Appendix B and broken down by site,
taxonomy and taphonomy. Schniebs analysis showed that the assemblage is
fairly typical for urban sites in Texas, with small pieces of cut bone from
domesticated livestock and birds predominating. The identified remains show
that cow and pigs were most commonly consumed, followed by chicken, fish,
turkey, and then lamb, sheep or goats. The assemblage is supplemented lightly
with a few wild species such a rabbit, raccoon, and opossum. These last two
may not have been used for food, but rather, were rodent pests who were either
caught, or died of natural causes under a house or in a yard.
A number of items could not be identified to species and family but were simply
identified as large, medium or small mammal, etc. Table 8-2 shows the
breakdown of faunal material from test units across the entire project area.

It is not surprising that very few fish remains were recovered from the test units,
given that these can be tiny and often do not preserve well. Most were not
identifiable to species. However it is thought provoking to note that the identified

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

167

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

remains included drum and snapper. While drum could have been caught in
the bayous, to catch snapper, one would have had to go the Gulf of Mexico.
Alternately, the snapper could have been procured at a local fish market. The
1915 through 1930 city directories list a number of fish dealers in Houston,
most of them located in the City Market. In 1915 there were two African
American fish dealers—James King at 1014 San Felipe, and Samuel Sauls at
2703 ½ Nance (Houston City Directory 1915). During the 1920s Fore’s Fish
Market advertised in the Houston Informer as the largest black-owned fish
market in Texas. Whether the project area remains were purchased at a local
market or caught on a trip to the coast, the presence of this class of fish implies
participation in a larger regional economy. The largest quantity of fish remains
was found on Block 2, associated with the tenant houses on Lots 2-4. Generally
speaking, though, the small sample size makes meaningful analysis of fish
remains tentative.
Across the three blocks where test unit investigations were conducted the
proportion of cow, pigs, large mammals and very large mammals is roughly
equivalent, indicating a relatively consistent and heavy consumption of beef and
pork among the various households in the project area (Figures 8-3, 8-4, 8-5).
This is a pattern that is well established for urban sites in Texas (Feit et al.
2003; Meissner and Hunziker 1997). However, a few notable differences
between household units are apparent in the project area.
The tenant
households yielded by far the greatest number of chicken and fish remains.
Proportionately, chicken and fish consumption was at least twice as much on
Block 2 than on any of the other blocks investigated. It is worth noting that this
context also contained the only raccoon and opossum elements found in the
project area, perhaps suggesting an increased reliance on inexpensive meats,
and wild animal protein. By contrast, the Richardson household on Block 4
yielded a proportionately much great quantity of lamb/sheep/goat elements, as
well as a larger number of rabbit remains. The Stark and Young households on
Block 5 yielded overall the smallest number of animal remains, and this likely
has much to do with the fact that test units excavated on this block were placed
in a front yard context, rather than a rear yard or in a formal disposal context.

The tenant houses on Block 2, the Spillman occupation and the Richardson
occupation on Block 4 contained large faunal assemblages. Overall their faunal
assemblage indicates a strong reliance on store purchased and butchered
meats. Saw cut rib and long bones dominate the assemblage. However, there
are a few examples of both cow and pig foot elements that might suggest a small
amount of home butchering or more likely, actual consumption of these parts of
the animal. The Richardson assemblage contained four pig feet elements, three
sheep feet elements and eight cow feet elements. The tenant assemblage
contained two pig feet, and two cow feet elements; while the Spillman
assemblage contained three pig feet and three cow feet elements. Cranial
elements of cows, sheep, and pigs were also recorded in the Richardson (2 pig, 2
sheep, 1 cow), Spillman (6 pig,) and tenant assemblages (1 pig, 1 large mammal,
probably pig). Proportionately, the Richardson family consumed more offal cuts
(such as cranial, foot and thoractic) than any other household.
Nonetheless, for all households, the number of offal cuts is extremely small
compared to the rib and long bone fragments identified. Overall ribs and long
bone fragment accounted for roughly 60-80% of percent of each assemblage,

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

169

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

with shoulder, pelvic and vertebral cuts comprising most of remainder.
Generally speaking then, it can be inferred that the project area residents
consumed meats that came from the local market, preferring to prepare rib, leg,
or shoulder cuts over the more idiosyncratic edible parts of the animal.
Oysters were also part of the dietary regime of the project area residents. And
given the proximity to the gulf, were likely widely eaten. Urban oyster houses
were very fashionable throughout American cities in the nineteenth and early
twentieth century. In his history of oyster harvesting and consumption in New
York, Kurlansky argues that oysters were one of the few foods that both rich and
poor enjoyed in equal measure (Kurlansky 2006). In New York oysters were
plentiful, inexpensive, simple to prepare yet elegant, and of course, delicious.
By the mid to late nineteenth century, Ostreamania gripped not just New York,
but also other cities both in the US and in Europe, as rail and steamboat
transportation suddenly made shipping fresh oysters over several thousand
miles viable. In Houston, oysters likely shared the same popularity, especially
given that the state bordered some of the richest oyster-producing waters in the
country—the Gulf of Mexico. Austin, Texas, for instance, had at least two oyster
houses by 1875, which shipped the bivalves over 200 miles in from the coast
(Austin city directory 1875). Houston counted at least eight market stalls or
restaurants specializing in oysters by 1915 (Houston city directory 1915).
Clearly oysters were readily available for restaurant and home consumption.
A precise distribution and comparison of discarded consumed shells is not
feasible for this project. This is because crushed oyster shells were also used to
pave alleyways, driveways, and roads. And while a number of dense shell
concentrations clearly representing roads and alleyways were recorded in trench
and unit excavations, due to previous machine disturbance through the project
area, shells and shell fragments were also lightly mixed into the soil matrix at all
levels of the test units. Thus it was often difficult to discern from notes and
records whether these shells represented consumed remains or landscape
remains. There were several areas, however, where shell fragments appear to be
clearly food remains. Level 1 of Test Units 3 and 4 (the tenant houses on Block
2, Lot 3) produced oyster shell that almost certainly represented eaten remains.
Investigators recorded a fairly sizable scatter of whole shells at a consistent
elevation at the bottom of Level 1 (elevation 100.075). Smaller, crushed
fragments were not recorded in the same context, suggesting that these shells
were food remains, rather than driveway or road remains associated with the
general refuse scatter from the early twentieth century shotgun tenant houses in
that area.
Another area that contained abundant oyster shells was the Richardson
household, which yielded proportionately the densest concentration of food
remains in the project area. Oyster shells were found in context with the
extensive bone and artifact scatter representing Feature 37. At least 328 oyster
shells were recovered in context with the Richardson refuse scatter (Feature 37),
which was also the single most productive feature in terms of faunal remains.
While many of these may have been crushed shell fragments associated with an
alley or a prepared construction surface noted in the upper portions of Test
Units 8, 9 and 11, those from the lowest levels (n=72) were almost certainly food
related, as they appeared to be in context with consumed animal remains.
Given their association with animal remains, it is likely that many of these other
shells also represent consumed remains, rather than incidental shell scatter
associated with decorative or landscape features.

Food processing and canning
Home canning, a common activity for rural residents and even some urban
residents during the early twentieth century, was not widely practiced among
the project area population. Investigators recovered a relatively small number of
canning jars and jar lids in the project area. The residents who relied most on
canning were the tenant occupants on Block 2 (Figure 8-6).
Four Ball jar
fragments and 4 Hazel Atlas canning jar fragments were recovered from the
tenant house assemblage. Canning jar lids were also recovered from the tenant
houses. Almost all of the approximately 32 canning jar lid fragments came from
test units on Lot 3 of Block 2 (the tenant houses). Nine other fragments were
found in Test Unit 8, the Richardson household. In some ways this pattern is
counterintuitive. Though it might make sense that the tenant households would
be more inclined to home can foodstuffs in order to economize, canning is
typically undertaken by residents and homeowners with more stability. Those
who owned their home would not only have had the space and surety to store
foods for the future, but also more control over their yard space in order to grow
produce needed for canning.
Those who rented their homes were more
transient, with less control over their outdoor space, less access to rural outdoor
areas where fruits and vegetables could grow, and therefore home canning
would have been less feasible.
Figure 8-6

Canning jars and fragments.

fragment with “Ball” Mark (Bag 21-21); D) Milk glass canning lid fragment (Bag 18-116); E) Unknown
Maker’s Mark jar base (Bag 19-38).

On the other hand, a likely explanation for the higher number of canning jars
and lids among the tenant assemblage, as opposed to the other owner occupant
assemblages is that they were actually purchasing home canned goods from one
of the local Italian markets. These home canned products might have been
inexpensive and abundant from the local storeowners, who themselves were
recent immigrants from the rural farming areas of southern Italy (Belfiglio 1983).

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

171

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

These immigrants had few professional labor skills, and the grocery business
was one way for them to maximize those they had. In fact, there were two
Italian owned groceries at the intersection of Andrews and Mason streets. One of
the more notable aspects of Trench 8 excavated on the lot next to what would
have been the Trapolino Market was a clear concentration of glass jars and jar
fragments noted in the trench. Recovered artifacts included a number (n=8) of
canning jar fragments.
Stoneware jugs and crocks were likewise poorly represented among the artifacts,
once again indicating that home food processing and long-term storage was
relatively uncommon. One notable exception to this pattern was a large
stoneware whiskey jug, found in the Spillman’s trash pit, suggesting that
someone may have distilled their own moonshine or purchased homemade
whiskey from someone else. Investigators working at the Alamodome noted that
percentages of stoneware vessels were lowest among the African American
households they investigated. They suggested that African Americans appeared
to be least inclined to long-term food storage of all the various residents who
lived in that neighborhood. The same pattern was also recorded for a racially
mixed neighborhood in Washington D.C. In that study, Cheek & Friedlander
(1990) found that the ceramic assemblages from white households contained
approximately 13.7% stoneware vessels, while black household assemblages
comprised only 4.9%. They further argued that data from the rural Richland
Chambers reservoir project in North Texas, which also found that rural African
Americans used fewer stoneware storage jars, bowls, and crocks, indicates that
this difference seems to apply whether the household is rural or urban.
The food and food storage remains in the Gregory Lincoln project area do
reinforce the conclusion that home food processing was not a common
household activity, and that most residents purchased ready to cook or ready to
eat foods from local groceries. Condiment and extract bottles such as ketchup,
Worcestershire sauce, pepper sauce and pickle jars are well represented for
instance. Meanwhile, other types of bottles such as vinegar, oil, or spice cans,
which would indicate primary food processing and home canning, are rare
throughout the project area.
Taken together, the data suggest that the
predominant foodways pattern in the project area is highly urban, with little
evidence of reliance on more traditional or rural food processing strategies (with
the possible exception of ethnic-based meat preferences). Though a few of the
project area residents were probably recent migrants from rural areas, once in
the city, they appear to have embraced urban food consumerism, while rejecting
more traditional farm-based forms of food preparation. This is a pattern
observed in other urban African American archeological contexts (cf. Wright
1997, Mullins 1999), and it has been theorized that late nineteenth and early
twentieth century African Americans consciously adopted urban foodways and
food consumption as part of a larger engagement with a market economy that
was largely denied them during the antebellum period.
Dining and Table Aesthetics
Household ceramics are one of the most common and best-studied classes of
artifacts on historic sites. This is because ceramics not only preserve well and
are well dated, but also because they offer a glimpse onto exchange networks,
economic class, foodways, and aesthetic choices. It has been suggested that due
to differing foodways, uneven access to high quality meats, and serving
preferences, that bowls occur more frequently than plates on African American
sites (Otto 1977, Baker 1980, Ferguson 1992). This perceived indicator of

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

172

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

ethnicity was largely based on data from antebellum plantation sites, rather
than turn of the century urban assemblages. Subsequent researchers working
on urban sites have found no differentiation in ceramic form composition
between white and black households (Cheek and Friedlander 1990). The data
from the Gregory Lincoln project area support the latter findings, demonstrating
a higher incidence of plates than bowls. A rough count of the minimum number
of specimens among the saved decorated wares from across the entire project
area yields approximately 14 bowls, seven cups, 18 plates, seven saucers, eight
serving or mixing bowls, and two lids. Bowls for eating then, account for no
more than 25% of the total assemblage, which is certainly within the range of a
typical white household assemblage.
However, the data raise other types of inquiries regarding African American
dining patterns.
The Spillman ceramic assemblage (Block 2, Lot 6) is
particularly useful for analyzing dining aesthetics and choices, since all of the
artifacts came from a single disposal context that seems to be associated with
one household. The Spillman assemblage represented the best matched and
most expensive of all the ceramics in the project area. Among the household
ceramics the Spillman family used and discarded, were pieces of French
Haviland Porcelain (Schleiger floral spray patterns HC-09, 58-1 and others,
1893-1930, www.antique-china-porcelain-collectibles.com), a set of English
Wood & Son late Victorian blue transferware plates (Trilby pattern circa 1891,
Schneider 1992), and a set of red transfer English, W.E. Corn whiteware (Daisy
pattern circa 1900, Kowalsky and Kowalsky 1999). At least four different plates
were represented by the Haviland china, at least two plates and one cup were
represented by the Trilby pattern blue transferware, and at least two different
plates and a serving bowl were represented by the red transfer Daisy print (see
Figures 7-17 though 7-20). The presence of multiple discarded pieces of the
same pattern suggests that the family probably owned a set, or at least the
better part of a set of each.
However, certain inconsistencies within each pattern also imply that the
Spillman table china was acquired piecemeal or collected over time, rather than
purchased as complete sets. Close examination of the Haviland china, for
instance (see Figure 7-18), shows that while the designs are similar, the pieces
came from different lots. They show slight variations—some have edge molding,
while others do not, while the flower pattern on one is not exactly the same the
flower pattern on another. Altogether, six similar but not identical floral
porcelain patterns (roughly concurrent styles and probably also Haviland) were
identified among the Spillman assemblage. The same is true for the red transfer
ceramics (see Figure 7-17). While there are at least two plates represented that
are from the same set, a large mixing or decorative bowl, upon closer inspection,
appears to be of a slightly different pattern, though the color and quality of the
red transfer print is identical. In fact, of the roughly 440 pieces of kitchen
ceramics that were found in the Spillman assemblage, approximately 174 (39%)
of them were decorated.
Altogether the Spillman household tablewares
comprised at least 21 different decorative patterns.
This suggests a couple of things about the dining and table aesthetics of the
Spillman family, who, though they were stable owner occupants of the
neighborhood, were not wealthy. Yet they appeared to have actively sought to
acquire the material culture of wealth in their tableware choices. While the
bottle and glass date range for this deposit is roughly 1900-1920, many of these
ceramic items appear to be older, dating to before the turn of the century.
Unlike bottles, which were typically discarded once their contents were emptied,

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

173

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

ceramics could be used for years, passed from generation to generation, and
collected over time. The expensive English and French china, representing
multiple patterns, and variations on patterns acquired over time implies that a
Spillman family member (Lucy Spillman probably) actively collected these items,
for use at the table, for decorating the home, or likely both. The assemblage
shows a marked preference for imported ceramics over American made wares,
though American made wares are also represented through Shenango (pre­
1940, exact date unknown, Lehner 1988), Onondaga (1890, Lehner 1988) and
Homer Laughlin (the Angelus pattern 1909, Tennis 1997) makers marks found
within the assemblage. More importantly, the Spillman assemblage illustrates
an inclination for ornate and colorful floral decorations on virtually every type of
ware. The number of different patterns identified among the assemblage
suggests that the collector was attracted to decorated items, and sought to
enhance this collection by matching pieces and adding different but
complementary decorations whenever feasible.
As a point of comparison, excavations at the site of the German born Schneider
household, who lived in Austin’s Guy Town from roughly 1860-1920, yielded
approximately 237 total pieces of whiteware and porcelain and only about 20 of
them were decorated. Next door, at the (white) Susan Morgan household,
investigations of a similar trash pit context (Feature 68) recovered approximately
399 ceramic fragments, of which 303 were undecorated. And overall, the variety
of decorative patterns from all contexts within the Susan Morgan household was
considerably less than what was represented by a single feature from the
Spillman household (Feit et al. 2003).
This pattern of consumption is similar to the one Paul Mullins (1999) identified
for African American households in early twentieth century Annapolis. In his
study, Mullins also noted an unusually high number of unmatched decorated
wares in the assemblages he analyzed. He argued that “the mélange of
decorative preparations, age of vessels and heavy wear suggests that many
ceramics came into these African American households through various forms of
non-market exchange, such as generational gifts, salvage, barter and positive
reciprocity (Mullins 1999).” This may be the case with the Spillman assemblage.
While it impossible to know how Mrs. Spillman acquired her household ceramics
(whether by purchase, gift, salvage, etc.), it seems unlikely that she purchased
these items as complete sets. This contrasts with the dominant paradigm for
white ceramic consumption, which urged housewives that “the service of each
course should be of one kind of dishes. There is nothing that looks so splotchy
and as inelegant as a table covered with five or six kinds of dishes (‘Notes,
Tableware’ 1898 in Mullins 1999).
While Mullins attributes this perceived difference in material culture choices to
race, class, and uneven access to material goods, it may also be useful to think
about it as an aesthetic choice. Zora Neale Hurston wrote about African
American aesthetics that, “there can never be enough of beauty, let alone too
much (Hurston 1981).” This ideal manifests itself in what she calls “decorating
the decoration,” that is, the African American habit of, for instance, placing a
doily over a calendar, or draping a mantle with a lace scarf and bows. African
American aesthetics are set apart from white aesthetics, she argued, by an
overriding urge to adorn and embellish. While this is admittedly a strong
generalization to apply to the Gregory Lincoln project area, this attraction to
beauty seems to be the dominant pattern for the Spillman assemblage.

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

The tenant houses on Lot 3 of Block 2 reveal a similar taste pattern. Though to
some degree, the tenant house assemblage reflects the lower socio-economic
status of its occupants. Over 34 patterns were represented among the tenant
house assemblage. While it is true that this assemblage represents at least two
households, it nevertheless demonstrates the same heavy admixture of ceramic
patterns and styles seen in the Spillman assemblage.
For instance, two
fragments of a porcelain gold banded cup were found in the same context as a
single fragment of a very similar whiteware gold-banded cup, suggesting that its
owners may have collected the cups for the pattern, without regard for the
material. Test Unit 20 on Block 5 also contained two ceramic sherds—a plate
and a cup of almost identical pattern, but one was porcelain and the other
whiteware (see Figure 7-39). A third ceramic sherd recorded in the assemblage
had a very similar, but not quite identical pattern. Similarly, approximately five
fragments of glazed Mexican coarse earthenware (Talavera, and loza coriente)
representing four different vessels were also found in the tenant context. These
coarse earthenwares are extremely colorful and often quite ornate. Though
Mexican American families commonly used this type of pottery for cooking,
black and white households typically used them for display or as decorative
flower pots.
Patterns of Activity and Consumption
It has already been pointed out that one of the most productive artifact contexts
throughout the project area was the tenant houses on Lots 2-4 of Block 2.
Overall, the artifacts from Test Units 1-6 and areas 10a, 10b, and 11a represent
approximately 31% of the total project area assemblage. The investigators
speculate that the reason that this area was so productive is because the
shotgun houses burned in a fire sometime during the 1930s. The inhabitants of
the tenant homes were probably still living in them when the fire broke out. A
quantity of ash, burned artifacts, and architectural material fragments in
addition to a generally diverse functional assemblage all support this
conclusion. Once razed, the burned buildings were then replaced with an
apartment complex that was still standing in 2002. In terms of interpretive
potential, this means that artifacts recovered from the tenant houses represent a
relatively complete snapshot of the material culture, and hence the range
activities of the occupants.
Sewing and Washing
One of the outstanding characteristics of this assemblage is the quantity of
buttons and clothing-related items found in the tenant house context. The
investigations documented approximately 289 buttons representing a variety of
forms, sizes, styles and materials. Approximately 78% of the total button
assemblage from the project area came from the tenant houses. In addition to
buttons, investigators recovered shoe parts, buckles, collar studs, silk stockings,
a thread spool, and an iron sewing machine table fragment from test units. In
fact, almost 70% of the total clothing assemblage was recovered from tenant
house context.
The very high number of buttons and clothing parts
undoubtedly reflects the activities of the occupants (Table 8-3).

*Represents trenches from other contexts not included in the major household units analyzed.

Most of the households were led by women (even though male boarders were
living in them), and most of the women in these households worked as
laundresses and seamstresses out of the home. The sizable button collection
suggests that items were collected when they fell off clothing, or that buttons
were specifically collected in a jar or tin somewhere to be used in mending
clothing items.
Though the size, materials, and styles (i.e., shell verses porcelain, two hole
verses four hole, etc.) of the buttons vary, it is significant that most are very
plain. There were few decorative cut glass buttons, or showy mold-made metal
buttons, buttons with glass insets, or even molded bakelite buttons so common
on fine clothing items in the early twentieth century. Most buttons appear to be
of the simple sew through variety and are shirt-sized or undergarment sized.
The majority of buttons are made of shell, though porcelain and bone buttons
are also represented. In terms of cost, the porcelain buttons made from around
1850-1920 were the least expensive, while shell buttons were typically slightly
more expensive. Carved decorative, metal, and mold made glass buttons were
the most expensive (Sears, Roebuck & Co. 1902). This cost-related seriation
could bear light onto the type of washing the tenant occupants undertook.
Since fine outer clothing is only minimally represented, most of the washing
probably consisted of shirts, blouses, plain dresses, and undergarments. The
absence of expensive buttons from fine outer clothing might also indicate
something about whose clothing the tenants on Block 2 were washing. They
were probably not washing the fancy dresses of rich white ladies, but rather
taking in the everyday washing from other black and white residents who lived
nearby. Viewed in this sense, the laundering done by the project area women
was perhaps less a service performed for whites outside the black community
(as is often assumed), than one for those inside it. Hence, it may be possible to
perceive women’s home laundering as a form of entrepreneurship, rather than
unskilled service-oriented labor.
This is a significant distinction for the
dominant African American narrative, as it redefines the role black women
played in the economy of the early twentieth century, and reflects the simple
everyday tactics black women developed to control their own socio-economic
space.
Hair Styling and Haircuts
Hair care activities are reflected in several different types of artifacts across the
project area, and compared to other types of materials are quite visible with
respect to ethnicity. Though not analyzed with one of the major household
assemblages (because it post-dates 1950 and is associated with children at the
current Gregory Lincoln school), a molded plastic barrette, for instance,
references the small braids or pigtails often worn by African American girls.
Praetzellis & Praetzellis (1994) wrote about African American barbers and hair
styling practices in early twentieth century Sacramento, arguing that over 40
Vaseline jars found in a trash pit behind the Cook house represented home
barbering offered to nearby African American residents. Across the Gregory
Lincoln project area petroleum jelly jars were the most common bottle product
recorded during the project. Most of the specimens came from two contexts—
the Spillman trash pit and the tenant houses on Block 2. The Spillman trash pit
contained seven Vaseline jars or fragments, while the tenant house assemblage
contained at least three Chesebrough and three Moroline petroleum jelly jars.
These six jars from the tenant houses were clustered in and around Test Units 1

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

and 2. Significantly, a pair of scissors and two metal “hot combs,” used for hair
straightening were also found in the tenant house context in Test Unit 3 and
Trench 11. Hot combs were brass combs that could be heated and, with the
help of pomade, brushed through curly hair to straighten it. During the latter
twentieth century hot combs were electric. While it is not realistic to say with
certainty (though it is theoretically possible) that the tenant occupants on Block
2 were supplementing their income with home haircuts, it is worthwhile to point
out the prevalence of artifacts pertaining to hair care and grooming in the tenant
context in particular. Hair straightening was clearly an aspect of everyday
grooming for some project area residents.
Medicine and Health
Most of the medical and health care products found during the project address
primarily aches, hair and skin concerns, and stomach ailments. Conversely, few
marked bottles aimed at curing cough and flu symptoms were found, though
remedies for these ailments may have been purchased in unmarked bottles or
bottles with paper labels that were worn off. An unmarked brown bottle that
may have held hair dye or some sort of hair tonic recovered from the Spillman
assemblage again reflects concerns about hair care. Among the more common
types of bottles are lotion bottles. Pond’s Extract, A.S. Hinds Honey and Almond
Crème, and Jergens lotion are all represented in the tenant and Spillman
assemblages, and attest to concerns about dry skin, which would have been
particularly common among laborers, machinists, or any individual who worked
with their hands. Products such as Vicks Mentholatum and Va-tro-nol were
used for muscle aches and congestion, while Bromo-Seltzer bottles would have
cured stomach ailments. Enema apparatuses from four separate contexts (the
Spillman trash pit, the tenant houses, the Richardson household, and the area
under the track) show that home remedies for constipation and digestive
ailments was probably fairly widespread.
One medical artifact type that is noticeably absent from this assemblage,
however, is the local prescription bottle. Medicine bottles from local druggists
are very common on urban historical sites throughout Texas. For instance
during work on the Capitol Extension project in Austin, investigators recovered
several dozen bottles bearing the names of local druggists (Thomas and Adovasio
1996). The same was true was for the New City Hall Redevelopment Project that
investigated Austin’s Guy Town (Feit et al. 2003). Roger Moore reports a similar
abundance of this artifact type on urban sites in Houston (Moore, Personal
Communication 2007). However, in the Gregory Lincoln project area only one
local druggist bottle was found. The Spillman trash pit contained a single bottle
from the Hoencke Pharmacy, which was located at 520 W. Dallas in the 4th
Ward, close to downtown. Houston city directories for 1915 and 1922 list the
pharmacy as a white owned and managed business (Houston city directory
1915, 1922). In 1915 there were 83 druggists in Houston, several of whom did
business in the 4th Ward. The M.M. Boyd drugstore, for instance was located at
1404 San Felipe (W. Dallas), just a few blocks from the project area; and the
Cravens and Jones Pharmacy was located at 1019 McGowen, a few blocks to the
southeast.
It is interesting to speculate about why so few local drugstore bottles would be
found in the Gregory Lincoln project area, when so many nationally marketed
health products are well represented. Though according to one source, there
were five African American run druggists in Houston in 1915 (Wintz 1984),
clearly the majority of them were white owned and operated. It may be that

177

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

entrenched racism actively prohibited African Americans from patronizing these
white operated businesses during the Jim Crow era. On the other hand, the
absence of these bottles could represent a conscious tactic of consumption on
the part of African American residents. As Cook et al. (1996) have pointed out,
product consumption is a social act, rife with symbolism that by the early
twentieth century was also linked to self-realization. For an African American in
the Jim Crow south, the rejection of discriminatory white owned businesses may
have represented a political statement to some degree. During the 1920s, Clifton
Richardson, the editor of the Houston Informer called on African Americans to
do just that. He urged the community to make efforts to patronize African
American businesses as a means to economic solidarity, and ultimately
advancement (Wintz 1984). The act of purchasing nationally marketed raceblind products over racialized local products reflects meaningful action in this
same spirit.
Shared Commodities, Shared Community
The historical background sections for this report have already attempted to
draw attention to the communal aspects of the neighborhood—that is, despite a
certain degree of transience of some residents and the community’s increasing
ghettoization throughout the twentieth century, the project area formed a
cohesive community.
This is born out by documentary evidence that
demonstrates familial continuity and long term tenure not only on the part of
owners, but in some cases renters that made efforts to stay close to family
members. This is also reflected in employment patterns, and marriage patterns.
Finally, certain aspects of the material culture assemblage also show how
individual tastes and product purchasing patterns were shared, again
demonstrating how product consumption is linked to social networks.
The Spillman trash pit assemblage, for instance contains two patterned transfer
print ceramic types that match precisely a pattern used by another household.
The Richardson ceramic assemblage is dominated by sherds from a green
transfer print faux oriental pattern. A single sherd from this same pattern was
found in the Spillman trash pit assemblage. A second print—a blue floral
transfer ware print—was found both in the Spillman assemblage and in the
tenant house assemblage (Figure 8-7). While it may be reasonable to explain
the presence of the exact same pattern in two different contexts as the result of
site disturbance during demolition activities (which was clearly evident), it is
important to remember that the Spillman trash pit was a sealed feature, whose
top was buried under 20 centimeters of soil. According to documentary sources,
this pit was sealed by 1925 at the latest, then covered with a new structural
addition. Therefore, the only way those artifacts could have made their way into
the trash pit was through pre-1925 activities. The presence of the same pattern
in these different household contexts has several implications. First it implies
that project area residents shared similar aesthetic tastes. Lucy Spillman, who,
as previously noted owned a diverse collection of decorated wares, purchased
the same plates as her neighbor Annie Richardson. She was also attracted to
the same ceramic pattern as her neighbors in the tenant houses on the same
block. It also suggests that different households probably did their shopping at
many of the same establishments, and that these ceramics were something
available locally, perhaps stocked at one of the local markets.
Community is also reflected in children’s play. Children’s toys in all contexts
attest both to the more mundane aspects of household organization, aspirations,
and the role children played in creating neighborhood cohesion. In every

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

178

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

neighborhood, children and their play tend to bring separate families together to
form communities. Unlike adults, children have a much more fluid sense of
space and limits; their play cuts across yards, and brings social life to empty
lots, streets, and alleys.
Their care also crosses family boundaries, as
households will often share childcare. There is ample evidence for children’s
activities in the project area. Dolls, a large number of marbles, toy soldiers,
plastic checkers, a jack, a plastic cowboy, and even the feet of a Mr. Potato Head
represent children’s play in the form of toys. These were things children could
play with by themselves or together, outside or inside. They were things that
could be collected, shared, or traded. Toys embody the games we learn in
childhood that prepare us for adult life. They are projections of everyday life
onto a world of fantasy that runs parallel to reality (Stewart 1994).

A) From the Spillman household (Bag 69-3), B-C) from the tenant households (Bag 28-38); E-F) from the
Spillman household, and G-H) from the Richardson household (Bag 31-9).

In the project area, children’s toys account for only a small percentage of the
total functional assemblage relative to other categories such as kitchen or
architecture, but they were found in virtually every household context, making it
quite evident that children did live in the project area. Children’s toys,
particularly marbles were abundant from the tenant households on Block 2.
Marble shooting was an outdoor activity, and based on the recovery of 52 of
them from the tenant household context it is likely that this game was played
frequently in back yards. Not only in the tenant household context, but
throughout the project area, marbles were the most common type of toy, which
suggests a fair amount of outdoor play. Dolls and doll parts were the second
most common type of toy. Unlike marbles, which form a competitive, social
game with codified rules, dolls are interior toys that occupy the realm of pure
fantasy. Dolls are typically collected, clothed and animated. Like toy soldiers or
cowboy figurines, they symbolize in miniature the dreams and fantasies of the
children who play with them. The range of dolls and figurines (soldiers,
cowboys, toy vehicles) in the project was fairly typical of any late nineteenth or
twentieth century urban assemblage. One notable aspect about the dolls and

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

179

Chapter 8 – Discussion and Interpretation of Results

doll fragments, however, is that they were all white. Black skinned dolls were
available by the early twentieth century and have been documented on several
sites in Austin (Feit et al. 2003, Brown and Anthony 1993). Given that the
Gregory Lincoln project area was predominantly black, the investigators
expected to find examples of these in this context as well.
One artifact that embodies the spirit of children’s play above others is a glass jar
with holes drilled into the top for holding bugs (Figure 8-8). This artifact, made
from a baby food jar, is probably quite recent and was not associated with either
of the households analyzed in detail due to its disturbed context. Nonetheless, it
signifies outdoor play, movement through yards and streets, and it represents
the childlike tendency (for all of us) to collect, re-use, and make [adult] things
their own. Most importantly, it reflects how children and adults articulate to
create a sense of place.

CHAPTER 9 CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
By Rachel Feit
At the outset, this project had two aims—to confirm or deny the presence of
burials in the project area, and to investigate the potentially rich household
remains from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century populations that
lived here. Though considerable effort was expended in the search for graves,
none were found. This effort required a substantial portion of the time and
money budgeted for the project, leaving less for excavation and, more
importantly, interpretation of the household remains. The authors of this report
have done their best with the material and resources leftover to spotlight
meaningful patterns from the collected data.
Despite radical redevelopment in the 4th Ward over the past 20 years, not a
single compliance related archeological study has been conducted that
documents and analyzes with any rigor the everyday material culture of late
nineteenth and early twentieth century African Americans of Houston’s 4th
Ward. The Gregory Lincoln project represents the first to examine closely the
material record left by those residents who lived and worked near Houston’s
Freedmen’s Town. Archeological investigations for this project consisted of 55
trenches and 32 square meters of test units, documenting a number of historical
features, archeological surfaces, and artifacts that will help enrich the story of
the community during the early part of the twentieth century. It has given voice
to many people, such as the Spillmans, the Starks, the Richardsons, and more
transient individuals such as Viola Forshay, whose lives would otherwise have
gone unnoticed in the historical record. It has drawn heavily on research from
both African American and white archeological sites not just in Texas, but in
other parts of the country. The analysis has attempted to examine urban
development patterns and material culture collections in terms of the ways they
demonstrate identifiable patterns of consumption among the neighborhood
residents. The authors of this report argue that the material culture from this
project highlights a certain amount of specificity with respect to yards, product
acquisition patterns, and aesthetic preferences.
Social theorists have pointed out the democratizing effect mass production,
industrialization, new forms of transportation, and urbanization had on
consumers in America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
(Fjellman 1992). These forces allowed for an unprecedented access to goods and
services that was in some ways blind with respect to race, class, gender, and
ethnicity.
In the industrialized capitalist system, individuals became
“disembedded” from the traditional economy as they transformed themselves
from identifiable producers to anonymous consumers (Fjellman 1992). This
trend has continued unabated into the twenty-first century. Under this system,
however, consumption overshadows production and things assume primary
importance in creating identity. As Susan Stewart (1994) writes, “the function of
belongings within the economy of the bourgeois subject is one of
supplementarity, a supplementarity that in consumer culture replaces its
generating subject.” In other words, the things we choose to buy and choose to
save are acts of self-expression. They say something about who we are, who we
identify with, or sometimes what we long to be.

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

Chapter 9 – Conclusions and Recommendations

It has been theorized that African Americans in particular embraced
consumerism after the Civil War as part of a set of tactics allowing them to
negotiate the dominant structure of institutionalized racism throughout the
country (Mullins 1999). In Race and Affluenc,e Mullins used archival and
archeological data to convincingly argue that “in the wake of Emancipation,
African Americans placed great conviction in the capacity of commodities to
improve their lives, and they recognized the symbolic privilege of entering
consumer space (Mullins 1999).” This report contends that the material
assemblage from the intact early twentieth century households in the Gregory
Lincoln project does suggest a sort of tactical consumerism, one that privileges
urbanism over pastoralism, and one in which consumers made choices (whether
conscious or unconscious) about their things, as expressions of their attitudes
and aspirations. Some of the artifacts such as the ceramics, an abundance of
jewelry, or certain grooming items also can be seen to represent and a series of
aesthetic choices or collection strategies, even as they reflect the more mundane
needs of eating, clothing, or styling one’s hair.
One final artifact is telling in this regard. It is a 1965 bottle base from the
Shiloh Battlefield in Tennessee, where one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil
War occurred (Figure 9-1). The 1862 battle represented a major Confederate
defeat, and served as a turning point in the war, paving the way for Union
victory, and ultimately the end of slavery. Given its association with an African
American neighborhood, it is tempting to read considerable symbolic meaning
into this artifact.
The recorded provenience information attached to it-­
shallowly buried (less than 10cm) in Trench 45-- provides few clues about
intentionality. The 1965 date on it suggests that it could have been a bottle
whose contents were first consumed, then the vessel was collected (at least for a
time) as a souvenir of a trip, as a reminder of the African American experience in
this country, or even as a poignant symbol of freedom. Likewise, it may have
had personal significance, as it could have been saved by someone whose
grandfather, or great grandfather fought at the battle of Shiloh. The larger 4th
Ward/Freedmen’s Town context for the artifact, however, cannot be ignored, and
it is reasonable to imagine that the artifact was a souvenir of sorts, the function
of which, Susan Stewart writes, is to displace attention onto the past (Stewart
1994). Souvenirs compress actions, events, thoughts, and feelings of the past
into a single object. They represent one of the ways we give meaning to our
things, and our things give meaning to us in a culture of consumption.
Archeology, as the study of historical things is well poised to explore those
significances.
The investigators acknowledge that the data from this study have only begun to
be interpreted. Time and budgetary constraints require that research choices be
made, often at the expense of other avenues of inquiry. We have chosen to
document and interpret the data to well beyond what the budget for this project
actually allowed, and have focused on some of the ways that the material
culture consumption and use by the neighborhood’s African American residents
in the early twentieth century may actually have differed from white
consumption. However, many research questions are possible. For instance, a
more rigorous sifting of the faunal material might reveal better data about
foodways, particularly with respect to the influences the local Italian groceries
had on African American eating patterns in the early twentieth century. As
photographs of Italian markets in Houston during the early decades of the
twentieth century show (Figure 9-2), it is clear that all of these markets stocked
traditional Italian meats—prosciutto, guanciale, pancetta, salami, etc. Do the
bones from these cuts (the prosciutto comes from a foreshank, for instance)

may imply that some of the Italian markets were home canning and selling these
products to local residents. How did these products influence the ways African
Americans ate? Despite the small efforts of this study to examine through
research and material culture how the Italian grocers may have articulated with
the surrounding African American population, their relationship is still only a
poorly understood and largely forgotten aspect to Houston’s heritage. Other
types of material from this project that could be studied in greater detail include
toys and jewelry, the architectural items, or even if one wished to delve into
aspects of the more recent past, the significant quantity of alcohol bottles found

from the most recent contexts.
Researchers with different theoretical
perspectives moreover, may ask different questions of the data to illuminate still
more aspects of the lives and material culture of the project area residents.
The authors hope that this study can be used to some degree as a springboard
from which to launch future research and other types of inquiries. It is hoped
that the results from this project, which demonstrates some of the specificity of
African American material culture consumption and use, even into the twentieth
century, will lead to more and better research about urban lifeways in late
nineteenth and early twentieth century Texas.
This project was conducted as a cultural resource management study, which
means that it was completed using public money, in advance of a publicly
funded project, as a means to comply with Federal or State legislation. More
specifically, this project was conducted in advance of the redevelopment of the
Gregory Lincoln school, and fell under the Antiquities Code of Texas. In
completing its compliance responsibilities the Houston Independent School
District was required to ensure that no archeological properties that were eligible
as State Archeological Landmarks would be affected. Properties eligible as State
Archeological Landmarks as liberally defined in THC’s Rules of Practice and
Procedure as:
a) Preservation of materials is sufficient to allow application of standard
archeological techniques to advantage;
b) The majority of the artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of
the sites original characteristics can be defined through investigation;
c) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative cultural historic by
the addition of the new information;
d) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
e) The site offers a unique or rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or
method of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge.
The project area consists of ten individual sites (41HR1008-41HR1017)
corresponding to individual blocks. Of those ten sites, there were three-- Site
41HR1010 (Block 2), 41HR1012 (Block 4) and 41HR1013 (Block 5)-- that might
have satisfied the above criteria, as they contained intact features and artifacts
pertaining to an ill-understood African American neighborhood in Houston at
the turn of the century. And it was their potential for SAL designation that
resulted in test unit sampling of these three sites during this project. However,
in a 1999 policy decision, the Texas Historical Commission stated that most late
nineteenth and early twentieth century sites “do not warrant extensive
excavations because the data recovered will not make a substantive contribution
to our understanding of the human activities that occurred at these sites.
(Denton 1999).” It further stated that, “In general, late nineteenth and early
twentieth century sites are not considered eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (Denton 1999).” While many archeologists may not
agree with this policy, it has nevertheless, been the operative principle for
historic archeological site evaluation and assessment in Texas since 1999.
With these considerations in mind, prior to the start of investigations, the
Principal Investigator defined the types of potential resources in the project area
that would be considered SAL-eligible as 1) burials; 2) intact pre-1880s
Freedmen’s Town occupation remains; and/or 3) well-preserved occupational
remains or complexes of features that can contribute data to key research
questions.

Cultural Resources – HISD Freedmen’s Town – September 2007

184

Chapter 9 – Conclusions and Recommendations

While the investigation did produce a variety of interpretable features and
artifacts, it was the opinion of the Principal Investigator that it did not uncover
any archeological remains that met any of the three criteria outlined above,
allowing a site to be eligible as a State Archeological Landmark, and hence
would warrant further investigation. The investigation did not uncover any
archeological evidence of early Freedmen’s Town or pre-1880 occupations
(though three were known through archival research). Nor did it uncover any
particularly unique early twentieth century remains or complexes of features
within this urban setting that might be worthy of preservation in place, or
further data recovery. It did find a number of interpretable features and
artifacts that have been analyzed and documented through this report.
However, the remains were periodic, and the project area lacked the widespread
integrity to warrant extensive further work under the framework of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. It was felt that the existing sample was sufficient to
begin to address some of the research issues. Finally, investigations did not
document any cemeteries, isolated burials or human remains. Given the
number and placement of trenches across the project area it is very unlikely
that a large cemetery is actually present on the property.
In an interim letter dated November 22, 2005, it was recommended that under
the guidelines of the Texas Antiquities Code no further archeological fieldwork
was required relative the historic household, commercial, or church-related
properties within the project area. However, due to the possibility that isolated
burials could be present in areas not excavated during the project, H&C
recommended monitoring the site during construction. If any human remains
were found during construction, all work would have ceased until these remains
could be documented, the proper notifications sent out, and an appropriate
burial treatment plan developed.
Monitoring was conducted from June 16 through October 27, 2006 and found
no evidence of human remains (Appendix D). The THC concurred that no SALeligible properties were affected by the project in December 18, 2006. This
report is presented as a final report of field investigations under TAC Permit
3837.

FAUNAL ANALYSIS

FREEDMEN’S TOWN FAUNAL ANALYSIS
By LeeAnna Schniebs

INTRODUCTION
A total of 2,487 faunal specimens were recovered from three sites during the Freedmenstown project
in Harris County, Texas. Total weight of the entire collection is 6,919.2 grams. Specimens from five levels at
two sites (41HR1010 and 41HR1012) and four levels at one site (41HR1013) were examined. The purpose of
the faunal analysis is to determine subsistence patterns of the occupants in the early 1900s, including the
utilization of domestic livestock and butchering techniques as well as the use of available natural resources.
The following report discusses the methods employed in the faunal analysis and results of taxonomic
identification and quantification of the faunal assemblage.
METHODOLOGY
All vertebrate remains were inventoried using Excel 5.0 to manipulate the generated data. An Ohaus
digital scale, Model CT600-S, was used to record bone weight. Identifications were made to the most specific
category possible depending on condition of the bone and available comparative material. Only positive
identifications resulted in the assignment of elements to genus or species.
Standard zooarchaeological methods have been used. The animal bones were collected by the Hicks
and Company archeological field crew of Austin, Texas, then submitted for identification and quantification.
Both unidentifiable and identifiable pieces were analyzed in similar fashion. That is, the same attributes were
recorded: taxon, element and portion of that element, anatomical location of the element, age when possible,
burning, gnawing, and presence of modification if applicable. Provenience information from the bag tags was
also recorded.
Quantification of the assemblage is summarized as number of identified specimens per taxon (NISP)
and as minimum number of individuals (MNI) for identified elements. The minimum numbers method was
chosen as the most suitable analytical measure of abundance. It involves no hypotheses and is purely factual.
The minimum number of animals that the bones could have come from is an “indisputable fact (Chaplin
1971)”. The fragments method and the weights method to quantify results require too many assumptions as to
processing techniques and post-mortem and/or post-depositional preservation.
The Freedmenstown project area was originally divided into blocks, then later each block was given a
site number. MNI estimates were calculated according to the most frequently occurring element in each site,
based on symmetry and element portion (Munzel 1986). In the mammalian class, usually teeth are used
whenever possible. Teeth retained in socket are recorded but not counted or weighed. Loose teeth (those not
in socket) are counted and weighed as separate elements. This allows for MNI calculations without elevating
specimen counts or skewing the data. However, very few teeth were recovered from these sites. In some
cases, complete long bones and proximal or distal ends were considered. In other cases, the presence of a
single element constituted an MNI of one.
The faunal data tables in this report are standard species lists with the number of occurrences for each
animal. Those specimens regarded as unidentifiable (those coded to only class) have been consolidated into a
few general categories. Elements of nondiagnostic skeletal value (unidentifiable fragments, ribs, vertebrae,
and long bone shafts; Olsen 1964), are coded in an indeterminate category by class and size range. For
example, specimens counted as “small mammal” is rabbit-size, “medium mammal” is at least raccoon or
sheep/goat-size, “large mammal” refers to smaller cow or pig-size mammal, and “very large mammal” is

1

larger cow or pig. “Indeterminate vertebrate” includes the bones of unidentifiable class. Recording these
specimens in a size category enables the most precise level of observation as the specimen allows. In small
samples, taking note of weight and the size categories of nondiagnostic elements broadens the function of the
bone assemblage. However, percentages referred to in this report are calculated by number of bones (NISP)
rather than weight. Complete inventories of the faunal collection by site can be found in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
RESULTS
The following section describes all of the vertebrate taxa recovered from the three sites. Taxonomic
classes identified include fish, bird, and mammal (marsupialia, lagomorpha, rodentia, carnivora, and
artiodactyla). Number of identified specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals (MNI) for each
taxon are summarized in Table 4, as are weights for each taxon and percentages of the assemblage.
Assemblage Composition
Class Osteichthyes
Order indeterminate: Ten elements from unidentifiable medium fish are included in the
Freedmenstown assemblage. Eight specimens were recovered from seven units at 41HR1010, one spinous
process was found in Unit 9 at 41HR1012, and one vertebra came from Unit 16 at 41HR1013. Four elements
from 41HR1010 are burned. Unfortunately, budgetary constraints prevented further analysis of these fish
remains by a specialist.
Order Perciformes, Family Sciaenidae: Freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) is represented by
three elements. Two spinous processes were recovered from Unit 7 at 41HR1010, and one vertebra was found
in Unit 9. None of the specimens are burned. The preferred habitat of the freshwater drum includes lake
shallows and large rivers, and it produces a grunting sound that is audible to man (Collins 1959).
Order Perciformes, Family Lutjanidae: Snapper (Lutjanus sp.) was recovered from Unit 10b at
41HR1010. This premaxillary fragment is not burned. The snapper is a carnivorous, salt water fish, and is
available in the Gulf of Mexico. It is much sought by anglers and relished by connoisseurs (Collins 1959)
because of it’s good flavor.
The presence of fish remains in the collection is not unusual, as the project area is in close proximity
to aquatic habitats. Some of the fish probably occupied the fluctuating local creeks and bayous, and could
have been caught by netting, trot lines, fishing poles, or purchased in local markets.
Class Ave
Order Galliformes, Family Phasianidae: Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) is represented by 66
fragments. Several units at 41HR1010 yielded 60 specimens, and six specimens came from three units at
41HR1012. A minimum of three individuals were present at 41HR1010, and 41HR1012 has an MNI of one.
Fifteen elements from 41HR1010 are burned. At least some of the bones recorded as medium bird are
probably the remains of chicken as well.
Family Phasianidae is also represented by turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Three units at 41HR1010
yielded five elements, two fragments came from Feature 37 at 41HR1012, and one toe bone was found in Unit
20 at 41HR1013. Only two pieces from 41HR1010 are burned. Each site has an MNI of one. These are

2

probably the remains of domestic birds. The wild turkey’s range is south and west of the project area, but was
likely available in local wooded areas. Turkey bones may reflect holiday meals, such as Thanksgiving and/or
Christmas. The unidentifiable large bird bones may also be turkey remains.
Class Mammalia
Order Marsupialia, Family Didelphidae: Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is represented by
one scapula fragment. It was recovered from Unit 11a at 41HR1010. The specimen is not burned. Opossums
are primarily inhabitants of deciduous woodlands preferring hollow trees, but are often found in prairies,
marshes, and farmlands (Davis 1978).
Sometimes it is hunted for sport, especially in the South, but the edible meat is oily.
Occasionally it is blamed for poultry raids, but also consumes many mice and insects. The
fur is salable, but of little value (Burt and Grossenheider 1980).
Order Lagomorpha, Family Leporidae: Six indeterminate rabbit bones were recovered from two sites.
One specimen was found in Unit 5 at 41HR1010, and five pieces came from two units at 41HR1012. None of
the bones are burned, but one femur fragment from 41HR1012 is sawed. These specimens are either
jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) or swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus). However, the range of the jackrabbit
bisects Harris County, and is limited to the western half.
Order Lagomorpha, Family Leporidae: Cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.) is represented by two
elements. One fragment was recovered from Unit 10a at 41HR1010, and one specimen came from Unit 8
(Feature 37) at 41HR1012. Neither pieces are burned. Two species of cottontail inhabit the project area: the
Eastern cottontail (S. floridanus) prefers heavy brush, strips of forest with open areas, edges of swamps, and
weed patches; swamp rabbit (S. aquaticus) prefers swamps, marshes, and wet bottomlands (Burt and
Grossenheider 1980). Osteologically, the swamp rabbit is the largest of the cottontails within its range (Davis
1978). Based on fragmented elements, a specific identification was not recorded. Rabbits are easily procured
by hunters and frequently found in archeological faunal assemblages.
Order Rodentia, Family Cricetidae: Woodrat (Neotoma sp.) is represented at 41HR1010 and
41HR1012 by one cranial fragment at each site. Specific identification was not recorded. Florida woodrat (N.
floridana) is the only woodrat that occurs in the project area, and has a wide range of habitats including
swamplands to forested uplands (Davis 1978). These specimens are not considered subsistence debris.
Order Carnivora, Family Procyonidae: Raccoon (Procyon lotor) is represented by one burned ulna
fragment recovered from Unit 11a at 41HR1010. The range of the raccoon includes the project area, occurring
throughout all of Texas and most of the country. The preferred habitats are streams and lake borders near
wooded areas or rock cliffs (Burt and Grossenheider 1980). They seldom occur far from water, and do much
of their foraging near or in bodies of water (Davis 1978).
Order Carnivora, Family Felidae: Domestic cat (Felis domesticus) is represented by three fragments
recovered from two levels in two units at 41HR1012. The presence of house cat is not unusual, as feral and
domestic cats were probably quite numerous in the community, and aided in the control of rodent overpopulation.
Order Artiodactyla, Family Suidae: Pig (Sus scrofa) is represented by a total of 23 specimens from
the three sites. Eleven elements were recovered from seven units at 41HR1010, ten elements came from three

3

units at 41HR1012, and two units at 41HR1013 yielded two long bone fragments. Each site has an MNI of at
least one, including evidence of immature individuals. The domestic pig is derived from the European wild
boar, and is an example of a domestic animal used entirely to man’s own ends. Element composition includes
parts from all anatomical locations, although cranial elements are few. The lower limb bones may be the
remnants of pig’s feet a food still popular today and available in many stores. Although rib bones were
recorded in the general categories, undoubtedly pork ribs were a part of the diet. In addition, at least some of
the specimens recorded as large mammal and very large mammal can be considered the remains of pig as
well. Pigs can become very large beasts very quickly, even at a young age. Only four pig fragments are
burned, recovered from 41HR1010.
Order Artiodactyla, Family Bovidae: Domestic cow (Bos taurus) is represented by a total of 40
specimens from the three sites. Five units at 41HR1010 yielded 17 elements, and 21 fragments came from two
units at 41HR1012, including the presence of immature individuals at both sites. Two pieces came from
41HR1013. Again, at least some of the specimens recorded as large mammal and very large mammal are
probably cow. Three cow bones are burned, and all came from 41HR1010.
Family Bovidae is also represented by Ovis/Capra (sheep or goat). A total of 14 specimens were
recovered from the three sites. Four long bone fragments came from three units at 41HR1010, including an
immature metacarpal. Nine fragments were found in three units at 41HR1012, and one tibia fragment came
from Trench 31 at 41HR1013. Two sheep/goat bones from 41HR1010 are burned.
Distinguishing the difference between domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic goat (Capra hircus)
is one of the oldest and most perplexing questions in osteology. Compounding the problem are the great
variety of breeds. So even comparative specimens have a lot of variety, and therefore, assessing a definitive
set of exclusionary characteristics is difficult. Diagnostic attributes are subtle and hard to recognize. Also,
much of the reference material does not differentiate between sheep and goat. Sheep/goat may also be
represented by at least some of the unidentifiable large mammal remains in the Freedmenstown faunal
assemblage.
Assemblage Condition
In general, the Freedmenstown faunal collection is well preserved, although iron oxide staining and
slight exfoliation was observed on some specimens. Again, budget and time restrictions prevented recording
specific taphonomic patterns. Much of the assemblage is highly fragmented, which explains the low
identifiability rate. Most pieces are small fragments from larger bones, especially vertebral spinous processes,
ribs, and other miscellaneous flat bones, such as scapulae and pelves. There are very few identifiable cranial
elements in the entire project collection. Element composition is summarized in Table 5. Six hundred thirty
four bone fragments are burned, and they were all recovered from 41HR1010 (Table 6). This is probably the
result of trash disposal rather than cooking or catastrophic events. The absence of burned bones at the other
two sites is perplexing, but perhaps trash was disposed of by burying rather than burning or disposed of in
another location. Rodent activity in the project area was limited, as only four pieces from 41HR1010 are
rodent gnawed. There is no evidence of scavenging activity, as none of the bones are carnivore gnawed.
However, the opossum and raccoon may have been scavengers.
Butchering evidence was observed on a total of 621 fragments (Table 7), including two cut and
snapped pieces from 41HR1010 and two pieces with slight cuts from 41HR1012. The remaining specimens
are sawed. The only other modified bone is a burned fragment from Level 2 in Trench 14, Unit 7, at
41HR1010. It is probably the remnant of a handle, possibly a toothbrush or kitchen utensil.

SUMMARY
41HR1010 yielded 1,408 faunal specimens. They were recovered from several units and features in
three trenches and four units outside of trenches. The majority was recovered from Trench 10 (N=510), 36%
of the assemblage. The site sample is dominated by unidentifiable large mammal remains (N=1,144), but also
includes a diverse assortment of identifiable dietary remains comprised of drum, snapper, chicken, turkey,
rabbits, pig, cow, and sheep/goat. The recovery of the single raccoon and opossum bones may be intrusive
rather than subsistence debris, but in times of stress they may have been eaten. The woodrat is surely
intrusive. Distribution of the 41HR1010 faunal collection by provenience is summarized in Table 8.
41HR1012 yielded 962 faunal specimens, recovered from Units 8, 9, and 11 in Trench 33 (including
Feature 37), and Unit 11 outside of the trench. Taxonomic recovery is similar to that of 41HR1010, except for
the absence of snapper and the addition of house cat. Distribution is summarized in Table 9.
41HR1013 is significantly smaller in quantity, yielding only 117 faunal specimens (Table 10). They
were recovered from four trenches including Feature 21. Again, the diet is comprised of fish, chicken, turkey,
pig, cow, and sheep/goat. It is dominated by unidentifiable large mammal bone fragments (N=95), which are
probably a mixture of the pig, cow, and sheep/goat remains.
The Freedmenstown faunal assemblage appears to be a typical collection of subsistence debris from
the area in this time period. Utilization of store-bought butchered meat, supplemented by game animals
available to the hunter or fisherman is suggestive of a well-developed urban economic-subsistence pattern.
The residents probably no longer needed to raise and butcher animals for food; it was simply purchased at the
local market.
Small game is present in the Freedmenstown faunal collection, but the majority of food remains are
cuts of meat from butchered, domesticated animals. Unfortunately, specific cuts of meat were generally
indiscernable, as most of the butchered bones could only be classified as unidentifiable fragments from large
or very large mammal. Sawed long bones are the most common butchered element identified, with smaller
quantities of sawed ribs, scapulae, vertebra, and pelves. A summary of these butchered elements by site can
be found in Table 11. The cuts with the highest meat value are the humerus and femur. Inferences as to meat
preferences, such as pork vs. beef, cannot be made due to limited information because of budgetary
constraints. The use of oral histories and other references combined with the faunal analysis should aid in the
identification of the particular resources preferred.

RESULTS OF GPR SURVEY

1504 WEST 5TH STREET AUSTIN, TEXAS 78703 TEL: 512.478.0858 FAX: 512.

August 15, 2005
Dr. James Bruseth
Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer
Texas Historical Commission
P.O. Box 12276
Austin, TX 78711-2276
Re: Permit 3837. Summary of GPR investigations
Dear Dr. Bruseth:
This letter report serves as a summary interim letter for the GPR investigations of the
HISD 4th Ward Property in Houston, Texas, Permit #3837. Investigations were
conducted July 13-15, 2005 by Hicks & Company and Anthony & Brown Consulting.
Rachel Feit of Hicks & Company served as Principal Investigator and oversaw Gradall
trenching, which was proposed as part of this project. The results of that effort are
included in this letter. David Brown and Dana Anthony performed the GPR survey.
Their draft summary of the radar survey is attached. The radar survey documented over
400 anomalies, only 30 of which deemed of historical interest or worthy of further study.
The remaining anomalies were attributed to grass clumps, posts, surface features, or
buried utilities. The patterning and signature of the anomalies did not generally match
those of burials. However, Brown & Anthony’s report recommends that the 30 or so
significant anomalies be investigated.
Two Gradall trenches was dug in support of the GPR survey. Heavy rain impeded not
only recording of one trench, but also excavation of additional trenches. Rain hindered
work on the afternoons of July 13th, 14th, and during the most of the 15th. By the time July
14th’s deluge ended, both excavated trenches had completely filled with water (Figure 1).
Nevertheless, the trenching provided some useful data from which to plan future
excavation efforts.
Each of the trench corners were recorded using a hand-held Trimble Geo XT GPS, as
were basic landmarks such as the track, fence corners, and the areas investigated by
radar. Gradall Trench 1 was examined and profiled. Gradall Trench 2 was examined but
the Principal Investigator did not have time to profile or photograph the trench before
heavy rains occurred.

Results of Gradall Trenching
Gradall Trench 1 (Figure 2) was placed over a previous soil boring which was dug
toward the eastern side of the track for the Gregory Lincoln school. According to the
archeological monitoring report for the geotechnical soil borings that were dug on the
property in January 2005, Soil Boring 19 contained bone, metal, and a nail buried
between 120-180 centimeters below ground surface (Garcia-Herreros 2005), suggesting
deeply buried deposits.
Gradall Trench 1 revealed three very distinct zones of historic fill, overlying undulating
and undisturbed Beaumont clays. The historic fill zones comprised two sandy clay loams
separated by a clean sand fill (Figure 3). The uppermost sediment contained pull tabs,
glass and other lightly scattered artifacts that post-date the mid-twentieth century. The
lower sandy clay historic era sediment was slightly more compact and contained a denser
scatter of mainly early twentieth century artifacts, scattered oyster shell, and occasional
bricks or brick fragments (see Table 1 for artifact list).
The two lowest stratigraphic components within Trench 1 were marked by Pleistocene
clays. A very dark grayish brown, dense silty clay represents the younger of the two
sediments. This soil featured scattered patches of laminated sand and clay in its upper
stratigraphy, close to the contact point with the overlying historic fill. Additionally, the
soil contained ferrous sandy deposits, resembling brick, throughout. Below this clay was
a Ck horizon composed of very compact, mottled silty clay with pea-sized caliche
concretions.
Nothing resembling grave or burial outlines was observed in either trench. In fact, the
lower Beaumont formation clays of both trenches were virtually undisturbed. A possible
foundation feature was noted in Gradall Trench 1, approximately one meter from the
trench’s eastern edge. The feature was within the lowest historic fill zone, buried
approximately 35 centimeters below ground surface. The feature consisted of a welldefined cluster of bricks and half bricks arranged in a generally linear manner. Though
the bricks appeared to be not fully in situ, they were tightly clustered enough to suggest a
slightly disturbed foundation remnant. The principal investigator also noted a small
amount of sandy mortar in between the bricks, again implying a foundation remnant.
This feature was not fully recorded before the rain began. However its position was
marked and it will be potentially investigated as part of the test excavations for this
project.
Gradall Trench 2 revealed the same general stratigraphic pattern as that of Gradall Trench
1, though the stratigraphy appeared be somewhat compressed, with thinner, shallower
historic fill zones and thinner Beaumont clays. The maximum depth of Gradall Trench 2
reached no more than one meter, with the lower mottled Beaumont clay appearing at
approximately 80 centimeters below ground surface.
Discussion
Limited Gradall trenching found no evidence of burials or grave shafts in the areas
investigated under the Gregory-Lincoln School track. The observed Beaumont clays
underlying the historic period fill looked to be virtually undisturbed. It was extremely
compact and uniform throughout each soil zone.

At issue for the testing phase was that the soil boring data suggested that historic deposits
could be buried under 180 centimeters of historic fill (Garcia-Herreros, 2005). The two
trenches dug under the track revealed that the soil boring data may have been
misinterpreted. According to the report many of the borings revealed brick fragments
and brick dust in sediments below 60 centimeters from ground surface. However,
Gradall Trenches 1 and 2 both exhibited an indigenous soil marked by ferrous sandy
inclusions whose color and texture resembles eroded brick. This sediment underlies the
more obvious historic era fills and sediments, and, as observed in Gradall Trenches 1 and
2, appears to be completely undisturbed.
Historic fill zones in both trenches were readily apparent and extend to no more than 60
centimeters below the ground surface. Thus it can be expected that any historic period
features and cultural deposits (apart from burials) will be shallow north Andrews Street.
It is likely that the same is true for the areas south of Andrews street as well. A review of
the soil boring data indicates that most historic period artifacts were found in the upper
60 centimeters, with the exception of three borings (#s 2, 3, and 11). These three borings
found metal or glass fragments in deposits between 60-121 centimeters below ground
surface. The same soil monitoring report found no cultural material (other than the
potentially misinterpreted “brick fragments”) below 121 centimeters below ground
surface.
Once again, this interim letter and attached report are intended to summarize the GPR
investigations that took place in July of 2005 at the HISD 4th ward property in Houston.
Investigations did not document any burials, but did find some anomalies that could
represent isolated burials or historical occupation features. It is proposed that these
anomalies be investigated as part of the testing phase (Stage 3) for the archeological
testing project. The results of the GPR survey will be finalized and integrated into the
final Testing Report, to be submitted following test trenching and excavations. Please

ABSTRACT
A subsurface interface radar survey was conducted by Anthony & Brown for select areas of a tract of
land owned by the Houston Independent School District adjacent to Freedman’s Town in the Fourth Ward of
Houston. This area included portions of Gregory-Lincoln school as well as the proposed Houston School for
the Performing Arts. The study was conducted at the request of Hicks & Company, the archaeological
contractor for the project. A total of 72 runs in four high probability areas were completed. These areas
included a portion of a concrete basketball court, a grass-covered football field/track, brick-paved Andrews
Street and a small grass-covered lot south of the street. In all, 441 anomalies were recorded. Oral histories
have indicated that graves were present beneath present-day Andrews Street although no discreet grave
patterns were noted. In addition, the remaining three areas investigated were chosen because they had little or
no development on them through the years with preservation of any subsurface features more likely. As with
Andrews Street, no definitive grave outlines or patterning was apparent. However, the large number of
anomalies may include isolated graves rather than a regularly patterned cemetery. It is more likely though
that the anomalies represent many of the disturbances recognized on the surface such as water lines, athletic
and electrical poles, fencing and grading. Nevertheless, there are areas that are recommended for grade all
scraping to verify the nature of the anomalies.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Hicks & Company Inc., a subsurface interface radar (SIR) investigation was
conducted for select areas of a tract of land planned for development by the Houston Independent School
District. The study was conducted on 14-16 July 2005, by David Brown and Dana Anthony with help from
Rachel Feit from Hicks and Company. This report presents an analysis of the data collected during the three
days in the field. The primary purpose of the investigations was to assess the potential for radar investigations
at the site and to examine a series of areas with a high probability for the location of a reported historic
cemetery. Though not known definitively to be within the project area but thought to be nearby, it is
reportedly a post-Civil War cemetery for Union soldiers (Fred McGee, personal communication, 2004).
Ground penetrating radar investigations have been utilized in prospection at archaeological sites
around the world, with investigations of both historic and prehistoric sites yielding productive results
(Conyers and Goodman 1997; Heimmer 1992; Vaughan 1986). Because of radar’s ability to locate buried
features such as walls, foundations, and pits, it has been particularly successful in historical archaeology and
the study of prehistoric structural remains. In Texas, SIR investigations have been useful in the location of
buried cultural features in both far West Texas (Brown 1992; Brown and Frederick 1994; Brown et al. 2000;
Driver and Brown 1994) as well as East Texas (Brown 1998, 1999; Brown and Anthony 1998; Brown,
Anthony and Thoms 1997). SIR investigations have also been successful in studies of cemeteries of various
ages in a variety of settings (Goodman and Nishimura 1993; Mellett and Geismar 1990; Persons 1990),
including the Rio Grande Valley near El Paso (Driver and Brown 1993; Willis 2002), the Hill Country near
Kerrville (Brown 1993; Brown and Driver 1993), and in East Texas (Galan, Smith and Brown 1999).
The Gregory-Lincoln School SIR study used a SIR-2000 system manufactured by Geophysical
Survey Systems, Inc., with a 270 MHz antenna. This antenna is capable of moderate resolution, down to
about a foot or less, with a maximum effective range of more than 30 feet under ideal conditions. SIR is an
active electromagnetic prospection system that transmits a low frequency electromagnetic signal from an
antenna located near the ground surface. As subsurface materials of differing electric potential are
encountered, the original transmitted signal may be absorbed or reflected back towards the antenna. These
returning signals are registered by a receiving antenna located beside the transmitter. A virtual subsurface
profile which records differential electrical potential is constructed by this register of the reflected waves,
with rapidly returning waves logged first and later returns logged after these in the data set for each run. The
image of returning waves, visible on the built-in computer screen of the SIR-2000, can be varied by a series
of controls and filters which affect the processing of the signal as well as its presentation. The soil depth
represented by the image is controlled by varying the cutoff of return times of the waves in nanoseconds
(billionths of a second).
The return times are dependent upon the velocity of the electromagnetic waves through the
subsurface material. Since velocities can vary dramatically for different soil materials (and for the same
material under different conditions of moisture), the return time in nanoseconds could represent very different
depths and it is up to the operator to estimate the electrical potential of the sediments being investigated (short
of actually testing the electromagnetic potential of the sediments in a laboratory). The conductivity of a
particular material is described as its dielectric potential and is occasionally expressed in two-way slowness
values (i.e., the travel time down and back in certain materials per a given distance unit such as a meter).
Sample values are listed in the SIR operation manual (Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. 1994:22-23). These
values range from 2 nanoseconds to travel a foot and back in air to 18 nanoseconds round trip travel in a foot
of water, one of the slowest materials. The sandy loam surface soil, found south of Gregory-Lincoln school,
have return trip values that range from 13 nanoseconds per foot in dry conditions to 25.5 nanoseconds per
foot in wet conditions. The underlying Beaumont clay is for all practical purposes impenetrable by the radar.

At best, these values represent ideal conditions. Moisture content can drastically alter the values. The
degree of soil structure, soil cracking, gravel and caliche horizons can also alter these theoretical averages.
While sandy soils are generally the best medium for radar investigations (Brown 1992; Brown and Frederick
1994), good results are possible under certain conditions in areas with clayey and caliche-rich soils (Brown
1993, 1998, 1999; Brown and Driver 1993).
METHODS
The Gregory-Lincoln school tract is located south of Buffalo Bayou just west of downtown. The total
area is a bit less than 17 acres, with the extant school located on the northernmost segment. All houses have
been removed form the southern segment in anticipation of construction of the new Gregory Lincoln School
and the Houston High School for the performing arts. While no structures remains, the area has trees,
telephone poles, and other remnants of the former occupation, including areas of obvious fill along Taft Street
to the west. The surface in this former residential area is relatively uneven, with ruts, holes, and oyster-shell
fill in some places. The streets in this area are also narrow, uneven, and filled with patches. East-west runs
were undertaken on the narrow streets.
At the northern end the areas of interest are covered by the football field and running track as well as
an outdoor basketball court adjacent to the extant building. Although the basketball court is paved with
concrete, the area has considerable grass in cracks, as well as a number of metal pole bases set into the
concrete, probably holders for poles for other games. With the basketball hoop supports, light poles, a high
cyclone fence lining the study area, and with the building immediately adjacent to the north, the area was not
ideal for radar investigations. South of the court, the cinder running track is edged with concrete and was not
amenable to north-south passes. In the corners on either side of the track are concrete extensions and lowmounded areas, neither of which was suitable for radar. In the end, the field within the track was the only area
subjected to radar. Though the surface is flat, the clump grass did interfere with radar passes, and the semicircular study area was not ideal for areal analysis. Despite less than ideal conditions, north-south runs were
completed in both the basketball and track areas.
As examined by grade-all trenches excavated during the radar phase, the soils are about 50
centimeters of sandy loam/sandy clay loam over Beaumont clay. While the underlying clay is not generally
amenable to radar investigations, the upper sediments are normally appropriate. And in theory, if burial pits
were excavated down into the clay and filled with the overlying material or a mixed fill, they also should be
visible to the radar investigations.
As noted above, the Gregory-Lincoln SIR field investigations were carried out on the 14-16 July
2005. A series of four high probability areas were chosen by Hicks & Company based on analysis of the
Sanborn maps and the historic research of project historian Janet Wagner. These areas include two long
narrow triangles of land from the adjacent land grant tract that were never built upon or built upon very late.
A third area is a small trapezoidal area at the southwest corner of Andrews and Mason that had never been
built upon. The fourth selected area was the brick-paved segment of Andrews east of Mason Street. It is in
this area that local residents have reported graves.
Upon arrival, it was determined that much of the southern area had dense clump grass that would not
be amenable to the collection of good data with the available set up. Arrangements were made to mow this
area and radar investigations were begun on the northernmost triangle, starting with the basketball court at the
southwest corner of the existing school building. Unfortunately, heavy rains prevented mowing the southern
section and standing water was left across much of this area, making it impossible to work in portions of the
high probability area. Work was completed across most of the northernmost triangle area as well as the brickpaved section of Andrews Street. Portions of the area at the southwest corner of Andrews and Mason were
run but noise from the uneven surface and standing water make the results difficult to interpret.

Prior to initiation of the runs, a theoretical grid was established within the project area solely for the
purposes of locating the radar run and anomaly data. This English system grid (utilized because of the historic
nature of the project) was established with its origin at the southwest corner of the property line of the corner
of Taft and West Gray. For reference within the project area, the cyclone fence corner at the southwest corner
of the Gregory-Lincoln School football and track field area was established as 0E 840N based on
measurements of the project construction map. All runs and anomalies were designated within this system.
Overall a total of 72 runs were completed in the various areas. Some 22 of these were in the
basketball court area while another 27 were undertaken on the football field. Nine runs were undertaken on
the west segment of Andrews Street and the grassy strip to the north of this. Ten runs were attempted on the
lot at the corner of Andrews and Mason and four more were completed on the brick-paved section of
Andrews Street east of Mason. Three of the football field runs were not used because they contained
incomplete data or other errors; a total of 69 runs contained useful data on anomalies in the area. These runs,
along with essential data, are shown in Table A-1 in Appendix A.
Overall, these runs recorded 441 anomalies in all the sample areas. These areas and the primary
anomalies noted within them are described below. The anomalies are listed in Table A-2 in Appendix A.
Note that out of these 441 anomalies, 30 were chosen as particularly interesting and worthy of further
investigation. These are marked with a superscript in Table A-2.
Analysis of the data was accomplished through ordinary visual means as well as by using
Geophysical Survey Systems’ proprietary RADAN software. Obvious anomalies were designated along each
of the runs and then compared against known signatures for this type of soil and against adjacent runs to
verify their reliability. The extreme noise inherent in the runs, largely due to rough surface conditions and
surface features, and the odd sample area shapes made the more sophisticated 3D Radan analysis impossible.
Instead, manual analysis was necessary to pick out real anomalies from the frequent skips, hangs, and surface
shadows. In most cases, the careful manual analysis of each anomaly in profile is vastly better than the
horizontal view which make distinction between noise and anomaly nearly impossible.
RESULTS
Gregory-Lincoln Basketball Court
This was the northernmost area studied during the recent investigations. It covered a narrow strip of
high probability area in the northwest corner of the tract, at the southwest corner of the school building.
While the concrete surface of the court was relatively smooth, there were cracks and expansion joints, some
with grass, as well as metal pole bases, and a small manhole cover. In addition, there was the building to the
north, fences to the south and west, three basketball backboard supports and a light pole, all of which could
have contributed to obscure or artificially enhance or create anomalies in this area. The runs began at the
building’s edge, where a series of bricks columns are located; thus the first six to ten feet was obscured by
anomalies related to this structure. At the southern end, the runs terminated at a high cyclone fence that was
likely to have masked anomalies in that area. While the runs were smoother than any of the runs undertaken
on grass, the unkempt surface of the court made for somewhat bumpy runs which were likely to have caused
anomalies as the antenna base lost contact with the ground surface momentarily.
A total of 22 north-south runs were undertaken in this area which was about 140 feet north-south by
about 60 feet east-west. The first eighteen runs were conducted on three-foot intervals beginning six feet east
of the cyclone fence at the extreme west edge of the property and extending to the eighteenth run at 57 feet
east of this fence. These runs were undertaken at 80 nanoseconds. Four additional runs were undertaken in
the same general area at 40 nanoseconds, at 15 feet east, 25 feet east, 35 feet east, and 48 feet east of the
property line fence.

Anthony & Brown Consulting
A total of 131 anomalies were recorded on the initial 18 runs, an average of over 7 anomalies per
run. The individual runs ranged from 13 anomalies on the run 12 feet from the fence to just 3 anomalies at 45
feet from the fence. The four duplicate runs, set to a shorter collection time (40 nanoseconds), recorded 32
anomalies, exactly the same as the corresponding four runs from the initial pass, but distributed somewhat
differently. In general, these later runs exhibited the same pattern of anomalies, though several showed
slightly different configurations because of the different data collection lengths. Nonetheless, it is clear from a
visual analysis of the two sets that most, if not all, of the anomalies are real subsurface features in definable
loci.
In general, the runs closer to the fence had more anomalies, possibly related to the greater presence
of surface features in this area. Other than the frequent anomalies, the runs were generally clean and relatively
noise free, though at least some of the anomalies were odd reflections caused by loss of surface contact by the
antenna due to the relatively rough surface. None of the anomalies can be definitely identified as a grave;
most are much shallower that would be expected and probably relate to intentional fill placed beneath the
court. Nor are the numerous anomalies regularly spaced enough to be considered typical cemetery interments.
Nonetheless, the surprisingly high number of anomalies in this area suggests that the investigators would be
well served by some degree of scraping under the court surface at the appropriate time to verify the nature of
these anomalies.
Gregory-Lincoln Football Field
This large area was just south of the basketball court. The primary central area was a grassy football
field surrounded by a cinder running track. This track featured concrete curbs on both sides, making northsouth traverses across it impossible, while the relatively narrow width made north-south traverses within it all
but useless. Nor was any attempt made to run east-west within the track because of its curvature.
Additionally, the area between the track and the fence along the western property boundary was complicated
by equipment, several small mounds, and a concrete-edged extension of the track on the south. Ultimately,
runs were limited to the area bounded by the track. These north-south runs extended from curb to curb on the
track, narrowing to the west as the track curved and stopping about 15 feet short of the goal posts. Although
this area was relatively smooth (there was a tendency for the ground to rise up to the track on both sides), the
grass was very uneven and grew in dense clumps which caused frequent stops, jerks, or jumps as the antenna
was dragged across the surface. Despite the long, obstacle-free runs, the investigation of this area suffered
somewhat from the rough grass.
A total of 27 north-south runs were undertaken in this area. Three of these were false starts or test
runs that were ultimately discarded. In total, 24 runs were undertaken beginning about 127 feet west of the
property fence and ending about 33 feet from the fence. A total of 157 anomalies were recorded on these 24
runs, an average of 6.5 per run. The actual number of anomalies varied from a maximum of 10 down to a
minimum of 4. These were not evenly distributed. The greatest numbers of anomalies were found in the
middle area, on runs 34, 35, 40, and 41, which had a disproportionate total of 36 anomalies. The anomalies
were spread roughly evenly across the entire north-south length of the runs. As with the anomalies in the
basketball court area, none can be clearly identified as an interment and none exhibit the regular spacing that
would be seen in a formal cemetery. Most are relatively small and shallow, and many could be subsurface
reflections of surface roughness. Others seem to be soil anomalies rather than historic features. In fact, none is
obviously a historic feature or manmade anomaly, although this should be tested through some degree of
excavation.
Strip North of Andrews Street
This small grassy strip was located south of the football field fence and north of Andrews Street. As
with most cemetery investigation runs, it would have been better to run north-south here, but the east-west

4

Anthony & Brown Consulting
road, curbs, sidewalk and other features made this simply impossible. Therefore the runs in the area, and
everywhere south of the football field fence, were undertaken in an east-west direction to maximize
information from the east-west lying parcels. Except for the sidewalk adjacent to the fence, which did have
regular expansion joints and was somewhat rough, the grassy surface was very rough, with several holes,
clump grass, and areas of standing water.
The study area here extended west from the property line fence along Taft Street a maximum of 145
feet. The northernmost of five east-west runs followed the concrete sidewalk along the fence, while the
remaining runs traversed the grassy area between the sidewalk and the road on approximate four-foot centers
(the areas closest to the road was not run because of standing water and an extremely rough surface – this
area amounted to what would have been three runs). A total of 18 anomalies were noted on these five runs, an
average of 3.6 per run. Overall, the anomalies on this run tended to be in the middle portion of the run or to
the west, rather than at the eastern end. The most on any single run, five, were found on the northernmost run
along the sidewalk, while run 57, 12 feet to the south, had only two. Because of its smooth surface, the
sidewalk in also one of the more dependable runs, while the runs in the rough grass to the south of the
sidewalk are likely to have recorded false anomalies based on surface roughness and standing water. Some of
the runs in this area are almost certain to be utility trenches, pipes, and drains along the north side of
Andrews. None can be clearly identified as a grave, and there are too few anomalies anywhere to suggest the
regular patterning of interments that one would find in a dedicated cemetery.
Andrews West of Mason Street
A small part of Andrews west of Mason was included in the same high probability area as the
basketball court, football field, and the grassy strip described above. Because the runs in the rough grass were
yielding inconclusive results, overwhelmed by surface noise, it was decided to expand this area to include all
of Andrews Street to the Mason Street intersection. This decision was bolstered by the report that graves had
been located in the eastern brick-paved portion of Andrews in the past (see below). In the end, with the
exception of the Mason Street intersection, all of Andrews was included in the study.
This street was among the smoothest surfaces run in the project area. Only a large area at the western
end where asphalt had been removed and occasional utility line patches marred the surface. Four east-west
runs were undertaken in this area, spaced at four-foot intervals. These were roughly centered in the street
away from the curb and gutter which was the roughest part of the road, and which in places had standing
water. These were relatively noise-free runs and anomalies were easy to distinguish. A total of 32 anomalies
were recorded, nine and ten along the two most productive (but not adjacent) runs and five and eight along
the remaining two. Of these, at least some were clearly utility trenches or underground pipes. Others could
not be so clearly identified, but could be variation in fill or pavement from road building. At least a few seem
to be potential historic cultural anomalies, though none can be clearly indicated as graves. Additionally, the
spacing of the anomalies does not suggest the spacing of graves in a cemetery although individual isolated
burials can not be ruled out.
Southwest Corner of Andrews and Mason
This parcel of land at the southwest corner of Andrews and Mason had been indicated as a possible
location for graves after trained cadaver-sniffing dogs were led over the area. Unfortunately, in addition to
not having been mowed, the surface was very uneven with trees, posts and other surface obstructions present.
Under the best of circumstances, it would be difficult to get clean runs in this area, but with standing water
from recent rains very little was expected.
Two east-west runs were undertaken near the south end of the tract, the only part of this southern
area that was relatively free of standing water. Eight more east-west runs were undertaken at the north end of
the tract. Because of the surface and the water, these runs were somewhat less than perfectly parallel and not
5

Anthony & Brown Consulting
perfectly aligned. Not surprisingly, the resulting radar profiles were very noisy and apparent anomalies
difficult to sort from the background noise. In particular, some effort was made to separate out the subsurface
anomalies from false echoes coming from surface features such as trees and posts. In the final analysis, 40
anomalies were noted on the ten runs completed in this area, 11 in the southern two runs and 29 in the eight
runs to the north. The anomalies were about equally distributed between and along the length of the runs. A
few of the anomalies can be correlated between the runs but on the whole, this exercise was somewhat
difficult and not completely accurate. While some of the anomalies must represent utilities on the lot, there
are too many across the lot to represent underground service lines. Some could also represent foundations as
there was a house here at some time in the past. None of the anomalies here is obviously an interment, nor
does the spacing of anomalies suggest the ordinary spacing of graves in a cemetery.
Andrews East of Mason
The last area run during the study was the brick section of Andrews Street east of Mason.
Neighborhood residents reported bones having been found in this street though it is not clear exactly where
these may have been or whether or not they represent graves. Although lower in probability than other
probability areas set aside for this phase, the heavy rains and large areas of standing water made it necessary
to shift to this area that was unaffected by the rains. The paving bricks were generally rough and uneven and
patches of concrete ran across the road in various areas. Despite the rough surface, this portion of Andrews
Street was actually one of the smoothest surfaces run and a number of anomalies were noted. There are storm
drains clearly visible at points along the street and many or all of the anomalies observed in this area may be
related to utilities or street construction.
Four east-west runs covered this area, spaced approximately four feet apart and all about 200 feet
long. Overall, the radar profiles from these runs were relatively smooth and easy to interpret, with less of the
surface noise that marked many other areas here. Initial concerns that the radar might not penetrate the brick
surface were totally unfounded; a strong returning signal was recorded. A total of 31 anomalies were
observed in this series of runs, with slightly more in the two southern runs, but overall well distributed
between the runs and along the length. As noted above, most if not all of these anomalies are expected to be
utilities in the street corridor. A few of the registered anomalies clearly cross the entire street from north to
south, though others seem more isolated. None of the recorded anomalies are clearly the size or shape of
graves, nor are they in any way regularly spaced. Nonetheless, several of these anomalies may represent
isolated burials or other historic cultural features.
DISCUSSION
Radar passes in six different areas south of the existing Gregory-Lincoln School recorded some
441 anomalies in 69 runs covering 9,966 feet of the suggested high probability areas, or one anomaly
about every 23 feet. As noted above, the vast majority of these anomalies are thought to be soil features,
reflections of surface roughness, and modern cultural features such as utility trenches, etc. Only a few are
likely to be historic cultural features and few if any are likely to represent interments. And while some
might be isolated graves, there is generally little or no evidence for regularity in spacing that accompanies
cemetery plots, especially formal ones.
Radar investigations of the tract indicated for construction of the new Houston High School for the
Performing and Visual Arts and the reconstruction/remodeling of the existing Gregory-Lincoln School
yielded a large number of anomalies on the 72 radar passes undertaken in the project area. Prior to the
fieldwork there had been some concern for the efficacy of the radar in the dense clayey soils of the Houston
area, mostly part of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. Clayey soils tend to absorb waves, severely
limiting penetration, especially in wet conditions. A partial solution to this problem is to use a lower
frequency antenna with longer waves, enhancing penetration but limiting somewhat the size of the target that

6

Anthony & Brown Consulting
can be recognized. In the Gregory-Lincoln case, a 270 MHz antenna was chosen as potentially superior to the
more common, higher frequency 400 MHz antenna that could detect smaller anomalies but would not
penetrate clay as well. In the end, although depth penetration cannot be directly measured because of the lack
of subsurface testing in the run areas (several trenches were excavated but because of heavy rains, no direct
correlation was possible), the high number of anomalies suggests adequate penetration.
More significant problems were faced in the nature of the site itself and the orientation of the selected
high probability areas. Because of historic property lines, several of these tracts were oriented diagonally to
the block, set as long slivers crossing the blocks from north to south. With fences, curbs, streets, and asphalt
spread across the area, it was difficult to log long, uninterrupted runs in these areas. In the end the basketball
court, with its grass, rough, cracked surface, and frequent surface features, turned out to be among the best of
the chosen areas. A very high number of anomalies was noted here, though it seems unlikely that any of these
are or could be burials. In fact, at least some of the anomalies are certainly due to surface roughness and
variations in the base laid down under the pavement.
The sports field area south of the basketball court seemed a potentially ideal area but the rough,
clump grass on the surface caused problems for the cart and antenna setup that was brought to Houston.
Additionally, the runs of diminishing length caused by the curbing at the edge of the running track made
block analysis of this parcel very difficult. In the end, slightly fewer anomalies per run and in total were
recorded here, but the number of false anomalies may be smaller (though the rough surface is certain to have
generated numerous false anomalies in this area). Although some of the anomalies in this area are intriguing,
none seem to indicate graves and there was little indication in the spacing that would indicate a formal
cemetery.
Runs in high probability areas along Andrews Street recorded a number of anomalies but many if not
most of these are probably related to utility trenches and construction features in this area. This may also be
true of the parcel at the southwest corner of Andrews and Masons Streets where utilities and possible
foundation debris may have been left from structures previously standing here. While anomalies in these
areas were clear, none appear to be graves.
One of the most difficult problems encountered in the area was high grass, which complicates a
smooth path for the radar. Attempts were made to mow while we were present, but this was complicated by
administrative and practical issues, and ultimately futile because of the heavy rains that struck every
afternoon (and much of the day on our last day there). These rains were the single most deleterious factor in
gathering good subsurface data, not only because it took us out of the field for a part of each day, but because
it saturated the soil and left large areas of surface water that hindered interpretation of data in those areas. Of
course, areas beneath cement, asphalt or brick were not likely to have been substantially altered by the heavy
rains since the area had experienced a long drought and these areas were relatively well protected from
localized moisture. Areas exposed to the surface, such as the football field, and the areas along the margin of
Andrews Street, would have been affected, however, and because of the shallowly buried clay, this effect
would have been multiplied.

This Management Letter presents the results associated with cultural resource monitoring
of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) 4th Ward Project Area, Harris
County, Texas. This investigation was completed by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA
Gray & Pape) between June 16 and October 27 of 2006, on behalf of Hicks & Company
(H&C) of Austin, Texas. Construction plans included deep drilling for pier placement
and deep trenching associated with utility and sewer line relocation and placement. The
monitoring for this project was completed in order to assist H&C in satisfying the cultural
resources management requirements of the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) permit
#3837. The results of this and previous fieldwork are reviewed below.
The property was initially investigated by Janet K. Wagner & Company who conducted
archival research in August 2005. This research revealed the possibility for human
burials on the HISD property. Due to that potential, H&C contracted with Anthony &
Brown to conduct a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey. This was followed up by
test trenching and excavation units by H&C. A total of 55 trenches and 32 square meters
(344.45 square feet) of test units produced no solid evidence for the interment of human
remains within the HISD property, however H&C recommended monitoring of the site
during construction due to the possibility for isolated human burials (Feit et al. 2005).
Archaeological monitoring consisted of weekly inspections by an Archaeologist of the
entire construction zone during all phases of construction. Monitoring efforts generally
ranged in duration from 1 to 2 hours each week but were of a longer duration in times
considered to be archaeologically sensitive, specifically during deep drilling or trenching.
Archeologists monitored any activities that resulted in ground disturbance. Any visually
exposed ground, including back dirt piles were closely inspected for the presence of
human remains or cultural features and/or artifacts suggestive of human burials.
Soil disturbance undertaken within the project ranged from surface leveling to drilling
and trenching several meters in depth. The deepest trenches involved sewer relocation
and placement, which reached depths of approximately 3.68 meters (12 feet) and were
approximately 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) or more wide. Drilling also reached depths of
approximately 3.68 meters (12 feet). Soil profiles observed in open trenches were
consistent with those reported in Feit et al. (2005), displaying gray brown silt and clay
overlaying a layer of either yellow to dark brown or reddish gray clay extending to
approximately 2 meters (6.56 feet). This was followed by light gray clay. These strata
were clearly visible in the back dirt piles as well. Cultural materials present were
generally observed in back dirt piles and were unprovenienced. The most prevalent
materials observed generally entailed foundation fragments, bricks, and shell. Scattered
among those materials was various household debris consisting of ceramics, window and
bottle glass, metal objects such as nails, and cut animal bone. The majority of cultural
materials were seen within 0.5 meter (1.64 feet) below the surface. Cultural materials
witnessed below that depth were only associated with previously laid utility lines. Also,
the presence of cultural materials seemed to lessen toward the north of the project area (in
the approximate location of the track field and near the existing school building).

Throughout the entire monitoring process, no features or artifacts that would suggest the
existence for the presence of human remains was observed.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends that this investigation complete the requirements of the
THC under permit #3837. Questions or comments regarding the methods, results, or
recommendations associated with this survey should be addressed to Mr. Tony Scott,
Principal Investigator, at 713-541-0473 or tscott@hragp.com.

Re: HISD 4th Ward Testing, TAC Permit #3837
Dear Mr. Denton,
This letter is intended to coordinate with your office regarding construction monitoring at the site
of the new Gregory Lincoln School in Houston’s 4th Ward. The construction took place on a 17acre property owned by the Houston Independent School District (HISD) bounded by Dallas,
West Gray, Genesee and Taft streets. The actual limits of construction during this phase,
however, included only those blocks south of Robin Street, as the existing Gregory Lincoln
School and parking lot still cover those blocks to the north.
Hicks & Company conducted the monitoring under an existing Antiquities Code Permit (#3837)
that included archeological testing for all blocks south of Robin Street. Following the testing of
the new Gregory Lincoln School site, which took place in October 2005, monitoring was
recommended as part of the ongoing compliance efforts on the part of the Houston Independent
School District. HISD hired Hicks & Company to undertake the monitoring. As outlined in the
permit modification request dated May 4, 2006, the investigation consisted of a combination of on
and offsite monitoring. As part of that effort, the Hicks & Company Principal Investigator met with
the construction contractors prior to commencement of the site preparation work to provide some
background on the project and to share concerns with the contractors over the possibility of
finding human remains during their site excavation work. During that meeting, Hicks & Company
discussed with the contractors what those remains might look like, if found, and what to do in the
event of an accidental discovery of human remains. 20 copies of a booklet were distributed that
provided not just visual and written guidance about what sorts of archeological remains the
contractors might expect to find, but also a notification protocol should any human interments
actually be uncovered. A copy of that booklet is attached.
Additionally, Hicks & Company subcontracted with HRA Gray & Pape, based in Houston, to make
weekly inspections of the site. They too received background documents and necessary
instructions in the event of accidental discoveries. An HRA Gray & Pape Project Archeologist,
Rebecca Sick, was familiar with the site already, since she had previously served as a Hicks &
Company Crew Chief during the 2005 testing. HRA Gray & Pape’s inspection reports were sent
to the Hicks & Company Principal Investigator weekly. Their final letter is attached along with
photos of the construction work.
During the construction, which lasted from June 16 to October 27, 2006, neither monitors nor
construction personnel encountered any evidence of human skeletal material, coffins, coffin
hardware, or soil stains that would otherwise indicate the presence of an historic human interment
(see attached letter). It is recommended that HISD’s compliance obligations under the Texas

Antiquities Code are complete for the blocks within the HISD property located between Robin,
West Gray, Genesee and Taft Streets.
This letter is further intended to notify your office that the actual Gregory Lincoln School is
scheduled for demolition under the current contract between HISD and its construction
contractors, Pyramid Construction. That demolition, however, will not take place until the new
school is completed. As part of the continuing efforts on the part of HISD to satisfy all regulatory
compliance procedures, we would like to request the Texas Historical Commission’s input about
what sort of effort, if any at this point, would be required under the Antiquities Code on the four
blocks between Robin, Dallas, Genesee and Taft Streets, where the Gregory Lincoln School
currently stands.
Once again this letter requests clearance under the Texas Antiquities Code for the new Gregory
Lincoln school site located between Robin, West Gray, Genesee and Taft Streets. It is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that there are no archeological resources in that area which
are eligible for designation on the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological
Landmark. The letter also seeks input on what level of effort should be required for the remaining
four blocks of the HISD property where the school currently stands. We look forward to hearing
from your office, and appreciate the opportunity to assist in the preservation of Texas’ valuable
cultural heritage.

Sincerely,

Rachel Feit
Principal Investigator
