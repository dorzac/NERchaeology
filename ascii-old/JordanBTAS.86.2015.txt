A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites:
Plains Biographic Rock Art and the Southern Plains
Ethnographic Record
Michael Paul Jordan
ABSTRACT
While scholars have incorporated ethnographic data into their analyses of Biographic Tradition rock art sites
on the Northern Plains, studies of Southern Plains rock art have made more limited use of the ethnographic
record. Reanalysis of select scenes and figures from two Southern Plains Biographic tradition rock art sites—
the Hussie Miers (41VV327) and El Caido sites—demonstrates the utility of an ethnographically informed
approach. Comparison of the pictographs and petroglyphs with ethnographic data, including nineteenth century Kiowa and Comanche drawings executed on paper, has facilitated the identification of items of material
culture, as well as the interpretation of several scenes. At the Hussie Miers site, the reinterpretation of items of
material culture has raised questions regarding the dating of the site, as well as the identity of the non-Native
combatants depicted in one of the panels.

INTRODUCTION
In this article, I present a reanalysis of select
scenes and figures from two Southern Plains Biographic Tradition sites: Hussie Miers (41VV327)
and El Caido. The Hussie Miers site is located
along a tributary of the Devils River in southwest
Texas. The site consists entirely of pictographs.
While Late Prehistoric Red Monochrome style
images comprise the majority of the rock art at
the site, a panel consisting of five combat scenes
(Figure 1) belongs to the Plains Biographic style
(Turpin 1989:105). The El Caido site is situated
approximately one mile south of the Rio Grande
in Coahuila, Mexico. Both pictographs and petroglyphs are present, the latter consisting of incised
images with painted elements (Labadie et al.
1997:14-15, 19).
Biographic Tradition rock art is found throughout the Plains region. Documented sites extend
from Alberta, Canada, to northern Mexico (Keyser
2004:65; Keyser and Klassen 2001:Map 14.1).
Previous studies of Plains Biographic Tradition
rock art have focused primarily on sites located
on the Northern Plains (Keyser 1987, 1991, 1996,
2007, 2009; Keyser and Klassen 2003; Keyser and
Cowdrey 2008; Keyser et al. 2004, 2006; Klassen
et al. 2000). However, archeologists have identified

several Biographic Tradition sites on the Southern
Plains, including sites in the Texas Panhandle
(Parsons 1987), southwest Texas (Turpin 1986,
1989), and northern Coahuila, Mexico (Labadie et
al. 1997; Turpin 1988).
While the earlier Ceremonial tradition rock art
is characterized by static figures, Plains Biographic
rock art is marked by the depiction of action sequences. Episodes of warfare, including combat
and horse raiding, figure prominently in this tradition (Keyser 1989:87, 2004:65; Keyser and Klassen 2001:224, 228). Keyser (2004:65) notes that
“[h]umans, horses, weapons, and track sequences
(both horse hoofprints and human footprints) compose more than 90 percent of the art.” Additionally,
tallies or counts recording the number of enemies
killed, horses stolen, and weapons captured also
appear in the art.
Biographic rock art was the “predominant
Plains art tradition from the 1600s on” (Keyser
2004:67). The earliest recorded Biographic rock art
sites are located on the Southern Plains and date to
the 1500s. The tradition experienced a fluorescence
in the eighteenth century and sites dating between
1750 and 1850 are found throughout the Plains
(Keyser 2004:65, 67; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:20;
Keyser and Klassen 2001:224). After 1880, the
production of Biographic tradition rock art largely

ceased (Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:20).1 Biographic
rock art is characterized by a trend toward increasing realism and later examples often feature detailed
depictions of clothing and accoutrements, including
weapons and horse tack (Keyser 2004:65, 69; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:20).
Biographic rock art is seen as a precursor to
works on hide and paper and the more general
term Biographic art is used to refer not only to rock
art, but to works in these media as well (Keyser
1989:87; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:20). Indeed, at
least two books on Plains rock art devote chapters
to drawings executed on hide and paper (Keyser
2004; Keyser and Klassen 2001). The term robe
art has been applied to works on hide and as such
encompasses a variety of objects including robes,
war shirts, tipi covers, and tipi liners (Keyser and
Klassen 2001:257). Similarly, the term ledger art is
used in a generic sense to refer to works on paper
due to the fact that some of these drawings appear
in the pages of repurposed account books (Greene
2004:22; Keyser and Klassen 2001:257; McLaughlin 2013:41; Szabo1994:xiv).2

Ethnographic sources, including robe and ledger
art, have proved especially useful in the identification
of items of material culture depicted in Biographic
tradition rock art. The correct identification of these
items often has implications for the interpretation of
these scenes. As Keyser and Klassen (2003:7) noted
“[c]orrect identification of material culture items is
frequently key to understanding Plains Biographic
art, since such items were used to advance the narrative aspect of this art tradition.” For example,
the identity of a figure may be communicated via
its association with tribally distinctive clothing or
regalia (Keyser 1991; Keyser and Klassen 2001;
Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:23, 25). Material culture
can also be of assistance in dating rock art sites. At
the Joliet site, several Crow figures are depicted with
regalia associated with the Hot Dance, a variant of
the Plains Grass Dance. The Crow obtained the Hot
Dance from the Hidatsa in 1875, indicating that the
panel must have been created sometime thereafter
(Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:27-28).
While archeologists studying Southern Plains
rock art sites have acknowledged the utility of

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
incorporating the ethnographic record into their
analyses, they have yet to recognize the full potential of this approach. Parsons (1987:257), building
on Keyser’s work on Northern Plains biographic
art, was an early proponent of using what he termed
“Plains Indian portable pictorial art,” i.e., robe and
ledger art, in the interpretation of rock art and he
ably demonstrated the advantages of this approach
in his analysis of the Mujares Creek and Verbena
sites.3 Turpin (1989) and LaBadie et al. (1997) are
to be commended for their efforts in documenting
Biographic tradition rock art sites on the Southern
Plains. However, their analyses and interpretations
of the Hussie Miers and El Caido sites are limited
by a lack of familiarity with the ethnography and
material culture of nineteenth century Southern
Plains tribes, including the Kiowa, Comanche, and
Plains Apache. In reanalyzing figures from these
two sites, I have made extensive use of the ethnographic record. Comparing the rock art images
with nineteenth century ledger drawings and ethnographic specimens in museum collections has led to
the identification of previously unidentified items
of material culture, as well as the reclassification

89

of previously misidentified objects. In addition, the
ethnographic record has provided information on
nineteenth century cultural practices and beliefs
that has served as the basis for new interpretations
of the symbolism and significance of objects and
figures depicted at these sites.
HAIRPLATES:
SOUTHERN PLAINS MEN’S FASHION
Figures at both the Hussie Miers site and the
El Caido site are depicted with long lines accentuated by circles extending from their heads and
hanging down to their feet. Describing the warrior
at the Hussie Miers site (see Figure 1), Turpin
(1989:106) interpreted this feature as representing
the man’s hair, observing that “[t]he protagonist
is distinguished by his long ornamented hair, perhaps braided in the Cheyenne fashion, that reaches
the ground whether he is afoot or mounted.” In
describing one of the mounted figures in Panel
A at the El Caido site (Figure 2), Labadie et al.
(1997:18) were influenced by Turpin’s earlier

Figure 2. Pictograph from Panel A at the El Caido site depicting a mounted figure wearing a set of hairplates (reprinted

identification of the “long braided hair style” worn
by the warrior at the Hussie Miers site. Describing
the figure at the El Caido site, they noted that “[t]
he rider is depicted with a long decorated ponytail
hairdo” (Labadie et al. 1997:18). Indeed, citing
the similarity in the figures’ hairstyles, Labadie
et al. (1997:29-30) posited a possible connection
between the two sites, going so far as to argue that
the warrior who appears in Panel A at El Caido
might be the same individual represented at the
Hussie Miers site.
In their drawings on hide and paper, Plains
Indian artists often employed what Petersen
(1971:54) referred to as a “costume-symbol” to
identify members of enemy tribes. Artists depicted
distinctive elements of tribal dress and adornment
in an effort to convey the tribal affiliation of figures
in their drawings. The depiction of tribally distinctive hairstyles served as a way for artists to identify
the affiliation of enemy combatants. For example,
Crow warriors were frequently rendered wearing a
hair style that combined a pompadour with a long
net-like section extending down their backs (Afton
et al. 1997:246 and Plate 127; Petersen 1971:54,
289). Kiowa artists typically depicted Navajo men
and women wearing their hair tied up in a club
at the back of the head (McCoy 1987:58, 60 and
Plates 4 and 12; Petersen 1971:290). Given that
this practice was widespread amongst nineteenth
century Plains Indian artists, it is conceivable that
the artists responsible for the drawings at the El
Caido and Hussie Miers sites may have employed
hairstyles as markers of ethnic or tribal identity.
However, a comparison of the depictions of
the protagonist at the Hussie Miers site (Jordan
2001:123) and the mounted figure in Panel A at
the El Caido site with nineteenth century drawings
by Southern Plains ledger artists indicates that the
artists responsible for the pictographs were not
depicting a particular hair style, but rather an item
of material culture. What Turpin (1989) and Labadie et al. (1997) have interpreted as the warriors’
braids are actually sets of hairplates. Hairplates
consisted of a “set of metal disks of graduated size
attached to a strap of hide, braided buffalo hair,
or trade cloth, which was worn trailing from the
back of the head” (Greene 2001a:1045). Although
the metal discs were sometimes obtained through
trade, Plains Indian artists also manufactured
them by hammering silver coins into the desired
dimensions (Greene 2001a:1045; Hail 1980:141).
The Kiowa language offers linguistic evidence of

this practice. The Kiowa term for money—â’dalhâñ’gya—literally translates as “hair metal,” a
reference to the use of silver coins in the manufacture of hairplates (Mooney 1979:255).4
It is difficult to determine precisely when
hairplates came into vogue on the Southern Plains.
According to Greene (2001a:1045), coin silver did
not become available until the early nineteenth
century. Kiowa pictographic calendars record an
attack on a party of American traders in the winter
of 1832-1833 in which the Kiowa captured a number of silver coins. According to ethnologist James
Mooney’s Kiowa consultants this was the first time
the tribe had encountered coins and they hammered
the specie into discs to make hairplates. The Kiowa
commemorated the event, referring to this winter as
the “winter that they captured the money” (Mooney
1979:254-255).
In 1834, artist George Catlin painted a portrait
of a Kiowa man wearing hairplates. Catlin accompanied Colonel Henry Dodge’s dragoon expedition,
which visited a Comanche village located near
the Wichita Mountains (Mooney 1979:264-265).
There, Catlin painted a portrait of Little Bluff
(Figure 3), the principal chief of the Kiowa at the
time. The artist carefully rendered the leather strap
on which the metal discs were mounted passing
over Little Bluff’s right shoulder (Catlin 1973:71,
74 and Figure 178). Taken together, the Catlin
painting and the information collected by Mooney
indicates that Southern Plains men were wearing
hairplates as early as the 1830s.
Hairplates remained in fashion among the
Kiowa during the ensuing decades and on into
the reservation era. Both the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, and the
Denver Art Museum hold examples of nineteenth
century Kiowa hairplates in their collections
(Conn 1982:Figures 77 and 144; Merrill et al.
1997:27, 309). Between 1875 and 1878, Kiowa
men imprisoned at Fort Marion in San Augustine,
Florida, created drawings depicting their lives on
the Plains (Berlo 1982:11-12; Szabo 2001:51). In
many of their drawings, the artists rendered Kiowa
men wearing hairplates (Harris 1989:Plates 22,
25, 28, and 30-31; Petersen 1971:Plate 37; Szabo
2011:Plates 2, 4, 6, and 13). A drawing (Figure 4)
by an unidentified Kiowa prisoner depicts five men
standing outside a tipi with its sides rolled up. All
of the men wear hairplates that extend to near the
ground.5 Reservation era Kiowa drawings also document the use of hairplates (Greene 2001b:Plate

in widespread use among the tribes
of the Southern and Central Plains
(Conn 1982:144). Both Plains Apache
and Comanche men wore them
(Foster and McCollough 2001:931;
Kavanaugh 2001:891, 2008:459). In
addition, pre-reservation era drawings on paper by Southern Cheyenne
and Southern Arapaho artists document the widespread use of hairplates
by members of these tribes as well. A
book of Cheyenne drawings collected
during the sack of Tall Bull’s Dog
Soldier village in July 1869 included
40 drawings in which Cheyenne
warriors were depicted wearing hairplates (Afton et al. 1997).8 Peter W.
Edwards collected a book of Southern Arapaho drawings between 1870
and 1872 (Afton 1990:cii; Petersen
1990:xi). The book contained 10
drawings of Southern Arapaho men
wearing hairplates (Petersen 1990).9
Given their widespread popularity
amongst the Southern Plains tribes,
hairplates have limited diagnostic
potential and cannot function as indiFigure 3. George Catlin 1834. Detail from Téh-tóot-sah (better known

Similarly, Kiowa artists depicted their Navajo

helmets” (Turpin 1989:106). Turpin (1989:106)
based her dating of the site on the U.S. military’s
adoption of the helmet, noting that, “[a]t Hussie
Miers, the style of helmets hints at a very late date
for this panel. Prussian-influenced formal dress
uniforms, including spiked helmets, were not adopted until 1871, suggesting that this pictograph
was painted during the final decade of warfare in
this region.” Based on her interpretation of the
headgear, Turpin identified the figures as U.S.
soldiers and dated the creation of the rock art to
1871 or later. Critically, both the identification
of the Euro-American figures and the date for the
creation of the pictograph hinge on the identification of the headgear.
The plumed helmets in question were introduced in 1872 when the War Department

announced the adoption of new uniform guidelines
for the Army and therefore they would have been
issued during the final years of military campaigning on the Southern Plains (Katcher 1985:43-44;
Steffen 1978:107, 109; Howell 1982:34-35).
However, as Turpin (1989:106) herself noted,
these helmets comprised part of the soldiers’ dress
uniform. Indeed, the new regulations set forth
in General Order No. 76, dated July 27, 1872,
specified that the helmets were part of the full dress
uniform for officers and enlisted men and were not
intended for field service. Instead, the regulations
prescribed a black felt fatigue hat for use by officers and enlisted men while on campaign or on the
march (Steffen 1978:107, 109-110, 115). The very
design of the helmet rendered its use on campaign
impractical. It lacked a wide brim to shield the

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
wearer from the elements and was festooned with a
variety of ornaments, including tassels, cords, and
a horse-hair plume (Steffen 1978:110 and Figure
161 and Color Plate V). The helmet together with
all of the trimmings weighed a full pound (Howell 1982:47). Describing the helmets, Hallowell
(1982:41) observed that they were “useless for
other than strictly dress wear.”
Given that the plumed helmets were not worn
on campaign, the initial identification of the headgear worn by the Euro-American figures depicted
at the Hussie Miers site appears to be incorrect.
This has implications for both the identification of
the Euro-American figures, as well as the dating of
the rock art panel. If the figures are not wearing the
plumed helmets prescribed in the 1872 regulations,
then there is no basis for identifying them as U.S.
cavalrymen or assigning the rock art a post-1872
date. If the figures do not represent U.S. cavalrymen, who are they? Fortunately, nineteenth century
Kiowa ledger drawings offer a possible clue.
Following the end of the Red River War in
1875, the Kiowa warrior Etahdleuh was imprisoned

93

at Fort Marion in San Augustine, Florida.10 During
his incarceration, Etahdleuh produced a number of
drawings detailing his life on the Plains (Earenfight
2007:109, 111, 113, 134; Greene 2013a; Lookingbill 2007:35-36; Petersen 1971:135 and Plates
31-34). In two of these drawings (Figures 5 and 6),
he documented his participation in engagements
with Mexican military forces. In both drawings,
Etahdleuh depicted his Mexican adversaries wearing shakos adorned with extremely tall pompoms
(Greene 2013a:Figures 5-6). The artist at Hussie
Miers may have been depicting this type of headgear. Given the site’s proximity to the Rio Grande
and the Mexican states of Coahuila and Chihuahua,
a depiction of an encounter with Mexican forces
would not be out of place.11
Both the Kiowa and Comanche conducted
raids into Mexico (Rivaya-Martínez 2014:399400; Turpin 1995:554). The Kiowa pictographic
calendars studied by James Mooney recorded six
such raids (Mooney 1979:276, 282, 293, 296, 300301, 306). These six raids likely represent only
a fraction of the overall number of raids Kiowa

warriors conducted in Mexico. The events recorded
in the Kiowa calendars were selected because they
were considered unique and therefore particularly
memorable (Greene 2009:2). With one exception,
the raids recorded in the calendars resulted in the
loss of Kiowa men’s lives. The sole exception
may have been considered noteworthy because
the raiding party was comprised entirely of older
men (Mooney 1979:276, 282, 293, 296, 300-301,
306). Numerous successful Kiowa raids, those in
which the party did not sustain casualties, likely
went unrecorded.
While the identification of the three EuroAmerican figures at the Hussie Miers site as Mexican soldiers is not conclusive, the site’s proximity
to the Mexican border, coupled with Kiowa drawings depicting Mexican soldiers wearing headgear
similar to that depicted at the site, indicate that
this interpretation warrants further investigation.
Research in Mexican archives may reveal records
documenting engagements between the Mexican
military and Southern Plains warriors in the vicinity of the Hussie Miers site.

CLIPPED CROW FEATHERS AND
PROTECTIVE MEDICINE
In each of the combat scenes at the Hussie
Miers site the protagonist is depicted in association
with a lance. In the scene that appears in the upper
left side of the panel (see Figure 1), the lance is
adorned with two circular ornaments. A similarly
decorated lance appears in a sketch by William
Bollaert depicting objects captured from a Comanche raiding party that attacked Corpus Christi,
Texas, in 1844. The lance in Bollaert’s drawing
features three circular ornaments: one near the base
of the blade, another at the midpoint of the shaft,
and one near the butt of the shaft (Ewers 1969:167
and Figure 18). In their drawings on paper, Kiowa
warriors frequently depicted themselves and their
comrades wielding lances with similar circular
ornaments (Greene 2001b:Figures 4.3 and 4.7 and
Plate 7; McCoy 1987:Plates 2-5, 13, 17, 19-20,
25, and 47-49; McCoy 1996:Figure 6; Merrill
et al. 1997:Figures 66-67; Smithsonian Institution 2012a; Szabo 2011:Plates 17 and 27-28). A

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
drawing (Figure 7) by an unidentified Kiowa artist,
created while he was imprisoned at Fort Marion,
features a mounted warrior carrying such a lance.
A review of the ethnographic literature on the
Kiowa and Comanche indicates that these circular ornaments are feather “whorls” comprised of
clipped crow feathers. In a 1933 interview with
Waldo Wedel and Wallace Hoebel, Comanche consultant Frank Chekovi described lances decorated
with “crow feather pieces,” i.e., clipped crow feathers, arranged in a fringe. These feather ornaments
were typically affixed near where a man would
grasp the lance or at the butt of the lance. Lances
adorned in this manner were called haikorohkO, literally “crow necklace” (Kavanagh 2008:267). The
term may refer to the way in which the feathers,
which were strung on a buckskin cord, encircled
the shaft of the lance.

95

Brevet Major General A. M. McCook collected
a Comanche lance in August 1873 at Fort McKavett,
Texas, that matches the descriptions of a haikorohkO
provided by Frank Chekovi and Quassyah. The
lance (Catalog Number E15697-0), which is part of
the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of
Natural History’s collection, features an ornament
of crow feathers. The clipped feathers are attached
to a buckskin thong that has been wound around
the shaft near the butt end. A lance bearing similar
clipped feather whorls appears in a photograph of
Red Horned Bull, an Oglala warrior (Figure 8).
In addition, a possible feather whorl is in a
collection of Comanche artifacts assembled by
Jean Louis Berlandier. The objects are part of the
National Museum of Natural History’s collection.
Berlandier collected the Comanche material between 1828 and 1851. Among the objects that he

acquired is a 54 cm long feather ornament, consisting of clipped feathers attached to a buckskin
lace. Based on its length, Ewers (1969:167, 184
and Figure 31) suggests that the object may have
been worn as a headband or a necklace.12 However,
it may instead have been intended to be wrapped
around the shaft of a lance.

As the aforementioned Kiowa ledger drawings
attest, Kiowa warriors also adorned their lances
with clipped crow feather ornaments. Among the
Kiowa, crow feathers were believed to be imbued
with protective medicine or spiritual power. According to Kiowa mythology, Crow stole Thunder’s
wife. The latter attempted to kill Crow by hurling

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
lightning bolts at him, but Crow successfully
dodged them, escaping with his life. Consequently,
Crow was seen as possessing the quality of being
difficult to hit or strike. Kiowa warriors carried
crow feathers into battle in order to tap into this
source of power. By adorning themselves with
crow feathers they sought to make themselves less
likely to be struck by their enemies’ arrows and
bullets (LaBarre 1935:923-924).
The Comanche also attributed protective properties to crow feathers. Observing crows in nature,
the Comanche noted that they would flock together
to attack and drive off owls. To the Comanche,
owls symbolized death, disease, and enemy warriors. Just as crows stood in opposition to owls,
they also stood in opposition to these negative
forces (Gelo 1986:3). Consequently, the Comanche believed that crows possessed “life-preserving
power” that could be harnessed by humans. This
belief persisted into the reservation period and
beyond and was expressed in the practice of affixing crow feathers to the doors of homes and
children’s bedposts (Gelo 1986:221). The earlier,
pre-reservation Comanche practice of adorning
lances with crow feathers was likely rooted in this
belief in the feathers’ protective medicine.
The artist who created the panel at the Hussie
Miers site was careful to depict the clipped crow
feathers on the protagonist’s lance. His decision to include the feather ornaments may have been motivated
by more than a mere desire to render an accurate representation of his own or his comrade’s armaments. In
Comanche society, the haikorohkO was reserved for
men who had distinguished themselves in combat and
thereby earned the right to wear eagle feather bonnets
(Kavanagh 2008:267). For a Comanche artist, the
lance would have served as a mark of distinction. By
depicting a man with such a lance, the artist could
communicate information regarding the warrior’s
martial prowess and past exploits.
While combat scenes served to commemorate
the protagonist’s brave deeds and celebrate his
courage, the drawings simultaneously functioned
as religious testimonials demonstrating the efficacy of the warrior’s spiritual medicine (Keyser
and Klassen 2001:216-217). As Jordan (2012:29)
observes with regard to works on paper, “drawings
of men overpowering their enemy or emerging
unscathed from showers of bullets or arrows may
be read as ‘religious testimonies’ that index the
efficacy of the protagonist’s personal medicine,
which is often referenced in the drawing through

97

the depiction of his shield.” The artist at the Hussie
Miers site was careful to depict not only the protagonist’s shield, but also the protective medicine
attached to his lance.
Armed only with his lance, the protagonist
charges a dismounted foe armed with a bow and
what appears to be a long gun (Turpin 1989:106).
The protagonist’s choice of a lance contrasts with
his opponent’s preference for long range weapons.
In order to strike the enemy warrior, the protagonist
had to move within the effective range of his opponent’s weapons, exposing himself to enemy fire
as he closed the distance between them. Although
he emerged unharmed, an arrow fired by the enemy
warrior lodged itself in his shield. Viewed against
the backdrop of this narrative action, the feather
whorls take on added significance. Since clipped
crow feather ornaments were viewed as protective
medicine by both the Comanche and Kiowa, perhaps the artist intended to underscore their efficacy
by illustrating the protagonist emerging safely and
triumphantly from his brush with danger.
In the remaining four combat scenes at Hussie
Miers the protagonist’s lance is decorated with triangular shapes. These triangles represent another
variant of the clipped crow feather ornaments. Unlike the globular feather whorls discussed above,
these objects resembled feather cones. Quassyah, a
Comanche, described a lance adorned in this manner
and Hoebel included a sketch of it in his field notes
(Kavanagh 2006:391 and Figure 6). The Kiowa artist Silver Horn illustrated a warrior wielding a lance
with a similar conical ornament (Greene 2001b:Plate
15). The feathers were strung on a cord that was
tied around the lance shaft. A second string, running
approximately halfway up the shaft of the feathers,
served to hold them in place, creating the distinctive
conical shape. Since these ornaments also incorporated clipped crow feathers, they likely carried
the same association with protective medicine as
the feather whorls. Consequently, all of the combat
scenes at Hussie Miers may be understood not only
as accounts of an individual warrior’s bravery and
martial prowess, but also as testimonies to the power
of his protective medicine.
COMMEMORATING THE RESCUE
OF A COMRADE
Ethnographic data can also aid in the interpretation of a pictograph from Panel A at the El

98

Texas Archeological Society

Caido site. The image (Figure 9) consists of two
men mounted on a single horse and is rendered in
red and yellow pigment (Labadie et al. 1997:19 and
Figure 6). Viewed on its own, the significance of
the drawing is not readily apparent. However, nineteenth century drawings on paper by Cheyenne and
Arapaho warriors contain similar depictions of men
riding double (Calloway 2012:Plate 38; Greene
1996:74 and Plate 1; Bates et al. 2003:Figures 4
and 5; Smithsonian Institution 2012b). These drawings include additional narrative details, discussed
below, that enable them to be recognized as rescue
scenes. For example, a book of drawings captured
during the destruction of Tall Bull’s Dog Soldier
village contains Cheyenne warriors’ depictions of
their martial exploits. Four of the drawings depict
mounted men rescuing comrades whose horses
have played-out due to exhaustion or have been
wounded or killed (Afton et al. 1997:xix, 24, 52,
59, 210 and Plates 16, 30, 34, and 103).
These drawings were intended to highlight the
rescuer’s bravery and self-sacrifice by documenting
his willingness to expose himself to danger in an
attempt to save his comrade. To emphasize the risk
involved, artists depicted the strength of the enemy

force. Enemy combatants are shown pursuing and
firing on the men as they make their escape. In
a two page drawing from the McDonald ledger,
an Arapaho warrior rescues a comrade, exposing
himself to the concentrated fire of 22 U.S. soldiers.
The artist depicts the Arapaho warriors engulfed in
a cloud of bullets (Greene 1996:74 and Plate 1).
It was also common for artists to depict the
imperiled warrior’s horse. Some men went so far
as to illustrate the precise nature of the horse’s
wounds. For example, a drawing in the Dog Soldier
ledger book features a horse that is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound in its side. In another
drawing from the book it is evident that a horse’s
right foreleg has been shattered by a bullet (Afton
et al. 1997:Plates 16 and 103). This level of detail
is more difficult to achieve in the medium of rock
art. It is therefore not surprising that these elements
are missing from the pictograph at the El Caido
site. The artist appears to have employed a form
of pictorial shorthand, trusting that the depiction
of two men riding double would be sufficient to
suggest the act of rescuing a companion.
Both the Kiowa and Comanche considered
it a great honor to save a comrade who had been

Figure 9. Pictograph of two men riding a single horse from Panel A at the El Caido site (Reprinted courtesy of La Tierra).

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
unhorsed in combat. Among the Kiowa, rescuing
a comrade was considered one of the most heroic
deeds that a man could perform and the act contributed to a man’s prestige and social standing
(Mishkin 1940:39-40). Similarly, a Comanche warrior who rescued a comrade was afforded certain
honors, including the right to wear a war bonnet.
Indeed, ownership of a bonnet, which could be
earned through the performance of a variety of
brave deeds, carried with it an obligation to assist
one’s imperiled companions. If a warrior ignored
the plight of an unhorsed comrade he not only
faced public censure, but also forfeited the right
to wear a bonnet (Kavanagh 2008:57, 263, 316).
In both Kiowa and Comanche society insti­
tutionalized practices existed to ensure that
men received recognition for their martial feats.
When Kiowa warrior societies paraded around
camp, any society member who had rescued a
dismounted comrade was permitted to reenact
and publicize his exploit by riding with another

99

man mounted behind him (LaBarre 1935:1211;
Swan and Jordan 2011:155). The Kiowa warrior
Etahdleuh illustrated this practice in a drawing of a
warrior society parade (Figure 10). The Comanche
observed a similar custom. Prior to departing
on a raid, Comanche warriors would mount and
ride through camp. At this time, a man who had
saved a dismounted comrade in battle might call
attention to his deed by taking up another man
behind him and riding double as the party paraded.
Commenting on this practice, Post Oak Jim, a
Comanche elder, observed that “two riders on one
horse [was] a sign of honor” (Kavanagh 2008:137).
Thus, this rather enigmatic pictograph can
be understood as a depiction of a man performing one of the most celebrated feats a Kiowa or
Comanche warrior could achieve. While narrative
details frequently depicted in rescue scenes drawn
on paper are absent, the ethnographic record and
the testimony of Post Oak Jim suggest that the
image of two men riding double would have been

sufficiently evocative on its own.
Members of the artist’s community,
as well as members of neighboring
Plains tribes, would have understood
the pictograph as commemorating an
act of heroism in which a mounted
warrior rescued a comrade.
WARRIOR SOCIETY
REGALIA
Knowledge of Southern Plains
material culture, specifically military
society regalia, can aid in the interpretation of another image the El Caido site. This figure appears in Panel B
(Figure 11) and is one of two incised
and painted pedestrian warriors. The
warrior is rendered in a frontal pose,
with arms outstretched and bent at
the elbow. The individual’s left leg
is turned to the right and bent at the
knee. Narrow incised lines extending
from below the arms and along the
edges of the legs appear to represent
fringe (Labadie et al. 1997:24). On
the Southern Plains, hide clothing,
including men’s shirts and leggings,
was frequently adorned with long,
twisted fringe (Hail 1980:69; Hovens
2010:224). The individual holds a
saber or sword in his left hand and
an object identified as a rifle in his
right.13 In addition, the figure features Figure 11. Image of a warrior wearing a no-retreat sash from Panel B at

sodalities. A sash owner was under an obligation
to stand his ground in combat. Should the enemy
begin to prevail, he was expected to stake himself
down by driving a lance or arrow through the end
of his sash. Anchored in this manner, the sash
owner could not retreat unless a comrade removed
the arrow or lance pinning him in place. If he was
not freed, he was obligated to remain and fight
even in the face of overwhelming odds (Meadows
1999:213, 2010:222-223).
The use of no-retreat sashes among Southern
Plains tribes is well documented. Two members
of the Kiowa Unafraid of Death or Skunkberry
Society wore red cloth sashes.14 Certain members
of the tribe’s Sentinel or Scout Dogs Society also
owned no-retreat sashes. While the two leaders
of the society shared a black sash, other select
members wore red sashes made of elk hide or cloth
(Meadows 2010:136, 222-223). Among the Quahada Comanche no-retreat sashes made of bison
hide were worn by members of both the Big Horses
and Little Horses societies. In addition, individual
Comanche men occasionally made personal vows
never to retreat in battle. These men also wore noretreat sashes (Kavanagh 2008:267-268; Meadows
1999:278-281, 289). No-retreat sashes were employed by the Plains Apache, as well. Officers in the
Manatidie or Blackfeet Society included four lance
bearers, each of whom wore a sash. Similarly, noretreat sashes served as the emblems of office for the
four leaders of the tribe’s Klintidie or Horsemen’s
Society (Meadows 1999:205-207, 212-213). Given
its widespread distribution on the Southern Plains,

the no-retreat sash has limited diagnostic potential
as far as assigning tribal affiliation is concerned.
Swords and sabers were used as symbols of
authority by the officers of three Kiowa warrior
societies. The leadership of each of these societies
included two whipmen, who were responsible for
recruiting initiates, maintaining order during society
functions, and ensuring that the members participated in the society’s dances (Meadows 1999:50).
One whipman in each society carried a sword or a
saber as his emblem of office (Meadows 2010:28,
37, 222). In the Mountain Sheep and the Horse
Headdresses societies these men carried straight
swords. The term straight sword may refer to the
Model 1840 Noncommissioned Officers Sword or
the Model 1860 Staff and Field Officers Sword,
both of which featured straight blades (McChristian
1995:26, 139-140 and Figures 105 and 106). One
of the whipmen in the Sentinel or Scout Dogs Society carried a weapon described simply as a sword
(Meadows 2010:222), suggesting that it may have
had a curved blade. The weapon wielded by the
figures at the El Caido site has a curved blade and
appears to be a saber.
The warrior is depicted both wearing a noretreat sash and carrying a saber, raising the possibility that he is one of the Kiowa Sentinel or Scout
Dogs Society whipmen. The society’s whipmen
shared a red no-retreat sash, which either man was
free to wear (Meadows 2010:223). However, the
fact that the warrior is depicted in association with
both a no-retreat sash and a saber is not conclusive
evidence of his tribal affiliation or warrior society

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
membership. The figure is not depicted wearing the
distinctive headdress associated with the Sentinel or
Scout Dogs Society. Members of the society wore
headdresses comprised of red painted owl feathers
(Meadows 2010:227). Drawings of society members
wearing these headdresses occur in Kiowa ledger
art (Harris 1989:Plate 13; McCoy 1997:Plate 46;
Smithsonian Institution 2012c). The fact that the
figure at the El Caido site is not depicted wearing
such a headdress argues against his identification as
a member of the society.
Regardless of his tribal affiliation, the no-retreat
sash serves to delineate the warrior’s stature within
his tribal community, identifying him as either a
member or officer of a warrior society. Individuals
were selected to serve as officers in Plains warrior
societies on the basis of their prior martial accomplishments (Meadows 1999:43, 205, 212; Kroeber
1983:157). Consequently, depictions of men wearing warrior society regalia reference not only the
offices that these men held, but also their war records. These emblems indexed the very exploits that
qualified these men to hold office (Jordan 2012:24).
Analysis of this static figure at the El Caido
site indicates that the artist attempted to convey
information regarding his standing within his tribe.
The figure is depicted with a sword, an item that was
carried as badge of office by the leaders of several
Kiowa warrior societies. In addition, the warrior
wears a no-retreat sash. Regardless of whether the
sash is intended to denote the figure’s membership
in a particular warrior society or his service as an
officer in one of these societies, it marks him as a
man of distinction.
While the drawing represents a departure from
the scenes of combat and horse stealing characteristic of the Biographic tradition, it nonetheless evidences a focus on male martial achievement, rank,
and social status. A corollary for this drawing can be
found in ledger art. Plains Indian artists occasionally created portraits in which warriors are depicted
displaying distinctive lances that identify them as
warrior society officers (Jordan 2012:29). The figure
at the El Caido site suggests that similar portraits
depicting men with their warrior society insignia
may be found in Southern Plains biographic rock art.
CONCLUSIONS
A great deal of ethnographic data on the Southern Plains tribes has emerged since the reports

103

on the Hussie Miers and El Caido sites were first
published in 1989 and 1997. Important sources
include studies of Southern Plains military societies (Meadows 1999, 2010), as well as the edited
and annotated notes of the 1933 ethnographic field
school among the Comanche (Kavanagh 2008). In
addition, the last decade has seen the publication
of a number of studies of Southern Plains drawings
(Calloway 2012; Earenfight 2007; Greene 2013a,
2013b; Szabo 2007, 2011). Online databases,
including the Smithsonian Institution Research
Information Service and the Plains Indian Ledger
Art site maintained by the University of California
San Diego, provide access to images drawn by
nineteenth century Kiowa and Southern Cheyenne
artists. Consequently, there is a growing body of
comparative work available to contemporary scholars interested in exploring Biographic tradition
rock art on the Southern Plains.
The existence of a rich body of data on the ethnography of the Southern Plains tribes eliminates
the need to look for ethnographic analogies and
comparative material in the records of Northern
Plains tribes. Keyser and Klassen (2001:243) noted
that “[t]he wide distribution of Biographic rock art
clearly indicates its pan-Plains cultural affiliations,
with most basic forms, designs, and compositional
expressions being shared among all Plains groups.”
However, an emphasis on these shared properties
has led researchers to propose interpretations of
Southern Plains rock art based on ethnographic
data derived from Northern Plains tribes. Such an
approach can obscure the existence of regional
and tribal variations. For example, Labadie et al.
(1997:19) suggest that the headdresses worn by the
two men depicted riding double in Panel A at the El
Caido site mark the men as members of a warrior
society, noting that “[f]eather and horn bonnets
were badges of membership in warrior or police
societies in many Plains tribes.” The sources cited
in support of this contention reference examples
drawn exclusively from Northern Plains tribes.15 A
review of the ethnographic literature on the Kiowa,
Comanche, and Apache, the tribes most likely affiliated with the El Caido site, indicates that horned
bonnets did not function as emblems of warrior
society membership in these tribes. While Plains
tribes shared many traits, each possessed its own
distinctive sets of beliefs and practices.
The results of the present study suggest the
utility of revisiting previously recorded Southern
Plains biographic rock art sites in light of newly

104

Texas Archeological Society

available ethnographic data on Southern Plains
tribes. Reanalysis of the images at the Hussie
Miers and El Caido sites led to the documentation
of two items of material culture that had not been
identified in previous studies of the sites, as well
as the correct identification of two additional objects which researchers had initially misidentified.
At the Hussie Miers site, Turpin’s identification
of the Euro-American figures’ headgear as U.S.
military dress helmets led her to assign the site a
post-1871 date and to identify the figures as U.S.
troops. However, this identification now appears
incorrect. The artist was more likely representing
a form of headgear worn by Mexican soldiers. This
revelation opens up the range of possible dates for
the petroglyphs.
Furthermore, the identification of hairplates
worn by the protagonist at the Hussie Miers site
and a mounted figure in Panel A at the El Caido
site has implications for the dating of both sites.
While the presence of horses and firearms date
these sites to the Historic period, the presence of
hairplates indicates that the sites date no earlier
than the 1830s. Thus, the recognition of hairplates
as part of the biographic rock art lexicon provides
archeologists with another tool for dating Historic
period rock art.
Incorporating the Southern Plains ethnographic record into the analysis of these sites has
also yielded new interpretations. Identification of
the clusters of clipped crow feathers adorning the
protagonist’s lance at the Hussie Miers site focuses
attention on the role of spiritual power or medicine
in Plains Indian warfare. The depiction of crow
feathers, which the Kiowa and Comanche considered to be a form of protective medicine, suggest
that the combat scenes were intended to function
simultaneously as religious narratives, testifying
to the efficacy of the warrior’s medicine. At the
El Caido site, the no-retreat sash worn by a figure
in Panel B demonstrates how depictions of static
figures can nonetheless reference martial exploits.
While the figure is not shown engaged in combat,
his no-retreat sash testifies to his bravery and martial prowess. The sash serves as an emblem of his
prior exploits, as well as the behavior expected of
him in future engagements.
Comparison of the pictograph of two figures
mounted on a single horse at the El Caido site
with Cheyenne drawings on paper and Kiowa and
Comanche ethnographic accounts has revealed
that the image represents a warrior rescuing

his unhorsed comrade, a deed that the Kiowa
and Comanche recognized and celebrated as a
war honor. While this act is depicted in several
ledger drawings (Calloway 2012:Plate 38; Greene
1996:74 and Plate 1; Bates et al. 2003:Figures 4-5;
Smithsonian Institution 2012b), the image at the El
Caido site is the only portrayal of this war honor
appearing in Plains Biographic rock art.
Several studies of Biographic tradition rock art
sites on the Northern Plains have identified items
of material culture that can serve as ethnic markers
(Keyser 1991; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008; Sundstrom and Keyser 1998). As Keyser and Klassen
(2001:243) note, “the analysis of the material culture depicted in rock art may point to ethnic styles,
since certain objects may be restricted to specific
cultural groups.” Unfortunately, it is not possible
to assign a tribal affiliation to either of the rock
art sites in this study on the basis of the material
culture depicted in the drawings. The Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache shared similar clothing
styles and their warrior societies employed related
regalia. While the analysis of additional Southern
Plains Biographic rock art sites may reveal objects
of material culture that were used exclusively by a
single group and that are therefore capable of serving as ethnic markers, the objects represented at the
El Caido and Hussie Miers sites saw widespread
use among the Southern Plains tribes.
Ultimately, an interdisciplinary approach to the
study of Southern Plains Biographic rock art offers
the best potential for enhancing our understanding
of this art form. Discussing the requisite knowledge required to interpret Plains Indian drawings
on paper, McLaughlin (2013:46) underscores the
necessity of “a deep and sustained engagement
with historical, biographical, and ethnographic
sources on nineteenth-century Plains Indian cultures, U.S. westward expansion, and both Plains
and U.S. military history and material culture.”
The study of historic Biographic rock art demands
similar expertise. And, for scholars studying Southern Plains rock art, one can add to McLaughlin’s
list knowledge of Mexican military history and
uniforms. It is unlikely that a single scholar could
possess the breadth of knowledge described by
McLaughlin. The expertise required to situate
Biographic rock art in its cultural and historical
contexts calls for an interdisciplinary approach.
One can envision a research team comprised of
archeologists, ethnologists specializing in the ethnohistory and material culture of specific tribes,

Jordan—A Reanalysis of the Hussie Miers and El Caido Sites
and nineteenth century military historians. Such
interdisciplinary collaborations appear to point the
way forward.
ENDNOTES
1. The last documented example of Biographic rock
art is a petroglyph at Writing-On-Stone that was created
in 1924 and features an automobile (Keyser 2004:67).
2. Anthropologists have criticized the tendency to apply
the term “ledger art” to all Plains Indian drawings on paper.
They maintain that the uncritical use of the term obscures
important issues of materiality, form, and function. Greene
(2004:22) argues that bound books of drawings differ from
drawings on unbound sheets of paper. An important quality
of the former is their ability to serve as “compendia holding the pictured deeds together, maintaining some essential
sense of connection that would be lost if the images were
separate, unrelated representations.” McLaughlin has proposed a further distinction between pre-reservation books
that Plains Indian warriors captured and subsequently used
to record their martial exploits and reservation era drawing
books. She advocates the use of the term “war books” to
refer to those objects seized as war trophies, arguing that
these objects’ unique biographies warrant a separate classification (McLaughlin 2013:48-49).
3. Parsons offers an analysis of two Plains Indian
rock art sites, the Mujares Creek site, located in Oldham
County, Texas and the Verbena site, located in Garza
County, Texas. He correctly interprets one rock art panel
at the Mujares Creek site as a tally of captured weapons.
Using ethnographic sources, including ledger drawings,
he is able to identify two of the weapons as bow lances.
Bow lances, essentially large bows fitted with metal
blades or points, were carried by the officers and members
of several Plains Indian warrior societies. Based on the
location of the site and the distribution of the bow lance in
Plains Indian tribes, Parsons concludes that the weapons
depicted at Mujares Creek were most likely captured from
the Southern Cheyenne. He posits that the Kiowa captured
the weapons in 1837 when they defeated a large Cheyenne
force and created the petroglyph to commemorate their
victory (Parsons 1987:261-267).
4. The Kiowa first encountered silver coins in the
winter of 1832-1833 when a raiding party under the leadership of Lame Old Man attacked a caravan of Missouri
merchants near the South Canadian River in the Texas
panhandle. According to Josiah Gregg, the party was
returning from Santa Fe and was carrying approximately
ten thousand dollars in specie (Mooney 1979:255 [1898]).
5. The drawing likely depicts men gathering for a
warrior society meeting. The presences of weapons, the

105

face paint worn by the figure on the right, and the painted
horse with a scalp hanging from its bridle, all convey a
martial tone. The covers of tipis were frequently rolled up
during warrior society feasts and dances to accommodate
the large number of attendees and allow spectators to view
the proceedings (Swan and Jordan 2011:156).
6. For a photograph of Pawnee men’s moccasins see
Cowdrey (1999:Figure 13).
7. In an earlier essay (Jordan 2011:123) discussing the
Hussie Miers site, the author posited that “the depiction of
a set of hair plates [sic] strongly suggests a Kiowa origin”
for the pictographs. In light of evidence that members
of several Southern Plains tribes adopted hairplates, the
author no longer sees the objects as markers of tribal
affiliation.

10. Etahdleuh was one of 72 Southern Plains prisoners sent east following the end of the Red River War. In
addition to 26 Kiowa compatriots, his fellow prisoners
included members of the Southern Cheyenne, Southern
Arapaho, Comanche, and Caddo tribes (Lookingbill
2006:42). For biographical information on Etahdleuh see
Lookingbill (2007:30-56) and Petersen (1971:135-159).
11. Initially, the author identified the headgear worn
by the non-Native combatants at the Hussie Miers site
as representing “one of the numerous styles of maned or
crested helmets worn by Mexican cavalry units at least as
early as 1835” (Jordan 2001:124). However, the discovery
of the drawings by Etahdleuh depicting Mexican lancers
wearing shakos adorned with tall pompoms, has led the
author to reject this interpretation.
12. Ewers (1969:184) identifies the clipped feathers as turkey vulture feathers. While Ewers may have
misidentified the feathers, it is conceivable that the
Comanche used turkey vulture and crow feathers interchangeably since both birds eat carrion. In Comanche
belief, crows were symbolically associated with warfare
since the birds often visited battlefields to feed on the
slain (Gelo 1986:5, 220).
13. A second pedestrian figure depicted in Panel B
at the El Caido site also carries a sword (LaBadie et. al.
1997:24 and Figure 13).
14. It is possible that one of the two sashes was made
of hide (Meadows 2010:140).
15. Howard (1954:23) notes that among the Dakota
the horned headdress was associated with the Stronghearts
