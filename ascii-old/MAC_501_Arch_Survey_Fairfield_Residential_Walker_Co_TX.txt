ABSTRACT
Between March 20 and March 23, 2007 a crew from Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc. performed an archeological investigation of a proposed housing development
property in Walker County, Texas. This was performed at the request of Berg Oliver and
Associates of Houston, Texas. The project involves the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers
(COE), but no permit number has been given as yet. The results will be subject to review
by the Berg Oliver, the COE and the Texas Historical Commission. The proposed Project
Area can be found on the Huntsville USGS quadrangle map in central Walker County. It
consists of two segments on either side (north and south) of Pine Shadows Drive in the
city of Huntsville. The northern segment covers an area of 7.9 acres. The southern
segment is 16.4 acres.
The methodology used during the investigation was developed in consultation with and
approved by COE and THC archeologist (personal communications Nicole Minnichbach,
COE Archeologist March 9, 2007 & Ed Baker, THC Archeologist March 12, 2007). A
total of 40 shovel tests were excavated in the Project Area. All but one shovel test
reached the sterile, basal clay subsoil. No prehistoric or historic properties were found.
The recommendation of Moore Archeological Consulting is that this project should be
allowed to proceed without further investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Between March 20 and March 23 of 2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. of
Houston, Texas, conducted an archeological survey of the proposed Fairfield Residential
LLC housing development tract (Figures 1-4). The investigation was performed at the
request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. (the client) on behalf of Fairfield Residential
(Fairfield) of Dallas, Texas. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) is involved with
this project and a permit has been applied for, but a permit number has not yet been
issued. The COE verification number is SWG-2007-115-RC. This report will be subject
to review by the Client, the COE and the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The proposed Project Area can be found on the Huntsville USGS quadrangle map in
central Walker County. It will involve construction of residential housing within a
general Project Area which is made up of two segments on either side (north and south)
of Pine Shadows Drive in the city of Huntsville. The northern segment covers an area of
7.9 acres. The southern segment is 16.4 acres. As of the onset of fieldwork there was no
proposed maximum depth of impact for the construction. Therefore it was assumed that
impacts would be significant in depth.
The objectives of the investigation were threefold: (A) to determine the presence or
absence of cultural materials within the location proposed for the housing development.
(B) To assess any potentially impacted archeological sites and provide recommendations
regarding mitigation measures if any are necessary. (C) To provide a report of the results
of the survey to the Client, the COE and the THC.
The archeological field crew excavated 40 shovel tests at predetermined locations within
the Project Area. Project Archeologist for the fieldwork Randy Ferguson and
Crewmember David Watts conducted this investigation under the supervision of Project
Archeologist Douglas G. Mangum and the Principal Investigator, Roger G. Moore.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS
Modern Climate
The modern climate of the Project Area can aptly be characterized as hot and wet for
most of the year. The mean annual temperature for the region is about 20 degrees
Centigrade, with mean rainfall of 117 centimeters. Summer temperatures average about
34 degrees Centigrade, with temperatures above 38 degrees common during July and
August (Carr 1967; St. Clair et al. 1975). The average winter temperature is a mild 18
degrees Centigrade. Freezes are infrequent and of short duration, with an average of 271
frost-free days per year. Snow, sleet, and freezing rain are uncommon.
Rainfall varies from 7 centimeters in March to 11 centimeters in December, with July to
December rainfall often supplemented by tropical fronts and storms. The rainfall records
range from a low of 45 centimeters to a high of 185 centimeters. Prevailing winds are
usually from the southeast, except during the winter months when âNorthersâ sweep into
the area.
Modern Flora and Fauna
Southeast Texas is within the Austroriparian biotic province near its western boundary
with the Texan province (Blair 1950:98-101). This boundary, set by available moisture
levels, is marked by pine-hardwood forests on the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The Project
Area is situated within the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian province and
includes, within its western limits, portions of the coastal prairie (Tharp 1939).
Grasses within the coastal prairies and marshes vegetation area are described from a
range-management perspective in Hoffman et al. (nd: 45). This 10,000,000-acre area
consists of 9,500,000 acres of gulf prairies and 500,000 acres of gulf marshes. The
regional vegetation of the coastal prairies is characterized as follows:
âThe principal grasses of the prairies are tall bunchgrass, including big bluestem
(Andropon gerardi), little bluestem, seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium, var.
littorus), Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass (Tripascum dactyloides), switchgrass, and gulf
cordgrass. Seashore saltgrass is common on moist saline sites. Grazing pressures have
changed the composition of the range vegetation so that the grasses now existing are
broomsedge bluestem, smutgrass, threeawns, tumblegrass and many other inferior
grasses. The other plants that have invaded the productive grasslands are oak
underbrush, mcartney rose, huisache, mesquite, pricklypear, ragweed, bitter sneezeweed,
broomweed, and many other unpalatable annual weedsâ (Hoffman et al. nd: 45).

The dominant floral species of the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian biotic
province include loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica).
Hardwood forests are found on lowlands within the Austroriparian and are characterized
by such trees as sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora),
tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra) and other species of oaks, elms, and

7

ashes, as well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneiodes) and palmetto
(Sabal glabra). Swamps are common in the region.
Blair (1950) and Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990:12-15) define the following mammals
as common within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis
latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus,
Lasiurus borealis, Sciurus niger, Sciurus carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps, Reithrodonomys fulvescens, Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris, cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus,), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus.). Bison (Bison bison) may have
been present on nearby grasslands at various times in the past (Gadus and Howard
1990:15).
Common land turtles include eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and Terrapene
ornata, while snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river
cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus, and
Ophiosaurus ventralis. Snakes and amphibians are also present in considerable numbers
and diversity.
The resources provided by river-influenced estuarine and marsh environments were
undoubtedly of great importance to the littoral residents of southeast Texas. These
resources are admirably summarized by Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990: 12 - 15).
Estuarine fish resources cited by Gadus include sand trout (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted
sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon undulatus), striped mullet
(Mugil cephalus), southern flounder (Paralichthysis lethostigma), shortnose gar
(Lepisosteus platostomus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), freshwater drum
(Aplodinotus grunniens), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata), and bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus) and other sunfishes. Common shellfish include Rangia (Rangia cuneata),
Macoma spp., dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis), oyster (Crassostrea virginica),
Vioscalba louisianae, and olive nerite (Neritina [Vitta] reclivata). Arthropods, such as
shrimp and crab, are also numerous and highly productive.
Area marshes replete with plants such as cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), reeds (Phragmites
spp.), giant millet (Setaria magna), and bullrushes (Scirpus spp.) would have formed a
highly attractive and bountiful magnet for waterfowl (Gadus and Howard 1990).
Within the Project Area there is a mixture of open areas, wooded tracts and a man-made
pond. Canopy vegetation includes Pine, various Oaks, Elm, Cedar and Osage orange. The
understory was a mix of Yaupon, various vines, Poison ivy and other low growing shrubs
and grasses.
Animal life reported by the field crew included Hoot owls, Red-tailed hawks, Cardinals,
Sparrows, loggerhead turtle, Box terrapin, Fox squirrels and a single Alligator in the pond
in the north of the Project Area.

Soils and Geology
The segment of the Texas Gulf Coast that encompasses the current Project Area is on
soils laid down primarily over the last million to two million years. It sits on the
Beaumont Formation, a band of alluvial deltaic soils running parallel to the coastline that
was deposited during a series of glacial and interglacial intervals during the Middle to
Late Pleistocene epoch. Downcutting and erosion processes during the most recent
glacial period incised and widened many of the river drainages running through the
Beaumont Formation. After the sea levels rose again during the Holocene, these river
valleys then filled with alluvial soils and created broad, level floodplains. The Project
Area is within the Depcor-Annona-Huntsburg association.
The proposed project area is depicted on sheets 38 of the Soil Survey of Walker County,
Texas (McClintock et al, 1979). Two soil types show up within the footprint of the
project elements. These are Ferris clay and Annona association. Ferris Clay soils are
upland side slope soils, while the Annona soils are deep soils on convex uplands in interstream areas. The Project Area is outside of the PALM archeological liability mapping
area, but Abbott (2002:Table 2) classifies Ferris Clay as an ancient clayey alluvium with
little potential for deeply buried sites.
Hydrology
The only significant stream affecting the Project Area is an unnamed tributary to Town
Branch, which runs from the west end of the southern portion of the Project Area through
the northeast corner of this same portion. This stream flows into Town Branch less than
200 meters to the east of the boundary of the Project Area. Town Branch has significant
prehistoric utilization a short distance downstream from the current Project Area.
There are also two unnamed drainages that drain into this tributary within the Project
Area. An examination of aerials from the late 1990âs and from 1975 suggest that these
streams are likely in close to their natural state.
An additional modern source of water is a pond in the middle of the northern tract.
However the field crew confirmed that this is a man made feature. This could have had
no impact on the potential for prehistoric occupation.

9

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, which has been
recently summarized by Patterson (1995). Other recent prehistoric summaries equally
pertinent to the prehistory of the Brazoria-Fort Bend County area include Ensor (1991),
Fields (1986) and Moore and Moore (1991). The reader is referred to these works for
detailed data on the prehistory of this region.
Previous investigations in Southeast Texas have demonstrated that prehistoric people
occupied this area as early as 12,000 years ago. Throughout prehistory the inhabitants
were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Ensor (1990) has proposed a prehistoric cultural
sequence of periods for Southeast Texas: Paleo-Indian (10,000-8,000 BC), Early Archaic
(8,000-5,000 BC), Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000 BC), Late Archaic (1,000 BCâAD 400),
Early Ceramic (AD 400-800), and Late Ceramic (AD 800-1750).
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of Southeast Texas is scarce in the Paleo-Indian
period and, indeed, is rather ambiguous through the Middle Archaic period (Patterson
1983; Aten 1983:156-157). However, although most previously recorded sites date to the
Late Archaic and Ceramic periods, it is probable that older sites have been lost to erosion,
channel cutting, and, particularly in the case of very early sites, to rising sea level. In
cases where early-dating artifacts have been found, such as Wheatâs (1953) finds of
projectile points dating from the Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic periods at Addicks
Reservoir in western Harris County, the materials occur in deposits with poor contextual
integrity.
Sites dating from the Late Archaic through the Ceramic periods are much more
commonly found in the project vicinity. During the Late Archaic period, modern
climatic conditions evolved, sea level rose and stabilized, and coastal woodlands
expanded. Aten (1983) hypothesizes that an increase in population and the establishment
of seasonal rounds, including regular movement from littoral to inland areas, occurred
during the Late Archaic.
Aten (1983) has proposed that ceramics were introduced in the aboriginal artifact
assemblage on the Upper Texas Coast in approximately AD 100. Ensor (1991) places the
beginnings of the Early Ceramic period at AD 400, which may be more applicable for
areas inland from the coastline. The Early Ceramic period is characterized by a
continued growth in population levels. Ensor (1991) places the beginning of the Late
Ceramic at AD 800 that coincides with the introduction of the bow and arrow. A plain
sand-tempered pottery dominates throughout both parts of the Ceramic era. Story et al.
(1990) have defined the Mossy Grove Cultural Tradition for Late Prehistoric cultures in
Southeast Texas with sandy paste pottery being the principle diagnostic artifact type.
European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation in the areas
inland from the Upper Texas Coast until after the 18th century (Patterson 1995; 249). But
European diseases, probably introduced by explorers and early traders, did begin to have
impacts as early as 1528 (at least seven epidemics were recorded among the tribes of the

10

study area between 1528 and 1890 [Ewers, 1974]). During the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, epidemic diseases, the mission system, and the fur trade acted to severely
reduce, and in some cases exterminate, the indigenous populations.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
There have been no previous archeological investigations within the Project Area. A
number of surveys have been conducted in the Eastham-Thomason Park roughly 400
meters to the northeast of the current Project Area. All were conducted by Moore
Archeological Consulting.
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. of Houston, Texas conducted both of these
investigations. The first was completed in 1990 (Moore and Moore). This survey appears
to have covered approximately 48 acres of the park. However, it is not clear from the
original report or records from that survey as to the number of shovel tests. The overall
impression is of a reconnaissance level investigation with more visual examination than
shovel testing.
The second survey was conducted in 1999 (Moore et al.). This survey discovered site
41WA99. This survey covered portions of a 100-acre expansion to the park. This survey,
while more intensive than the 1990 investigation, did not entirely cover the areas
examined in this assessment.
The most recent survey was conducted in 2005 (Mangum and Moore) and dealt with a
number of specific improvement elements within the existing tract. These totaled
approximately 3 acres of area. No cultural resources were found during the investigation.

11

METHODS
The pedestrian cultural resources survey covered 100% of the Project Area. The survey
was conducted in accordance with prevailing standards accepted by the State, the Council
of Texas Archeologists, and Section 106 regulations. This methodology was developed in
consultation with and approved by COE and THC archeologist (personal communications
Nicole Minnichbach, COE Archeologist March 9, 2007 & Ed Baker, THC Archeologist
March 12, 2007). All areas of exposed soil were examined for surface exposure of
cultural remains and features. Shovel testing was conducted in an attempt to identify
buried cultural resources within the Project Area. Shovel tests along the stream channels
were done at a 100-meter interval along either bank. Shovel tests away from the stream
were done in random placement based on judgement of the field crew.
Alterations were made to shovel test locations when necessary to avoid landscape
variations such as roads and other impacted areas. Alterations were also made to allow
testing of better landforms such as mounds and stream banks. All visible surfaces were
examined for historic or prehistoric archeological materials. Surface visibility varied
greatly throughout the Project Area, from 100%-0%. Some areas were eroded and
provided complete visibility while other locations were invisible due to dense
groundcover and pine duff.
The crew excavated all shovel tests in 10-cm arbitrary levels and screened the soils
through 1/4â hardware cloth. Soils that were too compact or clayey to sieve through
hardware cloth were broken up by hand. All materials were carefully examined for
cultural artifacts. Location, size, depth, and all other information for each shovel test was
recorded on standardized Moore Archeological Consulting shovel test forms. Shovel tests
were immediately backfilled. The UTM locations of all shovel tests were recorded
utilizing handheld, recreation-grade GPS units (Magellan GPS 315s). The location of
each shovel test was then plotted on a USGS quadrangle map of the Project Area (Figure
5) utilizing ArcView 3.3.
Based on the soils it was not anticipated that deep reconnaissance (in the form of backhoe
trenching) would be necessary for this project. It was proposed that should deep,
undisturbed and intact deposits be found during the shovel testing it would be necessary
to reevaluate the need for backhoe trenching. If it was then determined that backhoe
trenching was required, then a separate proposal and budget would be determined. Out of
the forty shovel tests excavated, all but one reached the clay subsoil anywhere between
the surface to 115 cmbs. The exception (ST 39) reached 116 cmbs and was still in sandy
clay loam. However the percentage of clay was increasing and suggested that the clayey
subsoil was within a few centimeters more of depth. Furthermore this shovel test was
within 40 meters or so of three other shovel tests, all of which had reached clay between
7 and 35 cmbs. This suggests a fairly isolated pocket of moderately deeper soil. It is felt
that a single instance of deeper soils out of 40 shovel tests does not justify backhoe
trenching within the tract.

12

Any locality that produced either prehistoric or historic cultural remains was recorded on
State of Texas archeological site forms for submission to Texas Historical Commission.
In addition to form information, photographs, plan and stratigraphic sketches and
measured drawings and crewmembersâ daily field notes documented sites and features.
Investigations at any identified site or feature sought to determine site boundaries, depth,
nature of the archeological deposits, and the siteâs state of preservation as far as was
possible with shovel testing. Archeological sites and cultural features were photographed,
mapped in plan view and plotted with accuracy on USGS quadrangle maps and project
maps. If possible, a recommendation for State Archeological Landmark and National
Register of Historic Places eligibility was made.
For buried or obscure sites, boundaries were delineated through shovel test excavation.
Where necessary, shovel tests were dug at 5 or 10-meter (16.5â or 33â) intervals radially,
generally in the cardinal directions from the presumed center of each site until no further
artifacts were encountered in two successive units (or until the boundary of the Project
Area was reached). The site boundaries on each radius were presumed to lie between the
last artifact-producing test and the first sterile unit. Information on the depth and nature
of the deposits was derived from shovel test results, as well as available surface
observations. No prehistoric resources were found during this investigation.
The collection policy for this survey was that (1) we would retain any prehistoric or
potentially pre-1870 historic materials recovered from shovel tests or other subsurface
investigations that did not prove, after extensive site delineation tests, to be isolated
artifacts1, and (2) for surface materials: only diagnostic cultural materials from the above
periods would be collected and retained.
Photographs were taken of the Project Area and general landforms within it. Photographs
were also taken of any feature that stood out (i.e. pimple mounds, structure remnants,
etc.) and of localities that could not be dug for various reasons. Photograph direction,
subject, photographer name, and dates were recorded on a standard Moore Archeological
Consulting photographic log.

These isolated artifacts, such as a single flake surrounded by multiple, negative shovel tests, will be
reburied and the isolate will not be recorded as an archeological site.

RESULTS
In March of 2007, a crew from Moore Archeological Consulting performed a pedestrian
archeological survey of the tracts where it is proposed to construct a housing
development in Walker County, Texas (Figures 1-4). This survey was performed utilizing
shovel testing and visual examination of all visible surfaces as described in the
METHODS section. This sampling methodology resulted in the excavation of 40 shovel
tests during the survey and the visual inspection of approximately 24.3 acres of ground
surface within the Project Area (Figure 5).
On average 1 shovel test was excavated per .6 acre within the Project Area. All of the 40
shovel tests excavated within the Project Area during the survey were sterile and nearly
all reached the clay subsoil at depths ranging from the surface to 115 cmbs. The
exception (ST 39) reached 116 cmbs and was still in sandy clay loam. However the
percentage of clay was increasing and suggested that the clayey subsoil was within a few
centimeters more of depth. Furthermore this shovel test was within 40 meters or so of
three other shovel tests, all of which had reached clay between 7 and 35 cmbs. This
suggests a fairly isolated pocket of moderately deeper soil. It is felt that a single instance
of deeper soils out of 40 shovel tests does not justify backhoe trenching within the tract.
No historic or prehistoric cultural resources were observed or recovered during the
investigation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the negative findings of this archeological investigation reported herein, it is the
recommendation of Moore Archeological Consulting that no additional archeological
investigation is necessary in the Project Area for the proposed construction of the housing
development before construction begins. Should archeological deposits or features be
encountered during construction, it is advised that construction cease in the immediate
area of the finds and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should
be contacted for further consultation.
