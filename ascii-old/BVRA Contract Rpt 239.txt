ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the route of the proposed Drennan Road and
Plantation Drive in central Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on July 13, 2010 under Antiquities Permit
5696 for the City of Conroe. The total length of the two roads as currently proposed
is 5170 feet, and the area investigated consisted of 7.4 acres. No archaeological
sites were found, and no artifacts were collected. Copies of the report are on file at
the Texas Historical Commission, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the
Texas State Library, City of Conroe, and BVRA.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The City of Conroe plans to construct two new roads as Phase I of the
proposed Plantation Drive and Drennan Road Project in the city limits of Conroe
(Figure 1). The new roads will be named Drennan Road and Plantation Drive.
Construction of Plantation Drive will begin at Farm-to-Market Road 3083 and
extend 3920 feet to the south where it will connect with the proposed Drennan
Road. From there, the new road will extend 1250 feet to the west where it will
connect with Interstate Highway 45. Both roads will consist of four lanes and a
median. The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle
Conroe (3095-132) dated 1958 and photorevised in 1976 (Figure 2) and an aerial
photograph dated 2005 (Figure 3).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is the City of Conroe, and
BVRA was retained to perform the archaeological survey. William E. Moore was
the Principal Investigator. Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist, and
he was assisted by Philip C. Bishop. The field survey involved sixteen person
hours and was performed on July 13, 2010. The reviewing agency is the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and prior archaeological surveys and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Montgomery County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Those reports reviewed include work
in the San Jacinto River Basin by Harry J. Shafer (1968) and a 450-acre tract in
Harris and Montgomery counties conducted by BVRA (Moore 1991). The project
area was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel testing. Shovel
tests were dug to sterile clay in most areas. Two tests were excavated in areas
where gravel and concrete and overburden spoil was present. Excavated earth
from the tests was screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were
entered onto a log (Appendix I), and the project was documented through field
notes and digital photography. Sixteen shovel tests were excavated (Figure 4).

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
previously recorded prehistoric sites had been recorded in close proximity to the
project area. In addition, there is no evidence that the area had been visited by a
professional archaeologist. At the time of this survey, the northern two-thirds of the
area was in developed pasture that had been heavily disturbed by plowing, ponds,
contouring, and a road to an office complex. The rest of the area was in thick
woods. Soils in the area consisted of sandy loam over clay in most areas. At two
shovel test locations, clay was observed at the surface, and two areas had been
disturbed by overburden and spoil, gravel, and concrete. Most of the shovel tests
were terminated at depths of 65 cm or less when clay was encountered. Only two
tests were dug past this depth, and they were stopped at 90 cm and 100 cm.
Figure 5 illustrates the pasture present in the northern portion of the project area.
No archaeological sites were found, and it is our opinion that the project area was
not occupied in prehistoric times because of the distance from the area to a
perennial stream. The nearest such water source is Stewarts Creek that is 8000
feet to the east.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
