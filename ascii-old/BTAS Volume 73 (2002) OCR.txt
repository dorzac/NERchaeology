Foreword

Taking on the responsibilities as editor of the
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society after the
ten-year tenure of Tim Perttula is a somewhat daunting enterprise. Tim's high editorial standards and
his constant efforts to expand the horizons of the
STAS-including the numerous topical volumes produced under his guidance-have established a standard that will be difficult to emulate by myself and
future editors. It is my opinion, as well as that of
many in the Texas archeological community, that
through Tim's efforts the BTAS has attained a stature as one of the more outstanding and professional
archeological periodicals produced among the many
avocational societies across the United States.
Volume 73 is, in essence, a topical volume.
The current volume contains three articles that

report the results of past Texas Archeological
Society Field Schools. One of the articles describes
the results of the 1967 TAS Field School at the
Harold Williams Site and thus brings to light the
results of this important Caddoan excavation
conducted 34 years ago. Credit is due to the many
authors and T AS members-both professional and
avocational-who have worked diligently to
produce these reports. Credit is also due to Ron
Ralph and members of the Reports and Curation
Committee of the T AS for their ongoing program
to ensure that the backlog of T AS Field School
reports continues to reach publication.
The TAS gratefully acknowledges the Houston Endowment and its financial contribution that
partially funded the production of Volume 73.

JACK THOMAS HUGHES (1921-2001)

At the inaugural Floyd V. Studer Banquet of
the Panhandle Archaeological Society in 1977,
Curtis Tunnell described Jack Thomas Hughes as
"an adept archeologist and a fine philosopher. He
is a connoisseur of tamales, tequila, and chickenfried steaks. He is a picker of guitars and a singer
of songs, and he can tell gravelly-voiced stories
around a campfire that make your hair stand on
end. He is the only person I know who would
just as soon dig a Pliocene turtle as a Caddoan
pot." In more recent years, Jack was known to
share his wit and wisdom with a broader audience using list servers for archaeology, allowing
still younger generations of archaeologists to gain
some insight into the thoughts of the "Dean of
Panhandle Archaeology."
Born October 16,1921, Jack spent his youth
traveling with his parents to the many Texas highway construction and other building projects his
father supervised. He spent his spare time walking
the fields and woods of North and East Texas,
falling in love with the outdoors and the mysteries
of the natural world. At the age of eight, he became
one of the earliest members of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society. He received
his B.S. degree in geology and anthropology from
the University of Texas at Austin. He received his
M.A. in archeology from the University of Texas
as an exchange student with the National University of Mexico. In 1943 he interrupted his studies to
enlist in the U.S. Navy.
After 1945 he participated in archaeological
investigations across the Great Plains on the
Smithsonian Institution River Basin Surveys. That
work led him to Columbia University in New York
where he eventually earned a Doctor of Philosophy
in Anthropology for his analysis of the prehistory
of the Caddoan speaking tribes. In 1952 he became
curator of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
and an associate professor of Geology at West Texas

County. Photograph taken by Gort Rushmer, WTSU
Photographer.

State College, which later expanded to include the
fields of archaeology and anthropology.
Jack's enthusiasm for archeology was contagious, and professional and avocational archeologists alike found encouragement and support in
his mentorship. Although West Texas State never
offered a degree in anthropology, Jack's presence
there attracted some of the most significant scholars in the field. Jack received numerous awards
for his life-long efforts to preserve and understand
the past. Some of the more notable awards came

from the Society for American Archaeology, the
Texas Archeological Society, and the Texas Historical Commission.
Jack was a member of the Texas Archeological Society for over 50 years, serving as President
in 1963 and in a number of other capacities. He
directed the T AS Field School at Lake Meredith in
1969, and was named a TAS Fellow in 1980. Jack

Thomas Hughes, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, West
Texas A&M University, Canyon, died May 11,
2001. His legacy lives on in his many contributions
to Texas archeology and Texas archeologists, and
this volume is dedicated as a memorial to him.
This memorial was adapted and modified from
an obituary published in the Summer 2001 issue of
Texas Archaeology.

The Harold Williams Site (41CP10) and the Texas
Archeological Society Field School of 1967
Robert L. Turner Jr. and James E. Smith II, with contributions by Timothy K. Perttula,
Bo Nelson, Mark Walters, and Bobby Gonzalez

ABSTRACT
The Harold Williams site has yielded artifacts dating from the Archaic through the Titus phase occupation
of the site, the last Caddoan group to occupy this particular region of Northeast Texas. House and burial features
are present in the Middle Caddoan occupation, with a large cemetery characterizing the Titus phase component.
This article describes the 1967 Texas Archeological Society excavations, as well as the work done prior to 1967,
and the latest data from the 2000 investigations.

INTRODUCTION AND
BACKGROUND
The Williams site (41CP10) 1 is located
6.6 km east of Pittsburg in Camp County, Texas,
on the north side of Dry Creek (Figure 1). It is
2 km downstream of the Tuck Carpenter site
(41CP5) (Turner 1978), and 2.2 km upstream of
its confluence with Cypress Creek. Camp County
is part of the Pineywoods of East Texas with low
rolling hills covered with sandy soil and a mixed
hardwood and pine forest, except where cleared
for agriculture.
In the early 1940s, most likely in 1943, an
extremely heavy and prolonged rain came to Camp
County and the surrounding area. Cypress Creek
completely left its banks, covering the nearby Highway 11 bridge between Pittsburg and Daingerfield.
Dry Creek was also swollen and rose 15 or more
feet above its bed. Area B of the site (Figure 2), on
the first terrace above the floodplain, was partially
covered by the waters. When the water receded,
Mr. Albert Hilton, who farmed the property at that
time, found clusters of pottery vessels and skeletal
remains that had been exposed by the flood. He
collected the vessels.
This was an event of considerable local interest
and many visitors came to visit the site. Among
those was one, who with permission, excavated in
excess of 60 graves at the site (see Perttula and
Nelson 1998: Table 22).

In late 1948, when the senior author moved to
Pittsburg, Mr. Hilton no longer owned or knew where
any of the vessels were. However, eventually eight
were located and acquired (Figure 3). These are all
typical Late Caddoan Titus phase vessels.
From 1948 until 1959 the site was surface collected by the senior author. In 1959, 19 Titus phase
graves were excavated by the senior author, Ralph
Nicholas of Daingerfield, and Ed German of Lone
Star (see below). After this the site was undisturbed
until the 1967 Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
Field School.
In the spring of 1967, Mr. Harold Williams,
who had purchased the farm, leveled an area of the
property which was designated as Area A during
the Field School. A heavy rain caused a gully to
form, and exposed a grave. There was no skeletal
material, but a cluster of three pottery vessels remained, including two bowls and one bottle with an
engraved rattlesnake motif. Also with these artifacts was a stone earspool of unusual design. These
artifacts were found by the Williams' teen age children Belinda and Rickey.
The senior author was notified of this find by
the Williams family and visited the site with them.
At this time the TAS was looking for a location
for the Field School, and when the Williams family gave permission, the Harold Williams site
was chosen. The selection committee was composed of Kathleen Gilmore, C. A. Smith, and
J. Ned Woodall.

phase middens.

The sixth TAS Field School was held June 1725, 1967. J. Ned Woodall, then a Doctoral candidate at Southern Methodist University (SMU), was
the Archeologist in charge. Local arrangements were
made by the senior author, the camp boss was
Charlie Bollich, and Mrs. Martha Davis, of
Pittsburg, was the camp cook. Figures 4 and 5 are
photographs of several of the Field School participants at work, along with views of the site during
the excavations.
In 1968 Woodall received his Doctorate and
soon thereafter acquired a position at Wake Forest
University. As a result he was unable to write the
Field School report, although he did write a short
article (Woodall 1967). All artifacts were stored at
SMU awaiting analysis.
In 1968 the senior author left Pittsburg and
moved to Fort Worth where both authors of this
article became members of the Tarrant County

Archeological Society (TCAS). In January 1975,
the TCAS undertook the task of completing the
washing, sorting, identifying, labeling, and bagging
of the Harold Williams site artifacts. Turner and
Smith then started a more detailed analysis of the
artifacts for publication purposes, and a spread sheet
was devised so that artifacts from each level were
counted, and if ceramics were present, they were
classified by decorative technique. Lithics were also
separated into groups and counted as cortex flakes,
biface thinning flakes, flakes, chips, and cores. Stone
tools were also enumerated for each level as were
bone fragments, daub, charcoal, ear ornaments, and
pipe fragments. The projectile points were sorted
as darts or arrows, and classified to type where this
was possible.
This is where the project stalled. Jimmy Smith
had a change in employment and moved to
Cleburne, while the senior author remained in Fort

Worth. For this, among other reasons, the article
was not completed at that time. This is not to say
it was forgotten, for it was not, either by the authors or by TAS, who in the person of Bill Richmond reminded us several times each year that
this needed to be completed. If you are reading
this, he was successful.
This article not only includes the work of the
TAS Field School but also the information from the
senior author's surface collection, the available information from the 19 Titus Phase graves excavated
in 1959, as well as archeological data from Pits 19
and 20, excavated in the Spring and Summer of
2000 by Perttula, Nelson, Walters, and Gonzalez. It
is our objective to use all available information to
give an account of the people who have occupied
this piece of ground over the millennia.

THETAS PLAN OF ATTACK
Dr. E. Mott Davis and Lou Fullen supervised
the Area A excavations. Area B was supervised by
Cecil Calhoun and Bob Burleson, and Charles
Bandy supervised the Area C work. Area C was
located 269 m northwest of Area B (see below).
The metric system was used during the Field
School, and most excavated units were l x 1 m in
size, or multiples thereof. Levels were usually excavated in 15 cm increments, but 10 or 20 cm levels, or other thicknesses, were used as necessary.
In Areas A and C, the excavated units were identified only by their north and east designation at the
unit's southeast corner. In Area B, in addition to
the southeast corner designation, units were identified by Pit, Trench, or Feature, and an identifying number.
The surface of Area A and B had been row
cropped for many years, and there was no contextual integrity within the plow zone. During the excavations, the sediments were screened through
1
/4-inch hardware cloth, but in cases where speed
was essential, 1h-inch screens were used.

THE AREA A EXCAVATIONS
Dr. E. Mott Davis directed the large eastern area
dig where the Williams children found the exposed
vessels (Davis 1967; see also Turner [1997]). Lou
Fullen and the youth group excavated the western

7

part of Area A, which was between Davis and the
fence dividing Areas A and B (Figure 6).
The location of the vessels and earspool found
by Rickey and Belinda Williams, the platform pipe
(with a ceramic hand holding the bowl), and the
location of the grave found during excavation, are
also shown on Figure 6. The units north of N94,
and the trenches (Figure 7), were excavated by
shovel shaving and spot screening through a disturbed zone, about 20 cm in thickness, looking for
additional features. None were found, but many
artifacts were collected in this zone.
A trench was placed across the gully between
W108-W117/N89 (see Figure 6). Profiles were recorded on the north wall to depict the maximum
extent of the disturbed areas along the sides of the
gully. In the course of these excavations, a discernible midden was not identified, and most of the
artifacts were recovered between 0-20 cm bs.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of selected artifacts in Area A. The artifacts include earspools (Figure 9), a platform pipe and fragments (Figure lOb- lOd),
and several arrow and dart points (Figure 1ln-w).
The three pottery vessels discovered by the
Williams include two bowls and a bottle. One bowl
has a slightly compound shape with a nearly
rounded base (Figure 12a). The four continuous
lines around the rim are engraved. The body decorative technique is completely different. The pattern is composed of punctates with no zoning or
guide lines. The curvilinear pattern, repeated three
times around the vessel, was placed when the clay
was plastic and then smoothed before firing. The
small simple bowl (Figure 12c) is undecorated.
The most interesting of this group of vessels is
the bottle with the rattlesnake design motif (see
Figure 12b). The vessel is a light chocolate brown
color, and has been well-fired; no temper is apparent. The design incorporates four engraved snakes
in two pairs, with each pair of rattles connected at a
circle (Figure 12d-e); the engraved lines have a red
hematite pigment smeared in them. The broken top
of the bottle appears to be a recent break probably
caused by plowing. There are also four rockerstamping lines on the neck. A close examination of
the engraved rattlesnakes shows that three have the
same rattle design and one is slightly different. The
same is true for the forked tongues, as three are
alike and one is different (see Figure 12e). These
vessels belong to the Middle Caddo period occupation at the Harold Williams site.

During the course of the exploratory trenching
along the gully, a grave was found at N92/Wl 13
(Figure 13a-b). Including a vessel found in the adjacent unit directly to the south, there were six
vessels with the grave (Figure 13c-d). Additionally,
a Homan arrow point was found near vessel a (Figure 13e). A single arrow point, even though found
in a grave, may not be an intentional placement but
it was in the grave fill. There was no skeletal material associated with this vessel cluster, and the attempt to find a grave outline was unsuccessful.
One vessel is a small Pease Brushed-Incised
cooking jar with four vertical appliqued ridges that
quadrate the body (see vessel a in Figure 13c); the
latter is roughly smoothed, but not polished. The
rim is horizontally brushed, with three rows of
punctates encircling it. The broken bottle neck had
been squared and resmoothed for continued use
(see Figure 13d). The design on the body was lightly
engraved and somewhat carelessly done. One plain
jar (see Figure 13d) had fire clouds on the exterior
that ranged from near black to chocolate brown to

reddish-tan in color. The other three vessels are
plain bowls and jars (see Figure 13c-d). Based on
the overall assemblage, vessel size, bottle decoration, proximity to the other vessel grouping, and
total lack of skeletal remains, this grave is also
assigned to the Middle Caddo period occupation at
the Harold Williams site.
Area A, the Western Excavation
This area was excavated by the youth group
under the supervision of Lou Fullen. The top of
Figure 14 is a plan view of the excavation units,
with profiles below (north wall, except for the east
wall at View B-B). The excavations were carried
out in 15 cm levels. Numbers to the left and right
depict the quantity of sherds and lithics, respectively, found in each level of the various units.
Projectile points are sketched and shown at the
level at which they were found. Units N89/W120
and N89/W130-N89/W150 appear to be undisturbed

A-A and B-B show relatively recent organic
accumulations, including small limbs and sticks,
and a large deflated deposit of local ferruginous
sandstone rock and gravels that appeared to be the
remnant of a wash.
Found in these gravels were an Edgewood dart
point, two Homan arrow points, a modem ceramic

sherd, a glass bottle neck fragment, and a rim sherd
of Ripley Engraved with a pendant triangle motif.
These units were certainly disturbed, and agricultural activity had covered the rocky gully bed and
artifacts with 60 cm of recent overburden containing unrotted twigs and limbs.
In three of the undisturbed units, lithic debris
was found in the 15 cm level below the first

undisturbed units Gary dart points are found at
depths of 90-105 cm, 45-60 cm, and 60-75 cm,
with a Homan arrow point and an unidentified arrow
point in the plow zone (see Figure 1 lt-w). Figure
15 illustrates the density per m3 of the ceramic
sherds and lithic debris for each 15 cm level in the
undisturbed squares. Table 1 shows the percent of
the sherd decorative techniques at each level.

A:rea A Projectile Points
There are 30 projectile points from Area A,
including 11 arrow points and 19 dart points (see
Figures 11 and 14). More than 80 percent of the
arrow points are of the Homan type (Table 2), and
these have a rounded to somewhat bulbous stem,
whereas Alba and Bonham arrow points have rectangular stems that are usually straight across the

base (Suhm et al.1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Shafer
1973; Turner and Hester 1993). The dart points are
dominated by Gary points (68 percent of the dart
points in Area A), including both large and small
specimens (see Table 2).
In Area A, east, only a few of the units were
excavated very deeply by level. In four of the units,
projectile points were found below the disturbed
zone: a large Gary, 20-30 cm bs, a small Gary,
50 cm bs, and an Edgewood dart point and Homan
anÂ·ow point from 20-40 cm bs (see Figure 14).

Area B Excavations
Cecil Calhoun directed one crew of excavators
in Area B, Bob Burleson directed the other. The
main purpose of these excavations (see Figure 2)
was to locate house structures or other features
within the village area, as well as to recover associated artifacts in the midden.
Some of the excavations were designated as
pits, usually 2 x 2 m in size, but some were 1 x 2 m.
The pits were placed to determine the limits of the

artifacts found, a large 3 x 3 m square, Test Pit 4,
was opened adjacent to Pits 1, 2, and 3 in an attempt to find post molds from a house or other
structure. Although artifacts were abundant, no post
molds were found here. Figure 16 indicates the
ceramic sherds/m 3, the lithic debris/m3, as well as
the weight (in grams) of daub in each level if it was
collected.
For Test Pit 4, Table 3 provides the analysis of
the pottery sherd decorative technique for all sherds
in each level by percent as well as the total sherds
in the level. Also listed are the other artifacts from
that level. Figures 16-20 and Tables 4-7 provide the
same information for all pits and trenches for which
data were recorded in Area B.

habitation area and the locations with the highest
potential to contain strnctures, features, and midden
deposits. Trenches designated those excavations
more elongated in shape and selected to cover a
greater surface area (see Figure 2). A few areas
were mapped as features and so designated on the
site map. In Area B, features were numbered from
1-3 and 5-8; Feature 4 was not assigned.
During the excavations, most of the levels were
in 15 cm increments, although 10 or 20 cm thick
levels were also employed. In some units where
there was no stratigraphic control, the artifacts were
bagged as if they were from a single level.
The initial excavations were in Pits 1-3 and
Trench l. Pit l was placed by an old test hole dug by
the senior author from which several pounds of
daub had been recovered. Because of the large quantity of daub, it was hoped that the remains of a
Caddo house would be found nearby. Trench 1 was
a 50 cm x 20 m unit with a maximum depth of 1 m
bs. The trench was oriented northeast-southwest, in
order to examine the midden deposit along its slope.
Feature 2 was encountered in the trench (at the
location of Pit I 0, see Figure 2). It was a basinshaped trash pit (80 x 35 cm in size) that had considerable charcoal, bone fragments, and a few pottery
sherds. Feature 2 extended from 35-70 cm bs, and
was first noted immediately below the midden.
All excavations had daub, sherds, lithic debris,
and other midden refuse. Because of the quantity of

Additional archeological investigations were
conducted at the Harold Williams site by Bo
Nelson, Mark Walters, Bobby Gonzalez (of the
Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma) and Timothy K.
Perttula in May and August 2000. The purpose of
this work, part of a broader and ongoing study of
the Caddoan archeology of the Big Cypress Creek
basin, was to locate and examine an area of intact
Caddoan archeological deposits at the site to obtain samples for radiocarbon and Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) dates as well as recover preserved
plant and animal remains.
One such area of Caddoan archeological deposits was located in Area B. Excavations first
included 11 positive shovel tests and six positive
auger tests (Table 8). Next a 1x I m unit (Pit 19),
and a 50 x 50 cm unit (Pit 20) were excavated;
Pit 20 adjoined the southeastern corner of Pit 19
(see Figure 2). These units were placed immediately adjacent to shovel tests that had quantities
of daub.
This work identified a 20-30 cm thick Caddoan
midden deposit containing a dense concentration of
daub, probably from a burned Caddoan house, along
with ceramics, lithic debris, arrowpoints, animal
bone, and charred plant remains (nutshells and
corn). The midden was overlain by a modern plow
zone, and underneath the midden were undisturbed
E-h01izon sandy deposits with a low density of
archeological materials. Table 9 summarizes the

different types of artifacts found in the combined
Pit 19 and 20 excavations.
Daub occurs at a density of more than 5000
grams per m 3 of excavated deposits in the two pits,
compared with 75 plain and decorated sherds per
m3 and 285 pieces of lithic debris per m3 . The
highest densities of Caddoan artifacts are in the
midden deposits, followed by the plow zone (see
Table 9 and Figure 21).
Ten OCR samples and two radiocarbon dates
were obtained from Pits 19 and 20 (Table 10). The

results strongly suggest that the Caddoan midden
deposits date primarily to the Middle Caddoan period, ca. AD. 1200-1400, with limited use in the
early part of the Late Caddoan Titus phase. The one
Late Caddoan triangular arrow point was found in
the plow zone (see Figure 21).
The culturally relevant OCR dates, based in
part on context, sediment textural changes, and
differences in pH in the Pit 19 and 20 columns
(Douglas Frink, 2000 personal communication),
range from 578-759 B.P., or ca. AD. 1191-1372. A

distinct spike in the frequency of coarse particles at
30 cm bs suggests the Middle Caddoan occupation
here may date closer to ca. A.D. 1251-1289. The
sub-midden OCR dates range from 2572-4734 B.P.,
but they do not relate to the archeological deposits

in Pits 19 and 20. It is more likely that they represent
the age of pedogenic development in the sandy
loam sediments on the landform.
Two radiocarbon dates on charred hickory nutshells were obtained from Pits 19 and 20. The

younger calibrated intercept date of cal A.D. 1420
(Beta-146787) is from 20-30 cm bs at the top of the
midden deposit. At 2 sigma (95 percent), the calibrated age ranges for this sample are cal A.D. 13201340 and cal A.D. 1390-1460. The older date from
30-40 cm bs has a calibrated intercept date of cal
A.D. 1180 (Beta-146788). At 2 sigma, there is a 95
percent chance that the radiocarbon age falls between
cal A.D. 1000-1280.The two calibrated radiocarbon
dates bracket the date range of the OCR dates from
the midden deposits in Pits 19 and 20 (see Table 10).
Schniebs (2000) analyzed the 75 faunal remains from these excavations. They weigh in

total 18.7 grams, and they were recovered mostly
from the midden in Pits 19 and 20, with a few
from the shovel and auger tests. Approximately
80 percent of the fragments had been burned.
Three deer teeth were identified as well as 34
fragments from large mammals, probably also
deer, five fragments from turtle shell, eight from
unidentified mammal, and 25 from unidentified
animals. According to Turner, this small and broken assemblage of fauna! remains is typical of
the debris mix of bone, sherds, lithics, and nutshells found as trash in prehistoric Caddoan
middens in Northeast Texas.

Area B Features
Trench 2, in the area of the Titus phase graves,
encountered the outline of a grave pit (see Figure
2). This was designated Feature 1. The pit was
completely excavated and the grave bottom was
reached at 1.15 m bs. This grave had been previously dug, and skull fragments, other bone fragments, and numerous sherds were in the fill. This
was probably Titus phase Grave A (see below).
Trench 4 (2 x S m) had sherds and both arrow
and dart points, but no features. There were old
potholes in the northwest and southeast corners of
the trench, but they were not associated with previously dug graves.
Trench 5, north of trenches 2 and 4, yielded
lithic and ceramic artifacts as well as a Gary point
and biface. In addition, the outline of another grave

was encountered in level 2, and traced through level
5. Apparently this was also the remains of a previously dug grave. It was not assigned a feature number, however.
Feature 3 (Figure 22) was located at the southwest end of Trench 1. It is the grave of an adult
buried on the back with legs extended, arms by the
side, and with the head at the east and the feet to the
west The small bones had disintegrated, leaving
only the skull, the major arm and leg bones, and a
fragment of the pelvic region. The skeleton was
oriented like other Titus phase burials (see Turner
1978, 1992), but there were no grave offerings. The
balk profile across the skeleton's chest area appears
to be intact (i.e., undisturbed by previous digging
to remove vessels), Feature 3 appears to be a person buried without grave offerings.

Feature 5 is the designation for the 1 x 3 m unit
attached to the western end of Trench 7 (see Figure
2). This was designated a feature because it was
thought to be in the area of a grave. It proved not to
be, but yielded an earspool as well as projectile
points, sherds, and lithics.
Feature 6 covered a rather large area (see Figure
2). The area had an extremely hard-packed sand
layer at 20-30 cm bs. At this depth were numerous

daub fragments, charcoal flecks, and sherds.
Although this appeared to be promising as a house
floor, it proved difficult to trace an outline. A
complicated arrangement of short trenches and holes
(Trench 6) were then excavated to try to determine
the extent of the hard-packed area. Fortunately, a
thunderstorm occurred during the pre-dawn hours
of Thursday, June 22, which softened the upper soil
above the hard-packed floor. This made it possible

to define a 4 x 7 m area (oriented roughly northsouth) with this distinctive hard pan. The northwest
quadrant was staked, shovel-shaved to 20 cm bs,
and partially screened. No post molds were found.
During the scraping of the quadrant, several artifacts
were recovered (see Figure 20 and Table 5). Other

quadrants were laid out and excavated in the same
manner as the northwest quadrant, but no post molds
or hearths were found. Two parallel hard-packed
sand areas extended south from Feature 6, and
Woodall concluded that it was the path of an old
road bed.

Figure 22. Feature 3 and profile across feature.

Pit 13 (Figures 23 and 24) was placed on a
narrow promontory between two converging gullies.
Three post molds were found at 40 cm bs. Subsequent excavations west and south of Pit 13 exposed
other round post mold stains that formed an approximate circle (Feature 7). The post molds were first
noted at elevations of approximately 99.19 m, except
molds 8, 9, and 10, found at about 98.72 m. They
extended from 4 to 39 cm below the elevation where
first identified. These molds were probably well below the original house floor, which had been eroded
away. Post molds to the south had been washed away
by the water flowing through the gullies. The post
molds have an elliptical shape with an east-west axis
of 6.5 m and a north-south axis of 5 m.
Feature 8 was discovered while excavations
were in progress on Feature 7. Like Feature 3, it
was a single individual, supine, but unlike the burial

of Feature 3 the head was to the west and the feet
were to the east. This arrangement is unknown in
Titus phase graves (see Turner 1978, 1992;
Thurmond 1990). Feature 8 also had no grave offerings. The general record form indicated the
individual's length as 1.64 m, with a 28 cm shoulder breadth, and a width at the pelvis of 36 cm. The
top of the skull was 20.5 cm bs.
Turner is aware of another grave similar to
Features 3 and 8 in this part of the Harold Williams
site. It also contained no grave offerings. Orientation was roughly north-south, with the head to the
north and the body in the supine position. This
grave was found in the early 1950s.
Who were these three graves with various
compass alignments, and no artifacts? Their alignment and lack of grave offerings rules out a Titus
phase age, except the grave of Feature 3, which is

properly oriented for it to be Titus phase affiliation. The Middle Caddo period peoples provided
grave offerings as well, as shown by the graves in
Area A, and at other Middle Caddoan sites in the
vicinity (see Turner 1997). Did these graves originally contain burial offerings that were uncovered
and collected after the flood of 1943, leaving the
skeletal material untouched, or were they graves
of individuals of low social status who were buried without offerings? Additional research is required to unravel this problem.
When trenches 8, 9, and 10, adjacent to Trench
1 and near Test Pit 4, were opened, a number of
pottery vessels were uncovered (Figures 25 and
26). In addition to the vessels, fragmentary skeletal
remains of two infants were discovered. As shown
in Figure 25, infant burial 1 is adjacent to pot cluster
1, undoubtedly a burial offering. Infant burial 2 is
somewhat apart from the pot clusters and may have
had no offerings. Pot clusters 2 and 3 may have
accompanied infant graves whose remains have
decayed. These infant graves may have been within
or directly adjacent to a house, as this was a common
prehistoric Caddoan practice to bury infants below

house floors (see Figure 4c for a view of the
excavations in this area).
In the Area B excavations, the pits were arranged in north-south rows in order to determine
the extent of the midden area. Figures 16-20 and
Tables 3-7 depict the distribution of artifacts from
each pit and their relative productivity.
There were 31 artifacts from units not excavated by level, primarily arrow points (n=l3), Gary
dart points (n=6), point fragments, pipe fragments,
and celt fragments (Table 11). Table 12 tabulates
dart points, pipe fragments, ear spools, and other
lithic artifacts by level. It is interesting to note that
both the large and small Gary dart points appear to
be equally present at all levels (see Table 12), as are
bifaces, while worked flakes are found only from 035 cm bs. Two of the three pipe sherds were recovered between 10-25 cm bs (see Table 12). The Titus
phase arrow points-Talco, Maud, Bassett, and triangular-in Area B mainly occur in the plow zone
(0-20 cm bs) and directly beneath it (Table 13). The
earlier Catahoula, Homan, and Fliley points are found
deeper in the deposits, and in fact the vertical distribution of the earlier arrow points overlaps with a

THE TITUS PHASE GRAVES

Background
After the flood of 1943, when this cemetery
was found, an individual from the Gladewater area
excavated more than 60 graves at the Harold Williams site. However, no information is available on
these burials other than anecdotal data that indicates they date from the Titus phase.
In the spring of 1959, Ralph Nicholas of
Daingerfield, Ed German of Lone Star, and the
senior author excavated 19 burials at the Williams
site. Of these 19 graves (Figure 28), at least three
had been previously dug. All burials, where any
skeletal material was observed, were extended and

supine: lying on the back with the face upward, and
with the head to the east.
It has been proposed (Turner 1978) that the Titus
phase people buried their dead with the feet toward
the setting sun. Archeological evidence consistently
shows an east-west orientation. Ethnographic studies also support this east-west burial behavior.
At the geographic location of the Williams site
(33Â° N latitude), the sun sets at 28.3Â° north of the
equator on the first day of summer and 28.3Â° south
of the equator on the first day of winter. At the
spring and fall equinox the sun sets due west. These
Titus phase graves, except Grave 0, for which the
direction is suspect, are aligned between these Â±
28Â° sunset directions. The grave directions provided
in the following listing of grave contents are true
directions, not magnetic compass readings. This
Titus phase cemetery, originally with 70 or 80
graves, would certainly suggest it was a community cemetery (see Perttula and Nelson 1998) rather
than a family plot of 10 graves or less.

GraveN

Excavated by Ed German. No other information available except that a 42.75 g concentration of
ground-up pottery sherds (used as temper in pottery
clay) was collected.

Excavated by Robert L. Turner, and the floor
of the grave was 91-117 cm bs. It was oriented
at 1Â° south of west. Associated artifacts include:
1, Ripley Engraved carinated bowl; 2, four-eared
compound bowl; 3, small jar; 4, 5, Ripley Engraved compound bowls; 6, ceramic elbow pipe;
7, Bassett point.
As part of the most recent study of the Harold
Williams site, Perttula and associates recently obtained a radiocarbon date from collagen preserved
in long bone fragments from Grave N. The intercept of the radiocarbon age of the remains with
the calibration curve is A.D. 1500, with a 2 sigma
calibrated age range of A.D. 1440-1640 (Beta152353). The 13C/12C ratio is -14.0 %0. This isotope value suggests that the Titus phase Caddo
individual buried in Grave N had a maize-rich
diet. Comparable isotope values have been obtained from other Late Caddoan and post-1650
Caddo burials along the Red River in Northeast
Texas, southwestern Arkansas, and northwestern
Louisiana (Perttula 1996:321).

Graves G, H, and I
Excavated by Ed German. No other information available.

Grave]
Excavated by Robert L. Turner on March 29,
1959. The depth of the grave was 84 cm bs, and the
grave direction was 11Â° south of west. Associated
artifacts include: 1, Ripley Engraved carinated bowl
(the style of decoration is the same as item 5); 2,
small cooking jar; 3, 5, Ripley Engraved compound
bowls; 4, no information. This grave had been previously dug. Vessels 1 and 2 were probably missed
because of their depth, while vessels 3-5 were broken and thrown back in the grave before it was
refilled; their original location is unknown.

Grave 0
GraveK
Excavated by Robert L. Turner on April 4, 1959.
The depth of the grave was 102-122 cm bs, and it
was oriented at 19Â° north of west. Associated artifacts include: 1, Maydelle Incised jar; 2, 8, Ripley
Engraved carinated bowls; 3, 6, no information; 4,
Wilder Engraved bottle; 5, four-eared or peaked jar
with nodes under each peak, along with an appliqued
design; 7, Ripley Engraved four-peaked compound
bowl; 9, deer mandible; 10; small concentration (14. l
g) of ground-up sherds to be used for temper; 11;
Bassett point, exact location not noted.

Excavated by Ralph Nicholas on May 2, 1959.
The grave was between 89-105 cm bs, and was
oriented 49Â° north of west. Four vessels (of unknown kind) were apparently found in the grave
(see Figure 30).

Grave P
Excavated by Ralph Nicholas on May 2, 1959.
The grave was 76-81 cm bs, and oriented 9Â° north
of west. It had been previously dug, but overlooked
were: 1, Ripley Engraved carinated bowl; 2, unidentified vessel; 3, four-eared compound bowl; and
4, a large sherd.

Grave L
Excavated by Ralph Nicholas. No other information available.

GraveM
Excavated by Robert L. Turner. A small 9 cm
long petaloid celt was found in this previously
dug grave.

Grave Q
Excavated by Ralph Nicholas on May 3, 1959.
The grave was 150-173 cm in depth, and was oriented east-west. Associated artifacts include: 1,
small bowl; 2, 3, 5-7, 9, 12, carinated bowls; 4,
bottle; 8, 10-11,jars; 13, eleven Talco points; 14,
three Talco points and one Bassett point; 15, two
celts; 16, one ceramic pulley-shaped earspool. The

Turner and Smith et al. - The Williams Site: TAS Field School 1967
drawn plan of the burial did not show the location
of any skeletal remains relative to the funerary
objects (see Figure 30). The carinated bowls were
likely Ripley Engraved. Based on the number of
offerings, this was the grave of an important person (probably a male). Large quantities of arrow
points are usually associated with Titus phase male
burials (see discussion in Turner 1978, 1992;
Perttula 1992).

Grave R
No information available.

Grave S
Excavated by Robert L. Turner. The burial
was 91-96 cm in depth bs, 1.17 m in length, and
was oriented 4Â° north of west. Associated artifacts
include: 1, small engraved bottle; 2, small carinated bowl with child-like non-repetitive design;
and 3, a concentration of kaolin clay. It is the
burial of a child, possibly a young girl. The potter's
clay and the child-like engraving on the two small
vessels (see Figure 32f-g) may indicate these were
her work.

THE THURMOND HYPOTHESIS
Thurmond (1985, 1990) has proposed that
within the Big Cypress Creek drainage, which is
the epicenter of the Titus phase sphere of influence, there is not one homogenous culture but
four groups (or subclusters) that can be separated by geography and their archeological remains. From west to east these subclusters are
named the Three Basins, Tankersley Creek,
Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek. These
subclusters extend for 80 km across the Cypress
Creek drainage basin.
Turner (1978) had earlier proposed that vessel
differences in types and decorative style, as well as
arrow point types, within this region during the
Titus phase, were a result of changes through time,
and not because of different cultural groupings.
Looking at the evidence in both Turner (1978) and
Thurmond (1985, 1990), Perttula (1995) suggested
that changes in decorative motifs will occur with
time within a given subcluster as well as from

53

regular interaction between peoples living in these
subcluster areas. Thus, within a particular cluster
not all artifact assemblages would be alike,
depending upon their age.
In Thurmond' s analysis of ceramic and arrow
point types within his four subclusters, each share
several identical ceramic decorative styles on Ripley
Engraved carinated bowls; these are the scroll, scroll
and circle, and the continuous scroll (Thurmond
1990:Figure 6). In addition, they contain the Wilder
Engraved bottle design, Maydelle Incised and
Harleton Appliqued cooking vessels, and Talco and
Maud arrow points. The two subclusters to the west
(the Three Basins and Tankersley Creek) contained
McKinney Plain jars, while the Big Cypress
subcluster, the farthest east, has Karnack BrushedIncised and Belcher Ridged cooking vessels. The
Belcher site, where Belcher Ridged pottery was
first defined, contains many of both pottery types
(Webb (1959).
The Belcher Ridged and Karnack Brushed-Incised vessels in the Titus phase subclusters appear
to have been traded or brought into the subclusters
from Late Caddoan groups to the east, along the
Red River. The two easternmost subclusters also
contain Bailey Engraved bottles, another Red River
import, and they are more numerous in Big Cypress
subcluster sites. Bassett points occur in the three
eastern subclusters but not in the Three Basins.
Thurmond (1985, 1990) also indicates that there is
very little Bullard Brushed ware in the Three Basins subcluster, but with more in the Tankersley
Creek subcluster, and it represents 40-50 percent of
the cooking ware in Swauano Creek and Big Cypress Creek subcluster graves.
The pendant triangle decorative technique used
on Ripley Engraved carinated bowls is the predominant decorative technique in the Big Cypress
subcluster, and is also a major style on the bowls of
the Swauano Creek subcluster. Perdiz points are
more prevalent in the Three Basins and Tankersley
Creek subclusters. Based on these regional differences, Thurmond (1985) has suggested that these
subclusters may represent tribal groupings similar
to those described by the early European visitors
to the Hasinai tribal groups about 150 km to the
south and the Kadohadacho groups on the Red
River to the north and northeast. Perttula (1995)
has argued that as more radiocarbon dates become
available from Titus phase settlements and cemeteries in each of the subclusters, a clearer picture

54

will emerge of the sequence of cultural events in
the Titus phase heartland.

are another indication of the ca. A.D. 1550 to
early 1600s time frame for these interments.

THE WILLIAMS TITUS
PHASE GRAVES

THE SURFACE COLLECTION
PROJECTILE POINTS

The Titus phase graves from the Harold Williams site best fit the pattern of Thurmond's (1985,
1990) Swauano Creek subcluster. The site is within
the spatial boundaries of the subcluster and the
artifacts mostly match his criteria. The only exception to this seems to be the small quantity of Bullard
Brushed utility ware from the site.
Perttula (1995:350) and Bruseth (1992:91)
believe that the large community cemeteries like
Harold Williams were a short term event that
generally dates from about A.D. 1550 to the early
1600s. This period follows the de Soto expedition into Texas in 1542-1543 as it passed through
this region from north to south and then returned
the same way. They believe these cemeteries
occur after the contact between the de Soto army
and the Titus phase people (probably the group
called the Lacane by the army, see Hudson
[1997]). Increased mortality of the people probably occurred because of diseases introduced by
the army. The Titus phase graves at the Williams site probably date to this period, i.e., from
A.D. 1550 to the early 1600s.

The surface collection was made by the senior
author between 1948 and 1959. The artifacts were
collected in Area B and in Area A south of the
youth group excavations. The platform pipe (see
Figure lOd) and a stone axe (see below) also came
from this part of Area A.
There are 131 projectile points and point fragments from the surface collection. Of this, 58
were arrow points and 73 were dart points (Figures 33-35).
Arrow points are classified as follows: Bassett
(n=2); Maud (n=2); Homan (n=8); Catahoula (n=9);
Friley (n=4); Scallorn-like (n=2); Clifton (n=2);
crude stemmed (n=4); small corner-notched (n=5);
thick triangular with basal notch (n=2); unclassified (n=l l); and fragments (n=7). The material used
for all arrow point manufacture, except for two,
was from locally available sources. Forty-three
points were of a gray to maroon quartzite. Twelve
points were of light yellow-tan jasper and dark red
jasper. Two unclassified points (see Figure 33) are
a white chert from non-local sources.
The dart points from the collection include:
Gary, small (n=21); Gary, large (n=8); Kent (n=l);
Yarbrough (n=8); Morrill (n=3); Marcos (n=l);
Bulverde (n=2); San Patrice? (n=l); and brokenunclassified (n=28). One Bulverde points is made
of a non-local tan chert with black mottling (see
Figure 35s). This same material is present in several large dart points from other Camp County locations. The second and larger Bulverde is made of
novaculite. The possible San Patrice point, with
both ears broken off (see Figure 35j), is a greenishbrown jasper. The Marcos point is made from a
large thinning flake with the flat surface unworked
as it came off the core and the other surface retains
a rather large area of almost polished maroon cortex. The material is a tan flint resembling that found
in Central Texas.
Of the remaining dart points 69 percent are of
the locally available gray-maroon quartzite, three
were tan jasper (7 percent), and 11 (24 percent)
were various non-local cherts. Most of the latter are
small Gary points.

Comparison with Carpenter Site Graves
The nearby Carpenter Site (Turner 1978,
1992) contained 44 graves. Nine of these contained Talco arrow points as well as Ripley Engraved carinated bowls with the pendant triangle
decorative sty le. Turner believed these nine
graves, which were on the periphery of the cemetery, belonged to the last burial episode at the
site. A calibrated radiocarbon date for one of these
graves (Tx-666) has a 2 sigma age range of A.D.
1473-1635, with the most likely range between
A.D. 1536-1635 (see Perttula 1998:Table 1). Pendant triangle decorative motifs on Harold Williams pottery vessels, as well as the Talco arrow
points, would probably make these neighboring
cemeteries contemporaneous. The 2 sigma age
range of Grave Nat Harold Williams (see above)
overlaps between cal A.D. 1440-1635 with the
Tuck Carpenter calibrated date. These together

Other Artifacts
The abrading stone (Figure 36a) is an extremely
coarse-grained slab of ferruginous sandstone 4 to
5 cm thick. It is similarly grooved on both sides
and would have provided an excellent surface and
texture for sharpening bone tools.
The perforated ceramic disc is from the base of
a large jar (see Figure 36b). It is approximately
11 cm in diameter and varies from 1 cm thick at the
edge to 1.8 cm at the perforation. The minimum

diameter of the perforation is 11 mm, increasing to
17-20 mm at the outer surfaces. The hole is perfectly smooth throughout its length. The disc break
appears to be relatively recent in time and was
probably caused by agricultural activity. The outside edge of the disc has been purposely smoothed.
Based on the size of the jar from which the disc
came, it is probably associated with the Titus phase
occupation, since the Middle Caddo peoples in the
Big Cypress Creek basin are not known to have had
large cooking vessels.

is complete, but slightly shorter (7.5 cm versus 8. 8
cm) than the celt in Titus phase grave M. The bit
edge of this small specimen is rounded at an
approximate radius of 1 mm, presumably from wear.
This small tool is large enough to be hafted in the

wood chopping. It would have been perfect, if hafted,
as a toy for a child or perhaps the dulled edge
resulted from a scraping action.
There are polished hematite axes (see Figure
36d-f) in the collection. Two were broken in antiquity as the broken surfaces have had time to metamorphose from a homogeneous ferruginous
sandstone to the same color and texture as the outer
surface. Each axe is full grooved, and they have
marks from modern ag1icultural activity. Grooved
hematite axes were a tool of the Archaic people of
Northeast Texas and continued in use into the Early
Ceramic period. The grooved axes were eventually
replaced in form and material by ungrooved axes or
celts during Caddo times.
The ferruginous sandstone gouge (see Figure
36g) is the shape of the classic Clear Fork tool (see
Turner and Hester 1993). Its outer surface has
weathered to the same dark reddish-brown color
and texture as the axes.
There are three other ferruginous sandstone tools
in the surface collections. This material frequently
occurs in tabular form and from 1 cm or more in
thickness. It is also a principal material for Archaic
tools in this area of the state. Percussion flaking was
used almost exclusively in forming tools from this
material, other than grinding for axes. In tool manufacture from the sandstone, a lighter-colored cortex
may remain on one or both faces. One tool utilized
the flat cortex on the bottom (see Figure 36h), and
the surface shows polish; this was evidently the
working surface. The edges are not smoothed and
the upper surface lacks wear or polish. The second
tool (see Figure 36j) is broken, but has some edge
smoothing. No wear or polish is apparent on either
of the faces, which are roughly convex in crosssection. This tool was probably broken while in use
and was discarded early in its life cycle. The third
ferruginous sandstone tool is also broken (see Figure 36k), and there are no scars or shatter from a
blow at the broken face; the tool may have snapped
from a prying action. It also has a light wear-polish
on high spots of both surfaces, but the major wear is
on the edges, which are smooth to the touch. Similar
complete tools of this type and material, and with
long elliptical shapes, were apparently used as saws.
One tool (see Figure 36i) is a fragment of highly
polished hematite that was apparently part of a
grinding surface. Two others are hammerstones (see
Figure 361-m), and one was only slightly used

The Williams Site: TAS Field School 1967

59

whereas the other (see Figure 36m) was used into a
nearly spherical shape. There is a well-shaped mano
of ferruginous sandstone (see Figure 36n), as well
as a tool with a slight depression on one surface.
The material is a tan sandstone that has been
smoothed around the edges. It may have been used
as a small grinding stone or a nutting stone.
Five bifaces were collected from the surface,
four of local quartzite and the other of a non-local
whitish chert. Rounding out the stone tools are seven
worked flakes.
Early Caddo period sherds were also found in
the surface collection. This includes Crockett Curvilinear Incised (Figure 37a-b), Coles Creek Incised (Figure 37c), Dunkin Incised (Figure 37d),
and Canton Incised (Figure 37e-f).

AREA C EXCAVATIONS
Area C excavations were located 269 m northwest of Area B on a sandy knoll (Figure 38). The
elevations and corner designations are part of the
same grid system as Areas A and B. Charles Bandy
directed the work at this location.
Test 1 was a 1 x 2 m unit excavated in three
30 cm levels. The first level had one Homan arrow
point and a hammer stone, and there was an earspool
fragment from 60-90 cm bs. Lithic debris and sherds
were present in these deposits, but not in abundance.
In Test 2, another 1 x 2 m unit, sherds occurred
at a density of approximately 100 per m 3 through
the upper 60 cm, and about 50 percent lower in
density between 60-90 cm bs. Lithics were present
to 120 cm, as were a few sherds. Charcoal and
charred bone were found at 47 cm bs.
The purpose of the Area C excavation was to
locate features for detailed study. In an attempt to
cover a larger search area, Test 3, a 30 m x 60 cm
trench, was placed across the knoll (see Figure 38).
This trench was dug to 75 cm bs in two 30 cm
levels and a third 15 cm thick level. Sherd densities
were 77 per m3 and 44 per m3 in the two upper
levels and lithic concentrations were 27 and 6 per
m3 , respectively. Charcoal fragments were present
in the top two levels as well as daub (n=39) in the
top level. Five arrow points were found between 030 cm bs, two of which were broken.
Test 4 had 105 sherds and 36 lithics, while Test
5 had 104 sherds and eight lithics. The only feature,
a fire pit, was found at N3 l 9/W349, at 39 cm bs. The

pit had burned soil, but no rocks were present, and it
was approximately 75 cm in diameter. The feature
contained 26 sherds, charcoal, 22 bone fragments,
and several shell fragments, probably mussel.
The six arrow points were found between 030 cm bs in Area C. They include two Homan, two
Perdiz, one Fresno, and one that was unidentified.
The quantity of artifacts found indicates a light
human occupation of this particular part of the Williams site. The arrow point styles suggest the occupation took place during the Middle Caddo period.

A SUMMATION
People inhabited the Harold Williams site, intermittently or seasonally during the Archaic and
Early Ceramic periods, and then on a more permanent basis after the advent of agriculture during the
Caddoan occupation of the site (Figure 39). The
oldest artifact, if identified correctly, is a single San
Patrice dart point (see Figure 35j). San Patrice dart
points are found in Camp County and in Northeast

Texas, but generally in very small numbers. They
are associated with the Late Paleoindian period, ca.
8000-7500 B.C. (see Webb et al. 1971; Johnson
1989; Story 1990).
Following this in time are two well formed and
readily identified Bulverde dart points (see Figure
35s-t), and several Morrill dart points. These points
date from the Middle Archaic in Northeast Texas,
between ca. 4000-1500 B.C. According to Thurmond
(1990), the Late Archaic period (1500-200 B.C.) is
represented by the dart point types Gary, Kent, and
Ensor. Story (1990) has added Edgewood and Ellis
to this Late Archaic dart point assemblage.
Following the Late Archaic in Northeast Texas
is the Early Ceramic period (Story 1981) presently
dated from 200 B.C. to A.D. 800. During this time
ceramics were present, and the bow and arrow was
introduced during the latter part of the period. Dart
point styles introduced in the Late Archaic, particularly Gary points, continued to be made and used in
the Early Ceramic.

Figure 39. Harold Williams site cultural sequence and associated artifacts.

Turner and Smith et al. southwest of the Harold Williams site, and from the
Manton Miller site in Delta County, provides a major
source of information on the Archaic period in
Northeast Texas. He demonstrated that changes in
dart point types occurred through time, with
expanding stem dart points (the Yarbrough type)
occurring early in time and before the contracting
stem points (the Gary type). As time passed, the
Gary points increased in numbers compared to the
Yarbrough points, although they were present in small
quantities during the period when the Gary type was
most popular. At the top of the stratigraphic column at
Yarbrough were a few pottery sherds and arrow points.
The Gary point is a major type in both the Late Archaic
and the following Early Ceramic period.
The same stratigraphic sequence occurred at
the Tankersley Creek site (Young 1981), 19 km
northwest of Harold Williams. Here, Yarbrough
points preceded the use of the Gary point. Overall,
the site's dart point assemblage closely matches
that at the Harold Williams site; that is, the total
Gary point assemblage is about 50 percent, and the
proportions of Yarbrough points are nearly the same.
The Tankersley Creek site had the same stone tool
groups as at Williams: nutting stones, manos, grinding slabs, hammerstones, gouges, and polished stone
fragments. It also had Williams Plain pottery, three
Catahoula arrow points, one corner-notched point,
one Alba-like point, and one that was unidentified.
The Early Caddo sherds were also similar, with
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Coles Creek Incised,
and Pennington Punctated Incised-like specimens.
Cliff (1998:105) stated that:
It is probable that the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas was fully Archaic in lifestyle and tradition, and
represents a period of change and modification to the Archaic tradition under
the combined pressures of increasing
within-group populations, and increasing between-group packing.
The Gary point tradition carried into the Early
Ceramic period and flourished. Young (1981), as
well as Johnson (1962), for example, has demonstrated that the large Gary points preceded the
small Gary points in time. Young (1981:7 5) proposes that:
occupations without Gary points probably
predate B.C. 2000 and that sites with a

predominance of large Gary's range
around B.C. 800 or later. Small Gary
points (less than 36 mm) are proposed to
become the dominant projectile point type
around the advent of pottery and to
continue as the dominant type into the
earliest portion of the Caddo sequence.
The selected Archaic sites in Table 15 overlap
in time. The Analysis Units 1 and 2 at the Yarbrough
site are a good baseline for temporal comparisons
of other East Texas Archaic sites. These sites have
archeological deposits with artifacts dating from as
early as the Paleoindian period, as well as Archaic
and Early Ceramic periods, and also Early Caddoan
in age (Table 16).
The Miller site, with a predominantly Gary dart
point assemblage and only one Yarbrough point,
but with both large and small Gary points, dates to
the Late Archaic and the Early Ceramic period.
Williams Plain pottery was present at the site as
well as early arrow point styles. A third component
at the site is Early Caddoan in age, with the appropriate ceramic and arrow point assemblage.
The Jake Martin site (Davis and Davis 1960),
located 32 km southeast of the Williams site, is
also an Archaic site, and with a Paleoindian component (see Table 16). The expanding stem
Yarbrough points are the most common dart point
variety, while the later Gary points are only a minor
part of the assemblage.
The Williams site excavations did not find
Yarbrough points in the excavations, but rather only
in the surface collection. At Tankersley Creek, the
Yarbrough points were found deeper than the Gary
type in the excavated columns, but the distributions
of Yarbrough and the large Gary points overlapped;
a similar distribution was noted for the large and
small Gary points, with the latter also postdating
the larger Gary points. This same sequence was
noted at the Yarbrough site.
The Bolton collection (see Tables 15 and 16)
was assembled over many years, primarily in the
1930s and early 1940s. Mr. Oliver Bolton of
Pittsburg, Camp County, was associated with the
dry goods business in downtown Pittsburg. During
this era, East Texas was cotton country and most
arable land was row cropped, primarily in cotton.
This exposed artifacts after each plowing and rain.
Nearly every farm boy collected artifacts, usually
from the family place. A custom of the time was
the Saturday visit to town to buy, or perhaps trade

produce, for next week's groceries, visit with
friends, and if you were a kid, go to the movie. To
help finance this excursion, young people would
bring dart points and other artifacts to Mr. Bolton
to purchase.
Based on this method of acquisition, and the
size of the collection, it provides an excellent
baseline for the kinds of Archaic dart points found
in Camp County. If one thinks of Camp County as
a single site, this collection can be compared to
assemblages from individual sites to assess local
and site-specific trends in prehistoric use. For example, by percentage, the total Gary assemblage
for Camp County and the Williams site are similar
(see Table 15), but at Harold Williams, the small
Gary points are a larger percent of the overall assemblage, and the large Gary and Yarbrough points
are a smaller percent. One may conclude that the
Williams site was more heavily populated during
the latter part of the Late Archaic and the Early
Ceramic period than was the county as a whole.
The artifacts, archeological deposits, and their
stratigraphy at the Harold Williams site indicate
that it was used during the Late Archaic (possibly
somewhat earlier), as well as during the Early Ceramic period. This period is marked by the first use
of the early Catahoula, Friley, and comer-notched
Scallorn-like arrow points (see Figure 39). The major stone tool assemblages of the Archaic and Early
Ceramic periods are also present. Although Williams Plain sherds were not recognized in the 1976
analysis, they likely were present were the sherds
to be reanalyzed. Perttula et al. ( 1993) discuss the
character of the Early Ceramic period in East Texas
in more detail.
Habitation of the Harold Williams site during
the Early Caddoan period is marked by Catahoula,
Friley, Scallorn-like, Bonham, and Homan arrow
points. There are also Crockett Curvilinear Incised,
Coles Creek Incised, Dunkin Incised, Canton Incised, and Pennington Punctated Incised sherds, and
pipe fragments of the long stemmed Red River variety. Webb et al. (1969), in their article on the Resch
site (41HS16) in nearby Harrison County, Texas,
describe a similar assemblage of artifacts that date
from the Late Archaic to the Early Caddoan period.
The Middle Caddoan and Late Caddoan Titus
phase occupations of the Harold Williams site are
characterized by large quantities of ceramic sherds,
arrow points, as well as houses and their graves. In
Middle Caddoan contexts, excavations recovered

65

charred nutshells in abundance, as well as corn.
Deer and turtle bone were also identified, along
with other bone, and these remains were found in
association with large quantities of daub. The Pit
19 and 20 radiocarbon and OCR dates suggest these
materials date from ca. A.D. 1200-1400.
The former presence of Middle Caddoan
houses is inferred from the large quantity of daub
at various locations within the site, including Pit
1, as well as nearby Pits 19 and 20. In trenches 810 where the infant interments and offerings were
found (see Figures 4c, 25, and 26), the supposition is that these burials of children were within
or immediately adjacent to a house, which is a
Caddoan burial custom. If this is correct, the
house in the trench 8-10 area dates to the Titus
phase, as all 10 vessels found as offerings belong
to this Late Caddoan phase. Feature 7 (see Figures 23 and 24) is the post mold pattern from a
prehistoric Caddo house. Excavations there recovered single examples of Bassett, Talco, and
Homan arrow points, and sherds of all decorative
styles, including a higher percentage of brushed
sherds than other pits and trenches. Based on the
artifacts from within and adjacent to the structure, the Feature 7 house probably was built and
used by Titus phase peoples.
In summary, then, the Middle Caddoan period
is represented by the graves in Area A, platform
pipes, the Homan and Perdiz-like arrow points, and
the rattlesnake motif on the bottle of one of the
Area A graves. Much of the archeological deposits
in Area B and C are also from a Middle Caddoan
occupation. There are twice as many Homan arrow
points at Harold Williams than there are Late
Caddoan arrow points, and it appears that the Middle
Caddoan people lived on the site in greater numbers than the later Titus phase. The Caddoan settlement of the Harold Williams site during this period
must have been permanent, as indicated by the evidence of structures, a substantial midden, and the
small number of burials. In addition to the stone
and ceramic artifacts, the OCR and radiocarbon
dates from sediments and charred nutshells in Pits
19 and 20 confirm this Middle Caddoan occupation
and provide excellent dating for the Homan arrow
points in Pit 19.
The last inhabitants of this site were the people
of the Titus phase. This occupation is marked by a
large community cemetery, houses, and the discard
of Bassett, Maud, and Talco arrow points and Titus

66

phase ceramics from a small settlement. In addition
to the large community cemeteries at Williams and
the nearby Tuck Carpenter site (see Figure 1), a
small Titus phase family cemetery with seven burials has been reported at the nearby Guest site
(Turner 1978). This cemetery is ca. 450 m north of
the Harold Williams site.
There are numerous Caddoan middens along
Dry Creek (see Figure 1) in the vicinity of the
Harold Williams site, and downstream near its
confluence with Big Cypress Creek. Each midden
probably represents the debris from a Caddo farmstead. The Harold Williams site is located on a
terrace above the floodplain, and in the midst of a
sandy field well suited for corn and garden agriculture. The other middens are in similar settings. Thus,
in Late Caddoan times there were apparently enough
local inhabitants to support a major community cemetery at the Harold Williams site.

NOTE
1. The Williams site, during the Field School, was
identified as X41CP1. All field notes, level reports, and
paper work generated during the excavations, as well as
the artifacts, are identified with this site number. This
identification has subsequently been changed to 41CP10,
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and Texas
Historical Commission site designation.

All artifact photographs in this article were taken
by Milton Bell, who came to Pittsburg to do the
photography. In addition he made all prints to the
scale requested by the BTAS editor. Without his
interest and expertise, this article would be lacking.

ABSTRACT
During the 1993 summer field season, the Museum of Texas Tech University hosted the Texas Archeological Society Field School at the Lubbock Lake Landmark. Field investigations included a 100% pedestrian survey
of the entire landmark preserve and test excavations at four locations. Test excavations at two of these locations
were continued through the end of the summer field season. Activity areas uncovered at these locations dated
to the late Holocene period based on the geologic context and temporal identification of artifacts recovered.
During the survey, artifacts were recovered from 14 areas within the Lubbock Lake site (4lLU1) in Yell ow house
Draw and from nine upland rim sites. A new occupation area within the valley was designated and two new
upland rim sites were recorded. Test excavations at Area l 0 revealed a complex and extensive veneer of hearth
material covering an underlying pit. Continued work in Area 13B helped explore the boundaries and
microstratigraphy of the cultural deposits in Stratum 5 and provided information on the number and extent of
bison processing events at this location. Test excavations in Area 72 focused on mid-twentieth century trash
dumps in order to gain insight into discard and consumer activity as reflected by Lubbock's post-World War II
population growth. Testing at Site 41LU31 was conducted to determine the age and extent of a disturbed hearth.
The results of the surveys and excavations underscored the extensive and repeated use of the Landmark area for
various purposes.

INTRODUCTION
The Lubbock Lake Landmark (41LU1) is a
designated National Historic Landmark and Texas
State Archeological Landmark located on the northern outskirts of the city of Lubbock, in the Texas
Panhandle of the Southern High Plains (Figure 1).
The landmark encompasses 300 acres along the
axis and margins of Yellowhouse Draw. The landmark is both an archaeological and biological preserve within the urban setting of Lubbock. The site
was discovered in 1936 during dredging operations
to rejuvenate springs in the meander channel associated with the historical location of Long Lake
(Holden 1974; Johnson and Holliday 1987). The
excavators did not realize that the water table was
dropping rather than the springs were silting in, and
thus several thousand cubic meters of sediment were
removed along the valley axis until the water table
was breached. The dredging operations resulted in
the formation of a city reservoir and also exposed
the extensive late Quaternary stratigraphy along the

valley terraces. The archeological deposits were
discovered when prehistoric artifacts were brought
to the West Texas Museum (now the Museum of
Texas Tech University) for identification.
For 65 years the Museum of Texas Tech University has been involved with the research, preservation, and governance of the Lubbock Lake
Landmark (Johnson 1993, 1995a, 2002; Johnson
and Holliday 1987). Although the boundaries of
the Lubbock Lake Landmark archeological site
(41LU1) and the Lubbock Lake Landmark Preserve overlap, they are not identical. The boundaries of the preserve encompass 105 acres of the
rims and terraces overlooking the valley and 202
acres of archeological site 4 lLUl within Yellowhouse Draw (Figure 2). The 98-acre portion of
4 lLUl located outside of the preserve is governed
by the city of Lubbock but is covered by permit to
the Museum for research purposes.
During the 1993 summer field season, the Museum of Texas Tech University hosted the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) Field School at three

Lubbock Lake is located in Yellowhouse
Draw that begins in New Mexico and joins Blackwater Draw in the city of Lubbock, thus becoming Yell ow house Canyon that forms the Double
Mountain Fork of the Brazos River. The draw is
incised below the high plains surface, cutting
through the Blackwater Draw Formation and into
the Blanco Formation. Prior to about 11,000 B.P.,
the draw began aggrading and filled with a variety of sediments throughout the late Quaternary
that compose five major geologic strata in which
five principal soils formed (Holliday 1985a, 1985b,
1985c). Almost 200 radiocarbon dates from these
well-stratified deposits now are available (Haas
et al. 1986; Holliday et al. 1983, 1985; Johnson
1989, 1993, 1995a, 2002). This well-documented
stratigraphic record reflects a more detailed version of the regional scheme (Table 1; Holliday
1995a, 1995b).
Considerably less well-known is the late
Quaternary stratigraphic record for the high plains
surface. Current research has focused on dune
formation, playa stratigraphy, and lunettes (Holliday
1995a, 1995b, 1997; Holliday et al. 1996; Sabin
1992; Sabin and Holliday 1995). Away from these
features, little is known about the sediments
overlying the Blackwater Draw Formation on the
high plains surface. Recent geologic work involving
these sediments has been undertaken at the Lubbock
Lake Landmark Preserve and has investigated
sediments associated with the upland rims
overlooking the draw (Holliday 1989, 1993, 1995b;
Johnson l 995a; Johnson and Hartwell 1989). These
sediments range from a few centimeters to well
over a meter in depth but are aeolian in nature and
are geologically unstratified. The deeper deposits
exhibit soil formation. These upland sediments
appear to be late Holocene in age and, therefore,
related primarily to valley-fill Stratum 5. Correlation
of upland stratigraphic designations (e.g., stratum
K) to substrata or facies within valley-fill Stratum 5
has not been made.

FIELD METHODS
Surface surveys using point-proveniencing of
artifacts have been conducted at the Lubbock Lake
Landmark preserve on an annual basis since 1987.
These surveys are conducted for several reasons: (1)
to provide spatial data over a period of years; (2) to

determine archaeological site boundaries; (3) to help
determine the placement of test excavation units;
(4) to monitor erosion across the surface of the
landmark; and (5) to serve as a preventative measure prior to scheduled prescription burns. The results of these surveys have demonstrated that the
landmark was occupied repeatedly over several thousand years.
The survey conducted in 1993 with the help of
TAS Field School members was a 100% pedestrian
survey of the entire preserve. The preserve boundaries encompass the valley axis, valley margin, and
adjacent upland rim areas (Figure 2). Survey and
excavation methods followed standard procedures
used at the Lubbock Lake Landmark (Johnson 1987,
1993, 1995a, 2002). Pedestrian survey was accomplished using three-meter transects. All materials,
including isolated artifacts not associated with an
area or site, were pin-flagged and point-provenienced
using a total station placed at known datum points
(brass caps or rebar) referenced to Benchmark Datum 1 of the Lubbock Lake Landmark. Elevations
above mean sea level (amsl) were also recorded
using this benchmark. Diagnostic artifacts were photographed in the field prior to collection. All artifacts were collected for cleaning and processing.
Surface expressions of prehistoric and historic
activity within Site 4 lLUl are assigned unique provenience numbers. However, sites found on the
upland rim areas are given distinct site numbers
separate from 41LU1. After each year's pedestrian
survey, maps are generated illustrating the spatial
distribution of collected materials. These maps are
used to help determine area and site boundaries or
to identify previously unrecorded areas or sites.
The 1993 survey covered the 307-acre project
area over an eight-day period with an average crew
of 13 field school participants. Material was recovered from 14 areas within the boundaries of 41LU1
and from nine upland rim sites. A total of 1,549
artifacts was mapped and collected during the survey, the majority (87%) of which were hearthstones.
Two new upland sites (41LU91 and 41LU92) were
recorded and a new area (Area 78) was designated
near the northern boundary of 41LU1. Artifacts
found between established sites or areas were designated as isolated finds.
Excavations were conducted using isolated test
units and intensive block excavations. Isolated test
units were exploratory in nature for the purpose of
determining the presence or absence of intact bur-

hearthstones. Spatial analysis of the mapped artifacts
corroborates earlier survey findings (Ladkin and
O'Brien l 995a) in that most of the artifacts were in a
linear concentration extending from the southwest to
the northeast along the margins of the dirt road.

41LU1 A:rea 28
Area 28 is a large locality along the southwestern valley margin of the Landmark. Previous surveys in 1989 through 1992 discovered lithic
assemblages indicative of a late Archaic occupation (Clifford et al. 1995; Lewis et al. 2002). These
surveys also found multiple hearthstone concentrations, suggesting an extensive area of thermal features that may have been used for an extended
period of time. The features have been subjected to
modern disturbances and erosion (Ladkin and
O'Brien 1995a).
Hearthstones constituted the majority of the
artifacts recovered during the 1993 survey.
Artifacts were recovered in many of the same

1

27

concentrations recorded during previous survey,
as well as in several newly identified clusters.
This pattern indicates that the site has been actively
eroding since the time of the original survey. A
utilized obsidian flake, a utilized piece of Edwards
Formation chert debris, and the base and part of
the body of a stoneware jar were also recovered.
No manufacturing marks were present on the
stoneware item.
41LU1 A:rea 29
Area 29 is located in the valley axis in the central
third of the Landmark. Previous survey in 1990 found
hearthstones widely scattered across the area (Ladkin
and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 survey recorded three
scattered hearthstones and a bone fragment.
41LU1A:rea30
Area 30 is located on the western valley margin in the midsection of the Landmark. Previous

76

Texas Archeological Society

survey in 1990 found four hearths and two loose
groupings of hearthstones (Ladkin and O'Brien
1995a). The 1993 survey recovered mostly hearthstones. Some of the hearthstones were associated
with hearth FA30-4. Two distinct concentrations
were apparent in the northern and western sections
of Area 30, and these did not appear to be associated with the previously recorded concentrations.
The addition of these new hearthstone concentrations suggests the presence of at least six thermal
features in this area.

O'Brien 1995a). Test excavations in 1992 revealed
that portions of the site were highly disturbed (Gill
2002), although some intact deposits remain. The
1993 survey located large groups of artifacts in the
same areas documented during the previous survey. The 1993 survey extended the boundaries of
Area 63.

41LU1 Area 65
Area 65 is in the valley axis in the northwestern quadrant of the Landmark. Previous survey in
1990 found a few widely scattered hearthstones
(Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 survey recovered one hearthstone.

Area 54 lies on the eastern valley margin along
the northeastern edge of the Landmark. Previous
surveys in 1989 and 1992 documented the presence
of lithics artifacts dating to the Late Archaic and
four distinct concentrations of hearthstones (Clifford
et al. 1995; Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a; Lewis et al.
2002). Only two hearthstones were recovered during the 1993 survey. The artifacts were not found in
any previously identified concentration.

Area 66 is in the valley axis in the northwestern quadrant of the Landmark. Previous survey in
1990 found a few widely scattered hearthstones
(Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 survey recovered three hearthstones.

41LU1 Area 56

41LU1 Area 68

Area 56 is located in the valley axis in the
southern quadrant of the Landmark. Previous survey and testing in 1990 revealed Holocene sediments containing lithic flakes, burned bone, and
hearthstones (Johnson 1995a). Artifacts recovered
in the 1993 survey consisted mainly of bone and
were clustered in two distinct loci. An intact hearth
was also reported during survey (Hartwell 1993).
The boundaries of Area 56 were extended through
the addition of the 1993 materials.

Area 68 is located on the western valley margin in the central third of the Landmark. Previous
survey in 1990 recovered a large quantity of hearthstones widely distributed among several areas that
possibly represented disturbed thermal features
(Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 survey identified three hearthstones that were not associated
with previously identified concentrations.

41LU1 Area 66

41LU1 Area 70
41LU1 Area 63
Area 63 is located on the eastern valley margin
in the northwest corner of the Landmark. The Area
63 deposits are composed of redeposited playa sediments that are currently being rapidly deflated. The
lack of vegetation in the area was helpful in terms
of visibility and collection of surface artifacts, but
unfortunately has also resulted in an increased rate
of erosion. Previous survey in 1990 documented a
substantial lithic assemblage and a large number of
hearthstones representing four distinct areas of thermal features (Clifford et al. 1995; Ladkin and

Area 70 lies on the western valley margin in the
southwestern quadrant of the Landmark. Previous
survey in 1990 recovered a Chupadero Black-onwhite sherd that provided a general age of AD. 1150
to 1550 (Oppelt 1988) for at least one component of
the site. Hearthstones were found in two widely
scattered concentrations that appeared to be the centers
of thermal features (Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The
1993 survey recovered primarily hearthstones.
Artifacts were located primarily in three concentrations, with the most northerly concentration associated with one of the two concentrations recorded
during the 1990 survey. A toy marble of black glass

Johnson, et al. -

The Lubbock Lake Site: TAS Field Schools 1993

with multi-colored specks also was recovered. This
type of marble was made in Japan, Mexico, or China
within the last 20 years (Grist 1995).

41LU1 Area 71
Area 71 is located in the valley axis in the
central portion of the Landmark. Two concentrations of artifacts were located during the 1990 survey (Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 survey
recovered one hearthstone associated within one of
the concentrations. The lack of materials from this
area indicated that little erosion has taken place and
that the deposits are relatively stable.

Olszewski 1995). A broken mason jar, consisting
of the base and part of the side, had a partial S and
an 0 and N. Lastly, a clear glass inkwell had a
manufacturer's mark of an F inside a hexagon. The
inkwell was machine made which dates it to post1913 (Kendrick 1971).

41LU1 Area 78
Area 78, first identified in 1993, is located on
the eastern valley margin in the midsection of the
Landmark. Six bone artifacts were collected from
within a small area during the survey.

41LU1Area72
Area 72 is located on the western valley margin in the southern quadrant of the Landmark. The
area consists primarily of an historic trash dump. A
1992 survey also identified a discrete cluster of
hearthstones designated as Feature FA72-1 (Lewis
et al. 2002). Artifacts recovered during the 1993
survey consisted of historic glass and tin cans. These
historic artifacts were found in two very discrete
concentrations separate from the hearth feature. Two
bottle bases of brown glass had the maker's mark
"Owens Illinois Inc." of Toledo Ohio. The mark
was used between 1929 and 1954. Also on the base
of each bottle was the Duraglas maker's mark that
has been used since 1940. These two marks dated
the bottles between 1940 and 1954 (Lockhart and

Nine archeological sites were documented
during the 1993 T AS Field School survey of the
upland rim landform surrounding 41LU1 (Figure 3).
The following discussion provides a summary of
these findings. Table 3 presents the artifact counts
recovered from each site.

ranging from 34,000 B.P. to the Protohistoric (Holliday
1983). Investigations in 1989 found hearthstones in
two concentrations associated with thermal features
(Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a) and substantial lithic
concentrations. A broken late Holocene projectile
point and a Garza point were recovered during the
1993 survey (Figure 4). The remaining artifacts were
primarily hearthstones. The survey recovered artifacts in the vicinity of the two concentrations identified in 1989. The two projectile points were found in
the more northerly concentration.

nostic artifacts and radiocarbon assays identified
late Holocene occupations, particularly from the
last 1,000 years (Johnson 1993, 1995b). Another
survey conducted in 1990 found a concentration
of hearthstones along a trail (Ladkin and O'Brien
l 995a). Two concentrations of artifacts were
identified during the 1993 TAS survey. The
boundary of 41LU29 was extended to include the
newly documented artifacts, most of which were
hearthstones.

41LU29
41LU29 (Ridgetop site) was first recorded in
197 4 and is a large site along the eastern uplands
of the preserve. The original survey documented
the presence of abundant lithic artifacts and pottery sherds. Five hearths were recorded and a
possible teepee ring was found in 1982. The site
was surveyed a third time in 1987 (Ralph 1989).
Diagnostic artifacts indicated occupations ranging from the Archaic to the Ceramic periods.
Tool assemblages suggested the existence of residential settlements associated with food processing and tool manufacture (Ralph 1989). The site
extends beyond the boundaries of the preserve
property and therefore is much larger than as
presently recorded.
Testing and block excavations were conducted
during the 1988 and 1989 field seasons (Johnson
1993, 1995b). Nineteen occupation surfaces were
identified within Stratum Z, the upland soil unit.
Stratum Z is a sandy clay loam to sandy loam that
has undergone pedogenesis and is up to one meter
thick in some locations (Holliday 1993). Diag-

41LU32 (Kireilis site) lies on the southwestern
uplands across the preserve boundary fence line
from Area 28 of 41LU1. The original pedestrian
survey was undertaken in 1974. Projectile points
representing Protohistoric and late Archaic occupations were recovered during a 1987 survey (Ralph
1989), although subsurface testing conducted later
that year failed to locate additional diagnostic artifacts (Johnson 1989). The 1990 survey identified
the presence of thermal features (Ladkin and 0' Brien
1995a). Hearthstones were concentrated in two distinct locations, one of which was followed a trail. A
1991 survey recovered numerous lithic artifacts,
including projectile points representing late Archaic
and late Holocene occupations (Lewis et al. 2002).
Hearthstones were the most abundant artifact collected. The 1992 survey recovered mostly bone and
lithic artifacts along two trails across the site (Lewis
et al. 2002). The 1993 TAS survey collected mostly
hearthstones from one large scatter.

41LU65
41LU65 (Trailer Park Comer site) was first
recorded in 1982 and is a large site along the western
rim in the central section of the preserve. While
intact features were not recorded, scattered
hearthstones, bone, and lithic debris were collected
(Ralph 1989). Survey in 1990 found hearthstones in
11 clusters, three that represented hearths (Ladkin
and O'Brien 1995a). Excavations of the three hearths
during the 1990 field season recovered 26 lithic
artifacts but no diagnostic materials (Clifford et al.
1995). The 1993 T AS survey located four
hearthstones, three of which were associated with a
concentration identified in 1990. The relative scarcity
of newly exposed artifacts suggests that the deposits
at this site are stable.

41LU67

41LU92

41LU67 (Halfway site) lies along the western
uplands in the central section of the preserve. This
site was first recorded in 1982 and the boundaries
were expanded during the 1987 survey. The site
had been heavily damaged by all-terrain vehicles,
agricultural use, and erosion (Ralph 1989). Surveys
conducted in 1989 and 1990 found scattered hearthstones but no discrete thermal features or activity
areas (Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). The 1993 TAS
survey recovered mostly hearthstones from a single
linear concentration.

41LU92 was also recorded during the 1993 TAS
survey. This site is located on the eastern rim of the
northeastern quadrant of the preserve. The survey
recovered a small number of hearthstones from an
eroded and disturbed context along an abandoned dirt
road. A glass bottle fragment was also found. The
fragment had the words "Cheer Up" and "Carbonated" as part of an applied color label. These labels
were used by the industry after 1934 (Sweeny 1995).

ISOLATED FINDS
41LU74
41LU74 (Ted site) is located in the far northwestern reaches of the preserve. It was recorded
and tested during the 1987 survey, and over 200
artifacts were collected (Ralph 1989). Hearthstones
and lithic flakes were also collected during surveys conducted in 1989 and 1990 (Clifford et al.
1995; Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a). A hearth
(FA 7 4-1) excavated during the 1989 season
yielded Chupadero Black-on-white sherds and a
calibrated radiocarbon date of A.D. 990 (Ladkin
and O'Brien 1995b). The 1993 TAS survey recorded only four scattered hearthstones. The scarcity of newly exposed artifacts suggests that the
deposits are stable.

41LU85
First recorded in 1989, 41LU85 lies on the
western uplands in the north-central portion of the
preserve. A small number of hearthstones and lithic
artifacts were recovered during the 1993 TAS survey. The artifacts were found primarily in three
concentrations. The concentration of hearthstones
likely represented thermal features, and the linear
arrangement of artifact distributions are a result of
old trails through the site.

41LU91
This site was first recorded during the 1993
TAS Field School survey. It is located on the western rim in the northwestern quadrant of the preserve. Eleven hearthstones were mapped and
recovered. The cluster may represent the remnants
of a thermal feature.

Fifteen isolated artifact finds were recorded
within the boundaries of 41LU1 during the 1993
TAS survey (Table 4). Most of these finds consisted of isolated hearthstones. An additional 30
isolated finds were recorded along the upland rim
landform around Yellowhouse Draw. As with the
materials within 41LU1, the majority of upland
finds consisted of isolated hearthstones.

feature designated as FAl 0-1 and two smaller hearth
features (FAl0-2, FAl0-3) were recorded during
previous surveys (Ladkin and O'Brien 1995a).
Twenty members of the 1993 TAS Field School
(Figure 5) participated in the excavation of this site
over a period of nine days.
Testing revealed the presence of one stratum
(designated as stratum M) that contained archaeological deposits. Stratum M is composed of aeolian

and slopewash accumulations that are subject to
wind erosion. Stratum M overlies the Blackwater
Draw Formation, an archaeologically sterile Pleistocene-aged deposit (Holliday l 995b ), and is capped
by a layer of recent sediments and construction
debris from the last 50 years. The original extent of
the prehistoric activity area was unknown since
caliche quarrying and construction of a sewer pipe
had disturbed areas to the south, east, and west.
Block excavations and test units were excavated
during the 1993 field season. The block excavation
concentrated on exposing areas around Feature
FAl0-1 while the test units were used to explore
the surrounding area for evidence of buried
occupation surfaces (Figure 6). Two additional
features, designated as FAl0-4 and FAl0-5, were
identified during these excavations. Feature FAl04 is an occupation surface adjacent to hearth feature
FAl0-1. Feature FAl0-5 is a discrete pit that was
cut below the occupational surface of FAl0-4
(Figure 7). Two additional features (FAl0-2 and
FAl0-3) were encountered in two test units placed
a few meters to the west. These features consisted
of disturbed scatters of small hearthstone fragments.
Four organic sediment samples were collected
from Feature FAl0-1 for radiocarbon dating. The
radiocarbon ages range from the late Ceramic through

the early Protohistoric periods (Buchanan 2002a).
These radiocarbon ages fit with the diagnostic
artifacts recovered during the earlier surveys.
A total of 3,392 artifacts was recovered during
the excavations at Area 10 (Table 5). The majority
of the artifacts (52%) consisted of burned caliche
hearthstones, over 75% of which were recovered
from Feature FAl0-1. Bone accounted for 46% of

81

the overall artifact count. Over 67% of all faunal
material was burned, the majority (65 .5%) of which
is unidentifiable burned bone scrap. All identifiable
burned and unburned bone from Area 10 was identified as bison, the majority of which (93%) was
recovered from Feature FA 10-1. Rib segments represented the most abundant element recovered
(Table 6).
Lithic artifacts were placed into five categories,
with flakes being the most abundant type (Table 7).
The majority of lithics (77%) were recovered from
FAl 0-1. Four tools, including a projectile point and
biface, were recovered during the excavation, three
of which were from the Feature FAl0-1. The
projectile point was heavily damaged but its general
morphology indicated an age within the last 500
years. Chert was the most common lithic material,
accounting for 94% of the assemblage. Edwards
and Tecovas Formation cherts represented the most
common raw material sources.

focused on Stratum 5, the youngest stratigraphic
unit at the Landmark (Holliday 1995a; Holliday
and Allen 1987). Work began in this area in 1988
after geoarchaeological trenching revealed archaeological deposits (Johnson 1993). The 1993 season
represented the fifth summer of excavations in
Area 13B. Previously opened block units were
expanded and test units were opened during the
1993 season (Figure 8). An average of five TAS

crew members worked in Area 13B for a period of
five days (Figure 9).
Geomorphological and archeological studies
conducted between 1989 and 1993 helped explore
the boundaries of the cultural deposits and define
the microstratigraphic sequence within Stratum 5.
Three local beds (LB) composed of lacustrine mud
(mw) were identified within Stratum 5 along the
valley margin (Holliday 1994). The local beds were

excavations focused on features FA 13Bl, FA13B-2, FA13B-3, and FA13B-6.
Feature FA13B-1 is a thick layer of

Excavations in Area 72 of 41LU1
Area 72 is an historic trash dump located on
the western edge of the valley margin near the
meander where Y ellowhouse Draw turns towards
the east. Test excavations of mid-twentieth century
trash dumps within the Lubbock Lake Landmark
were undertaken during 1993 T AS Field School.

The objectives of the excavations were to determine
what remained of the dumps following several
disturbances to the area in 1990, to gain insights
into post-World War II discard and consumer
activity, and to investigate the possibility that earlier
pioneer period dumps were present.
Prior archaeological investigation consisted of
pedestrian survey conducted in 1981 and 1982

(Johnson 1983) and 1990 (Johnson 1995b). The
dump material were positioned on top of and slightly
embedded in Stratum 4. In this part of the valley,
Stratum 4 is exposed along the valley margin at the
surface and is still aggrading today since it was
never buried by Stratum 5 (Holliday and Allen 1987;
Johnson and Holliday 1989).
The 1990 fieldwork resulted in designation of
the area as an historic dump. Also in 1990, artifacts
that mistakenly had been removed from the area
during park cleanup were recovered and analyzed
to determine probable discard dates and an average
date for the dumps. Artifact analysis yielded
manufacture dates that were used to calculate the
Site Mean Date using a modification of South's
(1972) Mean Ceramic Date Formula. The computations returned a Site Mean Date of 1954-1955 .5
and Artifact Median Dates ranging from 1942-1986
(O'Brien 1995). Evidence from the modern dumps
in Area 72 reflect characteristics of Lubbock's
development as it underwent a substantial post-war
population increase between 1950 and 1960. The
incidence of dumping at the Lubbock Lake
Landmark correlates with factors such as the

absence of a designated landfill area and the
direction of the city's expansion (O'Brien 1995).
Texas Archaeological Society members conducted surface mapping and test excavations at Area
72 for a period of seven days during the 1993 Field
School. Four excavation units were placed in two
distinct areas of the dump that were designated HD
2 and HD 5 (Figure 10). Artifacts were mapped but
not collected from unit 290N/l 79W in HD 2. Material observed in these units consisted of clear glass
fragments, tin can fragments, and ceramic sherds.
The remaining two units (300N/168W, 300N/l 70W)
were located in HD 5. The units were situated on a
slope and excavated in four 5 cm levels. All material was piece-plotted. Most of the artifacts were
recovered from the surface of the slope. The artifacts and their associated sediments were lying directly over caliche (Humphreys 1993). Sixty-one
artifacts were recovered and included metal, glass,
and plastic items (Table 12).
Eight artifacts bore attributes that allowed for
identification of manufacturer and date of manufacture (Table 13). Five glass segments had maker's
marks that allowed for dating. One base segment

the base were codes identifying

the Owens-Illinois Glass Company at another manufacturing
plant. The date of manufacture indicated by the code on the base
was 1954 (Figure 11 b ).
A segment from a Royal
Crown soda bottle has a maker's
mark used by the Liberty Glass
Company from 1946 to 1954
(Toulouse 1971). The label style
of this item was produced between
1950 and 1958 (O'Brien 1995).
Therefore, the manufacture date of
the bottle is between 1950 and 1954
(Figure l lc). A complete item
recovered during the excavations is possibly an ink
bottle and was manufactured by the Fairmount Glass
Works, Inc (Figure lld). The maker's mark on the
bottle indicates a date between 1945 and 1960
(Toulouse 1971 ). A brown glass segment is embossed
with the word "RETURN" and part of the message
"No Deposit No Return." The style of embossing
was that used on beer bottles from 1940 until the
mid-1950s (Busch 1987). Another datable glass
artifact is a marble made of black glass with colored
spots within the black. The marble is classified as a
"new foreign-made marble" (Grist 1995) made in
China, Japan, or Mexico within the last 10-15 years
(Everett Grist, personal communication, 1995).
Two collected cans were of similar size and
shape and could be dated based on can type. A
partial label visible on one can identified the
manufacturer as Lucky X Lager Company in Azusa,
California. This company eventually became part
of the General Brewing Corporation (Mugrage

however, could not be found. The cans were quartsized cap-sealed cans, with a cone-shaped top to
resemble a beer bottle (Martells 1976; Mugrage
1993). By the end of 1960, competition with the
flat top style beer can made the cap-sealed cans
obsolete (Martells 1976; Mugrage 1993).

Artifact Median Dates of the materials
recovered from Area 72 during the 1993
T AS Field School range from 1940 to

artifacts is calculated to be 1955. Without
the marble included in the calculations, the
material Median Date for glass is 1949.7.
The manufacture date for the marble is 1977
to the present. In 1986, however, public
access to the Lubbock Lake Landmark was
restricted by construction of a perimeter
fence (Johnson 1989), imposing an end date
of 1986 on deposited material. The marble
may have been deposited during a different
event than the older material or may be an
indicator that the material was dumped at a
date much later than the manufacture dates
of the older material. The Material Median
Dates for the metal and the glass are
averaged to achieve a Site Mean Date of

Excavations at Site 41LU31

Site 41LU3 l is situated on the uplands west
of the meander where Yellowhouse Draw
turns to the east. Two hearth features (F31-1 and
F31-2) were identified and mapped during a 1978
survey of this location (Barkes and Johnson 1978).
A subsequent pedestrian survey in 1990 (Ladkin
and O'Brien 1995a) identified a third hearth feature
(F31-3) by the presence of a concentration of hearthstones and a broken metate (Figure 13).

Two deposits have been identified at 41LU31
and include Stratum K and the Blackwater Draw
Formation. Stratum K is an aeolian sandy clay loam
typically found on upland sites (Holliday 1993). At
41LU31, Stratum K is approximately 25 cm deep
and contains archaeological materials. Underlying
stratum K is an archaeologically sterile, aeolian,
fine sandy loam that is the Blackwater Draw Formation (Holliday 1989).
Test excavation of Feature F3 l-3 was conducted
for a period of 18 days during the 1993 T AS Field
School to determine the horizontal distribution and
vertical depth of the feature. Six 1 x 1 meter test

89

units were placed across the general location of the feature. The
placement of the units was based
on the distribution of surface artifacts (Figure 14). Test excavations
confirmed the presence of a large
hearth area. This area contained
predominantly hearthstones (96% ),
the broken metate, and one Edwards Formation chert flake (Table
14). No diagnostic artifacts were
found. One bone fragment could
be identified as the lower molar
from a wolf. The hearthstones were
distributed to a depth of 35 cm
below the surface among the six
excavation units. Most of the
hearthstones were concentrated
within a 10 to 15 cm thick layer
that may represent the original occupation surface (Figure 15).
An organic sediment sample
was collected for radiocarbon dating from unit 73S/297W at a depth
of 5-10 cm below surface within
the main band of hearthstones (Figure 16). The organic sediment was
darker than smrounding sediment
and was in a concentration of hearthstones. The humate date was essentially modem in age, but could be
up to 300 years old (Herbert Haas,
personal communication, 1999).
SUMMARY AND
CONCLUSIONS

Pedestrian survey of the entire
Lubbock Lake Landmark preserve was conducted
during the 1993 field season with the participation
ofTAS Field School members. One new occupation
area was defined within 41LU1 and two new upland
rim sites were recorded during the TAS survey. In
addition, the boundaries of two occupation areas
within 41LU1 and one upland rim site were expanded on the basis of new information obtained
during the survey. The TAS survey recorded a total
of 1,549 artifacts within the previously and newly
recorded provenience areas within the Landmark.
Data collected during the 1993 survey program,
when combined with information from past and

future surveys, will allow several spatial analyses to
be undertaken. Prehistoric human behavior at the
landmark may be interpreted through the patterning
of artifacts across the surface. Additionally, the continual monitoring of the Landmark surface affords
the opportunity to observe rates of erosion and artifact exposure in different geomorphological settings.
At Area 10 of 41LU1, test excavations were
carried out with the purpose of exploring the archaeological potential of features identified during
previous surveys. Test excavations revealed an extensive hearth feature (FAl0-1) and revealed a complex of intersecting and overlapping pit features

fragmented bison bones (Hamilton 1998), suggesting
the cultural practice of man-ow extraction and grease
rendering took place at this location. This evidence
also underscores the extensive utilization of bison
carcasses. The distribution, size, and extent of
burning suggest the bone was used as a source of
fuel subsequent to fragmentation.

The results of the T AS Field School
investigations prompted continued study of this
area and were the beginning of an extensive
excavation program that has continued for seven
field seasons (Johnson 2002). By the end of the
2000 field season, 11 pits, an unlined basin hearth,
and two probable post-molds had been identified
within this complex activity area (Backhouse
2002). The original extent of the activity area is
unknown as various construction activities over
the past 50 years (before the Landmark was given
protection as a National Historic Landmark and
State Archeological Landmark) destroyed many
archaeological deposits. The mechanical excavation of a sewer pipe in the 1960s destroyed part
of the site. The present location of Area 10
represents a small remnant of preserved archeological deposits within a highly disturbed area.
The findings of the 1993 T AS field season at
Area 13B of 41LU1 reaffirmed that both cultural
and natural activities occun-ed in the area. Area
13B apparently was utilized repeatedly as a bison
processing station. Several such activity areas dating to the late Holocene are known elsewhere along
the valley axis of the Landmark (Johnson 1987).
The distinctive feature of Area 13B is the caliche

at least nine different tools were
used in this location, and at least
four different non-local lithic

This pattern suggests that the

had trade relations with groups
nearer the source.

vertically distributed over a depth
of 35 cm, a clearly defined concentration occurred within a 10 cm
band. Otherwise, the dispersed nature of the hearthstones across the
remainder of the area indicates that
this feature had been disturbed.
The other two features at 41LU31
have similar surface concentrations of hearthstones and are likely
indicative of larger, subsurface
features. The three hearth features
and large amount of scattered
hearthstones found at 41LU31 indicate that this area was repeatedly occupied. No chronologically
diagnostic artifacts or radiocarbon
age estimates were recovered from
these features, although based on
the local stratigraphy it is suggested that the occupation of
41LU31 dates to the aboriginal
Historic Period. The stratigraphy
of the site indicates that much of
Stratum K deposition took place
before the main occupation. Historic aboriginal occupations have
been documented at several locations within the Landmark
(Holliday and Johnson 1990;
Johnson and Holliday 1987). However, further excavation and analysis will be necessary to determine
the timing and nature of the occupations at 41LU31.

At 41LU31, the amount and concentration of
hearthstones in Feature F3 l -3 is typical of a thermal
feature. Such features are a common occurrence at
the Landmark (Johnson 1987, 1989, 1993; Ladkin
and O'Brien 1995a). The hearthstones were horizontally dispersed over a six square meter area. It is
assumed that the darkest organic sediment (where
the radiocarbon sample was taken) was associated
with the broken metate and as well as many of the
larger hearthstones, and therefore represents the location of the hearth pit. While the hearthstones were

is greatly appreciated and their efforts were instrumental in accomplishing the field objectives of the
1993 season and revealing the incredible potential
of Area 10. The senior author expresses thanks in
particular to Eunice Barkes and her TAS lab crew.
Through their efforts, materials were processed expeditiously that helped underscore the significance
of Area 10 and Area 72. Numerous Lubbock Lake

The 1994 and 1995 TAS Field Schools
Joan Few, Robbie Brewington, Karen Elliot Fustes,
W.L. McClure, and Barbara Penhaker

ABSTRACT
The Follet Lake Site (41B0138) is a large, prehistoric shell midden investigated in 1981 and 1982 by the
Brazosport Archaeological Society (BAS) and during the 1994 and 1995 field schools sponsored by the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS). The shell midden measures approximately 330 meters in length and 100 meters
in width, and is located on the southern shore of a freshwater brackish lake that was drained prior to 1860.
Three exposed and disturbed areas of the midden were tested during the T AS field schools. The areas
excavated by T AS revealed a series of stratified shell and artifact deposits situated along the original
lakeshore. Analysis of vertebrate and Rangia cuneata shell remains suggest a coastal prairie and lake-focused
hunting-gathering adaptation. Seasonality studies conducted on the Rangia shells indicate year-round
utilization of the local environment with the most intense exploitation occurring during the spring and
summer. The ceramics are of a style and technology common in the Galveston Bay area. Based on the presence
of ceramics throughout the excavation units, it is proposed that the excavated portions of the shell midden date
to the ceramic period, or after A.D. 300.

INTRODUCTION
The Pollet Lake Site (41B0138) is a prehistoric shell midden located on the south shoreline of
the old Pollet Lake bed in Brazoria County, Texas
(Figure 1). The site is located approximately one
half-mile to the north of the current channel of
Oyster Creek. Oyster Creek is an old channel of the
Brazos River, and it is possible that Pollet Lake
also represents an ancient meander channel of the
river. Pollet Lake was drained before 1860 by constructing a drainage ditch to Oyster Creek. The site
is situated on private property leased by Dow
Chemical Company USA.
Pollet Lake is rather unique because of its location in proximity to several ecological zones. Located on a coastal prairie close to freshwater and
saltwater marshes, Follet Lake is located two miles
from the Gulf of Mexico, five miles from West
Galveston Bay, and five miles north of the mouth
of Brazos River. Coastal woodland environments
are present ten miles to the west.
The Pollet Lake shell midden was originally
surveyed and recorded in September of 1981 by
Johnney Pollan. The midden had a dirt and grass

covering ranging from one to six inches in depth
and was estimated to be 500 feet (150 m) long
and 100 feet (30 m) wide. The site was discovered when Dow Chemical made a bulldozer cut
along the lake shoreline, revealing the presence
of a dense deposit of Rangia cuneata shell. Because of the density and extent of the shell deposit, it was thought that an historic shell-surfaced
road had been encountered. However, an archeological survey conducted by the Brazosport Archaeological Society (BAS) determined that the
shell deposits were associated with lithic and ceramic artifacts and thus the site represented a
prehistoric shell midden.
The BAS conducted a field school at 4lBO138
in November and December of 1981 and May of
1982. Test excavations included four 4 x 4 foot (1.2
x 1.2 m) units excavated in four-inch (10.16 cm)
levels. Materials recovered included faunal bone,
sandy paste ceramics, and whole and partial Rangia
shells. A projectile point was recovered at a depth
of 13 inches (33 cm) in Level 3 of excavation unit
N2/W2. The materials from these investigations
are presently curated at the Brazosport Museum of
Natural Science.

midden; (2) obtain materials to date
the midden; and (3) determine if habitation structures, fire hearths, or other
features indicative of residential occupations were present within or adjacent to the midden. Analytical goals of
the field and laboratory work included:
(1) identifying the subsistence and
technological activities of the huntergatherer groups who occupied the site;
and (2) identifying the environmental
zones exploited by the inhabitants
through analyses of ceramic, faunal,
and Rangia shell assemblages.
The search for residential structures in the form of shell house mounds
was a particularly important research
topic. A cultural feature found among
several Gulf Coast shell middens is a
circular concentration or pavement of
Rangia shells. The presence of several
dozen of these distinctive features at

EXCAVATION
PROCEDURES AND
FEATURE
DESCRIPTIONS

Three areas were selected
for excavation in 1994 (Figure
2). Area A was selected because of the high concentration of artifacts on the surface
that suggested a possible habitation area. Area B was selected to serve as a contrast to
Area A because of the abundance of shell and absence of
artifacts in this area. Area C
was a large deposit of shell located to the south of the original BAS excavations and situated between Areas A and B.
Areas A, B, and C are all
within areas of the site having
the highest elevation.
Area A consisted of a
dense surface scatter of Rangia
shell, ceramics, burned bone,
and small chert flakes (Figure
3). Surface artifacts were pointprovenienced and collected.
The deposits in Area A contained far more cultural material than anywhere else on the
site. During the 1994 field

possible, although the black clay deposits were
extremely difficult to screen. The clay deposits also
made it difficult to recover organic material and
charcoal. No charred material for radiocarbon dating
could be identified.
Two features were identified in Area A. Feature
I was a semi-circular area on the surface that had a
very dense concentration of pottery sherds and
burned bone. A stone drill and two bone awls were
recovered from the base of this feature. A scatter of
alligator bone was observed immediately to the
east of Feature 1. Norman Flagg provided a
description of this feature in his field notes and
expressed the difficulties of excavating in the dense
clay soils present at the site: "The recovery of the
alligator bones was crude but it was the best we
could do. Digging with picks, etc., was painstakingly slow and was resulting in destroying more
bone than we were saving. The clay was stronger
than the bone so when something gave way it was
through the bone rather than the clay." Feature 2

was another bone concentration to the northwest of
Feature 1. Faunal material in Feature 2 was situated
directly on the clay surface and was not associated
with shell deposit.
Area B was another disturbed area located approximately 40 meters to the south of Area A. Five
l x 1 m units were excavated in Area B. Sterile clay
soils were encountered at a depth of 30 to 50 cm in
these units. Due to the low artifact recovery, excavations in Area B were terminated after three days
of fieldwork. In contrast to the common presence
of lithic, ceramic and bone materials in Area A,
Area B appeared to consist almost entirely of shell
(Figure 5), although a small amount of bone and a
few small ceramic sherds were also present. In order to provide a quantitative comparison of the two
areas, all shell in each 1 x 1 m unit and level was
weighed. In Area B, Level 2 of Unit N462/E440
contained 180.3 kg of Rangia shell. In contrast,
only 89 kg of shell was recovered from Level 2 of
Unit N529/E469 of Area A. Aside from the shell
deposit, no discrete cultural features were identified within Area B.
Area C was another slightly elevated area
situated between Areas A and B. Trenches were
excavated across Area C using a small mechanical
ditch excavator (ditch witch) provided by Dow
Chemical Company. The trenches provided a crosssection of the portion of the site between Areas A
and B. The stratigraphic sequence observed in the
trenches included a 30 to 50 cm thick deposit of
Rangia cuneata shell situated above a generally thin
layer of black clay (Figure 6). Below the black clay
was a deposit of orange-green sandy clay

representing the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene
age. The stratum containing Rangia shell was not
continuous and often alternated with the deposit of
black clay. Shell deposits were also observed below
the black clay stratum in some locations, suggesting
that this stratum represented lake deposits and
provided evidence of changing water levels. A
projectile point of gray-banded che1i was found in
the east-west trench during wall profiling. The point
was recovered 73 cm below the surface, below the
black clay stratum and well below the Rangia deposit.
Tentatively classified as a Morhiss point (after Turner
and Hester 1993: 158), the specimen would date to
the Late Archaic period and thus predates the midden.
Several depressions filled with burned shell
were observed in the trench profiles across Area C.
Two of these depressions, designated as Features 3
and 4, were selected for more detailed hand excavation. Feature 3 was removed as a block and transported to the TAS field school laboratory. Feature 4
was excavated in the field, allowing for the dimensions of the depression to be defined.
Analysis of Vertebrate Remains
The remains of vertebrate species were identified to the extent possible through use of direct

comparisons with reference collections. Analysis
of materials recovered through fine-screening identified several species of small vertebrates and these
are included with the tabulation of other bones.
Unidentified fragments from the fine-screening are
not included in the totals. The vast majority of the
faunal remains were recovered from the excavations units in Area A. Very few bones were present
in Areas B and C.
Recovered bones from Area A total 25,458, of
which 13,245 (52%) could not be related to any
taxon other than 'vertebrata.' Table 1 provides a
list of the vertebrate remains presented as number
of identified specimens (NISP) of each type and the
minimum number of individuals (MNI) represented
in the total collection. The MNI measure will often
under-represent smaller animals since the remains
of larger animals are often better preserved. Smaller
animals are also under-represented because not all
of the soil was subjected to fine screen analysis.
However, this tabulation of MNI indicates the relative importance of each species and provides a basis of comparison with other sites.
Fish remains are by far the most common species identified in the assemblage. Among the identified specimens were 8637 fish scales and bones,
representing 71 % of the assemblage. Other major

groups represented in the assemblage include 2416
reptile and amphibian bones (20%) and 1122 mammal bones (9% ). Only 36 bird bones were identified, representing 0.3% of the collection. The
preponderance of fish remains may be biased by
the fact that fish scales (particularly those of various gar species) were probably more favourably
preserved than bone remains. Excluding fish scales
from the total yields proportions of 53% fish, 31 %
reptile and amphibian remains, 15% mammal remains, and less than 1% of birds.
The species counts were examined to determine
if any variation in vertical or horizontal distribution
throughout the shell midden could be detected. No
differences that would indicate change in cultural
practices or specific activity areas were revealed.
Most of the bones were stained from the dark soil so
it was not possible to determine whether or not they
had been burned. The fine-screening efforts were
also greatly affected by the condition of the soil.
Much of the soil resisted repeated washing and appeared to be partly fused by heat and/or heated grease.
Varieties of fish identified in the archeological

assemblage include gar, bowfin, smallmouth buffalo, catfish, sunfish, green sunfish, largemouth
bass, and freshwater drum. All of the fish are presently found in Brazoria County (Hubbs 1982) and
would have been available in the waters of the
ancient Pollet Lake adjacent to the site.
Reptile and amphibian species represented in
the assemblage include siren (an eel-like amphibian), tree frog, toad, bullfrog, leopard frog, alligator,
snapping turtle, mud turtle, slider turtle, box turtle,
green anole, skink, rat snake, mud snake, hognose
snake, kingsnake, water snake, coral snake, rattlesnake, and cottonmouth. Identified birds include
duck and crow. All of these species are found in the
Brazos River Valley in modern times (Dixon 1987).
Mammal species present at the site include
shrew, swamp rabbit, cottontail, gray squirrel,
fulvous harvest mouse, pigmy mouse, deer mouse,
rice rat, hispid cotton rat, prairie vole, white-tailed
deer, and either cow or bison. Prairie vole (Microtus
ochrogaster) became extinct in southeast Texas
sometime after 1900 (Davis and Schmidly
1994:202). Other than the prairie vole and the cow

Few, et al. -

The Follet L<lke Site: TAS Field Schools 1994-1995

or bison, these mammals all have habitat ranges
that presently include Brazoria County (Davis and
Schmidly 1994).
Prairie voles were common throughout the
coastal prairies of the Texas coast prior to 1900. In
addition to the Follet Lake site, the remains of
prairie voles have been identified at four archaeological sites in the region: 41CH161 in Chambers
County (McClure 1994,1998); 41FB3 in Fort Bend
County (Patterson et al. 1998); 41FB32 in Fort
Bend County (McClure 1989); and 41WH50 in
Wharton County (McClure 1991). These sites date
from the Archaic through the post-European contact periods. Modem agricultural practices were
probably a factor in the extinction of the prairie
vole among coastal prairie habitats.
Two clusters of bones from Features 1 and
2 were carefully excavated and processed through
fine-mesh screens because they were thought to
represent isolated, single cooking events. The bones
recovered from Feature 1 were not in anatomical
position and parts of broken bones were not juxtaposed. The larger bones were of alligator, including
cranial, vertebral, caudal, dermal, and long bones.
Both large and small individual alligators were
present, along with the bones of a large slider turtle,
gars, and a tooth and trapezoid magnum bone from
a deer. The soil matrix surrounding these bones
was typical of the site and included a few lithic and
ceramic artefacts. Five alligator vertebrae were recovered from Feature 2, along with five pit viper
vertebrae. These features may indicate disposal of
single meals, although no signs of butchering were
observed on any of the bones.
The limited excavations conducted in Area B
resulted in lower recovery rates and only 49
identifiable bones are available for analysis from
this area. Apparently this area had been used less
frequently for disposal of food remains and thus it
may be possible to isolate single discard events. All
of the alligator bones were recovered from a small
area within Levels 2 and 3, while all deer remains
were found in a separate location in Levels 1, 2,
and 3. These may represent the locations of single
food processing or discard events. Trenching and a
test pit excavated in Area C yielded a few bones of
deer, alligator, fish, and turtle.
The variety of species identified in the Pollet
Lake site faunal assemblage indicate that the prehistoric inhabitants relied primarily on freshwater
fish, alligator, turtle, rodents, and deer, along with

105

occasional other reptile, amphibian, mammal and
bird species. If the few fragments of cow-size mammal bones represent prehistoric bison and not intrusive remains of modem cow, their presence is an
intriguing component of Ceramic Period subsistence practices along the coastal prairie.
An interesting comparison can be made with
the Cotton Lake site (41CH161) investigated by the
Houston Archeological Society in 1992 and in 1997.
Cotton Lake is located 135 km northeast of Follet
Lake. Both the Cotton Lake and Follet Lake sites
are Rangia shell middens situated on the banks of
freshwater lakes of the coastal prairie, and have
comparable dates of occupation. However,
differences in resource exploitation may be
indicated in the faunal assemblages of these sites.
The vertebrate assemblage from the Cotton Lake
site has been described by McClure (1994, 1998).
Nearly 90% of the bones consisted of marine and
freshwater fish. No marine fish species were
identified at Pollet Lake. Perhaps this represents a
significant difference in food choices for groups
residing on opposite sides of Galveston Bay.
Analysis of Rangia Cuneata Shell
Rangia cuneata species are found along the
Gulf of Mexico coast from northwest Florida to
Campeche, Mexico, and along the Atlantic Coast
as far north as Maryland and New Jersey (LaSalle
and de la Cruz 1985). These water clams are adapted
to brackish water environments of generally low
salinity (Carlson 1987). Rangia cuneata have been
found as far as 25 miles upstream in river deltas
(LaSalle and de la Cruz 1985), but reach their greatest population densities in shallow water between
freshwater and saltwater environments (LaSalle and
de la Cruz 1985; Tarver and Dugas 1973). The
accessibility and high population densities of this
mollusk accounts for the abundance of large Rangia
middens along the upper Texas coast.
Rangia shells can provide insight into seasonality of resource use and site occupation
through analysis of the growth lines found on
the heavy thick shells (Aten 1981; Ricklis 1996).
Aten (1981:183) describes the procedure for determining season of death of individual Rangia
shell specimens based on the amount of new
growth beyond the last growth interruption associated with winter, which is represented by a
dark ring. Shells are assigned to spring, summer,

year, but more intensively during the spring and

was assigned to the "early" category, indicating
procurement during the late winter months. Fiftyeight percent of the sample was harvested during
the late spring and summer occupations of the site,
and twelve percent indicated a late fall or early
winter occupation.
In order to obtain a larger and more representative sample, Rangia shell material was examined

108

Texas Archeological Society

from three of the four features in Areas A and C
investigated during the 1994 field school. Shell
specimens from Features 1, 3, and 4 were analysed
by students at the University of Houston at Clear
Lake during the Spring semester of 2001. Excavation unit N527/E468 was placed in Feature 1 of
Area A. Sample 41B0138-7 from this unit yielded
26 pounds (11.8 kg) of Rangia shell for analysis.
Sample 41B0138-16 was from units N504/E464
and N504/E463 of Feature 3 in Area A, and provided a sample of 18 pounds (8.2 kg) of shell.
Sample 4lBO138-11 was collected from unit N497I
E455 within Feature 4 of Area C. A total of 26.5
pounds (12 kg) of shell was analysed from this unit.
All shell specimens were washed, measured, and
weighed. One of every ten specimens was systematically selected for determination of seasonality
and age using the procedures established by Aten
(1981). Seasonality was determined for a total of
276 shell specimens and age was determined for
299 specimens. The results of these analyses are
presented in Table 2.
Measurements are generally consistent across
the three contexts. In Feature 1, 80% of the shells
measured between 2.5 and 4.0 cm in length and
83% were between 3.0 and 5.0 cm in width. In
Feature 3, 81 % of the shells were between 2.5 and
3.5 cm in length, and 84% were between 3.0 and
4.0 cm in width. In Feature 4, 82% of the shells
were between 2.5 and 3.5 cm in length and 84%
were between 3.0 and 4.0 cm in width. Of the total
collection, 71 % of the specimens were harvested
during the spring or summer.
Rangia shells from the Armand Bayou site
(41HR81) were also analysed by the University of
Houston students and provide a comparative data
set (Table 3). The Armand Bayou site is located
approximately one mile from Clear Lake, which
empties into Galveston Bay. The individual samples
of Rangia shell from the Armand Bayou site were
larger than the Pollet Lake samples. The shells from
Armand Bayou were much thicker and had a
rounder shape (variation in length and width was
less than Pollet Lake). Trying to explain the
differences in shell attributes is complicated by the
multiple variables involved among the ecosystems
where the Rangia specimens were harvested.
Seasonality analyses provide the most reliable
source of information. Hunter-gatherers groups
occupying both Pollet Lake and Armand Bayou
harvested Rangia more often during the spring and

summer months, although it is also evident that
harvesting was a year-round activity. Because of
the temperate climate of the Texas Gulf Coast it
seems logical that hunter-gatherers would utilize
available resources during any season. This is
supported by the Rangia shell data at Pollet Lake
and Armand Bayou.

Ceramic Artifacts
The Brazosport Archaeological Society collected 78 sherd from the surface and an additional
15 sherds from subsurface contexts during the 1980
and 1982 investigations at 41B0138. Most of these
sherds were substantially weathered and it was difficult to refit edges, define vessel form or shape, or
make observations of surface modifications. Films
and coatings were minimally evident. Sherds measuring over 2 cm in size were analyzed for thickness, paste, temper, rim form and orifice diameter,
evidence of construction or forming marks, and
modifications to vessel exteriors or interiors. The
presence or absence of these attributes reflects
choices made by the prehistoric potters inhabiting
the site (Ellis 1992).
With two exceptions, all sherds from the 1980
and 1982 investigations were sand tempered. Two
sherds recovered from the surface were found to
have grog and shell temper. Evidence of coil construction was observed on two sherds and interior
scraping was noted on one specimen. Two sherds
had evidence of interior surface film and one sherd
had both interior and exterior surface film.
The ceramic assemblages from the 1994 and
1995 TAS excavations were analyzed using the
same procedures. A total of 403 sherds was recovered the surface of the six 1994 excavation units in
Area A, and an additional 345 sherds were recovered from the 1994 and 1995 excavation units. Most
sherds were recovered within the upper 10 cm
(Level 1) of the midden. Only 91 of the 345 sherds
recovered from subsurface contexts were of sufficient size for attribute analysis. The sherds ranged
between 4 and 7 mm in thickness. Evidence of coil
construction was present and interior scraping was
observed on seven sherds. Only one small rim sherd
was identified in the collection. The majority of
sherds had sandy pastes, although shell temper was
noted in seven samples. Interior or exterior asphaltum coatings were noted on five sherds and one
specimen had another form of exterior film.

Few, et al. - The Follet IAke Site: TAS Field Schools 1994-1995
Only five sherds were recovered from Area
B and all were from Level 1 of Unit N464/E437.
Only one sherd was large enough for analysis
and was a sandy paste brownware identical to the
majority of ceramics found elsewhere at the site.
The ceramic assemblage of the Follet Lake
site conforms to the type descriptions of ceramics found in the Brazos River delta and West
Galveston Bay region of the Texas Gulf Coast
(Aten 1983) and are typical of the Goose Creek
and Rockport types described by Suhm and Jelks
(1962), Aten (1983), Ellis (1992), and Ricklis
(1996). The sherds were predominantly sand
tempered, sandy paste brownwares, although
seven shell tempered sherds and a single grog
tempered sherd were also observed in the assemblage. Aten (1983) considers the presence
of shell to be a fortuitous inclusion. However, in
the Follet Lake site collection shell tempered
sherds have thinner walls (4 to 5 mm) and the
shell temper was evenly distributed among the
paste. Coil construction was evident in most
sherds and interior scraping of vessel surfaces
was noted. Surface modifications were rare.
Small, incised lines were noted on a single sherd,
and asphaltum coatings were present on the exterior or interior of several sherds.

Projectile Points
The lithic assemblage recovered during the
1994 and 1995 field school excavations consists of seven projectile points or fragments,
one chert drill, several marginally utilized
flakes, and 71 chert flakes. The seven projectile points (Figure 7) were recovered during
the 1994 field school and include three points
and one unidentifiable tip fragment from Area
A, two points from Area B, and one specimen
from Area C. Perdiz points are the most common type and their presence supports the ceramic chronology of the midden.
Three Perdiz points were recovered from
Area A (Figure 7, top row), all within the upper
1Ocm of the midden in Level 1. The specimen
on the left was collected from unit N529/E469
and measures 21 mm in length, 13 rnm in width,
4 mm in thickness, and has a neck width of 6
mm and a haft length of 7 mm. The blade is
neither beveled nor serrated. The point in the
middle (N529/E469) measures 25 mrn in length,

15 mm in width, and 3 mm in thickness, and has a
neck width of 7 mm and a haft length of 9 mm.
The blade of this specimen is neither beveled nor
serrated. The point on the right (N529/E469) is
broken at the neck and is missing the basal section. The length of the remaining portion is 19
mm, the width is 16 mm, and the thickness is
3mm. The neck width is 8 mm. Unlike the other
two examples, the blade of this point is slightly
beveled but lacks serrations. The broken tip fragment (not illustrated) has a slightly beveled and
very finely serrated blade.
A dart point and Perdiz point were recovered
from Area B (Figure 7, middle row). The dart point
was collected from Level 2 of unit N464/E437. The
specimen has a broken base and measures 40 mm
from point to neck, is 21mm in width, and is 9 mm
thick. The neck width is 11 mm. The blade is neither beveled nor serrated. The Perdiz point was
recovered from Level 2 of unit N464/E442. The
specimen measures 23 mm in length, is 13 mm
wide, and 2 mm thick, and has a neck width of 5
mm and a base length of 6 mm. The blade is slightly
beveled but is not serrated.
A single dart point was recovered at a depth of
73 cm below the surface in a trench profile of Area
C at grid coordinate N504/E460 (Figure 7, bottom).
The specimen measures 7 mm in thickness, 85 mm
in length, and has a maximum width of 30 mm. The
basal width of the point is 21 mm, the haft length is
approximately 13 mm, and the neck width is 21mm.
This projectile point has a beveled blade.

SUMMARY
Based on surface indications, the full extent of
the Pollet Lake site midden appears to be 330 meters
long and 100 meters wide. Less than 1% of this
area was investigated during the 1994 and 1995
TAS field schools. The greatest densities of shell
debris are situated among the highest elevated areas
of the site. The T AS field school excavations
determined that the depth of the shell deposits in
these areas range from 30 to 50 cm below the surface
and consist of overlying occupational lenses of shell
deposits. The midden deposit and associated artifact
assemblages are similar to other shell middens in
the Brazos River Valley and Texas coastal prairie
(Aten 1983; Shafer and Bond 1985). However, no
circular concentrations of shells suggesting the

presence of house structures were found during the
limited excavations at 41B0138. No evidence of a
discrete camp area was found, although several
clusters of animal bone may represent the remains
of isolated cooking and discard events.
Analysis of the faunal remains determined that
the prehistoric inhabitants relied primarily on Rangia,
clams, freshwater fish, alligator, turtle, rodents, and
deer. No salt water shells or fish species were identified that would indicate the utilization of the nearby
bays and estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. The variety of vertebrate species in the assemblage demonstrates that the Pollet Lake region was a rich area of
food resources and that the prehistoric inhabitants
of the site practiced a broad-spectrum hunting and
gathering subsistence economy. The uniformity in
size and age of the Rangia shells suggests selective
collecting. The site was utilized year round with the
most intensive occupation occurring during the spring
and summer months.
The ceramics are of a style and technology
common to the Galveston Bay region (Aten 1983;
Shafer and Bond 1985; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Since
ceramics were found in all levels of the excavations, the date for formation of the midden deposits
most likely falls within the ceramic period, or post
A.D. 300 (Aten 1983:297). Perdiz points are common to the upper Texas Coast (Suhm and Jelks
1962:283; Turner and Hester 1993). The presence
of this style of projectile point in Levels 1 and 2 of
the midden may indicate that the upper levels of the
midden may have been deposited after A.D. 500
(Aten 1983: 303).
Overall, the 1994 and 1995 TAS field school
excavations at Pollet Lake contributed to our knowledge of the prehistory of the Texas coastal prairie.

Not only does this 1853-page five-volume set
add about a dozen pounds to your bookshelf, it
provides the comprehensive and authoritatively detailed discussion of this very unique Central Texas
archeological site known as Wilson-Leonard. The
Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas Historical Commission (Office of the State Archeologist), and the
Archaeological Conservancy should be commended
for their persistence in excavating, analyzing, reporting and preserving a portion of this scientifically and prehistorically valuable location.
Specifically, much of this work is a result of the
vision and efforts of Michael B. Collins and C.
Britt Bousman who co-directed the supplemental
excavations and analyses and participated in writing half of the 42 chapters. Although it is not possible to summarize the entire contents of this
multi-volume monograph, the highlights of this
work deserve a longer discussion than usually provided in most book reviews.
Wilson-Leonard contains a stratified sequence
of deeply buried occupations dating to the Late
Pleistocene. The site was first identified in 1973
when TxDOT archeologists found prehistoric
remains on the floodplain surface where RR1431
crosses Brushy Creek about 33 km NNW of Austin.
TxDOT excavations in 1981and1982-84 revealed
cultural deposits at least 1.5 meters below the
surface. Subsequent excavations were conducted
by TARL in 1992-93. This impressive work
revealed a much deeper and complex sequence of
occupation at the site. Ultimately, a total of 477
cubic meters of this cultural deposit were
investigated. Significant evidence encountered at
the site include the Clovis component, Early
Paleoindian Bone Bed, Late Paleoindian (Wilson
component), Paleoindian burial, and sporadic but
intense occupations throughout the Holocene (both
Archaic and Late Prehistoric Periods) with burned

rock middens. The total of 92 radiocarbon dates
makes this one of the best-dated sites in Texas.
Readers are cautioned that none of these dates (nor
those used in this review) appear to have been
calibrated to calendar ages. Nonetheless, this series
of dates combines with the long history of repeated
occupation and more than six meters of geologic
deposition at the site to make a substantial
contribution to the understanding of cultural
chronology in the region, including suggested
revisions for the typological status of certain
Paleoindian and Early Archaic projectile points.
In addition, this multidisciplinary team of investigators also makes contributions to understanding of regional cultural adaptations and processes,
site formational processes, and paleoenvironmental
reconstruction. Extensive multidisciplinary efforts
and special studies were conducted at the site making this work an excellent model for those facing
similar settings at complex archeological sites. The
intermittent 25-year history of investigation resulted
in problems of correlating diverse research goals,
methods and procedures, and stratigraphic designations; but the T ARL team does an admirable job of
addressing these inevitable challenges. Importantly,
the T ARL team also addresses the complex and
dynamic processes of landform evolution at the
site, including the primary post-depositional disturbances such as earthworm burrowing. Unusually
good preservation and stratigraphic separation of
the Paleoindian horizons resulted from rapid rates
of alluvial deposition at the beginning of the sequence. Periodic surface stability and soil formation with reductions in the rate of alluvial deposition
(but increases in colluvial deposition) resulted in
recognizable but less discrete separation of the Holocene occupations.
Wilson-Leonard is situated within the ecotone
of the Edwards Plateau savannah and the tall grass
prairie of the Interior Coastal Plain and it is unclear

why people repeatedly inhabited this particular
location. As Collins and Mear (p. 5) ask, "why for
nearly 11,000 years did people keep returning to
this rather nondescript place?" They go on to
describe the location as "just a narrow bit of valley
floor alongside a small stream in rolling limestone
hill country with thin soils and ordinary vegetation."
Although not providing a very satisfying answer
for those who hope to predict and easily comprehend
the locations of prehistoric human occupations, they
suggest, "Perhaps its answer lies in the diversity of
resources that characterize the area (p. 5, emphasis
in original)."
Volume 1: Introduction, Background, and Syntheses contains the acknowledgments, a forward
(written by Thomas R. Hester), and Chapters 1-11
with 94 tables and 187 figures (including an oversized map of the Early Paleoindian Bone Bed component in the back pocket) and a list of references
cited. An introductory chapter to this site monograph is written by Collins. This volume represents the core of the entire set with contributed
chapters on the site and its setting (Michael B.
Collins and C. E. Mear), the history of investigations (C. Britt Bousman, Michael B. Collins, Jan
Guy, Paul Takac, and Gail L. Bailey), a background to the archeological investigations (Michael
B. Collins), discussion of the research objectives
(C. Britt Bousman), geology and stratigraphy (Paul
Goldberg and Vance T. Holliday), Early Paleoindian components (Michael B. Collins), Late
Paleoindian archeology (C. Britt Bousman), Archaic Period occupations (Michael B. Collins, Jan
Guy, and Susan W. Dial), Late Prehistoric components (Michael B. Collins), and the place of Wilson-Leonard in Southern Plains prehistory
(Michael B. Collins). In the interest of brevity, my
review focuses on the contents of this introductory and synthetic volume.
The stated research objectives at the site include
making contributions to prehistoric cultural
chronology and paleoenvironmental reconstructions,
consideration of site formation processes, defining
prehistoric resource exploitation patterns in context
of the paleoenvironment, describing and explaining
the changing organization of lithic and food
processing technology, documenting and interpreting the patterns of spatial organization and
prehistoric activities on a few of the best-preserved
surfaces (the Bone Bed and the Wilson component),
increasing our biological understanding of the

prehistoric inhabitants from their skeletal remains,
and examining problems of artifact typology and
cultural systematics. The greatest contributions to
cultural chronology are made in the early parts of
the sequence when rapid alluvial deposition results
in good stratigraphic separation.
Although ancient pollen is not preserved at the
site, paleoenvironmental studies include analyses
of plant phytoliths, wood charcoal, vertebrate microfauna (including bird egg shells), stable isotopes
from sediment samples, and ostracodes and diatoms from the basal Late Pleistocene pond deposits. Effects of earthworm burrowing on the vertical
distribution of these micro-particles and any AMS
dates obtained from them can be significant. Consequently, numerous approaches were undertaken
to understand site formation processes, including
the reconstruction of landscape evolution and alluvial geology, micromorphological study of sediments, magnetic studies of burned rocks to evaluate
the context of burned rock features, magnetic susceptibility of sediments to help identify soils in the
higher levels and help interpret pit features. Several
conjoined stone tools are illustrated in the monograph but it is not clear why refitting studies were
not employed to further evaluate horizontal spatial
patterning and post-depositional vertical movement.
I suspect the sheer volume of artifacts and data
recovered may have precluded these approaches
for this report, but I suggest future researchers
should consider systematic refitting studies of the
Wilson-Leonard collection (especially the Clovis
and Wilson components and the Bone Bed) to enhance the interpretation of the site.
Studies of resource exploitation patterns include
investigating the procurement and processing of
plants, animals, and minerals. Approaches to the lithic
assemblage include documenting spatial and temporal patterns of raw material use; technology of manufacture; form of objects; patterns of discard, wear
(three independent investigations of microscopic usewear were undertaken), refurbishing and recycling;
and testing for preservation of residues, both inorganic and organic (lipids and sterols).
Beginning around 8,700 years ago, people conducted intensive bulk processing of plant foods at
the site using hot rock cooking techniques. The
study of food processing technology focuses on the
evidence of these hot rock cooking features from
the Holocene occupations. "Capacity planning models" are used to suggest large cooking features were

Reviews

used to prepare large packets of food in an effort to
reduce the per unit costs of food processing. Although this microeconomic logic may provide a
robust behavioral explanation of the increasing size
of these cooking features, it still begs the question
of how we can distinguish bulk processing for immediate consumption versus storage.
Paul Goldberg and Vance Holliday discuss the
site stratigraphy and lithostratigraphy in Chapter 6
of Volume 1. While the TxDOT work was largely
soil-geographic in nature, the subsequent TARL
work sought to address the complex superimposition of depositional and post-depositional processes
(i.e., the geologic, soil forming, biological, and human influences). Difficulties in correlating the results of these two excavations and the contrasting
approaches to stratigraphic classification and description of the deposits are made clear in this chapter. Numerous photos (including color plates) and
extensive drawings document stratigraphic profiles
of the excavated area over six meters deep and 45
meters long and 12 meters wide. In addition, an
expansive soil coring program was conducted,
which contributed to interpretations of landform
evolution. Several chemical and physical analyses
were also conducted on the sediments. These investigations reveal phosphate concentration is highest in the burned rock midden areas, while isotopic
analysis of oxygen-18 and carbon-13 is used to
demonstrate that popcorn carbonates found in Stratum Isl (dated around 11,500 to 10,600-10,000 years
B.P.) are pedogenic in origin and produced by an
ancient cienega rather than by high groundwater.
Rapid silty alluvial sedimentation follows the
cienega up to about 9,500 years ago when a period
of surface stability is indicated by the Leanne soil.
A shift in the geomorphic regime is indicated by
Unit II (beginning around 9,500 B.P.) when the
depositional sequence indicates a notable contribution of slope erosion sheetwash and colluvium. Unit
III is similar to Unit II but contains significant
anthropogenic influence (burned rock features and
organic-rich soils), which begins around 8,870 B.P.
with periodic peaks of intensity around 8,600, 6,250,
and 4,000 years ago. These deposits reveal additional periods of surface stability and soil formation around 7,000 years ago (the Stiba soil) and
from present to 4,000 years ago (the WilsonLeonard soil).
The Early Paleoindian components are discussed by Collins in Chapter 7 of the first volume.

117

At least two distinct cultural components
containing fauna and lithic remains are identified
in this three-meter thick deposit. Clovis artifacts
are associated with the lower component while
the single projectile point from the 11,000-11,500
year old Bone Bed is intriguing because it appears
technologically similar to Folsom but typologically
similar to Plainview/Goshen. Materials found in
the upper levels of the Early Paleoindian deposits
(between the Bone Bed and the Wilson component)
are not assigned to a specific cultural complex
because of mixing and lack of coherent technological patterning. Some Clovis objects are also
found above the Clovis component and Clovis and
Midland points are found together in even younger
deposits. This evidence from a Late Pleistocene
site with good stratigraphic separation may suggest
cultural complexity was much greater in Early
Paleoindian times than assumed by unilineal
models of stylistic and cultural change.
Notably, two bone processing features were
identified in the Early Paleoindian component: one
is a core and hammerstone with bone splinters associated with the Clovis component and the second
contains 63+ bone fragments with charcoal and
lithic debitage. This second feature is associated
with the Bone Bed component, which appears to
represent the edge of an extensive unexcavated bone
bed. A domestic area with a possible hearth is located near the edge of the Bone Bed, which is
described as a "modest concentration of bison bones
and artifacts found in and around a swale (p. 146)."
Analysis reveals a broad range of fauna in the Bone
Bed with at least 18 different species represented.
Many of these bones are splintered by human modification, weathering and erosion. The Early
Paleoindian lithic assemblage contains 8,438 waste
flakes, 5 burin spalls and 1 blade; 76 unifaces; 74
tools on flakes or blades; 51 bifaces; 26 cores or
core tools; 6 battered stones; 4 projectile points; 3
unanalyzed stone tools; 2 gravers; l Clear Fork
tool; 1 hammerstone; 1 mano; 2 pieces of worked
hematite; 4 chert cobbles; and 4 pieces of sandstone. Complex but effective diagrams (Figures 7-3
and 7-4) are used to report material distribution
patterns. Detailed analyses of the lithic assemblage
are presented in Volumes 2 and 3. Collins uses the
Early Paleoindian evidence at Wilson-Leonard to
suggest greater diversity in material culture and
subsistence behavior than previously recognized
(also see Chapter 11).

In Chapter 8, Bousman reports on the Late
Paleoindian occupations at the site and describes the
approximately 9,500 to 10,000 year old Wilson occupations associated with the Leanne soil. At least
two Wilson occupations are identified in the upper
portion of Unit I and this site contains the first
evidence of the Wilson component in a buried and
datable context (31 radiocarbon dates were derived
frorn this stratum). Diagnostic identification of this
earliest Holocene cultural phase is recognized by
distinctive stemmed Wilson projectile points appearing to be geographically confined to South Texas.
It is not clear why this local type is not compared to
similar (but slightly later) early Holocene cornernotched forms associated with the Southeast (Kirk
cluster) and the Midwest (Thebes cluster). Interestingly, numerous and diverse forms of narrow lanceolate points, most of which are traditionally
considered Late Paleoindian types (e.g., GolondrinaBarber, St. Mary's Hall, Angostura), are found mixed
in Unit II, which overlies the Wilson components
found in Unit I. The overlying Unit II stratum produced 11 radiocarbon dates and this deposit appears
to range from 8,400 to 9 ,500 years old. Paleoenvironmental evidence suggests two brief grassy periods
associated with the Leanne soil in the upper portion
of Unit I (and the Wilson occupations), but climate
during deposition of Unit II (and the narrow lanceolate occupations) appears to have been more
xeric resulting in a more grassy environment and
shift from oak to oak-juniper forest.
This remarkable record of Late Pleistocene and
Early Holocene cultures and environments at
Wilson-Leonard makes a significant contribution
in questioning how archeologists should distinguish
Paleoindian frorn Archaic. The Wilson component
and subsequent narrow lanceolate components
described in Chapter 8 are arguably Early Archaic
because as Bousman puts it, "shift to the exploitation
of Holocene faunas was fully complete (p. 161)."
So what defines the term Paleoindian? Does it
require association with extinct Pleistocene fauna
or the lifeway of big game hunting? Is it simply any
occupation prior to 10,000 years ago (the geologic
definition of the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary)?
Or is it a cultural tradition defined by artifact styles,
tool types and technological organization? The
important question of what distinguishes Paleoindian from Archaic is addressed again by Collins
in Chapter 9 where he suggests that Archaic
occupations at Wilson-Leonard are distinguished

by the advent of earth-oven cooking technology.
Although the evidence from Wilson-Leonard shows
that it is not easy to answer this question, it is
important it be raised. In fact, many archeologists
in the Great Basin have now adopted the term
"Paleoarchaic," a trend probably reflecting increased
recognition of continuity in the cultural evolution
of many Paleoindian and Archaic hunter-gatherers
in the New World.
The bewildering diversity of unfluted lanceolate
and Early Archaic bifurcate stem points found in the
Late Paleoindian assemblage is summarized by multivariate statistical analysis of metric and qualitative
attributes. This thorough and thoughtful morphological analysis and numerical classification is presented in Chapter 14 of Volume 2 (authored by
Anne C. Ken and Susan W. Dial). Observations
used in this analysis focused on the basal portions of
points to minimize the effects of morphological
modifications resulting from use, resharpening and
rejuvenation (but not the potential effects of
rebasing). Ken and Dial use a sample of 182 unfluted
lanceolate points from Wilson-Leonard and several
related sites to suggest 21 morphological clusters
and 4 outliers, while their sample of 102 bifurcated
stem points from Wilson-Leonard is reduced to at
least 11 clusters. Ken and Dial (p. 491) state a
cluster solution that could "achieve the most meaningful balance between segregation and aggregation" was chosen. Although clustering dendrograms
are illustrated, the Euclidean distances separating
cluster solutions are not provided. Use of a scree test
or some other objective method of determining the
cluster solution would have been preferable. Nonetheless, numerical taxonomy of projectile points
seems to have fallen out of vogue and I am pleased
to see this application of what is still a useful technique of investigating morphological diversity. Yet
I am unclear how much of the variation among these
points has been resolved, because the resulting clusters are apparently interpreted as distinctive morphological forms rather than variation within one or
more types. In addition, as the authors note, this
kind of morphological analysis does not consider
information about learned traditions (and cultural or
ethnic markers) more likely recorded in the techniques and grammar of production.
More problematic is the question of how one
Midland and one Clovis point come to occur in
Units I/II and II/III, respectively. These artifact
forms are generally believed to date earlier than

Reviews
these stratigraphic units at Wilson-Leonard. Figure
8-7 illustrates complex mixing and interdigitation
of the archeological components at the site. What
are the mechanisms for what appears to be "mixing" of temporal markers in some strata (especially
Unit II)? Are these aiiifacts actually contemporaneous with the younger deposits? Are there unrecognized post-depositional disturbances at the site
accounting for these apparent anomalies? Or were
they older artifacts scavenged or recycled by later
occupants? For example, as Bousman (p. 184) notes,
"A great amount of recycling occurs especially
among the projectile points."
Bousman (p. 174) also suggests Wilson peoples
employed a more expendable strategy of stone tool
manufacture than the later Unit II occupants who
did not leave much debris. Alternatively, this contrast might also be explained by differences in depositional histories, site sampling and the distribution
of prehistoric activities, and variation in occupation
length and character. The lack of features and definable occupation floors in Unit II suggests an
unstable surface and the proportional increase in
complete projectile points and distal fragments of
points may reflect shorter occupations, which lack
retooling activities.
Interestingly, Unit II contains notched stones
(Waco sinkers) indicating continuity with the
regional Archaic subsistence technology of net
fishing or net hunting. However, the Late Paleoindian
faunal remains show a reduction in the number of
species compared to the underlying Unit I deposits,
which may suggest the narrowing of diet breadth or
environmental responses to climate change at the
beginning of the Holocene. Although a diversity of
animals are found in these Early Holocene deposits,
there is a general decline in small fauna with deer
replacing bison as the common large mammal prey,
less-intensive bone processing methods are used,
and there is a shift toward aquatic animal exploitation
in the upper portion of Unit II. The Late Paleoindian
deposits also contain 39 burned rock features, 2 or 3
pit features, and a flexed burial associated with a
limestone stab, groundstone tool (mano reworked as
chopper), and fossil shark tooth. Bousman (p. 196)
notes, "The distribution of burned rock feature types
does not demonstrate any significant patterns through
time at Wilson-Leonard," although comparison of
Unit I versus Unit II shows an increase through time
in the average number of rocks per feature and the
average size of features. Magnetic analysis of the

119

burned rock features indicated that most (9 of 11)
cooled in place and have remained in place. Spatial
analysis of the contents of these excavation units
was conducted making isopleth maps of artifact and
faunal density as well as cluster analysis of
excavation block contents defining clustered coassociations of material types.
The entire span of Archaic components (ca.
8800-1300 B.P.) appear to be represented at Wilson-Leonard and includes 167 burned rock features
(most of which likely represent simple hearths), 3
burned sediment features, 3 burned sediment and
rock features, 2 burned rock middens, 2 partial burials, and 1 lithic artifact cluster. There is a notable
absence of evidence for posts, pits and caches, which
seems to suggest a lack of investment in housing or
storage facilities at the site. Nearly 500,000 artifacts of stone, bone and shell are assigned to these
Archaic occupations. The vast majority of this artifact assemblage is lithic debris and despite proximity to Edwards chert outcrops, there are relatively
few cores. About half of these artifacts and more
than half of the features are attributed to Early
Archaic occupations. The Archaic deposits are complex and these cultural components often appear
mixed. Consequently, the authors focus on understanding burned rock midden formation rather than
culture history. A driving issue is the question of
why people continue building cooking facilities in
exactly the same place for hundreds and thousands
of years. It is proposed that formation processes
indicate: 1) large earth ovens coalesce into burned
rock middens; 2) small discrete fireplaces do not
coalesce in this manner; and 3) subsistence activities maintained through the use of earth ovens differ from those of the small, discrete hearths.
Early Archaic occupations at Wilson-Leonard
are seen to show continuity with the Late
Paleoindian occupations in similarity of projectile
point forms, use of small-medium hearths, diverse
subsistence base, and increasing consumption of
fish. The major discontinuity appearing to distinguish the Early Archaic pattern is use of earth ovens to cook geophytes. Procurement and earth oven
processing of camas (wild hyacinth) bulbs, as well
as other secondary plant and animal foods, is proposed as the primary focus of Archaic activities at
the site. These roasting events began during the
Early Archaic at Wilson-Leonard and include preserved hyacinth bulbs radiocarbon dated as early
8,250 Â± 80 years B.P. Middle Archaic occupations

120

Texas Archeological Society

are comparatively sparse and not well-isolated
stratigraphically, but the Late Archaic occupations
are substantial. However, the archeological information gleaned from these Late Archaic deposits is
limited by compressed stratigraphy and intermixing with the overlying and underlying components.
Identifiable Late Archaic features include Burial 1,
a disturbed grave with other scattered human bones
nearby; an apparent cache of three bifaces; and
numerous burned rock features.
Site activities are consistent throughout the
Archaic and they appear to be distinct from patterns seen at some other Archaic sites in the region. From these and other observations, Collins
proposes that certain localities (like WilsonLeonard), "were the focus of specific subsistence
activities for very long periods of time and that
these activities varied between localities (p. 211)."
Specifically, the authors conclude that Archaic activities at Wilson-Leonard are focused on the procurement and processing of perennial camas root
crops using rock-filled earth-oven cooking methods. These onion-like camas bulbs are rich with
inulin, a nondigestible polysaccharide in raw form,
which is converted into a highly nutritious food
through such cooking. These activities were most
likely conducted during the spring, although the
faunal and floral remains indicate a mix of other
activities and seasons of occupation occurred at
the site. Collins suggests the Archaic evidence at
Wilson-Leonard underscores the role of a principal resource in "determining where and when it
and nearby resources are exploited (p.262)." This
proposition should provide a very useful hypothesis in the continuing analysis of Archaic settlement and subsistence patterns in Central Texas.
A relatively thin, surficial archeological deposit
of Late Prehistoric occupations is also present at
Wilson-Leonard. This horizon is mostly confined
to the upper portion of Unit IIIc and concentrated
upslope from the crest of what is known as Burned
Rock Midden 1. Two burned rock features are
attributed to the Late Prehistoric occupations but
these younger remains do not appear to be very
involved in the burned rock midden formation at
the site. Although one ceramic sherd and 94 Late
Prehistoric arrow points and preforms were found,
there is some mixing of these younger deposits
with the underlying Late Archaic component.
Interestingly, the on-site activities of these Late
Prehistoric inhabitants appears to have differed from

the Archaic pattern, but poor context and mixing
lead Collins to conclude that Wilson-Leonard "adds
little to our understanding of the late prehistory of
the region (p. 276)."
In Chapter 11, which is the concluding chapter
of the first volume, Collins summarizes the major
results from this investigation of the WilsonLeonard site. He notes more than a dozen points
where significant contributions have been made
from this study. Many of these contributions are
noted in this review but include a few more worth
mentioning. First, Wilson-Leonard contains a small
lithic assemblage of very early Clovis or perhaps
pre-Clovis occupation at the base of the cultural
sequence, which is radiocarbon dated about 11,400
to 11,500 years old. In addition, the complexity of
the overlying Paleoindian and Early Archaic sequence appears to defy simplistic models of culture
history with suggestions of contemporaneous cultural diversity, including overlapping and intergrading traditions. Many Late Paleoindian unfluted
lanceolate points previously attributed to what has
become the catch-all type of Plainview are proposed to represent a distinctive but previously undefined type called St. Mary's Hall dating about
one thousand years later than Plainview. Furthermore, Golondrina and Barber, two unfluted lanceolate types previously considered distinctive, are
shown to be morphologically related with a single
category. Similar morphological continuity is demonstrated for several Early Archaic bifurcate
stemmed forms. Finally, the Wilson component is
used to define a previously unrecognized Early Archaic horizon extending throughout South Texas.
Volume 2: Chipped Stone Artifacts contains
Chapters 12-18 with 285 tables and 244 figures and
the list of references cited. An introductory chapter
is written by Collins and Susan W. Dial concerning
the cultural materials discussed in this volume.
Dial's lithic aitifact analyses dominate this volume,
which includes contributed chapters on projectile
points (Susan W. Dial, Anne C. Kerr, and Michael
B. Collins); statistical analysis ofunfluted lanceolate

and tested and unmodified chert materials (Susan
W. Dial and Michael B. Collins).

Volume 3: Artifacts and Special Artifact Studies contains Chapters 19-23 with 41 tables and 123
figures, references cited, and Appendices 1-5. This
volume consists of detailed material culture analyses including contributed chapters on debitage
analysis (Marilyn A. Masson), ground and other
nonchipped stone artifacts (Lauren A. Sullivan),
modified bone and shell (Leslie C. Shaw),
microwear analysis of chipped stone artifacts
(Marvin Kay, Dale B. Hudler, Boyce N. Driskell,
and Michael B. Collins), residue analyses (W. Jeffrey Hurst, Curt W. Beck, Edith C. Stout, Jonathan
Bingham, and Michael B. Collins). The most substantial contribution here is from Marvin Kay who
found microscopic wear traces on 64 of the 122
lithic artifacts he examined. The thoughtful analysis in this well-documented study reaches beyond
functional classification of individual tools. Kay
defines patterning among different tool types that
can be attributed to design principles and economic
constraints. Chronological trends in the design of
these tool types suggest interesting shifts in the
organizational strategies of work and stone tool
manufacture and use.
Volume 4: Archeological Features and Technical Analyses contains Chapters 24-29 with 51 tables
and 264 figures, references cited, and Appendices 6
and 7. Collins contributes an introductory chapter
concerning the contextually oriented studies contained in this volume including contributed chapters on radiocarbon chronostratigraphy (Thomas W.
Stafford, Jr.), cultural and noncultural features (Jan
Guy), archeomagnetic analysis of burned limestone
rocks (Paul R. Takac ), magnetic susceptibility of
sediments (Paul R. Takac and Wulf A. Gose), and
micromorphological analysis of sediments (Paul
Goldberg). Organic remains, including charcoal, are
not particularly well-preserved at Wilson-Leonard
despite impressive efforts taken by the TARL team
to increase their rates of recovery. Consequently,
one of the most remarkable contributions of this
project was Stafford's ability to produce a solid
radiocarbon chronology at the site. Although adopting this costly approach will require archeologists
to reassess their traditional allocation of project
funds, it represents a revolutionary step forward in
our ability to investigate archeological site formation and chronology. Another very noteworthy contribution in this volume is Takac' s careful
archeomagnetic study of burned limestone, which
provides impressive reconstructions of the thermal

121

history and complex taphonomy of burned rock
features. Among his remarkable findings, most of
the rocks in Burned Rock Midden 1 appear to have
cooled in place and been only minimally disturbed
afterwards. This conclusion contradicts assumptions
that burned rock middens are largely composed of
rocks that are secondary, detrital deposits.
Volume 5: Special Studies contains Chapters
30-42 with 80 tables and 40 figures, references
cited, and Appendices 8-10. An introductory chapter is written by Bousman concerning the largely
paleoecological investigations contained in this volume including contributed chapters on human skeletal remains (D. Gentry Steele), stable isotopic
analysis (Diane Wilson), vertebrate fauna (BatTy
W. Baker), fine screening methods (Susan Decker),
microvertebrate fauna (Robin Balinsky), eggshell
analysis (Susan Decker), the molluscan paleoassemblage (Leslie C. Shaw, Raymond W. Neck,
James L. Theler, and Michael B. Collins), diatom
analysis (Barbara Winsborough), ostracod remains
(Marion J. Henry, Mervin Kontrovitz, and Jerry
Marie Slack), carbonized plant remains (J. Philip
Dering), phytolith analysis (Glen Fredlund), and
stable caiÂ·bon isotope analysis of soil organic matter (Glen Fredlund and Larry L. Tieszen). Most
impressive here is the remarkable recovery and identification of extremely fragile faunal remains (bird
eggshell) from the site. These eggshell fragments
were found in the 1/8 and 1/16 inch mesh residues
from water screening and classified on the basis of
comparative shell thickness.
As pointed out by Collins in Chapter 11
(Volume 1), the cultural sequence in Central Texas
differs from surrounding regions in that prehistoric
hunter-gatherer societies neither developed nor
adopted the characteristic traits of formative
lifeways (e.g., horticulture, ceramics, sedentism,
nondomestic earthwork construction). Importantly,
Collins uses the archeological evidence from
Wilson-Leonard to address the meaning of
"Archaic" and to explore the difficulties of making
extra-regional comparisons. In particular, he frames
the critical issue of why there appear to be no
changes nor movements toward formative lifeways
seen in the prehistoric record of Central Texas.
Although it is not possible to answer this question,
Collins offers some thoughtful observations on this
big issue. First, the prehistoric record of huntergatherers in Central Texas does not support those
who have suggested the adoption of formative

122

Texas Archeological Society

lifeways results from internal causes in response to
risk or stress. Neither does this record support those
who seek external causes for the appearance of
formative lifeways because prehistoric inhabitants
of Central Texas do not appear to have been isolated
from the formative cultures of surrounding regions.
Finally, Collins notes that environmental or climatic
limitations cannot explain the failure of formative
lifeways to catch on in Central Texas. After all, it
was no drier than the American Southwest where
substantial investment in horticulture and formative
lifeways appeared. In contrast, the prehistoric
inhabitants of Central Texas appear to have lacked
the need and interest in adopting formative patterns
of behavior. These observations lead him to
question whether formative traits are possible
without a horticultural subsistence base and what
the potential role of food storage may have been
for the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of Central
Texas. Investigation of these issues can provide
prehistoric archeologists working in Central Texas
with a fruitful research direction for addressing
some critical questions in hunter-gatherer ecology
and evolution.

For those who are serious researchers of burned
rock middens, prehistoric hunter-gatherers, and Early
Paleoindian and Central Texas archeology, this fivevolume set provides an essential resource. Despite
the massive size of this multi-volume monograph,
there are relatively few typographic errors or citation omissions. Collins and his colleagues are to be
congratulated for accomplishing this demanding task.
One minor criticism is that several of the digital
images (produced by scanner or digital camera) provided as figures appear grainy and the use of original photographic images would have been an
improvement. Although some shorter articles about
Wilson-Leonard are already available, I urge the
authors to continue publishing papers that are accessible for those who are unable or unwilling to tackle
this comprehensive but daunting site rep01t. Better
yet, I recommend the authors consider preparation
and publication of a book length monograph about
one-tenth the size of this tome. I believe many academic book publishers should be interested and am
certain that prehistoric archeologists throughout the
world would find the analysis and synthesis from
this unique site to be very valuable.

After Slavery: The Rubin Hancock Farmstead, 1880-1916, Travis County, Texas, by Marie E. Blake
and Teri Myers. Reports of Investigations, Number 124, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., and Archeology Studies Program, Report 19, Texas Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs
Division, 1999. viii+ 124 pp.

Reviewed by Shawn B. Carlson

This report chronicles the life of Rubin
Hancock, an emancipated slave, who owned property just north of Austin, Texas, during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His small
farmstead is examined in various contexts, i.e., as
an owner-occupied farmstead, as part of a rural
African American community, and as part of a larger
trade network extending from Austin to other parts
of the United States.
In a joint effort by Blake and Moore, the report
pulls together data from a 1987 testing and data
recovery project conducted by John W. Clark, Jr.
for the Texas State Department of Highways and
Public Transportation, now the Texas Department
of Transportation, that was never completed.
Though some historical research and oral histories
were done at the time of the excavation, additional
research was conducted for this report.
In the first chapter, Blake outlines the objectives of the report, drawing upon the previous studies at this National Register eligible site. The four
objectives she defines include production of the
technical report, development of a curriculum unit
for use in the public schools, analysis of a prehistoric component of the site, and preparation of the
project materials for curation.
The second chapter outlines the history of the
project, detailing the survey, testing, and data recovery methods and touching upon the archival
research and oral history interviews. Descriptions
of the fieldwork note that 79 5-x-5 ft units and
three trenches were excavated and 9,086 artifacts
recovered from the historic component of the site.
Chapter 3 is a detailed historical account written by Teri Myers. She begins by explaining her
research methods and tracing the chain of title for
the site. Next, she documents the members of
Rubin Hancock's family and explores the slaveto-slave owner relationship between Hancock, his
three brothers, and their half-brother/owner, John

Hancock, a prominent Travis County judge. Following emancipation, the four Hancock brothers
purchased property in northern Travis County
where a small African American community subsequently developed. Myers discusses their property ownership in the context of surrounding
communities and the development of those communities through the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.
A number of cultural features were recorded at
the site and are described in Chapter 4. The more
prominent features included a hand-dug stone-lined
well, a drilled well, and a chimney hearth and house
foundation. Other features were fences and fence
lines, yard and garden areas, a dog burial, trash
dumps, outbuilding foundations, and a pit feature.
All are thoroughly described with accompanying
maps and photographs.
In Chapter 5, Blake describes the artifacts, beginning with an explanation of the methods used
given that the collection required some reorganization. She provides both descriptive and functional
discussions of the artifacts, complimenting them
with contextual information.
The final chapter of the report examines site
structure looking at both features and artifact patterning. A discussion of consumer behavior places
the Hancock assemblage in a broader context as
does the discussion of intersite comparisons. Overall, the report satisfies the goals that were set forth
in the introductory chapter.
After Slavery is a well-written, well-documented report that deserves a broader audience
than the cultural resource management community. This has partly been addressed through the
development of a seventh-grade curriculum unit
on archaeology. However, the quality of data available for this site is unusual and should be made
available to other professionals researching African American archaeology.

Reviewed by Stephen H. Lekson

The Ojasen and Gobernadora sites are two small
Jornada Mogollon pithouse sites just north of El
Paso Texas. After a somewhat complicated history
of earlier research, the two sites were mitigated in
1981 in advance of a highway project. Using a
variety of techniques, the Ojasen site was dated to
A.D. 1000 to 1150, and the Gobernadora site was
dated to A.D. 1000 to 1200; both were assigned to
the Dona Ana Phase. The authors argue that both
sites were winter occupations. The main emphasis
of the reported research, undertaken ten years after
the fieldwork, was descriptive; but secondary
themes included site structure, lithic analysis, ceramic analyses of various kinds, analysis of subsistence and settlement patterns, and a discussion of
the broader socio-cultural context of these two
sites-tasks for which the authors are extremely
well qualified.
Features located at the Ojasen site included
two to four surface concentrations, two pithouses,
three hearth/ovens, and 17 pits. Features located at
the Gobernadora site included four to six pithouses,
three hearth/ovens, three FCR scatters, 15 pits, a
midden, and one burial.
Site structure analysis recognized a "core
residential area at each site that hints of a linear
(Ojasen) and semicircular (Gobernadora) pattern of
structures. While in general, the lithic industries are
expedient, the analysis suggests that "expedient
tools can be multifunctional," and that useful local
raw materials "negated the need to import large
amounts of raw materials." Several very interesting
ceramic analyses included typology and vessel form,
and more specialized analyses of El Paso brownware
rim form and neutron activation analysis of imported
Mimbres Black-on-white. The latter analysis

concluded that, contrary to earlier reports, Mimbres
Black-on-white found in these Jornada Mogollon
sites was not made in the Rio Grande Valley or in
the Jornada area. Floral remains were dominated by
wild plant resources; corn was only a minor element
of the floral remains. Cottontails and jackrabbits
were the most abundant faunal remains, but larger
game animals were also present, including
pronghorn, deer and mountain sheep. The authors
conclude that both sites were occupied by small
mobile bands that used corn only as a minor element
in a hunter-gatherer economy. The sites were fallwinter loci that were repeatedly re-occupied for
those seasons. The considerable Mimbres expertise
represented by the authors appears to good purpose
in the suggestion that, based on Mimbres Black-onwhite ceramics in the two sites, "Jornada people
may have been visiting the large Mimbres towns to
observe plaza ceremonies and participate in
feasting" not unlike Navajo visits to Pueblo
ceremonies today.
The report is well produced and edited, in 8.5 x
11 inch format. The graphics are clear and tables
are well organized and readable. Some data are
presented on a floppy disk, attached, in Excel database formats.
The report is an excellent example of the utility of CRM data, competently recovered and recorded, in addressing changing questions and
research themes. The fieldwork was undertaken in
1981; the reported research was begun in 1991.
The result is a very useful, very professional report with both local and regional implications.
The archaeology of the Jornada region and southern New Mexico will benefit from the research
and this excellent publication.
