This report documents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Blanton &
Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) between February 8 and 10, 2007, for the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) El Paso District. The project consisted of a one hundred percent pedestrian
survey of approximately 3,200 feet of right-of-way (ROW) for the proposed Biggs East Gate Road, as
well as an approximately 600-foot by 450-foot adjacent retention pond. Both facilities would be
components of the larger El Paso Inner Loop (Inner Loop) project in El Paso, Texas. During the survey
two previously unrecorded prehistoric archeological sites (41EP5919 and 41EP5920) were discovered.
The sites were highly deflated and disturbed and, therefore, Blanton & Associates recommends that the
proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations. No
archeological materials were collected during this survey and there was no curation.

This report documents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Blanton &
Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) between February 8 and 10, 2007, for the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) El Paso District. The project consisted of a one hundred percent pedestrian
survey of approximately 3,200 feet of right-of-way (ROW) for the proposed Biggs East Gate Road, as
well as an approximately 600-foot by 450-foot adjacent retention pond. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) covers approximately 7.9 acres. Both facilities would be components of the larger El Paso Inner
Loop (Inner Loop) project in El Paso, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
The TxDOT El Paso District proposes to construct a six-lane, urban expressway that would provide
access from northeast El Paso to east El Paso. The approximately 10.18 miles project area extends from
the intersection of US 54 and Fred Wilson Road; progresses eastward to Airport Road and then southeast
to follow Founders Boulevard/Walter Jones Drive; crosses a small area of El Paso International Airport
(EPIA) property south of Biggs Army Airfield, as well as Fort Bliss property along the northern edge of
the ROW; and terminates at SL 375. The proposed construction would include the development of
military-secure two-lane privately-owned vehicle (POV) road and/or a parallel two-lane Tactical Vehicle
Road (TVR) for military use from roads adjacent to the Inner Loop and Airport Road. These roads would
proceed through Biggs Army Airfield to the proposed Future Road, and south into EPIA property via an
overpass. The linear project area and has been divided into five contiguous phases that include, in
sequential order, CSJs: 0924-06-194, 0924-06-267, 0924-06-097, 0924-06-xxx, and 0167-01-090. (The
CSJ for Phase IV is currently being determined by TxDOT.) In 2005, Blanton & Associates conducted an
intensive archeological survey of the proposed project area.
Since the original archeological survey, design changes to Phase II (CSJ: 0924-06-267) of the project
resulted in the relocation of the proposed Biggs East Gate Road and an adjacent retention pond. As
planned, Biggs East Gate Road would be a POV road located on EPIA property that would extend
approximately 3,200 feet east from Future Road before terminating at an existing north-south trending
EPIA road. The proposed Biggs East Gate Road ROW would be 108 feet wide and contain a four-lane
divided roadway with a raised median, sidewalks, and bike lanes. The interior lanes would be 14 feet
wide and the two outside lanes would be 12 feet wide. The raised median would be 24 feet wide, the two
bike lanes would be six feet wide, and the sidewalks would be five feet wide.
During the 2005 archeological survey, a previously unknown prehistoric site was observed outside of the
APE. This site is now located within the proposed new ROW location for Biggs East Gate Road. Based
on the known presence of a previously undocumented prehistoric site within the new proposed ROW, as
well as the density of previously recorded sites in this area, it was determined that an archeological survey
should be conducted within the new location for Biggs East Gate Road, as well as the adjacent proposed
retention pond, prior to the proposed highway construction.
As the project would occur on property that is owned or will be owned by the State of Texas and
administered by TxDOT, the proposed construction is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the

necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and
requires that any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions
that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) administers the
code’s provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by
the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. The current project was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 4411 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the highway construction will come in part from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction projects are also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies. Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that
depends on site significance as defined by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the
ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section 106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review
and concurrence by the involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented
in Texas by the THC.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all cultural resources discovered within the proposed Areas of Potential Effect (APEs), evaluate their
potential eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant
cultural resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options
such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

The Biggs East Gate Road is located in the Hueco Bolson of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin
and Range Province (Figure 3). The Bolson is characterized by intermontane basins separating northsouth trending mountain ranges. The project corridor traverses the nearly level to undulating basin that is
bounded by the Franklin Mountains on the west and the Hueco Mountains on the east. It is believed that
the Hueco Bolson originally supported semi-desert grasslands prior to overgrazing since the eighteenth
century.
The project area consists largely of coppice dunes within the secure boundary of EPIA. Man-made
impacts in the area include a Kinder-Morgan high-pressure gas line that bisects the survey area running
north to south, El Paso Water Utilities (EPWU) water wells that are located on both the east and west
ends of the project area, 8-inch water lines that connect each well, and military traffic (armored tanks and
other tracked vehicles) that once used the area for maneuvers. In addition to these impacts, EPWU
periodically flushes their wells, which involves the discharge of tens of thousands of gallons of water into
the nearby dunes. The results of this discharge are man-made drainages that are eroded deeply into the
caliche substrate in several parts of the project area.
Natural impacts mainly consist of intensive eolian action that has formed coppice dune fields. By their
nature, dune fields have both aggraded and deflated areas. Regionally, prehistoric archeological sites are
commonly found in the deflated areas between dunes where the sand has been blown away to expose a
palimpsest of prehistoric artifacts on the harder caliche substratum. Since deflated areas are adjacent to
nearly every dune, archaeologists are afforded a window into the subsurface potential for buried sites in
the adjacent aggraded sands. The majority of the project area is deflated with nodules of the ancient
caliche substratum exposed on the ground surface. The excellent subsurface exposure offered by
interdunal areas allowed archeologists to excavate judgmental shovel tests in appropriate areas. Thus, to
determine if buried sites were present in the survey area, shovel tests and trowel probes focused on areas
with aggraded sands, especially those adjacent to surface artifacts.

Three geologic units are mapped within the project area and include Quaternary (Holocene) Windblown
sand, Young Quaternary (Holocene) lacustrine and fluviatile deposits, and Young Quaternary (Holocene)
colluvium and fans. The project area is mapped as Windblown sand with possible dunes (Barnes 1983).
SOI L S
Soils throughout the project area belong to the Turney-Berino association, undulating, and the HuecoWink association, hummocky. The proposed Biggs East Gate Road corridor consists of the Hueco-Wink
soil association, which consists of nearly level to gently sloping soils with fine sandy loam subsoil that
are moderately deep over caliche (Jaco 1971).
V E G E T A T I ON
It is believed that the Hueco Bolson originally supported semidesert grasslands prior to overgrazing since
the eighteenth century. Modern flora is described as a Mesquite/Broom snakeweed association. The
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) allows the formation of coppice dunes that rise 0.5 to 2.0 meters above
the desert floor. Four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescans) is typically associated with the dunal
formations, while interdunal areas tend to support broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and
Sporobolis spp. Less dominant vegetation includes creosote (Larrea tridentate), yucca (Yucca elata), and
prickly pear (Oppuntia spp.).

The Hueco Bolson contains numerous fault line depressions that have been commonly referred to as
playas. This is a misleading conception because overall most of the depressions do not retain surface
water. However, they may be a source of ground water for a short period of time following periods of
heavy rain.
C UL T UR A L B A C K G R OUND
The overall cultural region was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) in his study of the Jornada Branch of
the Mogollon. The following presents a summary of the commonly accepted periods and phases of
occupation in the Jornada and adjacent regions. The cultural chronology for the region has been addressed
by various investigators.
PA L E OI NDI A N PE R I OD
Lithic artifacts found in the area suggest that early occupations in the El Paso area date to the late
Pleistocene/early Holocene between approximately 10,000 and 6000 B.C., although MacNeish's (1991)
work at Pendejo Cave suggests evidence of earlier occupations. Diagnostic point types of later and betterdocumented periods found within the El Paso area, such as Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and Plainview (all
dated from other regional contexts) provide strong support for late Pleistocene occupations (Whalen 1977,
1978). Unfortunately, natural processes have either buried or destroyed most archeological evidence from
this time period, and therefore, relatively little is known about late Pleistocene lifeways in the El Paso
area. Based on comparative evidence from archeological sites of the same period in other areas, the
general social and economic organization of Late Pleistocene populations appears to be characterized by
small, mobile bands subsisting predominantly on large game supplemented with the utilization of wild
plant resources (Cordell 1984, Carmichael 1986a).
A R C H A I C PE R I OD
Evidence of increasing cultural complexity among the prehistoric inhabitants of the El Paso area is based
on the excavations of relatively well-preserved Archaic period cave sites dating from 6000 to 2300 B.C.
in the mountain region (MacNeish 1989a, 1991; Phillips 1990). Archeologists have found evidence of
basketry, bone and woodworking, including the introduction of the atlatl, which demonstrates an increase
in technological complexity. Additionally, the recovery of possible digging sticks as well as groundstone,
important in plant processing, combined with palynological evidence for increased reliance on plant
products suggest that people in the area experimented with horticulture and plant domestication by the
second or first millennium B.C.
MacNeish (1989a, 1989b, 1991) proposed that the Archaic period should be subdivided into four separate
phases. The Gardner Springs phase (ca. 6000±500 to 4300±300 B.C.) is characterized as a “simple
scheduled seasonal-round settlement pattern organized around a few very small groups. In essence, these
Archaic people were probably foragers engaged in hunting, animal collecting or trapping, and plant
collecting” (MacNeish 1991:685). People lived mainly in small ephemeral camps on the desert floor or
around the playas there, with a few living in mountain rock shelters such as Fresnal shelter.

The Keystone phase (ca. 4300±300 to 2500±200 B.C.) is proposed as an outgrowth of the Gardner
Springs phase, with a continuation of small, microband camps and task force sites but with the notable
addition of large pithouse sites such as the Keystone Dam Site (O’Laughlin 1980) along the Rio Grande.
These sites appear to have been occupied during winter, but they may also have been bases for excursions
into other microenvironments during the spring, summer, and fall. MacNeish notes that this period
“reveals a subtle shift toward a more efficient desert foraging subsistence system as well as a possible
exploitation of more desert plants from more ecozones” (MacNeish 1989b:689). This may correspond to a
shift in the Chihuahuan Desert fauna and flora.
The Fresnal phase (ca. 2500±200 to 900±150 B.C.) is coeval with the introduction of early maize into the
Southwest and reflects fundamental changes in prehistoric lifeways. There was a substantial increase in
the number of sites, including many more and larger sites in the Rio Grande Valley and desert floor/playa
areas. The phase is characterized by MacNeish (1991:691) as possibly having year-around occupations
where the sites served as base camps for a radial rather than a calendar-round system. The early evidence
of horticulture includes maize and squash but not beans, which are known to be essential for their
complementary amino acids; however, in this low desert region along the Rio Grande, tornillo or
mesquite seeds may have satisfied this need (Schroeder 1974).
During the Hueco phase (ca. 900±150 B.C. to A.D. 200±100), people lived in seasonal microband or
taskforce occupations but with larger and probably more numerous pithouse sites that may have served as
winter villages (Carmichael 1986b, O’Laughlin 1980). The ephemeral sites include new site types such as
rock-roasting pits that indicate harvest and preparation of leaf succulents (Carmichael 1986b, O’Laughlin
1979, O’Laughlin et al. 1988). Faunal remains from sites indicate an increase in rabbit bones over large
game, and the remains include fish and turtle for the first time. MacNeish (1991:695, 697) characterizes
this phase as a trend toward larger and more numerous base camps occurring in a broader area. The
village settlement in the later Mesilla and El Paso phases apparently developed out of this shift toward
sedentism made possible by the adoption of horticulture. Mauldin et al. (1994), Burgett et al. (1995), and
O’Laughlin et al. (1988) have excavated pithouses that are associated with this phase. The sites have
occasionally contained brownware ceramics, although associations with the structures have not been
definitively verified.
M E SI L L A PH A SE
The introduction of ceramics around the first century A.D. denotes the beginning of the Mesilla phase,
first defined by Lehmer (1948). Characteristic of the Mesilla phase is the production of El Paso
Brownware, a plain earthenware ceramic type. This development is accompanied by larger and more
permanent pithouse settlements (MacNeish 1989a, 1989b; O’Laughlin 1980; Whalen 1977). Until near
the end of the Mesilla Phase (about A.D. 1000), people sometimes lived in pithouse clusters ranging from
15 to 50 or more structures. Though population density remains low, a significant change in social
organization appears to have occurred, with small, mobile bands gradually adapting to a more sedentary
lifestyle. Evidence from neighboring areas suggests that the emphasis on horticulture continued to grow
throughout this time period. The presence of pottery types from the Mimbres Valley of southwestern New
Mexico in the El Paso area indicates that long-distance material and information exchanges were

occurring between the prehistoric inhabitants of these two regions by approximately A.D. 750 to 950. The
presence of shells from the Pacific Coast supplements the evidence for external contact. The proliferation
of trade and shifts in settlement patterns may indicate increasingly sedentary populations with a growing
dependence on horticulture (Cordell 1984).
Foster (1988), Carmichael (1986a; personal communication from D. Carmichael to J. Peterson 1995), and
Gerald (1959) have excavated pithouse structures dating within this time frame along the Rio Grande
Valley margin. Of these, only the Keystone escarpment sites (Carmichael 1985) contained more than a
single pithouse structure on a particular site. It appears that during the Mesilla Phase in the west El Paso
region, isolated pithouse structures constitute the prehistoric habitations along the river zone. This has
also been demonstrated on the basin floor zones (Mauldin et al. 1994, O’Laughlin et al. 1988.)
DOÑA A NA PH A SE
Lehmer (1948) proposed a transitional Doña Ana phase to describe the period of adjustment from
pithouse to pueblo settlement in the Jornada Mogollon region. Carmichael (1986a) presented evidence for
this phase based on a survey of the Doña Ana Range and Fort Bliss in the Tularosa Basin. In Carmichael's
survey area, both decorated and undecorated El Paso Brownwares were found along with contemporary,
non-local, decorated ceramics dating to the mid-Formative period, but there are insufficient fine-grained
chronometric data from good contexts to define the period. The phase is analogous to similar transitional
phases proposed for the Mimbres region to the west and the Reserve−Tularosa region to the north. There
is clearly a florescence of population and settlement systems in the El Paso area from the end of the
Mesilla phase through the El Paso phase that appears to have corresponding development in the Mimbres
and the Casas Grandes regions.
Recent excavations of the Sandcliffe site in Sunland Park, New Mexico, at a small Doña Ana Phase
village along the Rio Grande Valley found El Paso Bichrome and Polychromes along with the
introduction of numerous types of trade wares. The excavations have also revealed that hunting and
gathering still appear to be the predominant subsistence pattern rather than horticulture. Predominant
remains uncovered in association with the Doña Ana Phase village consist of tornillo seeds and various
faunal remains associated with the river. Investigations at the Meyer Pithouse Village (Peterson et al.
2001) and other sites in the region document the Doña Ana phase occupation (Kegley 1982, Scarborough
1986, Scarborough and Wilcox 1991).
E L PA SO PH A SE
The elaboration of ceramic technology, as indicated by the introduction of new, locally produced ceramic
types such as El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome (Hill 1990a, 1990b) as well as the appearance
of new architectural forms marks the beginning of the El Paso Phase, dating from approximately A.D.
1050 to 1375 (Lehmer 1948). Large, 100- to 200-room pueblos such as Hot Wells, Escondido, Worley,
Cottonwood Springs, Alamogordo Site 1 (House 2), and Indian Tank occur in alluvial fan and riverine
settings. The architecture of the largest villages consists of surface or semi-subterranean linear
roomblocks, multiple rows of parallel roomblocks, or U-shaped or enclosed plaza structures of adobe or
masonry construction. The introduction of this pueblo-style architecture is accompanied by further

evidence for significant increases in population density, intraregional and interregional exchange, and
sociopolitical complexity (Lehmer 1948). Concomitant increases in the sociopolitical complexity of other
regional communities in the Mimbres Valley to the north and at Casas Grandes to the south may indicate
that these areas were playing a role in these cultural changes (Di Peso 1974).
While there are clearly stylistic and settlement similarities with Pueblo groups to the north in New
Mexico, the pueblo occupation of the El Paso area shares at least as much affinity with systems described
from northern Chihuahua and western Texas as documented in the La Junta and Guadalupe Mountains
areas (Kelly 1949a, 1949b, 1952, 1953; Mallouf and Tunnell 1977; Phillips 1990; Sebastian and Larralde
1989). Also, as several investigators have proposed, the pueblo settlements of El Paso do not appear to
have been fully dependent on horticutural subsistence. The occupants apparently practiced a wide range
of subsistence activities (MacNeish 1989a, 1989b; Carmichael 1986b; O’Laughlin and Martin 1990;
Whalen 1977, 1978). Excavations of El Paso Phase pueblos on the west side of El Paso near the Rio
Grande Valley verify a wide range of subsistence practices (Bradley 1983, Scarborough 1985). In this
regard they may have taken a different trajectory toward sedentary village life than elsewhere in the
Southwest (MacNeish 1989a:695).
In contrast to the pueblos of the northern Rio Grande Valley, rancherías appear to have been the
settlement of choice in the lower Rio Grande Valley and south along the Rio Grande from El Paso. These
smaller, probably seasonal, settlements documented along the river by Spanish accounts have been found
“on the banks of the river” as “distinct groups of jacales” (Kelly 1952:273). Other accounts appear to
have distinguished rancherías from the more permanent pueblos situated on the mesas at La Junta and
recorded settlements at arroyo mouths and springs along stretches of the river, which would not otherwise
have provided floodplain settlement opportunities.
By A.D. 1375, the populations of the Hueco Bolson and El Paso area exhibited an abrupt shift in
socioeconomic strategies, with a dispersed, hunting-and-gathering lifestyle replacing the previous
horticulturally oriented, aggregated village (Brethauer 1977; Whalen 1977, 1978; O’Laughlin and Martin
1990). Though the cause for this subsistence shift is poorly understood, an extended period of drought
during this time period or a shift in relationship between hunter-gatherer and farming populations could
be involved. Whatever the cause, a relatively dispersed hunting and gathering lifestyle prevailed in the
desert regions of far west Texas until historic times, although some pueblos were present in the Rio
Grande Valley.
The normative cultural chronology for the region, embodied particularly in Lehmer's Jornada Mogollon
Branch, was originally based on the distribution of El Paso Polychrome, Lincoln Black-on-red, and Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta ceramics (Lehmer 1948:71). The boundaries of these distributions have since
been found to be much more extensive, especially to the east and south. Furthermore, the range of
settlement types by period of occupation also appears to be much broader than originally proposed. With
the wealth of recent and finer-grained data, the Jornada Mogollon Branch, similar to its precursor as
proposed by Haury for western New Mexico and eastern Arizona (1956), may be ripe for a heuristic
overhaul.

The El Paso Phase was proposed to extend to A.D. 1450 by Lehmer and others. This date is commonly
considered the end of the period, although O’Laughlin (1980:26) states that the El Paso Phase may have
extended to A.D. 1500.
POST -E L PA SO PH A SE
The Post-El Paso Phase spanned the years from A.D. 1450 to 1657, and the occupants of the general area
and their relative utilization of the region remains relatively unknown (see Peterson and Brown 1994).
This time period has been referred to as the Protohistoric period. Prior to 1680, El Paso was utilized
primarily as a river crossing and for temporary settlement (Peterson and Brown 1994:70). However, early
Spanish descriptions of the general area speak of “a valley of swamps extending over eight leagues”
(Walz 1951:2). Earlier Spanish entradas in 1581 and 1583 along with the colonizing expedition of Oñate
in 1598 provided chronicles of the region. However, the first known settlement was the establishment of
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe in Paso del Norte as a mission for the Manso Indians in 1659.
Mansos were reported to be living north of El Paso in 1630 (Benavides 1966:13-16). Later accounts place
the origin of the Manso at the time of contact with the Spanish in the area of Doña Ana, New Mexico
(Gerald 1974:122). No direct accounts of the Manso were reported in the Upper Valley of El Paso or the
lower Mesilla Valley.
Other Indian groups mentioned from early Spanish accounts through the general area refer to the Suma
Indians (Gerald 1974:69). The group described by Gerald (1974:69) as Suma in the late seventeenth
century lived within “northern Chihuahua, northeastern Sonora, and from present day El Paso down river
about 130 miles to El Cajon.” Gerald (1974:51) notes the Suma Indians to the south of the pass. Like the
Manso, there is no direct historical evidence of the Sumas living in the Upper or Lower Mesilla Valley
during the Mexican or Historic periods.
The Manso population was reported as consisting of small villages of rancherías that are described as
“huts of branches” (Benavides 1966:13). Mansos were also noted to be raw-meat eaters, although Gerald
(1974:118) reports that Bandelier noted some tilling of the land. Gerald (1974:122) concludes that the
Manso were a nomadic group that was probably “related to one of the Rio Grande Pueblo groups,
probably one of the southern Tigua speakers.”
The Suma population was reported in Gerald (1974:74) from Bandelier and Naylor as living in flimsy
brush structures called jacales that were covered with skins in the winter. The Suma quickly adapted to
Spanish cultural practices (Gerald 1974:74). Gerald (1974:80) also states that the Suma practiced a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The Suma Indians were reported as living with the Spanish at the Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe in present-day Ciudad Juárez by 1659 (Gerald 1974:76). Hendricks documents
Suma as laborers on the Hacienda Santa Bárbara in the eighteenth century (Hendricks 2001).
Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache Indians were reported in the area from as early as the first Spanish
entradas into the region, and possibly from the late prehistoric period. They were Athabaskan speakers
who, along with other groups such as the Utes and Comanches, migrated into the region. Their lifeways
were horticultural as well as nomadic, but they adapted a lifestyle of raiding and high mobility following

the intrusion of the Spanish. This highly resilient lifeway enabled them to coexist with pueblo and
Spanish settlements as well as early Euro-American occupation. By the late 1880s, however, the last of
the Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache Indians were subdued and removed to reservations.
The reported Indian groups present in the El Paso general area by early Spanish invaders were hunters
and gatherers with limited horticultural practices. The archeological remains from these groups were
similar to those described in ethnobiological accounts by Castetter (1935) and Castetter and Opler (1936)
of Indian groups within the Southwest. The remains from processing native American plants were similar
to remains observed in association with most of the prehistoric groups of the area. Hearths, roasting pits,
various structures, and other features would be expected. These remains are common to cultural resources
located throughout the Jornada Mogollon. Unfortunately, few absolute dates have been recorded from the
Post-El Paso Phase, especially along the Rio Grande Valley. An exception is a fire-cracked rock feature
excavated on site 41EP2933 to the east of the Rio Grande. This feature may date to this period or within
the late El Paso Phase.
Recent radiocarbon dates from the Lower Valley of El Paso date to the Historic period (Brown et al.
1995a, 1995b; Leach et al. 1995). An exception is the dates recovered from a structure (possible pithouse)
at site 41EP1532 (Brown et al. 1994b). The dates recovered may indicate a Post-El Paso Phase occupation
of the area around the Old Socorro Mission before it was established.
Tigua, Piro, and other Indian groups would later move into the Lower Valley of El Paso by 1680 and
1682 (Gerald 1974:140) to eventually be absorbed by the Ysleta Mission. They moved into this area
following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This is the time frame most archeologists refer to as the official start
of the Historic period. This however, does not correspond to the time that initial settlements were
established in present-day Juarez, Chihuahua. The history of the Tiguas within the region is extensive and
reported in detail by Gerald (1974, 1977) and others. They were not reported as utilizing the Upper Valley
area of El Paso, though given their extensive range throughout the Hueco Bolson and south along the Rio
Grande as reported from their hunting ranges (Gerald 1974:65) and somewhat verified from historic finds
in a report (Seebach et al. 1995) of their remains in the Hueco Bolson, it is highly probable that Tiguas
would have extended up into the Upper Valley area of El Paso. This is even a greater possibility given the
Pueblo settlement in the Mesilla Valley at the village of Tortugas.
H I ST OR I C PE R I OD
Very little if any historic utilization of this general area occurred before U.S. Highway 180 was built in
the early 20th century. The exception is the presence of remnants of the Butterfield Stage route, which
was established in 1858 (Sonnichson 1968), and is located approximately one kilometer to the south of
eastern extent of this project area. It was demonstrated on the Loop 375 project that most notable
occurrences associated with this historic trail were limited to the immediate area of the trail (O'Laughlin
et. al. 1988). Therefore it is unlikely that cultural occurrences associated with this trail would be found
within the project area. Utilization of the general area before the Butterfield Trail was limited other than
for ranching and/or hunting during Spanish Colonial, Mexican, Texan, or American periods of occupation
in the region.

Prior to field investigations, a background records search and literature review of site and project files
was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC, and on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) to provide information on the potential for archeological
site occurrence and density in and near the project area. That review found that there are several previous
project areas with numerous recorded prehistoric and historic sites within a 1,000-meter radius of the
planned APE. This is particularly true south and east of Biggs Air Force Base near the northern edge of
the proposed Inner Loop ROW on Fort Bliss property, as well as south of the Inner Loop ROW on EPIA
property. The following provides a brief summary of those sites.
SI T E S 41E P928–932 A ND 41E P937
These sites were recorded on Fort Bliss property and are assumed to represent prehistoric sites.
Unfortunately, no data was available on the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas. Based on the current
construction plans, these sites are located approximately 500 meters or less from the Inner Loop project
area west of SL 375.
SI T E S 41E P2686–2690, 41E P2693–2696, 41E P2710, A ND 41E P2818
These sites were part of the inventory of 38 prehistoric sites documented during archeological
investigations sponsored by TxDOT along SL 375 in 1986 (Dering et al. 2001). Temporal affiliation of
the 38 camp sites ranged from the Middle Archaic Period to the El Paso Phase. Many of these sites
reflected minimal occupation, often possessing only one basin-shaped, dark charcoal-stained hearth
feature or burned caliche feature. Charcoal was frequently associated with features, thereby providing
chronometric data. Test excavations were conducted at 32 of the sites and data recovery excavations were
completed at six sites (Dering et al. 2001).
SI T E 41E P4682
This site is a presumed to be historic, but there is no available data on the THC’s Archeological Sites
Atlas. Site 41EP4682 is located approximately 0.9 kilometer northwest of the Fred Wilson Road/Airport
Road intersection.
SI T E 41E P4873
This site is described as a historic site within the cantonment area of Ft Bliss on Fred Wilson Rd. near the
entrance to the Ft. Bliss Cemetery. Investigations revealed three trash pits with associated domestic
artifacts dating from 1900 to the early 1930s. Recovered materials included remains of a boar, a cow, and
a number of unidentifiable faunal remains. Other artifacts included a blue enamel pot with handles, an
iron wedge, and non-diagnostic metal, and glass fragments. The site was documented by archeologists
from the Directorate of Environment, Fort Bliss, Texas.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY FOR THE PROPOSED BIGGS EAST GATE ROAD

SI T E 41E P5177
This is a historic dump containing artifact clusters specific to Fort Bliss departments, such as the medical
department and quartermaster corps. The site is located about 1.6 kilometers northwest of the intersection
of Fred Wilson and Airport Roads. The site was determined eligible for listing on the NRHP, as the
cultural deposits provide valuable information on various activities that occurred at Fort Bliss in the early
20th century (i.e., medical, domestic, and cavalry). The site was recorded during a cultural resources
survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Cultural Resources Survey of Biggs Army Airfield and McGregor
ASP (Roberts 2004)).
SI T E 41E P5331
Site 41EP5531 was a historic trash pit with 1930s–1945 household/domestic debris (i.e., bottles,
ceramics, and butchered animal bones). The site was located approximately 1.9 kilometers southwest of
the intersection of Fred Wilson Road and Airport Road. No further investigation was recommended at this
site. The site was documented by archeologists from the Directorate of Environment, Fort Bliss, Texas.
SI T E 41E P5577
This prehistoric site was documented in 2004 by archeologists from the Directorate of Environment, Fort
Bliss. The site was recorded near the southeast corner of the Aero Vista military community and
approximately 250 meters north of the proposed Inner Loop ROW. The site was described as typical of
the ubiquitous, sparse prehistoric campsites containing the remnants of single or multiple fire hearths.
Such sites have been consistently identified with the regional Formative period.
SI T E S 41E P5580, 41E P5582, A ND 41E P5585
South of the proposed Inner Loop ROW on property belonging to the EPIA and within close proximity to
the Inner Loop corridor, three prehistoric camp sites were recorded. These sites were identified in 2004
during surveys for a City of El Paso golf course and an EPIA-owned industrial park. In 2005, the sites
were subjected to test excavations and data recovery. The survey and excavation data suggested that
prehistoric occupation of the sites occurred from the Late Archaic through the El Paso phase. The
realignment ROW for Walter Jones Boulevard will come within 200 meters or less of sites.
SI T E S 41E P5742 A ND 41E P5743
In 2005, Blanton & Associates conducted an archeological survey for the proposed Inner Loop project
(Willis and Young 2006). Those investigations discovered two prehistoric camp sites with surface scatters
of El Paso Brownware sherds, debitage, core fragments, ground stone fragments, and burned caliche.
Twelve Isolated Occurrences were also discovered. Given the sites’ deflated nature and lack of subsurface
components, it was recommended that they possessed little research potential and that the construction
should proceed as planned without additional investigations.

M E T H ODS
The intensive archeological survey of the Biggs East Gate Road project area involved surface and
subsurface investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the
significance of any discovered cultural resources. The survey complied with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d). All field investigations were
thoroughly photographed.
Site recording criteria in the El Paso region is complex due to the high density of archeological materials
across the Jornada del Muerto. For consistency, as the current study is part of the overall Inner Loop
Project that traverses portions of Fort Bliss and Biggs Field, this survey utilized site definition standards
conforming to criteria established by the U.S. Army. These criteria also include Isolated Occurrences
(IOs), which are scattered artifacts not associated with a discernible site.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area by archeologists
walking 15-meter interval transects. In accordance with THC survey standards for linear project areas, the
surface survey was augmented by systematic shovel testing in areas where surface visibility was below 30
percent and in areas where sediment accumulation may have contained buried cultural materials (Figure
4). Moreover, shovel tests and/or trowel probes were conducted on recorded sites to delineate boundaries
and to test for subsurface remains or cultural features. Deviations from this standard occurred in areas of
highly eroded or disturbed surfaces, such as that found in the eastern end of the project area where
exposed caliche bedrock was common.
Shovel tests were 30–40 centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated to a depth of a meter or until soil
characteristics/bedrock prohibited further excavation. Shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary 20centimeter levels with all soil screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. All shovel test locations were plotted
with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers and documented on an appropriate Blanton &
Associates shovel test form. A total of 45 shovel tests, including those used to define site boundaries,
were excavated during the survey (Appendix A).
Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical extent of any previously
unidentified sites within the project area. Site data included a description of the site’s environment,
cultural materials observed within the APE, and observations on the continuance of any site that extended
outside of the project area. Sites were also evaluated with respect to their eligibility for listing to the
NRHP and for formal designation as SALs, as per eligibility criteria set forth in National Park Service
regulations 36 CFR 60.4 and Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas. If site eligibility is uncertain,
then further archeological investigations are recommended to determine eligibility.
When an IO was encountered, adjacent areas were inspected for the presence of additional cultural
materials to ensure that an archeological site was not missed. If aggraded sands were adjacent, shovel
tests were also excavated. Locational data for IOs was obtained with the GPS receiver, while the artifact
was described briefly and photographed

Field investigations resulted in the discovery of two previously unrecorded prehistoric sites (41EP5919
and 41EP5920) and 12 IOs. A search was undertaken at all IO locations to look for additional cultural
materials. The survey of the proposed APE indicated that the proposed ROW occupies an area that is
primarily deflated and has been disturbed by the development of EPIA as well as buried utilities.
SI T E 41E P5919
This prehistoric site is exposed on the ground surface within an interdunal area on the eastern slope of a
large playa. The site is ovate in plan, measuring 86 meters east/west by 62 meters north/south. Soils in the
site area are mapped as belonging to the Hueco-Wink soil association and are pale brown to brown, fine
sandy loams to loamy fine sands approximately 25 cm thick over yellowish-brown, fine sandy loams that
are calcareous and extend to approximately 70 cm below the surface (Jaco 1971:24). However, much of
the area has been deflated and pebble size nodules of caliche material were present on the ground surface.
The terrain around the site was dotted with one to two-meter tall mesquite dunes and ground surface
visibility across the site was approximately 90 percent given the area’s largely deflated condition, though
some built-up sheet sands were also present. Vehicular traffic had recently crossed the southern margins
of the site.
The boundaries of site 41EP5919 were based on the extent of the surface scatter of artifacts, the
excavation of 12 shovel tests, which uncovered no buried cultural materials, and several trowel probes
(Figures 5 and 6; see Appendix A). Observed artifacts included four El Paso Brownware sherds, one
schist palette fragment, one rhyolite core, one quartzite hammerstone, five pieces of rhyolite debitage, two
pieces of chert debitage, one piece of quartzite debitage, two complete rhyolite manos, two rhyolite mano
fragments, four rhyolite metate fragments (probably from the same artifact), and one fire-cracked rhyolite
rock. No decorations were identified on the ceramic sherds and no rim fragments were found. Since all of
the artifacts observed were at the deflated surface, they are not believed to be in situ.
In addition to the artifacts, three highly dispersed areas of burned caliche were found. The burned caliche
scatters likely represent hearth remains with no horizontal or vertical integrity. Examination of the
scatters revealed no carbonaceous remains or associated diagnostics.
Site 41EP5919 consists of a highly deflated surface scatter of groundstone artifacts, chipped-stone
debitage, and ceramics that likely represent the remains of a prehistoric campsite. The site is not intact
and lacks buried deposits. There appears to be little or no potential for the recovery of data that might
contribute to a better understanding of regional prehistory and, therefore, site 41EP5919 is not
recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for formal SAL designation.
SI T E 41E P5920
This site is located amidst an area of coppice dunes that slopes westward toward a distant playa. Site
boundaries are approximately 8 meters in diameter. The site is situated within a semi-deflated interdunal
area about 130 meters south of the property line between EPIA and Biggs Field and 450 meters east of

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY FOR THE PROPOSED BIGGS EAST GATE ROAD

17

site 41EP5919 (Figures 7 and 8). As, with 41EP5919 soils on 41EP5920 belong to the Hueco-Wink soil
association (see above). A low density scatter of caliche nodules was visible throughout the site.
Site 41EP5920 was first identified as a large rhyolite stone partially covered with sheet sands. On top of
the stone was a large El Paso Brownware sherd with nine additional sherds scattered in a one meter radius
area around it. One secondary quartzite flake was also noted approximately two meters northeast of the
stone. Large stones are unusual in this portion of the Hueco Bolson, much less one directly associated
with a broken ceramic vessel.
Two shovel tests (B1 and B2) were excavated adjacent to the stone to determine if there was evidence for
anything buried below the stone (see Figures 6 and 7 and Appendix A). The only artifacts recovered from
Shovel Test B1 were ten small El Paso Brownware sherds that were recovered between 0 and
10 centimeters below ground surface. One of the sherds may have been decorated but it was too
weathered to tell for certain. Shovel Test B1 was dug to a depth of 90 centimeters where caliche was
encountered and excavations were halted. Shovel Test B2 recovered five El Paso Brownware sherds
between 0 and 10 centimeters, while at about 15 centimeters, a small krotovina was encountered. Shovel
Test B2 was terminated at 85 centimeters below ground surface when caliche was reached. Neither shovel
test indicated the presence of anything cultural extending beneath the stone. Eight additional shovel tests
were excavated on site but none contained any cultural materials and all encountered caliche within 80
centimeters below ground surface or less (see Appendix A). Several trowel probes were also dug around
the stone to find evidence of an associated pit but none was found.
Concluding that nothing was buried below the stone, it was carefully turned over. The stone was actually
a large rhyolite metate with two apparently in situ rhyolite manos directly beneath and resting about
15 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 9). Their position suggests that the items were placed
intentionally or possibly carried in a basket or other perishable vessel that was discarded and has long
since deteriorated. No additional artifacts were discovered adjacent to or below the metate.
Other than the two manos at 15 centimeters below ground surface, subsurface investigations below the
stone discovered no additional subsurface cultural materials. While it is a curiosity, the site contains little
or no potential for containing intact buried cultural deposits that could contribute new or important data to
our understanding of regional prehistory and is not recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP
or for formal SAL designation.

Two new prehistoric archeological sites (41EP5919 and 41EP5920) and 12 IOs were recorded in the
project area. The sites appear to be the remains of ephemeral prehistoric camps common throughout the
Hueco Bolson. Given the deflated conditions at 41EP5919, as well as the lack of buried cultural materials
and questionable horizontal integrity at 41EP5920, the sites’ research value is considered low. The survey
indicated that the APE was primarily deflated and has been disturbed by the development of EPIA and
subsurface utilities. Given those conditions, it is the opinion of Blanton & Associates that there is little to
no potential that intact buried cultural resources would be impacted within the APE during the planned
construction.
Due to the project area’s low potential for containing intact subsurface prehistoric and historic cultural
deposits that could contribute new or important data to our understanding of local and regional prehistory
and history, Blanton & Associates recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as
planned at 41EP5919 and 41EP5920 without additional cultural resources investigations as the sites are
not recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP or for formal SAL designation.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW or workspace outside of the proposed APE at
41EP5919 and 41EP5920 or other locations for the planned (or future construction), then additional
cultural resource investigations in those areas would be necessary. In the event that previously
unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area would
cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures
in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
