ABSTRACT

In January through March 1993, archeological and geomorphological investigations were conducted at
two clay dune sites, 41WY50 and 41WY60, in the outfall area of the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Pitch system.
This work represents the final investigations of a cultural resource management program conducted for the U.S.
Anny Corps of Engineers and the local sponsors, Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and Willacy County
Drainage District No. 1, by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
The results of the archeological investigations were poor. Neither site yielded materials of
unquestionable cultural origin, although several small basin-shaped hearth features were encountered. Based
on radiocarbon assays from soil humates and the stratigraphic provenience of the features, it is speculated that
the occupation(s) at 41WY50 is late Archaic and the occupation(s) at 41WY60 is Late Prehistoric to Historic.
Both sites represent very short term occupations and most likely do not represent repetitive use on a seasonal
or yearly basis. These investigations suggest that, since the development of the modem coastal enviromnents
approximately 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, the south Texas coast between Baffin Bay and the Holocene delta of
the Rio Grande has been a resource-poor and inhospitable area that probably was utilized only sparsely or
intermittently.
The geomorphological investigations were more successful, adding valuable data about paleoenvironments and the formation of the modem coastal enviromnents of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The clay dunes
formed through the eolian transport of fine to very fine quartz sand and fine to very fine sand-sized aggregates
of clay from adjacent wind-tidal flats during the late Holocene. Stable carbon isotope studies of soil humates
suggest that the clay dune plant community was and still is dominated by C4 and/or CAM plants. These
investigations also disclosed fluctuations in sea level during the late Holocene. An abandoned wind-tidal flat,
encountered at 41WY50, indicates that sea level was at least 1 m higher than present mean sea level between
2300-1100 B.P.

INTRODUCTION

1

This report presents the results of the archeological and geomorphological investigations at two
prehistoric sites, 41 WY50 and 41 WY60, in Willacy
County, Texas. Both sites are located on the
mainland coast of the Laguna Madre within the
outfall area of the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch system constructed by the Hidalgo County
Drainage District No. 1 and the Willacy County
Drainage District No. 1 to minimize the impact of
hurricane-related floodwaters over much of the
area (Figure 1).
Sites 41WY50 and 41WY60 were originally
recorded by Day et al. (1981) during Phase I work
sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in
1980. In 1987, Hall et al. (1987:76-77) recommended that both sites undergo testing to determine
their eligibility for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places. Although not directly impacted
by ditch construction, the outfall area and sites
41WY50 and 41WY60 were determined to be in a
zone of potential secondary impacts due to
discharge from the ditch and channelization of flow
debouching into the lagoonal inlet. Since construction of the Main Floodwater Channel and the North
Ditch, sedimentation of bayheads and wind/tidal
flats and channelized flow are readily noticeable in
the outfall area.
In 1992, a work plan was submitted to the
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and
Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 for further
investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY60. The plan
called for 5 weeks of testing to further define site
boundaries, determine site integrity, and determine
placement of block excavations at both sites. The
results of the testing were to be evaluated at the
end of the 5-week period, and if favorable, work
was to proceed into a 12-week-or-less period of

block excavations and data recovery at one or both
of the sites.
The archeological test excavations commenced
on January 25 and continued to March 10, 1993.
Fieldwork was halted a number of times at the
beginning of the testing period due to heavy rains
and impassable two-track ranch roads; however,
the test excavations were completed in approximately 154 person days. At the end of the testing
period, it was determined through meetings with
representatives of the Hidalgo and Willacy County
drainage districts, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, and the Texas Historical Commission
that further work at 41WY50 and 41WY60 was not
warranted due to the extreme paucity of cultural
materials.
The results of the 5-week archeological testing
and geomorphological investigations are presented

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The Lower Rio Grande VaIIey is characterized
by unique climatic conditions, floral communities,
and wildlife that combine to form a distinctive
ecosystem found nowhere else in the United States
(Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:1). The biotic
community, referred to as the Matamoran District
of the Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950:103)
or the Tamaulipan brushland (Jahrsdoerfer and
Leslie 1988), consists mainly of dense thorny
brush, which provides food and habitat for many
wildlife species. Many neotropical genera of
mammals, snakes, lizards, and salamanders reach
2

Chapter I : Introduction

the northern limits of their distributions in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley (Blair 1950). The
Lower Rio Grande Valley also represents the
northernmost extent of 21 bird species that are
found in Mexico and Central America (Winckler
1976). The region also provides important feeding,
nesting, and cover habitats for many species of
migratory birds.
Human impacts on native vegetation have been
severe throughout this century and continue to
threaten the survival of this unique ecosystem.
Since the 1920s, more than 95% of the original
native vegetation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley
has been converted to agricultural or urban use
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1980). More than
90% of the riparian zone on the United States side
of the Rio Grande has been removed (Collins
1984). It is estimated that 98% of the lush,
subtropical region of the delta has been cleared in
the United States (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
1980) and that a similar percentage has been
cleared in Mexico (Collins 1984).
Loss of wildlife habitat through land-clearing
activities related to agriculture, ranching, and
development has had a profound impact on many
animal and plant species. Eighty-six animal
species, including the ocelot (Felis pardalis) and
jaguarundi (Felis yagouaroundi), are considered
endangered, threatened, or placed on notice of
review or watch-list by the U.S. Department of the
Interior, the State of Texas, or the Texas Organization for Endangered Species (Jahrsdoerfer and
Leslie 1988:9, Table 3). Fifty-five plant species
also are on the list of endangered, threatened, or
watch-list in the Lower Rio Grande Valley
(Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:Table 1).
Land-clearing practices also have had a
profound effect on the cultural resources (see
Bousman et al. 1990:17-18; Day et al. 1981:170;
Mallouf et al. 1977:23-26). The archeological
record of the region is characterized as one of sites
in disturbed contexts with scattered artifacts.

atures are fairly uniform over the entire Lower Rio
Grande Valley, although means tend to be a few
degrees warmer on the coast than inland during the
winter and vice versa in the summer (Figure 2).
Modified polar air masses occasionally reach the
area during the winter months and interrupt the
warm flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico, but the
region may go several years without a freeze,
especially near the coast.

Although the Lower Rio Grande Valley
receives humid air masses from prevailing
southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico, the
region is semiarid. Precipitation varies across the
Valley from about 48.0 to 68.5 cm a year (Figure
3), although it is common for some years to
deviate greatly from the mean, especially when
hurricanes bring intense rainfall (Natural Fibers
Information Center 1987: 16; Norwine and Bingham
1986). The effects of the low rainfall are intensified by a high potential evapotranspiration rate of
1,525 mm per year (Norwine and Bingham 1986:3).
Cycles of drought have occurred at erratic intervals
throughout the twentieth century, with episodes
lasting an average of 4 to 7 years (Norwine and
Bingham 1986:4). Drought episodes most likely
correspond to the frequency of hurricanes, whose
absence is a factor in the protraction of drought
conditions in south Texas (Bousman et al. 1990:5).
The average relative humidity is high, around
60% at midday and higher at night (Turner 1982:2).
Relative humidity increases during the winter
months (Natural Fibers Information Center 1987:
16).

Climate
The climate of the Lower Rio Grande Valley
is classified as semiarid-subtropical with hot and
humid summers and mild winters (Natural Fibers
Information Center 1987:16). The region's climate
is considered to be one of the most unique in the
world (see Norwine and Bingham 1986). Temper3

surrounded by floodbasin muds.
Toward the end of the Pleistocene, climatic
and environmental changes led to dramatic
developments and the establishment of the modem
environments of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. At
the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum around
18,000 B.P., sea level dropped significantly and
the Rio Grande cut a deep valley into the
Beaumont Formation. Irregular rising sea levels
during the Holocene caused the valley to fill
through meanderbelt (point bar) and floodbasin
mud deposition.
Basinward, the valley was
flooded, forming an estuary. Erosion along the
margins of the Rio Grande estuary and valley walls
widened the original Pleistocene valley. Tidetransported marine sediments were deposited over
the earlier estuarine deposits. Around 10,000 to
7000 B.P., this transgressive period ceased (Brown
et al. 1980:19). The estuary eventually filled with
estuarine, deltaic, and aggrading fluvial sediments
after which at least three different Holocene deltas
formed in the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico
(Brown et al. 1980:19).
By 4500 B.P., sea level reached its approximate modem level, and the Rio Grande prograded
a large, wave-dominated delta into the open Gulf
at least 16 km east of the present shoreline (Brown
et al. 1980:20). Due to a decrease in the sediment
load of the Rio Grande between 3400 and
1900 B.P., delta progradation ceased and marine
transgression, which continues today, commenced
(Brown et al. 1980:22). As the last major delta of
the Rio Grande subsided and waves reworked its
delta-front sand sheet, discontinuous offshore bars
eventually merged forming South Padre Island, a
sandy peninsula attached to the transgressive Rio
Grande delta. The peninsula eventually linked with
the offshore barriers of middle and northern Padre
Island, and the Laguna Madre was formed between
the island chain and the mainland shoreline. South
Padre Island and the inner shelf continue to move
landward, gradually filling the Laguna Madre with
washover fan and eolian sediments. Wind-tidal
flats and associated clay dunes along the western
margin of the Laguna Madre mark the gradual
subsidence and transgression of the Rio Grande
deltaic plain (Brown et al. 1980:23).
Farther inland, beyond the influence of
estuarine and marine transgression, the Rio Grande
Pleistocene valley slowly filled throughout the
early and middle Holocene by meanderbelt (point
bar) and floodplain deposition (Brown et al.

Geology
The Lower Rio Grande Valley is part of the
West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal
Plain geomorphic province (Hunt 1974:725). The
bedrock geology of the province consists of a
series of stacked and tilted beds that dip and
become progressively younger Gulfward. The
Lower Rio Grande Valley is actually a fluvialdeltaic environment consisting mainly of Quaternary channel fill and distributary sands and
floodplain and interdistributary muds. Deposition
and incision of these sediments have been dictated
by cyclical changes in sea level during the
Quaternary glacial and interglacial periods (Figure
4).
The earliest deposits in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley are Tertiary and are represented by the
Goliad Formation, which consists of Pliocene
sands, sandstones, marls, and limestones (Barnes
1976).
Pleistocene-age deposits consist of
fluvial-deltaic sediments of the Lissie and
Beaumont formations. The age of these deposits is
uncfoar, although they probably were deposited
during the high sea stand of the Sangamon
Interglacial period (Brown et al. 1980:17). Morerecent Beaumont Formation deposits are the result
of fluvial deposition during a later Pleistocene
(Peorian?) interglacial stage (Brown et al. 1980:
18). These more-recent Beaumont Formation
deposits formed the Raymondville alluvial plain
and its delta in the northern portion of the Lower
Rio Grande Valley. The Pleistocene fluvialdeltaic formations consist of meanderbelt sands

1980:19). By 4500 B.P., channel incision and
terrace formation had occurred (Boyd et al. 1994),
possibly triggered by a dwindling sediment supply
that culminated between 3400-1900 B.P. (Brown
et al. 1980:22). Continuing decreases in the
sediment load of the Rio Grande throughout the
late Holocene and the onset of more-xeric climatic
conditions (Kibler and Freeman 1993:33; Bousman
et al. 1990) has transformed the Rio Grande into
an underfit stream within the Pleistocene valley.
Holocene environments of the Rio Grande
valley consist of meanderbelt sands and silts,
floodbasin muds, distributary sands and silts,
interdistributary muds, crevasse splays, abandoned
channels and resacas, local marshes, and
headward-eroding streams (Brown et al. 1980:56).
Most of these environments are inactive or
ephemeral, abandoned by the shifting course of the
river. Today, only the present Rio Grande channel
periodically floods and deposits sediment. Point
bar accretion, levee and crevasse splay building,
and the flooding of floodbasins and interdistributary areas only occur during periods of heavy
rainfalls and run-offs related to tropical storms
and hurricanes.
Eolian environments also formed in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley at the end of the Pleistocene
and throughout the Holocene. Increased aridity
during the Holocene resulted in the formation of
the south Texas sand sheet and other eolian
formations, such as the Faysville-Edinburg
stabilized dune field. These eolian deposits and
dune trains display southeast-northwest axes,
mirroring the modem prevailing wind pattern.
Eolian sediments were derived from Pleistocene
Lissie and Beaumont formation deltaic and fluvial
deposits and were deposited along the northern
periphery of the Lower Rio Grande Valley as the
south Texas sand sheet. Bousman et al. (1990)
produced a series of radiocarbon assays between
12,780 and 4300 B.P. from deflated soils of the
Raymondville alluvial plain, suggesting that
formation of the sand sheet occurred at this time.
It is also suggested that finer materials such as
silts were deposited farther inland along the
Balcones Escarpment (Bousman et al. 1990:136138).

into several environmental zones based on different
geological, geomorphological, hydrological
topographical, and biotic patterns and characteris~
tics (e.g., Bousman et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1980·
Day et al. 1981; Jahrsdoerfer and' Leslie 1988'.
Mallouf et al. 1977). Such divisions were a~
integral part of some of the initial archeological
investigations in the region (e.g. Day et al. 1981;
Mallouf et al. 1977). The division of the region
into zones was a response to the need for manageable units for sampling cultural resources and for
establishing research objectives, which involved
predicting site locations according to different
environmental/geographical variables. Mallouf et
al. (1977:102) divided the Lower Rio Grande
Valley into seven environmental zones, based on
geographical, topographical, hydrological, and
floral characteristics, and to a lesser extent on data
believed to be meaningful for the determination of
prehistoric land-use patterns and the present
archeological record. Ensuing cultural resources
investigations by Day et al. (1981) and Hall et al.
(1987) fashioned models of environment-site
location relationships after Mallouf et al. (1977)
with the addition of two more environmental zones
that were not part of Malloufs sampling universe.
Later archeological research, focusing on human
adaptations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, used
a less-complex set of environmental zones by
combining the nine zones into five (Bousman et al.
1990:10-17). The five zones are the sand sheet,
the lowland plain, the upland plain, the Rio Grande
floodplain and delta, and the coast (Figure 5).
These five zones are employed in this report for a
discussion and study of human adaptations and
resource accessibility and availability (see Chapter
6). Sites 41WY50 and 41WY60 are in the coastal
zone. A detailed discussion of the environment of
the coastal zone follows a summary of the other
four zones.
Sand Sheet

This zone is a stabilized and active dune area
that sustains a savanna habitat of grasslands and
scattered oak mattes. The sand sheet includes all
of Kenedy and Brooks counties and parts of Jim
Hogg, Starr, Kleberg, Duval, and Jim Wells
counties. The southern periphery of the sand sheet,
consisting of the Norias sand lobe and Rudolph
sand/loess plain, extends into northern Hidalgo and

Willacy counties.
The dune fields probably formed when climatic
conditions became increasingly arid and surfaces
were deflated by southeasterly prevailing winds
(Brown et al. 1980). While only one chronometric
date (11,450 B.P., Brown et al. 1980:21) is
available from the dunes of the sand sheet,
Bousman et al. (1990:136, 218) note several
radiocarbon assays between 12,780 and 4300 B.P.
from a deflated late Pleistocene soil upwind of the
sand sheet. This suggests that the sand sheet
accumulated during a more-xeric period in the
early to middle Holocene.
Oak mottes within the sand sheet are most
common on the higher sand hills and are replaced
by prairie grasses or brush on lower ground
surfaces and near the coast. The oak mottes
consist predominantly of live oak, Quercus
1
virginiana or Q. oleoides quaterna.
Prairie
communities consist of Andropogon sp., Panicum
sp., Paspalum sp., E/yonurus sp., Brachiaria sp.,
Cenchrus sp., and Chloris sp. (Johnston 1955:95106). Mesquite and thorny brush thickets are
present but not common. The oak mottes provide
habitat for many animals, including deer, turkey,
javelina, turtles, snakes, and rodents.

other terrestrial fauna as well (J ahrsdoerfer and
Leslie 1988:8).
Prairie communities consist commonly of
perennial grasses (Cenchrus, Eragrostis, Chloris,
Aristida, and Sporobolus) and forbs (Desmanthus
virgatus depressus, Cassia fasciculata, Croton
spp., and Eriogonum multiflorum) (Johnston 1955:
107-109). Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie (1988:8) refer
to the brush thickets as the mid-delta thorn forest.
The mid-delta thorn forest community consists of
xerophytic short trees and shrubs, including
mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), spiny hackberry
(Ce/tis pallida), Texas ebony (Pithecellobium
flexicaule), anacua (Ehretia anacua), yucca, (Yucca
treculeana), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and Texas
lantana (Lantana horrida). These species often
grow in dense, impenetrable thickets.
Upland Plain

The upland plain is characterized by low,
rolling, calcareous, gravelly hills of the Goliad
Formation and an increase in perennial and
ephemeral streams. Elevations increase. to over
120 m (400 ft) westward from a small escarpment
bordering the lowland plain. Stabilized dunes of
the Faysville-Edinburg dune field are present along
the eastern and southern margins of the zone. One
major distinction between the upland plain and
lowland plain, at least presnmably to the prehistoric inhabitants of the region, is the presence of
knappable Iithic materials in the upland plain.
The characteristic plant community is a low,
dense chaparral which Johnston (1955:67-68) terms
"short brush." Isolated riparian strips of dense
brush occur along streams and arroyos. Defined as
the ramadero biotic community, these riparian
zones include such woody plant species as spiny
hackberry (C. pallida), sweet acacia (A. farnesiana), retama (Parkinsonia aculeata), bluewood
condalia (Condalia obovata), and mesquite (P.
juliflora) (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:8). The
ramaderos provide habitat for many animals,
including white-winged dove and deer.

Lowland Plain

This zone consists of a featureless landscape
with no natural drainages. Dispersed over the
surface are shallow blowouts which form seasonal
playas surrounded by thin eolian deposits on the
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation, an abandoned
delta of the Rio Grande. The lowland plain zone is
analogous to the Raymondville Alluvial Plain
noted by Mallouf et al. (1977:Figure 19). Within
the southwestern portion of the zone, dunes of the
Fayesville-Edinburg and Hargill conical dune
fields commonly overlie the Beaumont Formation.
Land-clearing activities related to agriculture
and ranching have decimated much of the natural
vegetation in the lowland plain. Indigenous floral
communities include prairies, brush thickets, and
rare oak mottes. Greater plant diversity occurs
around the playas and blowouts, where species
with greater water requirements, including sugar
hackberry (Ce/tis laevigata), sweet acacia (Acacia
farnesiana), and Eragrostis spicata, a coarse bunch
grass, thrive. These "wooded potholes and basins"
provide important habitat for migratory birds and

Rio Grande Floodplain and Delta

This zone consists of the Rio Grande floodplain and its modem delta. The Rio Grande is a
major source of perennial water in the region, and
its significance cannot be overestimated. The
8

Chapter 1 : Introduction

topography of the zone is flat or gently sloping due
to the very low stream gradient.
Scattered
throughout the zone are many oxbow lakes or
resacas which hold freshwater. The delta is an
active wetlands formed by many small and large
distributary channels which constantly change
course.
Clay dunes are common along the
Gulfward margin of the delta. Both environments
provide habitat for numerous terrestrial and aquatic
vertebrates (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:8).
Much of the indigenous plant community has
been removed due to agriculture and urban
development. Biotic communities within the Rio
Grande floodplain and delta include, from the
upper valley to the delta, the Chihuahuan thorn
forest, the upper valley flood forest, the midvalley riparian woodland, and the sabal palm forest
(Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988:7-8). Tree species
common in all of the communities include black
willow (Salix niger), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) , Berlandier ash (Fraxinus berlandieriana),
western soapberry (Sapindus drummondii), sugar
hackberry (C. laevigata) , Texas ebony (P.
flexicaule), and thickets of mesquite (P. juliflora)
and spiny hackberry (C. pallida). Limited to the
sabal palm forest are Mexican palmettos (Sabal
mexicana) or sabal palms. Beneath these forested
canopies thrive several different types of shrubs
and vines, including Barbados-cherry malpighia
(Malpighia glabra) , short-fruited serjania-vine
(Serjania brachycarpa), and saw greenbrier (Smilax
bona - nox).

Geology and Holocene Geomorphology

The coastal zone is characterized by Holocene
deposits of the Laguna Madre, Padre Island,
lagoonal deltas, wind-tidal flats , and clay dunes
overlying the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation.
The Beaumont Formation in this part of the Lower
Rio Grande Valley is a part of the Raymondville
fluvial system, the most recent and most basinward
occurrence of the Beaumont Formation. Although
undated in south Texas, it probably was deposited
prior to 60,000-50,000 B.P. during a brief
Wisconsin interglacial high sea stand (Brown et al.
1980:47). Deltaic deposits of the Raymondville
system are assumed to lie buried under the Laguna
Madre, Padre Island, and the inner shelf (Brown et
al. 1980:47). The Raymondville fluvial system
consists of intertwined meanderbelt sands and
floodplain muds. To the north the sand sheet
overlies the meanderbelts, and basinward the
meanderbelts underlie the wind-tidal flats and clay
dunes between Cayo Atascosa and Fourmile
Slough. The southern margin of the Raymondville
meanderbelt system was eroded by the late
Pleistocene entrenchment of the Rio Grande during
the Last Glacial Maximum (Brown et al. 1980:51).
This portion of the mainland shore consists of
Holocene deltaic deposits of the Rio Grande.
The end of the Pleistocene initiated many
changes to the south Texas coast. Sea level began
to rise, which included periods of initial rapid rise,
stand stills, and a possible maximum high stand of
1.5 m above current sea level between 45003000 B.P. (Frazier 1974; Prewitt and Paine 1987).
Compactional subsidence, lack of run-off from the
mainland, and increasing aridity have resulted in
the formation of extensive wind-tidal flats along
the shoreline and hypersaline conditions in the
Laguna Madre. Saltwater and freshwater marshes ,
which are present farther north along the Texas
coast, are virtually absent along the south Texas
coast due to arid climatic conditions, lack of
drainage or run-off into the Laguna Madre, and
prevailing southeasterly winds (Brown et al. 1980:
72). The wind-tidal flats of the mainland are
predominantly mud with minor amounts of sand,
algal-bound mud, and algal mats. The surfaces of
these flats are usually covered with blue-green
algae and desiccation cracks and polygons.

Coastal Zone
This zone consists of a strip of land parallel to
the coastline. A number of diverse environments
are present, including the Gulf of Mexico, barrier
islands, lagoons, wind- tidal flats , clay dunes , rare
salt marshes, and sand dunes. The number of and
interplay between both aquatic and terrestrial
environments and freshwater and saline environments make parts of the coastal zone highly
productive and complex but at the same time very
fragile. Hurricanes and prolonged droughts, which
affect the salinity, precipitation, and other climatic
conditions of this zone, can have devastating
consequences on the biological communities of the
coast.

20). This has left the south Texas coast in a state
of marine transgression. The mainland shore
subsides and retreats, marked by wind-tidal flats,
while South Padre Island moves landward and the
Laguna Madre fills. At the same time, the Laguna
Madre has moved westward to a lesser extent over
the subsiding Pleistocene and Holocene coastal
plain. As a result, the Laguna Madre has become
narrower and parts of the lagoon have become
shallower, while South Padre Island has become
thinner and increasingly erosional (Brown et al.
1980:22). More importantly, this process has
accelerated due to even more decreases in the
sediment load of the Rio Grande as a result of dam
construction and agricultural irrigation upstream
(Brown et al. 1980:32).

Associated with the wind-tidal flats are numerous
clay dunes, which form as a result of sand-sized
aggregates of clay being transported from the
surface of the wind-tidal flat to its leeward margin
(Price 1963).
Often clay dunes accrete on
remnants of delta-plain distributary levees (Brown
et al. 1980:73; Huffman and Price 1949:124). It is
estimated that the clay dunes along the south Texas
coadt started to accrete around 4500-5000 B.P.
(Prewitt and Paine 1987; Price and Kornicker
1961). Many of the presumably older and more
basinward clay dunes that formed on the Holocene
delta of the Rio Grande in Cameron County are
now inactive islands, as their wind-tidal flats have
been drowned due to compactional subsidence of
the delta and encroachment of the Laguna Madre.
The shoreline also experienced the headward
erosion of streams, most notably the Arroyo
Colorado which has been eroding headward
throughout the Holocene. It has pirated run-off
from a portion of the northern Holocene Rio
Grande floodplain.
The Arroyo Colorado
debouches directly into the Laguna Madre and
formerly built a large lagoonal delta upon which
wind-tidal flats and clay dunes have formed
(Brown et al. 1980:21). Flow and discharge
through the Arroyo Colorado is limited, with peak
discharge associated with floods from tropical
storms. The Mercedes-Raymondville floodway
was a similar headward-eroding floodway that
· discharged into the Laguna Madre near Fourmile
Slough during the Holocene (Price 1958:53). The
Mercedes-Raymondville floodway, which is now
abandoned, also formed a lagoonal delta on which
wind-tidal flats and clay dunes formed (Brown et
al. 1980:63).
As sea level reached its approximate modern
level, offshore bars and spits developing from a
marine-transgressive Holocene Rio Grande delta
merged with discontinuous offshore barriers to
form Padre Island and the Laguna Madre between
3400 and 1900 B.P. (Brown et al. 1980:22). Broad
wind-tidal flats developed along the eastern
margin of the Laguna Madre, where washover fan
and eolian sediments from Padre Island filled the
lagoon. South Padre Island formed from the
longshore transport of sediment delivered to the
Gulf by the Rio Grande. However, for the last few
thousand years the sediment load and discharge of
the Rio Grande have decreased, leaving the barrier
islands starved for sediment (Brown et al. 1980:

Soils
The soils of the coastal zone consist of various
nonsaline and saline, sandy and clayey Aridisols
and Entisols. The soils belong to three different
soil associations that include the GalvestonMustang-Dune land, the Barrada-Lalinda-Arrada,
and the Satatton-Tatton (Turner 1982).
Soils of the Galveston-Mustang-Dune land
association are nearly level to rolling, nonsaline,
sandy soils formed on the beach, fore dunes, and
mid-barrier flat of barrier islands and coastal
mainland sand dunes. Galveston series soils are
predominant in this association (Turner 1982:10).
Galveston soils are classified as Typic Udipsamments, which are sandy Entisols of humid climates
(Buol et al. 1980:230).
Barrada-Lalinda-Arrada soils consist of
nearly level to gently sloping, saline and nonsaline,
clayey and loamy soils formed on mainland windtidal flats (Barrada and Arrada soils) and clay
dunes (Lalinda soils). Barrada and Lalinda soils
make up the majority of the Barrada-LalindaArrada association (Turner 1982: 13). Barrada
soils are Aquollic Salorthids, Aridisols with
shallow salic horizons and thin, wet mollic
epipedons. Arrada soils are classified as Typic
Salorthids, Aridisols with shallow salic horizons.
Lalinda soils are classified as Ustollic Camborthids, which are Aridisols with cambic horizons
and dry, thin mollic epipedons and/or gypsic or
calcic horizons below the cambic horizon. Buried
soils are common (Buol et al. 1980:253, 264).
The third soil association, Satatton-Tatton,

10

Chapter 1: Introduction

includes nearly level, saline, sandy soils formed on
the backside of barrier islands and wind-tidal
flats. Satatton and Tatton soils are the predominant soils (Turner 1982: 12). Satatton soils are
Typic Salorthids, which are Aridisols with shallow
salic horizons. Tatton soils are Typic Psammaquents, wet, sandy to loamy sand Entisols (Buol et
al. 1980:230, 253).

scoparium var. littoralis), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), seaoats (Uniola paniculata), marshhay
cordgrass (Spartina patens), and gulfdune
paspalum (Paspalum monostachyum). The beaches

and backbeaches of the barrier islands are largely
barren.
Plants from the coastal zone provide little in
the way of food resources; rather, shellfish, fish,
and waterfowl provide the greatest economic
opportunities, involving lesser risks and greater
returns. Larger game such as deer, javelina,
rabbit, and turkey are available along the coast but
involve greater risks to obtain.
Species diversity and distribution depend
largely on salinity levels throughout the different
environments. The hypersaline conditions of the
Laguna Madre preclude many species from
occupying this environment. Generally, species
diversity decreases away from the tidally influenced inlets and bays of the Laguna Madre, such
as Brazos Santiago Pass. Shellfish that can
tolerate the hypersaline conditions include
Laevicardium mortoni, Tellina tampaensis, and
Anomalocardia auberiana (Andrews 1981 ; Brown
et al. 1980:108). Fish, including black drum
(Pogonias cromis), speckled sea trout (Cynoscion
nebulosus), and redfish (Sciaenops ocellatus) also
are able to tolerate the waters of the Laguna
Madre. Inlets and bays of lower salinities, due to
tidal influences from the open Gulf or freshwater
run-off from the mainland, are inhabited by many
more shellfish species including Crassostrea spp.,
Ostrea spp., Crassinella spp., and Tellidora spp.
(Andrews 1981; Brown et al. 1980:108). Species
diversity and number are also higher in the surf
zone of the barrier islands. Shellfish include Arca
spp., Anadara spp., Busycon spp., Donax spp., and
a diverse number of crustaceans and fish (Brown et
al. 1980:108).
The coastal zone is inhabited by abundant
waterfowl which increase in availability seasonally
due to the many migratory birds, especially ducks
and geese, that winter on the south Texas coast.
The distribution and number of waterfowl are less
restricted by differences in salinities, and they
certainly were an important food source prehistorically in all environments of the coastal zone.

Fauna and Flora

Three distinctive plant communities occur
within the coastal zone, with their distributions
controlled by their varying tolerances to windborne
salt and saline soils and, to a lesser extent, by
surface elevations (Johnston 1955). The most
inland community is dominated by Gulf cordgrass
or sacahuista (Spartina spartinae) with rare
occurrences of Houstonia nigricans and Hybanthus
verticillatus platyphyllus (Johnston 1955: 112-116).
Among the more saline soils of the wind-tidal
flats and clay dunes and closer to the saltwater is
the Borrichia-Batis-Monanthochloe community
(Johnston 1955:117-118). The dominants of this
herbaceous community are bushy sea-oxeye
(Borrichia frutescens), salt-flat grass (Monanthochloe littoralis), and maritime saltwort (Batis
maritima). This community commonly occurs on
low-lying coastal clay soils and frequently
flooded, algal-mat-covered wind-tidal flats
surrounding clay dunes. Many of the clay dunes
support dense thorny brush, such as mesquite (P.
juliflora), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), trecul yucca
(Y. treculeana), common lantanta (L. horrida),
Texas ebony (P. flexicaule) , and Berlandier
fiddlewood (Citharexylum berlandieri). Grasses,
like the bunch grass Sporobolus wrightii, are also
common on the dunes (Brown et al. 1980: 108).
Nearest the strand in the most saline conditions
is the Batis-Salicornia-Suaeda community, a
community of succulent halophytes (Johnston 1955:
118-120).
The dominant plants include B.
maritima , Salicornia perennis , Salicornia bigelovii,
Cakile lanceolata geniculata, Suaeda conferta, and
Suaeda linearis.
A number of salt-tolerant grasses grow on the
mid-barrier flats and fore dunes of barrier islands,
including seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

This chapter presents an overview of the
prehistory and cultural chronology of the Lower
Rio Grande Valley and a summary of previous
archeological investigations associated with the
Hidalgo-Willacy drainage ditch project.

been characterized by small but highly mobile
bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of
Pleistocene megafauna. However, a more accurate
view of Paleoindian lifeways probably includes the
utilization of a much wider array of resources.
The late Pleistocene and early Holocene environment of the Lower Rio Grande Valley was
markedly different than today, offering different
resources and subsistence challenges. Paleoenvironmental data from stable isotope studies
suggest that temperatures may have been 10°F to
15.4°F cooler than today at the end of the
Pleistocene (Bousman et al. 1990:97-98).
Climatic conditions were also probably arid to
semiarid. Bousman et al. (1990:94, 98) have
suggested that plant communities were dominated
by C4 and/or CAM plants, such as prickly pear and
agave. Isolated Paleoindian projectile points
collected from surface contexts indicate that the
area was occupied by Paleoindian groups; however,
intact cultural deposits representing Paleoindian
occupations are unknown. A Folsom base was
collected from a site (41CF54) on Cayo Atascosa,
just south of the Laguna Atascosa (Anderson field
notes, TARL files). Other projectile points have
been collected from eolian dune fields in Willacy
County and the La Perdida Site in Starr County
(Mallouf et al. 1977:167-168; Weir 1956).
The Archaic period (7000- 800 B.P.) is also
poorly represented and understood. The Archaic
represents a shift to the hunting and gathering of a
wider array of animal and plant resources and a
decrease in group mobility (Willey and Phillips
1958:107-108). Early to middle Archaic sites are
extremely rare in the Lower Rio Grande Valley;
this most likely is due to the onset of more-xeric
conditions and eolian deflation of occupational

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
An understanding of the prehistory of the
Lower Rio Grande Valley remains elusive.
Detailed and extensive archeological investigations
prior to 1980 are lacking (Hester 1981 :119-128).
complexes and tool assemblages are not well
defined, and even projectile point chronology
(dominated by simple triangular styles) has not
been clearly established (although, see Jelks 1978).
The lack of an established absolute chronology for
the region further hinders an understanding of the
region's prehistory, as do the well-documented
land modifications and disturbances related to
historic agricultural and ranching activities
(Bousman et al. 1990:1 7-18; Day et al. 1981:1012; Mallouf et al. 1977:23-26). Attempts to
interpret the cultural chronology of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley rely heavily on comparsions of
artifact and site types with those from surrounding
areas such as the Lower Pecos, Central Gulf Coast,
Central Texas, and Northeastern Mexico (e.g.,
Black 1989; Mallouf et al. 1977).
The prehistoric cultural sequence of the
Lower Rio Grande Valley can be divided into three
broad periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric. The Paleoindian period (11,5007000 B.P.) represents the earliest known cultural
manifestation in North America but is poorly
known and/or represented in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley. The period is often described as having
13

Archeological and Geomorphological Investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY60

surfaces during the early and middle Holocene (see
Bousman et al. 1990; Hall et al. 1987). Evidence
of utilization of the Lower Rio Grande Valley by
Archaic peoples again comes from surfacecollected artifacts, "primarily by unstemmed
triangular thin bifaces, gouges, and infrequent
stemmed dart points" (Hall et al. 1987:17-18).
Late Archaic sites are not as infrequent, but often
their components are mixed with later Late
Prehistoric assemblages, e.g., 41HG118 (see Hall
et al. 1987). Human remains recovered from the
Lower Rio Grande Valley have yielded late
Archaic radiocarbon assays (Bousman et al. 1990:
99-100), providing the earliest conclusive evidence
of human occupation of the area. It is probably no
coincidence that the apparent increase in sites
during the late Archaic is coeval with the beginning
of landscape stability and soil development (Hall
et al. 1987:57-59). More-mesic conditions are
apparent throughout much of Texas around
2500 B.P. and are represented by a predominance
of C3 plants in the region (Bousman et al. 1990:9495).
MacNeish (1947) defined two Archaic
complexes, Abasolo and Repelo, for northeastern
Tamaulipas and the Lower Rio Grande Valley
based mainly on surface-collected artifacts. Based
on stratigraphic superpositioning, MacNeish (1958:
Table 30) estimated that the Repelo Complex dates
from 5000-4000 B.P. and the Abasolo Complex
from roughly 4000-2000 B.P. However, few sites
bearing Repelo and Abasolo components have been
excavated, and radiocarbon assays are not
available.
The Late Prehistoric (800-300 B.P.) is the
best known of the three periods. It is defined by
the presence of the bow and arrow and marked by
the production of small triangular arrow points
beginning around 800 B.P. (Hester 1981:122). The
emergence of ceramics and horticulture, which is
apparent during the Late Prehistoric period in other
parts of Texas, is absent or very nebulous in the
region. Increasingly xeric, but modern, conditions
emerged at this time. Stable carbon isotope
analysis suggests that plant communities were in a
state of flux and were marked by a steady increase
in C4 grasses (Bousman et al. 1990:94-98).
Sayles (1935) was the first to define a
cultural complex- the Brownsville Phase-for the
Lower Rio Grande Valley. MacNeish (1947, 1958:
186-192) later defined a Brownsville Complex,

based on the collections and work of Anderson
(1932), Sayles (1935), and Mason (1935).
MacNeish (1958) also defined a Barri! Complex
beginning around A.D. 1000 and slightly predating
the Brownsville Complex. The Brownsville and
Barri! complexes are characterized by a welldefined shell industry and were determined to be
Late Prehistoric based on the presence of small
triangular arrow points and Huastecan-like
ceramics indicative of the Panuco Periods V and
VI (MacNeish 1958:189). Prewitt (1974:62)
suggested that the Brownsville Complex was also
contemporaneous with the Rockport Phase to the
north on the central Gulf Coast of Texas. The
Barri! Complex is distinguished by the presence of
rare conical bone projectile points and abundant
shell columella projectile points, while the
Brownsville Complex is uniquely associated with
conical pumice pipes. Barri! Complex sites are
largely limited to the south side of the Rio Grande
in northeastern Tamaulipas, while Brownsville
Complex sites are situated north of the river.
MacNeish's assemblages, cultural complexes, and
their geographical distributions.however, are based
only on surface sites and surface-collected
artifacts. A few excavated burials and cemetery
sites have been attributed to the Brownsville
Complex, even though radiocarbon assays are not
available (Collins et al. 1969; Hester and Rodgers
1971; Hester and Ruecking 1969). The Ayala Site
is attributed to the Late Prehistoric Brownsville
Complex due to its stratigraphic position over an
earlier Repelo-Abasolo midden (Hester and
Ruecking 1969:147).
Historic aboriginal sites are noted by the
presence of materials of European origin, including
metal and glass projectile points, trade beads, and
wheelmade or glazed ceramics. Four historic
aboriginal sites (41CF8 and three other sites
discovered by A. E. Anderson) in Cameron County
have yielded glass arrow points and wheelmade or
glazed sherds (Anderson 1932; Prewitt 1974). The
latest record of aboriginal inhabitants in the area
was in A.D. 1886 near Reynosa, Mexico (Salinas
1986:258).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The earliest archeological investigations in
the region can be attributed to A. E. Anderson, a
civil engineer from Brownsville, Texas. Between
14

Chapter 2: Prehistoric Background

1908 and 1940, he made extensive systematic
surface collections from sites north and south of
the river in the Rio Grande delta (Anderson 1932).
Later, Sayles (1935), Campbell (1947), Kelley
(1947), and MacNeish (1947, 1958) defined
cultural complexes for the Lower Rio Grande
Valley and surrounding regions based on their own
wo1k and Anderson's collections.
Ensuing
archeological investigations were few and simplistic. Most involved further archeological surveys
and revisitation of earlier recorded sites (e.g., Hall
and Grombacher 1974; Prewitt 1974) and salvage
excavation of human burials (Collins et al. 1969;
Hester and Rodgers 1971; Hester and Ruecking
1969; Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979). By far the
most intensive and comprehensive archeological
investigations have occurred since 1976 and are
associated with the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch project. These investigations have documented 161 archeological sites, 1 of which 11 have
undergone testing or excavation. Geomorphological and paleoenvironmental studies also have been
carried out in association with many of the
archeological investigations. These investigations
have consistently revealed the unique nature of the
archeological record in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley- a record characterized by disturbed
contexts, widely variable site densities, short-term
occupations, and low artifact densities.
The first cultural resources investigation
related to the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch was
an archeological survey conducted by the Office of
the State Archeologist for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District (see Mallouf et al.
1977). Since then, all additional archeological
investigations have been conducted by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and local sponsors Hidalgo County
Drainage District No. 1 and Willacy County
Drainage District No. 1. This report represents the
final archeological investigations associated with
the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch project.
The initial survey in 1976 sampled 12 areas,
each measuring 2 x 2 km, and documented 49 sites
(Mallouf et al. 1977). The goal of this survey was
to provide a predictive assessment of cultural

resources expected to be impacted by the construction of the drainage ditch. The project universe
was divided into seven environmental zones on the
basis of topography, geology, hydrology, and to a
lesser extent floral communities. The 12 survey
areas sampled the environmental zones that were
expected to be traversed (six of seven zones) by
the drainage ditch. Examination of the survey
results led Mallouf et al. (1977:244-254) to
suggest that the intensity of future surveys should
vary from zone to zone due to differences in
predicted site density and the extent of humaninduced land-surface modification. Mallouf et al.
(1977) also provided a review of the Lower Rio
Grande's prehistory, ethnohistory, and previous
archeological investigations.
In 1980 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
along with local sponsors Hidalgo County Drainage
District No. l and Willacy County Drainage
District No. 1, funded archeological surveys of the
drainage ditch rights-of-way in Hidalgo and
Willacy counties. The investigations included a
sample survey of different ditch segments,
including the Main Floodwater Channel, the North
Main Drain, the South Main Drain, the Edinburg
Stub, the East Lateral, the Southwest Lateral, and
pumping stations along the North Floodway and the
Arroyo Colorado (see Day et al. 1981:2-4). Many
of these ditch segments had already been excavated
at the time of the investigations, so the survey
focused on the exposed banks of the ditches. The
local sponsors funded the survey of the proposed
North Ditch, which runs parallel to and south of the
South Main Drain. In all, the 1980 survey documented 54 new archeological sites, two of which
(41WY50 and 41WY60) were selected for limited
testing. In addition, 10 previously recorded sites
were documented. Day et al. (1981) recommended
that 15 of these sites, including 41WY50 and
41WY60, warranted further investigations and that
testing be conducted to determine their eligibility
for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places.
The investigations by Day et al. ( 1981)
followed the recommendations of Mallouf et al.
( 1977) by varying the survey intensity of certain
channel segments depending on the environmental
zone in which the segment was located. Day et al.
(1981) also produced the first radiocarbon assay
from the Lower Rio Grande Valley. This uncorrected assay of 540 ± 110 B.P. was on the bone

finds that were given site trinomial numbers during earlier
projects.

apatite fraction of a human burial recovered from
site 41 WY50. A second radiocarbon assay was
later obtained from the collagen fraction, revealing
a much earlier o 13C-corrected age of 1415 ±
140 B.P. (Bousman et al. 1990:99).
Two of the 15 sites recommended for
National Register testing, prehistoric sites 41 WY71
and 41 WY72, were tested in the summer of 1981
(see Day 1981).
These investigations were
sponsored by the Hidalgo County Drainage District
No. 1 and the Willacy County Drainage District
No. 1 because they were recorded during the
survey of the proposed North Ditch, which also
was funded by the local sponsors. Site 41WY71
did not yield information warranting its nomination
to the National Register. However, site 41WY72
was considered eligible for listing on the National
Register, which resulted in a southward shift of the
ditch alignment to avoid any significant impacts to
the site. Site 41 WY72 was interpreted as a
stratified, semipermanent campsite containing a
relatively high density of cultural materials (Day
1981:34). Artifact distributions suggested that
discrete activity areas were present. Within the
artifact assemblage were obsidian debitage and
ceramic sherds, indicating that the site is Late
Prehistoric in age (Day 1981:34). Obsidian source
data, which was not available at the time of
publication (i.e., Day 1981), is presented here for
the first time. Two obsidian flakes recovered from
41WY72 were submitted to Dr. Thomas R. Hester
for trace element analysis as part of the Texas
Obsidian Project (TOP). Based on the x-ray
fluorescence trace element analysis performed by
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley,
California, the likely source of the two flakes is
Cerro de las N avajas (Pachuca), in the State of
Hidalgo, Mexico (TOP specimen 166, BA
<15 ppm, Ce= 119 ± 12 ppm; TOP specimen 167,
BA <26 ppm, Ce = 120 ± 13 ppm [Hester 1993]).
In 1982, archeological investigations
sponsored by the Willacy County Drainage District
No. 1 were conducted along the Main Floodwater
Channel, consisting of proposed and existing ditch
segments (see Mercado-Allinger 1983). The
investigations included a survey during which 10
sites were recorded. Five of these sites (41WY84,
41WY86, 41WY89, 41WY90, and 41WY91) were
assessed as being potentially eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places. Testing
was recommended for these sites prior to construe-

lion of the proposed channel segments. All five
sites were similar in terms of integrity, topographic
location, and cultural materials present. Due to
these similarities, one site (41WY84) was selected
for initial testing to better assess the integrity and
nature of these resources. The testing of 41WY84
revealed that the site consists of thinly dispersed
cultural materials in a highly disturbed context and
did not warrant further investigations; therefore,
testing of the remaining sites was canceled.
In November 1985, excavated segments of the
ditch in Hidalgo and Willacy counties were
surveyed and 13 sites were documented (see Hall
et al. 1987). Many of these sites had not been
visible before ditch construction, and many could
be discovered only after prolonged exposure of the
excavated ditch slopes to the elements. Thus,
postconstruction survey actually increased the
discovery rate of the region's cultural resources.
Archeological investigations recommenced in
the spring and summer of 1986 and included survey
and testing and assessments of previously recorded
sites (Hall et al. 1987). Geomorphological and
paleontological studies also were conducted.
Surveys were conducted along existing and
proposed ditch segments in Hidalgo and Willacy
counties. In all, 43 sites, including the 13 sites
recorded in November 1985, were documented.
One of these, the Sardinas Resaca Site (41HG 118),
was intensively investigated through the excavation
of backhoe trenches and test pits and a controlled
surface collection. Artifacts recovered from the
site suggest that it was occupied during the late
Archaic and possibly the Late Prehistoric periods.
Deposits containing cultural materials were found
to be severely disturbed due to recent landscape
modifications.
Geomorphological studies and
radiocarbon assays from soil humates provided
useful insights into the age and development of the
landforms associated with the site.
Paleontological studies focused on the
recovery of seven Pleistocene tortoise (Gopherus
hexagonatus) specimens. Although the specimens
apparently were not associated with human
activity, they did provide important paleoenvironmental information (Westgate 1987).
Hall et al. (1987:76) also reviewed the status
of all of the sites and isolated finds documented
through the various cultural resources investigations associated with the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch. At the time, recommendations for
16

Chapter 2: Prehistoric Background

32 sites were considered complete, either through
testing, monitoring, or avoidance. Two sites,
41WY72 (Day 1981) and the Sardinas Resaca Site
(Hall et al. 1987) had undergone testing and were
declared eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. Two other sites,
41WY71 (Day 1981) and 41WY84 (MercadoAl~inger 1983) had been tested and were determined to be ineligible for listing on the National
Register, along with four other sites (41WY86,
41WY89, 41WY90, and 41WY91) on the basis of
similarities to 41WY84. Recommendations for the
other 24 sites were considered complete because
the sites were either avoided or monitored,
revealing that further work was not necessary.
Recommendations for 56 sites, at that time
yet to be completed, included National Register
testing of 26 sites and monitoring of 30 sites.
Eighteen of the 26 sites recommended for testing
were recorded during work sponsored by the
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and the
Willacy County Drainage District No. 1. Hall et
al. (1987:77) suggested that a sample of seven
sites initially be tested and that the research
strategies include four specific approaches: (1)
geomorphological and stratigraphic studies of sites
as they are exposed in the ditch walls; (2)
obtaining chronometric dates from culturally
relevant strata through radiocarbon assays of soil
humates or other organic materials; (3) hand
excavation of an average of 4 m2 for each site and
utilizing features exposed in ditch walls to the
maximum advantage; and (4) opportunistic
collection of additional cultural materials that
might be exposed in the ditch walls.
Prior to archeological testing, additional
survey and site monitorings were conducted in
1988 (see Quigg et al. 1989). Five additional
prehistoric sites (41HG 135 through 41HG139) were
recorded along proposed realignments of the
Southwest and Mercedes laterals and the Rado and
West Main drains in Hidalgo County. It was
recommended that all five sites be monitored after
construction (Quigg et al. 1989). In addition, four
previously recorded sites, including the Sardinas
Resaca Site, were revisited and their current status
evaluated.
The archeological testing proposed by Hall et
al. (1987) was undertaken in the summer of 1989
(see Bousman et al. 1990). Five sites (41HG128,
41WY112, 41WY113, 41WY134, and 41WY140)

were recommended for Phase II testing in a 1988
work plan submitted to the Hidalgo County
Drainage District No. 1 and the Willacy County
Drainage District No. 1.
An earlier technical proposal by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. identified four major goals for
archeological investigations in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley and provided a theoretical model of
hunter-gatherer mobility and territorial organization. The four major goals were to develop the
ethnohistorical, archeological, and paleoenvironmental records, and then, from this data base,
develop a synthesis of prehistoric occupations.
Past ethnohistorical research (Campbell 1988;
Ruecking 1953, 1955; Salinas 1986) provides a
detailed ethnohistorical record, and no further
primary research was necessary. It was recommended, however, that additional archeological and
paleoenvironmental data were needed.
With these goals in mind, National Register
testing was carried out at the five prehistoric sites.
These investigations included stable isotope
analyses and radiocarbon dating to study paleoenvironments and prehistoric human diets, as well
as reanalysis of artifacts from other sites. The
synthesis of this information resulted in the
development of testable models of hunter-gatherer
land use, incorporating optimal foraging theory and
assuming that territorial divisions limited access to
resources.
The nine environmental zones presented in
Day et al. (1981) were condensed into five zones
of resource exploitation by Bousman et al. (1990:
10-17). Three models were proposed. Model I
proposes an unlimited-access exploitation pattern,
where the region was occupied by a single group
with a low population density. Model II proposes
multiple groups and group territories focused on
the exploitation of resources on the Rio Grande
floodplain and less-intensive use of areas north of
the floodplain. Model III proposes multiple group
territories focused on the coast and less-intensive
use of inland areas. These models grew out of
initial formulations by Hester (1976, 1981), which
were modified in the 1986 technical proposal.
The limited stable isotope analyses and
radiocarbon dating done by Bousman et al. (1990)

Given that the paramenters of the three models
affected both subsistence activities and resource
procurement patterns, it was assumed that an
analysis of lithic assemblages could serve as a test
of best fit between the models and the archeological data. An analysis of the frequencies and
distributions of 12 lithic artifact types (e.g.,
resharpening flakes, cores, exhausted tools, earlyreduction debitage, and manufacture failures) from
the five tested sites and other documented and
tested sites in the region was performed. The
collected data were inconclusive, although they
slightly favored Model I, the unlimited-access
exploitation pattern, over Model II or Model III.
While these investigations found that none of
the five sites were eligible for listing on the
National Register, many important aspects of the
Lower Rio Grande Valley's geomorphology and
past environments were brought to light. Valuable
chronometric data, which in past investigations had
been elusive, also were gained.

increase in C4 grasses in the late Holocene
(Bousman et al. 1990:94-98). The collagen
fraction from the human remains recovered at
41WY50 produced a c5 13 C-corrected assay of 1415
± 140 B.P. The collagen fraction from human bone
at 41WY113 produced a c5 13C-corrected age of
1088 ± 90 B.P. (Bousman et al. 1990:99). The
stable isotope data from the human remains
suggested that distinct coastal and inland dietary
patterns may have existed. The remains of a
specimen of late Pleistocene tortoise (Gopherus
hexagonatus) collected during previous work were
also radiocarbon dated.
A c5 13C-corrected
radiocarbon age of9360 ± 415 B.P. on apatite was
produced.
Bousman et al. (1990:37) viewed the procurement of subsistence resources and lithic raw
materials as subject to the same kinds of constraints. Lithic assemblages were considered
integral elements of subsistence-related activities.

Field and Documentation Methods

The archeological field investigations at
41WY50 and 41WY60 included mapping of the
sites and excavation of l-x-1-m test units and
backhoe trenches. The sites were first re-located
through the use of topographic maps and site
descriptions by Day et al. (1981). Once the sites
were located, initial surveys of the site areas were
carried out, examining erosional faces for cultural
materials and looking for prime test unit locations.
Baselines were laid out using a transit and 60-m
tape along the crests of the dunes. Initial test units
were laid out along the baselines at various
intervals at the discretion of the Project Archeologist. Ensuing test units were placed either on the
grid or off the grid over selected features that were
exposed in the walls of backhoe trenches. Test
units were excavated in 10-cm arbitrary levels.
The excavation levels were numbered sequentially
(in reverse geologic order) starting with Level 1 at
the the ground surface. Vertical control was
maintained by a line-level datum located at the
surface of either the southeast comer of the test
unit or the comer with the highest surface elevation. Elevations were obtained through transit
readings. Excavated matrix from each level was
water screened, with 75% being passed through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth; the remaining
portion (the northwest quadrant of each level) was
passed through 1/16-inch-window screen. Materials recovered from the 1/4-inch and 1/16-inch

screens were bagged separately and labeled with
appropriate provenience data.
Backhoe trenches were utilized to detect
buried features and cultural materials, as well as to
provide geomorphological data. The backhoe
trenches were placed on-site at the discretion of
the Project Archeologist. A few backhoe trenches
were placed off-site for additional geomorphological data. Backhoe trench excavations were
monitored by the Project Archeologist or a member
of the field crew. Upon completion of the
excavations, the trench walls were cleaned and
selected walls were profiled. These profiles depict
the depth, thickness, and dip of each natural zone.
A contour map of each site was produced
from transit readings. The test units, backhoe
trenches, line level datums, baseline datums, and
general topography were mapped with the transit
and metric stadia rod. Mean sea level (MSL) was
used as a vertical datum. Normally, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) would
be used as a vertical datum because it is more
accurate than MSL; however, compactional
subsidence along the Texas coast has rendered the
NGVD unreliable. For mapping purposes, the
water levels at the sites were read with the transit,
and the time of day was recorded with these transit
readings. Mean hourly tidal or water level records
(relative to MSL and NGVD) for Port Mansfield,
Texas, were provided by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (1993). The
NOAA records reveal that the tidal range in the
area is normally less than 9 cm, and therefore for
mapping purposes, the water level readings were
given the value of "0.0" m and used as a vertical
control.
Documentation of the field investigations
includes photographic and written records. These
include 35-mm color slides and black-and-white
prints, photograph logs, test unit excavation forms
recorded by excavation level, feature drawings and
forms, field inventories of materials recovered,
backhoe trench profile sketches and detailed
stratigraphic and sedimentary descriptions, transit
and mapping notes, sketch maps, and a daily
journal kept by the Project Archeologist.

and defined at sites 41WY50 and 41WY60. Many
of these were detected and documented by their
cross-section exposures in the walls of backhoe
trenches. Detection and designation of features
proved to be a complex task for several reasons.
All but two of the features are very shallow, small,
basin-shaped hearths. Feature fills consist mainly
of small dispersed pieces of charcoal, ashy
sediments, and some oxidized sediments. The
problematic task of identifying and defining such
thin, ephemeral features was compounded by the
fact that many of them occurred within dark
organic A soil horizons or zones throughout the
clay dunes. Some of these zones are thin and
discontinuous, which made them at times look very
much like discrete hearth features.
A set of conservative criteria was therefore
utilized for defining hearth features to separate
them from natural anomalies that resemble
features. Feature designation considered morphology, content, and composition. Features had to be
basin shaped, regardless of their thickness, in cross
section and have distinct boundaries or limits.
Features, regardless of size, had to contain
charcoal and ashy sediments. Oxidized sediments
along the bottom of the feature also were among
the criteria for feature designation. Of course,
some of these criteria disclosed a stronger presence
than others, varying from feature to feature. Thus,
if one criterion was distinctly or profoundly present
while the presence of the other two was weak or
ephemeral, feature designation was assigned.
Since almost all of the features were exposed
and detected in the profiles of backhoe trench
walls, feature documentation included detailed
profiling and photographing the feature cross
section. Small blocks of feature fill and surrounding matrix were cut from the profiles of two
features at 41 WYSO for micromorphological
analysis (see Appendix E).
Selected features were excavated by placing
test units adjacent to the backhoe trenches where
the features were exposed. Features excavated in
test units were drawn and photographed in plan
view. All feature fill was collected, bagged, and
labeled with appropriate provenience information
for later analyses, including radiocarbon dating and
pollen/phytolith studies. Elevations of the tops and
bottoms of features were noted by the line-level
datum located at the corner of the test unit and
were recorded on feature forms.

GEOMORPHOLOGICAL AND
PALEOENVIRONMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
Geomorphological and paleoenvironmental
characteristics provide a setting for and interact
with cultural systems (Butzer 1982:6), making their
study an integral and necessary part of any
archeological investigation. Geomorphological and
paleoenvironmental processes . also represent
important factors of site formation. The geomorphological investigations included the documentation of backhoe trench profiles, sediment grain-size
analysis, and dating of sediment/soil humate
samples by radiocarbon assay. Selected backhoe
trench profiles were recorded in detailed (see
Appendix A). Each profile description is based on
the examination of a 50-100-cm-wide column
within the trench wall. The neutral term "zone" is
used to allow both stratigraphic and pedogenic
variation in the profile to be described under the
same nomenclature.
Each zone is numbered
sequentially from the top (surface) down. Munsell
color (moist), · consistency (moist), texture,
structure, type and abundancy of inclusions, and
lower boundary characteristics are described for
each zone according to the guidelines and criteria
presented by Buol et al. (1980) and Birkeland
(1984). Final soil horizon classifications were
made based on the guidelines of Birkeland (1984)
and Bettis (1984). Selected sediment/soil samples
were submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc. for chronometric dating by radiocarbon assay and to the Soils
and Physical Geography Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for sediment grainsize and soluble salts analyses (see Appendix B).
The radiocarbon assays provide the chronological framework for reconstruction of the
geomorphic history of the clay dunes. The assays
on sediment/soil samples are on organic materials
or humates extracted from the samples. The
organic matter in sediments is detrital, having been
deposited with the elastic sediments. Therefore,
21

the radiocarbon assays provide approximate ages
of deposition. The humates in soils, however,
represent organic matter that was produced on
stable surfaces and then translocated through
illuviation into the subsurface, where it is bound by
clays. The assays thus represent estimates of
mean residence time (MRT) and provide a reliable
measure only of minimum age (see Stein 1992:
202-203). All radiocarbon age calculations are
based on a 5,568-year half-life for 14C. All
assays have been corrected for carbon isotope
fractionation, and their c5 13 C values are presented.
Calibration factors based on the 20-year atmospheric record of Pearson and Stuiver (1993) and
Stuiver and Pearson (1993) have been applied to
the corrected assays to provide calendrical dates.
The paleoenvironmental studies involved a
preliminary pollen/phytolith analysis, conducted by
J. Philip Dering of the Palynology Laboratory,
Texas A&M University (see Appendix D), and
stable carbon isotope studies of past plant
communities based on the c5 13C values provided by
Beta Analytic, Inc. on the soil humate samples.
The buried organic-rich A horizons and zones
throughout the clay dunes provide an excellent
opportunity for reconstruction of past plant
communities through stable carbon isotope
analysis. Researchers have argued that increases
in c5 13C values provide a measure of change in C4
versus C, plants in the overall plant community
(Cerling 1984; Cerling and Hay 1986). Therefore,
the c5 13C values from soil humates should be able
to assess changes between C3 and C4 plant production and biomass (Cerling et al. 1989; Dzurec et al.
1985; Haas et al. 1986; Natelhoffer and Fry 1988).
All trees and many shrubs and grasses are C,
plants, while some grasses and herbaceous plants
are C4 plants. The photosynthetic pathway used
and the chemical composition of the carbon
molecules produced differ between C, and C4
plants. Plants of the C3 group utilize the CalvinBenson photosynthetic pathway, which produces a
three-carbon molecule (phosphoglycerate), while
C4 plants utilize the Hatch-Slack pathway, with a
four-carbon molecule (oxaloacetate, aspartate, or
malate) as the first stable product of C02 fixation.
The Calvin-Benson pathway is more "primitive"
(Smith and Robbin 1974), while the Hatch-Slack
pathway has developed relatively recently,
probably in reaction to decreasing amounts of C02
in the atmosphere (Smith 1976).

-,-,::--

Archeological and Geomorphological Investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY60

During photosynthesis, a plant utilizes C02
consisting of either 13C or 12C. Unlike 14C, these
two isotopes of carbon are stable and do not decay,
and they are readily available in the atmosphere.
Because of slight weight differences in the two
stable carbon isotopes, 13C being heavier due to an
extra neutron, the two photosynthetic pathways
utilize 13C and 12C in slightly different ratios. The
C, and C4 pathways use the same basic photosynthetic processes; however, the C4 pathway has
additional steps which allow it to efficiently use
more of the available carbon (in the form of CO,).
The C3 pathway utilizes less of the available
carbon because it discriminates more against 13C
(Vogel 1980). This difference has two effects on
C4 plants. First, C4 plants are more resistant to
water stress, high temperatures, and high irradiances but less tolerant of cold temperatures,
especially minimum temperatures during the
growing season (Tieszen and Imbamba 1980).
Consequently, C,/C, plant ratios reflect past and
present climatic conditions such as mean annual
temperatures and precipitation (see Cerling and
Hay 1986; Livingston and Clayton 1980; Teeri and
Stowe 1976). Second, 13C is relatively more
common in C, than in C, plants, rendering the
isotopic difference between C3 and C4 plants
measurable by mass spectrometer. Plants in a
third group, Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)
plants which include most succulents, have the
ability to operate as C, or C, plants depending on
the environmental conditions. The most common
CAM plants in South Texas-prickly pear and
agaves- normally function as C, plants (Eickmeier
and Bender 1976). Therefore, this analysis groups
CAM plants with C4 plants.
The measurement of carbon isotope ratios
(o 13 C) is calibrated from the 13 C/12C ratio in a
marine belemnite (Belemnitella americana) from
the Cretaceous-age Peedee Formation of South
Carolina (Craig 1953). Known as the PDB
standard, this fossilized mollusc has a tremendous
amount of 13 C in relation to 12C and is used as the
zero reference point for measurements of 13C/12c
ratios. Most terresterial sources such as living
plants have much less 13C, resulting in negative
numbers compared to the PDB standard. The
difference between the PDB standard and the
13
C/12C ratio of a given sample is represented by
o 13C and is expressed in parts per thousand ( /00).
For example, a o 13 C value of -JO /00 with respect
0

0

22

to the PDB standard indicates that the sample
contains 1% less 13C than the marine belemnite or
PDB standard.
The preindustrial atmospheric o 13C value I~
estimated at -6.0 °/oo. Plants of the C, group have
much less 13 C, and their average 13C value is
approximately -27 °/00; C4 and CAM plants have
more 13C, and their average o 13C value is near
-13 °/oo (Ceding et al. 1989:138). In materials
that incorporate both types of plants (i.e., soils,
pedogenic carbonates, and bones), the o 13 C value
should range between -27 and -13 °/oo. Given no
further chemical changes, known as fractionations,
the specific value should reflect the relative
biomass contribution of c, and C4 plants.
However, further fractionations do occur in most
materials such as soils. All stable isotopes
undergo fractionation due to different mass
weights, which render them less likely (for heavier
isotopes) or more likely (for lighter isotopes) to
react with other elements. It is this process that
allows meaningful stable isotope analysis.
The incorporation of carbon isotopes into
plants through the process of photosynthesis is the
first major fractionation step. Thus, C3 plants have
fractionated the atmospheric source to a greater
extent than C4 plants. As carbon isotopes pass
from plants into soils, additional fractionations
occur affecting the isotopic configuration. Besides
the C,/C4 composition of the plant community,
several other factors affect the isotope composition
of soils: (1) variations in atmospheric 6 13C values;
(2) differential preservation of 13C plant components such as holocellulose and lignin; (3) variations in soil organic inputs; (4) decomposition of
organic materials; (5) illuviation; and (6) anthropogenic modifications (Ceding et al. 1989; Dzurec
et al. 1985; Natelhoffer and Fry 1988). However,
as explained below, only one of these variables is
considered to have affected the soil hum ate
samples in this analysis.
Data from coal derived from terrestrial
plants and early Pliocene C, and C4 grass cuticles
suggest that atmospheric o 13C values have not
changed by more than 1 or 2 °/00 since the Tertiary
or earlier (Deines 1980; Nambudiri et al. 1978).
Since the samples for this analysis are clearly late
Holocene in age, effects from variations in the o 13C
values of the atmosphere are considered negligible.
Differential preservation of plant components could
possibly affect the 6 13C values in soils; however,

\ ,,

Chapter 3: Objectives and Methods of Investigations

this appears to be a factor for only short periods
after the introduction of dead plant materials into
a soil because the plants decompose rapidly
(Dzurec et al. 1985:18; Natelhoffer and Fry 1988:
1637). Therefore, it is unlikely that differential
preservation of various plant components or variations in soil organic inputs would pose a problem
for soils more than 100 years old or soils isolated
from introduced nondecomposed plant materials by
burial (Bousman et al. 1990:93). Anthropogenic
modifications of the plant community through
agriculture are nonexistent, although overgrazing by
cattle may have a slight effect on the modern
surface soil. Effects of illuviation are regarded as
insignificant because the samples were taken from
near the top of the thin (ca. 10 cm) humic-rich A
horizons, which are separated by zones of relatively unweathered sand-clay parent material.
Only microbial decomposition of organic
materials is regarded as having an effect on the
6 13C values of the soil humate samples. Microbial
decomposition enriches the 13C content of soils
from the isotope values of the original plants
(Cerling et al. 1989; Dzurec et al. 1985;
Natelhoffer and Fry 1988). Generally, 6 13C values
increase with depth in single soil solums as total
carbon decreases, implying that a reduction of
carbon reflects greater decomposition of soil
organics (Natelhoffer and Fry 1988). Therefore,
decomposition tends to increase the 6 13C values,
while organic inputs act to decrease the 6 13C

23

values with the introduction of plant material.
Since decomposition has the final fractionation
effect, this must be considered in paleoenvironmental reconstructions (Bousman et al. J990:93).
Dzurec et al. (1985:18) and Natelhoffer and
Fry (1988:1635) suggest that a +3 to +4 °/oo
enrichment in 13C occurs ·due to the microbial
decomposition of organic materials in soils. Soil
humate 6 13C values can be compensated for this
fractionation effect, and the relative contribution of
C3 versus CJCAM plants can be calculated through
the following formula (Bousman et al. 1990):
Estimated%ofC3PlantBiomass

((IJ"~-~~i~ + 131.

This formula assumes that the mean 6 13C
value for C3 plants is -27 °/oo and the mean 6 13C
value for CJCAM plants is -13 °/oo. It also
assumes that 13C enrichment of soils is +3.5 °/oo
(Bousman et al. 1990:94). However, it should be
noted that there is disagreement on the mean 6 13C
values and the degree of fractionation used. For
instance, Bender (1968) gives a mean value of -25
and -12 °/oo for C3 and C4 plants, respectively, and
Tieszen et al. (1979) propose different means of
-28.0 and-12.5 °/oo. The microbial decomposition
degree of fractionation of 3.5 °/00 is slightly
smaller than the 4.4 °/00 suggested by Cerling et al.
(1989:138). These differences, however, only
result in marginally different estimates of the C,/C4
plant biomass.

RESULTS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

SITE 41WY50

A subsurface probe measuring 150 x 60 cm
was.placed on top of the dune over the burial at the
edge of the erosional scarp. It was excavated to a
depth of 180 cm below the ground surface. The
human burial was removed from between 112 and
133 cm, along with several modified bone fragments and canid teeth. Two shallow, basin-shaped
hearths also were encountered. Both consisted of
charcoal flecks, ashy sediments, and a few burned
clay lumps. The excavated profile revealed 15
natural strata, consisting of brown to grayish brown
clays and silts that became increasingly sandier
down-profile.
.
A sample of the human bone was radfocarbon
dated to 540 ± 110 B.P. (Prewitt 1981:413).
However, this assay was on bone apatite, and it
was not corrected for the effects of carbon isotope
fractionation. A sample of collagen from the bones
was later assayed and yielded a c5 13 C-corrected
age of 1415 ± 140 B.P. (Bousman et al. 1990:99).

Site Description
Site 41 WY50 is located on the mainland
coast of the Laguna Madre on the El Sanz Ranch
(Figure 6). It lies 4.4 km east of the drainage
ditch outfall and 2.6 km west of Josephine Island.
The elevation of the site is less than 4.5 m above
mean sea level. It is situated on the backside
remnant of a clay dune and the wave-cut or
truncated windward side of the dune. Low, dense,
thorny brush, including trecul yucca and prickly
pear, covers the backside of the dune. Common
open grassy areas are found along the erosional
areas and scattered throughout the brush. The
sloping, truncated, windward side of the dune is
virtually barren of vegetation and is littered with
drift debris. Downslope and east of this area is an
active wind-tidal flat. Burned pumice, a piece of
burned shell, and fish otoliths were observed
eroding out of the erosional scarp of the dune and
onto the truncated windward side. Site boundaries
measure approximately 90-100 m along the northsouth axis of the dune and 20-30 m east-west.

Work Accomplished
The current investigations at site 41 WY50
included hand excavation of nine 1-x-1-m test
units; mechanical excavation of 11 backhoe
trenches; collection of 82 sediment samples for
radiocarbon assays, grain-size and soluble salts
analyses, and pollen/phytolith analysis; and site
mapping.
The depths of the test units ranged from
100 cm in Test Unit 9 to 150 cm in Test Unit 8.
The 11 backhoe trenches ranged in length from 7.6
to 21.3 m, with the mean being 10.6 m, and in
depth from 1.3 to 2.4 m, with the mean being
1.6 m. Nine of the 11 trenches (Backhoe Trenches
1-9) were excavated from the erosional east face
of the dune to the western backslope perpendicular

Previons Investigations
Site 41WY50 was recorded by Day et al.
(1981) during a survey of the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch outfall area. Surface cultural
materials were observed along 100-125 m of the
eastern erosional face of the clay dune. These
consisted of the upper portion of a human cranium,
five long bone fragments, two marine shell
fragments (one with edge damage), seven fish
otoliths, and several marine and terrestrial
gastropods.

to the long axis of the dune. Backhoe Trench 10
ran parallel to the long axis of the dune, west of
Backhoe Trenches 7 and 8. Backhoe Trench 11
was placed on the truncated dune surface, running
west to east from the erosional dune face to the
wind-tidal flat. Eight localities or profiles in
seven of the trenches were described in detail (see
Appendix A). One wall along the length of each of
five backhoe trenches (Backhoe Trenches 2, 7-9,
and 11) was completely profiled.
Of the 82 sediment samples collected for
various analyses, 8 were submitted for radiocarbon
dating, 35 for grain-size analysis, 5 for soluble
salts analysis, and I for pollen/phytolith analysis.
The fill collected from Features I, 3, 10, and 11
was floated, and charcoal was extracted for
radiocarbon dating; unfortunately, these charcoal
samples were lost en route to Beta Analytic, Inc.
Two samples of feature fill from Features 3 and 10
also were analyzed for pollen and phytoliths. Two
small blocks of sediment and feature fill were cut
from Features 9 and 10 for micromorphological
analysis (see Appendix E) ..
Site mapping was completed with a transit
and metric stadia rod. Two permanent datums
were set in concrete and stamped with the site
number and date. One datum was labeled "Baseline datum," and the other was labeled "Hub A."

Materials Recovered

The cultural affiliation of the materials
recovered from site 41WY50 is extremely. tenuous.
Definite artifacts such as lithics, ceramics; worked
shells, or modified or burned bones were not
recovered. The materials that were recovered
consist of 270 fauna! remains and 20 gravel- and
pebble-sized pieces of pumice (Table 1). The
fauna! remains include elements of turtle, fish,
rodents, and bird (see Appendix C). Many of the
skeletal elements are small and fragmentary, but
surprisingly, over 70% are identifiable. Most of
the fauna! remains (n = 202) were recovered from
the upper levels (1-5) of the test units, proveniences that are well above any cultural feature.
Only 18 specimens are associated with a feature
(Feature 3); however, they are not burned, cut
marks are not evident, and only 1 specimen is
identifiable.
Most of the 20 pieces of pumice were
recovered from Level I of the test units. Four
pieces appear to be burned but are not associated
with a feature, although one piece is associated
with two charcoal chunks in Level 1 of Test Unit
6.
Because pumice floats, it commonly is
deposited by tidal storm surges on the wind-tidal
flats and clay dunes of the south Texas coast.

Ten cultural features were encountered at
41 WY50 within the backhoe trench profiles and
test units. One additional feature, Feature 4, was
found to be a rodent/tortoise burrow or deu and
therefore is not discussed further. Most of the
features occur within organic-rich A horizons or
lenses, making feature designation and feature
boundaries difficult to define. These organic-rich
zones represent old sloping surfaces or soils on the
leeward side of the dune. Often the dip of the
features is dictated by the slope of the old surface.
Features l, 3, 10, and 11 were completely or
partially excavated. With the exception of Feature
11, all are small, shallow, basin-shaped hearths.
The feature fill consists mainly of small pieces of
charcoal, ashy sediments, and some oxidized
sediments. Surprisingly, burned clay lumps, which
are fairly common in small hearth features of the
region, were absent (cf. Headrick 1991; Hester
1971; Smith 1982). Burned clay lumps are
considered to be natural products of the intense
heat or fire within the shallow earthen basins
(Corbin 1963; Huebner 1986). The absence of
burned clay lumps suggests that the fires were not
intense, probably fueled by grass, and/or the
utilization of the hearths was for only a very short
period of time.

Feature 2
Feature 2 was exposed in the south wall of
Backhoe Trench 8. It was not excavated but is
documented through its cross-section exposure in
the trench profile. Feature 2 is a shallow, basinshaped hearth, measuring 55 cm east-west and
2.0-5.5 cm thick. The top of the feature is at 8694 cm below the ground surface. The feature fill
consists of charcoal flecks and ashy sediment.

Feature 3
Feature 3 was exposed in the south wall of
Backhoe Trench 7 and excavated by Test Units 5
and 7 (Figure 8). Feature 3 is a shallow, basinshaped hearth, which when first exposed in the
backhoe trench wall measured 63 cm long;
however, upon further excavation, the feature was
found to be 104 cm long, at least 44 cm wide, and
3-5 cm thick. The top of the feature is 62 to
79 cm below the ground surface at Test Unit 5.
Feature 3 was probably oval shaped to amorphous
in plan view. The feature fill consists of charcoal
chunks and flecks, charcoal-stained sediments, and
ashy sediments. The eastern half of the feature is
discrete and dips to the west, while the western
half is less discrete. Eighteen fauna! specimens
were recovered from the feature, only one of which
is identifiable (cf. Texas gopher tortoise). None
are burned, and they reveal several gnaw marks.

Feature 1
Feature 1 was exposed in the south wall of
Backhoe Trench 9 and excavated by Test Unit 9
(Figure 7). The feature is a shallow, basin-shaped
hearth, which when first exposed in the backhoe
trench wall measured 40 cm east-west, but upon
further excavation, the feature was found to be
47 cm east-west, at least 14 cm north-south, and
4-5 cm thick. The top of the feature is at 7273 cm below the ground surface at Test Unit 9.
Feature 1 was probably circular to oval in plan
view. The fill consists of charcoal flecks and ashy
sediment. Feature boundaries range from distinct
to diffuse, with clearer boundaries at the east end
of the feature.

They are considered to be intrusive since a burrow
(Feature 4) overlies and cuts across the central
basin of Feature 3. Considering the large size of
the burrow and the burrowing nature of the Texas
gopher tortoise, the disturbance may be attributed
to this reptile.

Feature 6 was exposed in the south wall of
Backhoe Trench 5. It was not excavated but is
documented through its cross-section exposure in
the trench wall. Feature 6 is a 28-cm-long,
2-cm-thick lens of charcoal flecks and ashy
sediment covered by a thin (<1 cm) layer of eolian
silts and sands. The top of the feature is 8182 cm below the ground surface. Its boundaries
are slightly diffuse but discernible.

Feature 5

Feature 7

Feature 5 was exposed in the north wall of
Backhoe Trench 6 (Figure 9). It was not excavated
but is documented through its cross-section
exposure in the wall of the trench. The feature is
an undulating lens, 1-2 cm thick and 57 cm long,
of charcoal flecks and ashy sediment covered in
spots by a thin (<1 cm) layer of eolian sediments.
The top of the feature is 67-71 cm below the
ground surface. Heavy concentrations of charcoal
flecks occur in the center of the feature and become
thinly dispersed along the outer portions. The
feature may represent a simple surface fire rather
than a prepared-basin fire hearth.

Feature 7 was exposed in the north wall of
Backhoe Trench 4 (Figure 10). It was not
excavated but is documented through its crosssection exposure in the wall of the trench. Feature
7 is a shallow, basin-shaped hearth 33 cm long and
1-4 cm thick. The top of the feature is 177185 cm below the ground surface. Oxidized
sediment forms the bottom of the basin underlying
charcoal flecks and chunks and ashy sediments.
Charcoal and ashy sediment also occur outside the
basin to the west, possibly representing fill that
was cleaned out of the basin by human or possibly
other agents .

Feature 8 was exposed in the north wall of
Backhoe Trench 3 (Figure 11). It was not
excavated but is documented through its crosssection exposure in the wall of the trench. Feature
8 is a shallow, basin-shaped hearth, 0.5 to 3.0 cm
thick and 41 cm long, that gently dips to the west.
The top of the feature is 102-108 cm below the
ground surface. The feature fill consists of a
concentration of charcoal, ashy sediment, and a
few patches of oxidized sediment in the eastern
half.

in situ burning.

Feature 10
Feature 10 was encountered during the
excavation of Test Unit 8 (Figure 13). The feature
extends out of the south wall of Test Unit 8 and
therefore was only partially exposed in plan view
during excavation. Feature 10 is a shallow, basinshaped hearth which is probably circular in plan
view. It measures SO cm east-west and at least
12 cm north-south and is 1-4 cm thick. The top of
the feature is 85-90 cm below the ground surface
at Test Unit 8. The feature fill consists of
charcoal flecks and chunks and some oxidized
sediments. A small block was cut out of the
cross-section profile of the feature for micromorphological analysis (see Appendix E). Under
microscopic examination, the thin-sectioned block
revealed a lens of grass charcoal, phytoliths, and
oxidized sediments representing in situ burning.

Feature 9
Feature 9 was exposed when the balk
between Test Unit 3 and the erosional face of the
clay dune was removed to facilitate the excavation
of Test Unit 3 (Figure 12). It was not excavated
but is documented through its cross-section
exposure in the south wall of the removed balk.
Feature 9 is a shallow, basin-shaped hearth,
3-5 cm thick and 45 cm long (east-west). The top
of the feature is 96-100 cm below the ground
surface at Test Unit 3. The feature fill consists of
charcoal flecks and chunks and ashy sediment,
covered by a thin layer of eolian silt and sand. A
small block was cut out of the cross-section

out of the east wall of the unit and therefore was
only partially exposed in plan view during
excavation. Feature 11 appeared to be a pit
feature when first encountered at 115 cm below the
surface in the eastern half of the unit. The exposed
portion was semicircular in shape, measuring
80 cm north-south and at least 35 cm east-west.
Its fill was darker than the surrounding sediments
and contained common pieces of charcoal. Test
Unit 8 is adjacent to and west of the location of
the human burial that was exhumed by Day et al.
(1981). It was first believed that Feature 11 might
represent the edge of the original burial pit or a
separate burial pit. The semicircular feature
became larger in size with depth but disappeared at
approximately 122 cm below the surface.
Excavation continued to 150 cm below the surface,
but nothing was encountered.

Only the
leeward side of the clay dune is preserved, while
the windward side has been truncated. The dune
contains many buried but weakly developed soils
with thln mollic epipedons. The modern surface
soil is an Aridisol grading into an Ustoll (Mollisol)

yielded a 6 13C-corrected radiocarbon assay of
80 ± 60 B .P. Zone 3 is a 13-cm-thick grayish
brown clay with moderate medium subangular
blocky structure. Zone 3 is a 2Bb horizon. Zone
4 (59-95 cm) is a massive grayish brown clay
loam and represents the parent material of the
overlying soil. Filaments of CaC0 3 are common
and increase in number down-profile. Zone 4 is
classified as a 2Ck horizon. Zone 5 (95-103 cm)
is a massive light gray clay loam. A thin (3 cm)
discontinuous sandy lens is present at the top of the
zone. Other sandy lenses were observed in the
other backhoe trenches at similar elevations and
may represent storm washover fans or deposits.
Zone 5 is a 2Cu horizon. Zone 6 (103-129 cm) is
a weakly developed buried soil consisting of a
light brownish gray clay with weak medium
subangular blocky structure. Zone 6 is a 3AC
horizon. Zone 7 (129-147 cm) is another weakly
developed buried soil. It is a structureless grayish
brown sandy clay loam. Thin sand lenses are
common throughout the zone. Zone 7 is classified
as a 4AC horizon. Zone 8 (147-163 cm) repre-

Camborthids, Aridisols with cambic horizons and
dry, thin moIlic epipedons and/or gypsic or calcic
horizons below the cambic horizon (Buol et al.
1980:253, 264). The epipedon or surface horizon
is usually a dark grayish brown to grayish brown
sandy clay loam to sandy loam. Subsurface
horizons consist of grayish brown sandy clay loams
to clays.
General descriptions and geomorphic
interpretations of five of the nine localities
documented in the backhoe trenches are presented
here (Figure 15). More-detailed descriptions of
the sediments and stratigraphy of all nine backhoe
trench localities can be found in Appendix A.
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated on the
preserved leeward side of the dune from the
erosional face westward. It was excavated to a
depth of 189 cm, and 10 zones were identified and
described from the east end of the trench. Zone 1
(0-7 cm) is a massive grayish brown sandy loam
and is classified as a Cu horizon. Zones 2 and 3
(7-59 cm) represent a buried soil. Zone 2 is a

sents the parent material of the overlying soil. It
consists of a massive grayish brown loam and is
classified as a 4C horizon. Zone 9 (163-181 cm)
is a weakly developed buried soil (5Ab horizon).
It is a dark grayish brown clay loam with weak
medium subangular blocky structure. Zone 10
(181-189+ cm) is a light brownish gray to pale
brown clay loam. Zone 10 is a 5C horizon.
Four buried soils are represented in the
profile of Backhoe Trench 2. Each soil represents
an interval of surface stability. The strongest
developed soil is the most recent one (Zones 2 and
3), suggesting that earlier periods of stability were
much shorter in duration.
Backhoe Trench 8 is north of Backhoe Trench
2 and was excavated on the preserved leeward side
of the dune from the erosional face westward. It
was excavated to a depth of 170 cm, and 10 zones
were identified and described from the east end of
the trench. Zone 1 (0-6 cm) is a massive grayish

brown sandy clay loam and is a Cu horizon. Zones
2 and 3 (6-45 cm) are a buried soil (2Ab and 2AC
horizons). Zone 2 is a 15-cm-thick dark grayish
brown clay loam with moderate medium subangular
blocky structure. Zone 3 is a 24-cm-thick
structureless grayish brown clay loam. Zone 4
(45-71 cm) is a weakly developed buried soil
(3AC horizon). It is a structureless grayish brown
clay loam. Three thin (1 cm) sandy lenses are
present at the bottom of the zone. Other sandy
lenses were observed in other backhoe trenches at
similar elevations and may represent storm
washover fans or deposits. Zones 5-7 (71114 cm) represent three other weakly developed
buried soils. Zone 5 is a IO-cm-thick 4AC
horizon consisting of a structureless dark gray clay
loam. Feature 2 is located within this zone. Soil
humates from Zone 5 yielded a c5 13C-corrected
radiocarbon assay of 1200 ± 70 B.P. Zone 6 is an
I I-cm-thick grayish brown clay loam with
33

I

moderate fine subangular blocky structure. It is
classified as a 5AC horizon. Zone 7 is a 22-cmthick grayish brown clay loam with moderate
medium subangular blocky structure. Zone 7 is
classified as a 6AC horizon. Zone 8 (114-135 cm)
represents the parent material of the overlying soil.
It is a massive grayish brown sandy clay loam with
common soft CaCO, nodules and filaments. It is a
6Ck horizon. Zone 9 (135-153 cm) is another
weakly developed soil (7 ACk horizon). It is a
structureless grayish brown to dark grayish brown
sandy clay loam. The common soft CaC03 nodules
and filaments are probably a postburial occurrence.
Zone 10 (153-170+ cm) represents the parent
material of the overlying soil. It is a 7C horizon
consisting of a massive grayish brown loam.
Six buried soils are represented in Backhoe
Trench 8. The pedogenic sequence and development of these soils are similar to those in Backhoe
Trench 2. The strongest developed soil is the most
recent one, which corresponds to the soil radiocarbon date of 80 ± 60 B.P. from Backhoe Trench
2. Earlier periods of soil development apparently
were short lived, since the older soils in the profile
are weakly developed.
Backhoe Trench 11 is located on the truncated windward side of the dune. This truncated
surface gently dips eastward to the active windtidal flat. Backhoe Trench 11 is approximately
21.3 m long. Three localities along Backhoe
Trench 11-one near the western end (lla), one in
the center (llb), and one near the eastern end
(llc)-were described due to stratigraphic and
geologic variations observed in the trench wall.
Clay dune deposits and associated soils are present
at each locality. The dune stratigraphy dips to the
west; consequently, the basal zones present in the
western locality are the more-surficial zones in the
central and eastern localities. The dune stratigraphy of the three localities represents a continuous
2.35-m vertical sequence of dune deposits and
associated soils from the base of the dune on the
underlying Beaumont Formation. Locality l lc, the
easternmost locality, revealed a complex intersection of clay dune, wind-tidal flat, and late
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation deposits (Figure
16). The base of the dune's windward face is
represented in the Locality l lc profile, as well as
tidal flat sediments that lap up onto the windward
side and underlying deposits of the Beaumont
Formation.
34

Locality lla consists of 11 zones (0138 cm). Zone 1 (0-10 cm) is a grayish brown
fine sandy loam consisting of fine thin (<2 mm)
small ripples and planar laminations. This zone
represents recent slopewash and alluvial fan
sediments and is a Cu horizon. Zone 2 (10-23 cm)
is a light brownish gray clay loam with moderate
fine subangular blocky structure. Zone 2 is a C
horizon. Zones 3 and 4 (23-44 cm) represent a
buried soil. Zone 3 is a 9-cm-thick structureless
dark gray clay loam and is classified as a 2Abk
horizon. Common soft CaC03 nodules throughout
the zone are most likely a postburial phenomenon.
Soil hum ates yielded a 15 13C-corrected radiocarbon
assay of 1180 ± 60 B.P. Zone 4 is a 12-cm-thick
light brownish gray clay loam with moderate fine
subangular blocky structure and many soft CaC03
nodules. Zone 4 is a 2Bbk horizon. Zones 5 and
6 (44-78 cm) are weakly developed buried soils.
Zone 5 is a 17-cm-thick structureless grayish
brown clay loam and is classified as a 3ACk
horizon. Zone 6 is a 17-cm-thick structureless
light brownish gray clay and is a 4ACk horizon.
Both soils contain many soft CaC03 nodules, which
are probably postburial phenomena. Zones 7 and
8 (78-116 cm) represent the parent material of the
overlying soil horizon. Zone 7 is a 28-cm-thick
massive grayish brown clay, while Zone 8 is a
10-cm-thick massive light brownish gray clay.
The zones are classified as 4Ck and 4Ck2 horizons,
respectively. Zone 9 (116-124 cm) is another
weakly developed buried soil (5ACk horizon)
consisting of structureless dark gray clay loam.
Zone 10 (124-131 cm) is a massive grayish brown
sandy clay loam, representing the parent material
of the overlying soil. Zone 10 is a 5Ck horizon.
Zone 11 (131-138+ cm) is a weakly developed
soil consisting of structureless dark gray sandy
clay loam. Zone 11 is a 6ACk horizon.
Locality l lb consists of nine zones
(0-122 cm). Zone 1 (0-10 cm) is a grayish brown
fine sandy clay loam consisting of thin (<2 mm)
ripples and swales and a few thin muddy lenses.
Zone 1 is recent slopewash and alluvial fan
sediments and is classified as a Cu horizon. Zone
2 (10-24 cm) is a massive grayish brown sandy
clay loam with many soft CaC03 nodules. Zone 2
is classified as a Ck horizon. Zone 3 (24-34 cm)
is a weakly developed buried soil. It consists of a
structureless grayish brown sandy clay loam and is
classified as a 2ACk horizon. Another weakly

brown sandy clay loam. A thin (3 cm) fine sandy
lens is present at the bottom of the zone and may
represent a storm washover fan. Zone 5 (5468 cm) represents the parent material of the
overlying soil. It consists of a massive light
brownish gray to grayish brown clay loam and is
classified as a 3Ck horizon. Zone 6 (68-83 cm)
represents another weakly developed soil,
consisting of grayish brown clay loam with
moderate fine subangular blocky structure. Zone 6
is a 4ACk horizon. Underlying Zone 6 is a more
developed soil (5Ab horizon). Zone 7 (83-90 cm)
is a dark gray clay loam with moderate fine
subangular blocky structnre. Zone 8 (90-104 cm)
represents the parent material of the overlying soil.
It is a massive grayish brown clay and is classified
as a SC horizon. Zone 9 (104-122+ cm) is a
weakly developed soil consisting of a structureless
dark gray clay loam. Zone 9 is a 6AC horizon.

Locality Ile consists of seven zones (0124 cm). Zone 1 (0-17 cm) is a grayish brown
fine sandy loam consisting of small ripples and
swales and common thin (<3 mm) muddy lenses.
Zone 1 is a Cu horizon representing recent
slopewash, alluvial fan, and beach deposits. Zone

this fill is a soil (Zone 4) formed on a clay dune
deposit. The soil (4Abk horizon) is an 11-cmthick dark grayish brown clay loam with weak fine
subangular blocky structure. Soil humates from
Zone 4 produced a .s "C-corrected radiocarbon
assay of 2320 ± 90 B.P. Zone 5 (55-62 cm) is a
massive light brownish gray clay representing the
parent material of the overlying soil. Zone 5 is
classified as a 4Ck horizon. Zone 6 (62-75 cm)
represents a basal dune deposit upon which a soil
formed (5Abk horizon). The soil is a structureless
dark grayish brown clay loam. Common soft
CaCO, nodules and incipient nodules are most
likely postburial phenomena. Soil organics from
the zone produced a .S 13 C-corrected radiocarbon
assay of 2690 ± 60 B.P. The base of the dune
rests on the late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation
(Zone 7). Zone 7 (75-124+ cm) is a brown
moderate medium angular blocky structured clay
loam. It is heavily turbated and contains a few
CaCO, nodules and common gypsum crystals.
Backhoe Trench Localities Ila, llb, and
Ile, along with Backhoe Trench 8, provide a
complete vertical sequence of the clay dune from
the underlying Beaumont Formation to the modem
surface (Figure 17). Dune aggradation apparently
commenced at least by ca. 3000 B.P. based on
radiocarbon assays on soil humates from basal

zones. Accretion of the dune was relatively rapid,
based on the presence of weakly developed soil
profiles throughout the dune. Approximately 1416 soils are present in the entire preserved vertical
sequence. Most of these consist only of a thin A
or AC horizon. The strongest developed soil is one
of the most recent, implying that aggradation of the
clay dune has decreased dramatically in recent
times. Decreased aggradation may be associated
with the fact that the windward side of the dune
has been truncated, creating an escarpment 0.51.5 m high that greatly limits the amount of
sediment transported by eolian processes up onto
the preserved backside of the dune. Further
discussions on the formation, sedimentology, and
geochronology of the 41WY50 clay dune can be
found in Chapter 6, along with their archeological
implications.
Summary and Conclusions

The preservation and integrity of site
41WY50 were expected to be good. It was anticipated that the intact stratigraphy, recognizable
features, datable materials, human remaius, and
shells reported by Day et al. (1981) also would be
encountered during this phase of work. Intact,

features were encountered; however, definite
cultural materials were not recovered.
A paucity of artifacts on archeological sites
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley is not uncommon,
but a complete absence of unquestionable cultural
materials was not expected. The absence of
temporally diagnostic artifacts makes it difficult to
relate the occupation(s) of 41WY50 to others
within the Lower Rio Grande Valley and adjacent
regions. Furthermore, the lack of artifacts makes
it extremely difficult to interpret how the site and
the area were utilized. Site 41WY50 did yield a
nnmber of hearth features; however, their thin
shallow nature, apparent lack of reuse, and lack of
associated artifacts, macrobotanical remains, and
fauna! remains also make interpretation of feature
and site utilization difficult. Several of these
hearth features are at similar elevations and are
probably associated with an occupation surface. It
was expected that radiocarbon assays from these
features would confirm this notion. However, due
to the unfortunate loss of the radiocarbon samples,
the ages of the features can only be estimated
based on their provenience. The provenience of
Feature 2 within a dated soil horizon (1200 ±
70 B.P.) snggests that it and other features
(particularly Features I, 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10) at
similar elevations are late Archaic in age. A late
Archaic occupation of the site is also suggested by
the radiocarbon-dated human remains previously
recovered (Bousman et al. 1990:99). The late
Archaic occupation of site 41 WY50 was obviously
short term and most likely does not represent
repetitive use on a seasonal or yearly basis. A
similar late Archaic occupation, consisting of few
artifacts and a few small basin-shaped hearths,
was documented on Loma Ochoa, a clay dune on
the Rio Grande delta (Espey, Huston and
Associates, Inc. 1990).

southern end of a large north-south-trending clay

dense stands of thorny brush, including mesquite,

Open grassy areas are found along the crest and
Compared to site
along the erosional face.
41WY50, the clay dune at 41WY60 is relatively
intact. The windward face is slightly eroded and
gullied, but for the most part the windward side or
slope is preserved right up to the active wind-tidal
flat to the east. A burned clay lump and a marine
shell fragment were observed on the surface. The
site measures approximately 125 m north-south by
20-30 m east-west.
Previous Investigations
Site 41WY60 was recorded by Day et al.
(1981) during a survey of the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch outfall area. Cultural materials
were observed eroding out of a 150-m-long
exposed scarp face. Surface materials noted and
collected included 1 modified primary flake, 4
ceramic sherds (possibly Rockport Ware), 6 marine
pelecypods, 1 marine gastropod, 1 fish otolith,
several terrestrial gastropods, and 31 unidentifiable
bone fragments.
Two subsurface tests were placed in the
southern and northern portions of the site on the
crest of the dune. The southern probe measured
100 x 100 cm and extended to 80 cm in depth.
The profile revealed six natural strata consisting of
brown clays and silts that became increasingly
sandier down-profile. The other subsurface probe
measured 100 x 150 cm and involved cutting back
a portion of the erosional face of the dune. It was
110 cm deep. The profile revealed seven natural
strata, consisting mainly of light brown sands and
silts, and one feature, a shallow basin-shaped
hearth filled with charcoal and ashy sediment.

ranged from 50 cm in Test Unit 6 to 150 cm in
Test Unit 3. The lengths of the 11 backhoe
trenches ranged from 6.8 to 16.0 m, with the mean
being 9.6 m. The maximum depths of the trenches
ranged from 0.9 to 2.1 m, with the mean being
1.6 m. Backhoe Trenches 9-11 and 13 were
excavated from the crest of the dune down the
erosional windward face. Backhoe Trenches 8, 12,
and 15-18 were excavated from the crest down the
backside of the dune. Backhoe Trench 14 is a
shallow trench excavated on the wind-tidal flat
east of the dune. Six localities or profiles from six
trenches (Backhoe Trenches 8-13) were described
in detailed (see Appendix A). One wall along the
long axis ot each of four trenches (Backhoe
Trenches 8-9 and 11-12) was completely profiled.
The sediments and stratigraphy of the wind-tidal
flat also were observed and documented from a
50-x-50-cm unit, known as Geomorphic Locality
No. 1 (see Appendix A).
Of .the 56 sediment samples collected for
various analyses, two were submitted for radiocarbon dating. Because of the lack of features and
artifacts, further analyses, including geomorphological and paleoenvironmental studies, were not
pursued. The fill from Feature 1 was floated and
charcoal obtained for radiocarbon dating. Unfortunately, this sample was lost en route to Beta
Analytic, Inc.
A number of exposures and erosional faces
along the crest of the dune were cut back and
cleaned to detect cultural occupation zones and
features. These profiles were no more than 4060 cm high and totaled approximately 56 m in
length.
Site mapping was accomplished with a transit
and metric stadia rod. No permanent datums were
set on the site.

materials recovered are nine pieces of burned
pumice associated with Feature 1. Like the
materials recovered from 41WY50, most of the
materials from 41WY60 carmot be attributed to
human activities with any confidence.
Feature
One feature was documented at 41WY60
(Figure 19). It was exposed in the north wall at
the east end of Backhoe Trench 12 and excavated
by Test Unit 5. Backhoe Trench 12 bisected the
feature, but only a small portion of it remained
intact in the south wall of the trench. Feature 1 is
a shallow, basin-shaped hearth containing charcoal,
ashy sediment, and nine pieces of burned pumice.
A thin layer of white (IOYR 8/2) eolian fine sand
overlies the charcoal and ashy sediment. Burned
clay lumps, commonly associated with small hearth
features in the region, were absent. This absence
is probably a testament to the intensity and
duration of the fire. When first exposed in the
trench wall, the feature measured 74 cm east-west;
however, upon subsequent excavation, the feature
was found to be 83 cm east-west by at least
124 cm north-south and 3-4 cm thick. The top of
Feature 1 is 30-33 cm below the ground surface at

feature was probably oval shaped to amorphous.
The presence of burned pumice seems to be
a very rare occurrence and poses an interesting
question. The regional archeological literature
does not provide any documentation of hearth
features associated with pumice, but with an
absence of rocks in the area, the presence of
pumice in this feature suggests that it was used for
stone boiling or baking pit construction. However,

were observed and documented from 6 of the 11
backhoe trenches and Geomorphic Locality No. 1.
Two sediment samples were submitted for radiocarbon dating (Table 4). These observations and
the results of the radiocarbon assays reveal that
site 41WY60 sits on a Holocene eolian dune
consisting mainly of sand and clay overlying the
late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. The clay
dune contains many buried but weakly developed
soils with thin mollic epipedons.
The modem surface soil is an Aridisol
grading into a Ustoll (Mollisol) that belongs to the
Lalinda (Turner 1982) soil series. Lalinda soils
are classified as Ustollic Camborthids, Aridisols
with cambic horizons and dry, thin moIlic epipedons and/or gypsic or calcic horizons below the
cambic horizon (Buol et al. 1980:253, 264). The
epipedon or surface horizon is usually dark grayish
brown to grayish brown sandy clay loam to clay
loam. Subsurface horizons consist of grayish
brown sandy clay loams to clays.
General descriptions and geomorphic
interpretations of three of the six documented
backhoe trenches and the one geomorphic locality
are presented here (Figure 20). More-detailed
descriptions of the sediments and stratigraphy of
all six backhoe trenches and one geomorphic
locality can be found in Appendix A.
Backhoe Trench 8 is located at the southern
end of the site on the backside of the dune. It was
excavated to a depth of 152 cm below the surface.
Nine zones are identified and described from the
west end of the trench.
Zone 1 (0-35 cm) is a grayish brown silty
clay loam with moderate coarse angular blocky
structure. A few very thin sandy laminae are

present in the lower half of the zone. Zone 1 is an
A horizon. Zone 2 (35-45 cm) is a zone of interbedded small ripples and planar laminations of
brown sand and very dark grayish brown mud. The
lower boundary of Zone 2 is very abrupt and
smooth to wavy. Zone 2 represents a Cu horizon.
Both Zones 1 and 2 represent recent deposition on
the backside of the dune. A thin surface soil,
represented by Zone 1, has developed on these
deposits. These recent deposits buried a 9-cmthick dark gray silty clay loam soil (2Abk horizon)
with moderate medium angular blocky structure
represented by Zone 3. The presence of CaC03
filaments are most likely postburial phenomena.
Soil humates from Zone 3 yielded a 6 13C-corrected
radiocarbon assay of 250 ± 60 B.P.
Zone 4 (54-58 cm) is a grayish brown clay
loam with weak fine angular blocky structure.
Humic materials are common. Zone 4 is classified
as a 2AC horizon. Zones 5-6 (58-81 cm) consist
of gray to dark gray and grayish brown clay loams
to loams. These zones are 2C and 2C2 horizons,
respectively, or parent materials of the overlying
soil (Zones 3 and 4). Another buried soil (Zone 7)
underlies Zone 6. Zone 7 (81-109 cm) is a dark
gray clay loam with weak medium subangular
blocky structure. Zone 7 is a 3Ab horizon. Zone
8 (109-144 cm) is a massive grayish brown silty
clay. It is a 3C horizon. Zone 9 (144-152+ cm)
represents a buried soil (4Ab horizon), consisting
of dark gray silty clay loam with weak fine
subangular blocky structure.
The Backhoe Trench 8 profile reveals three
buried soils representing intervals of surface
stability. These stable intervals were probably
short-lived given the weak development of the

Feature 1 is at the bottom of Zone l, resting on top
of Zone 2. Zone 2 (30-38 cm) is a dark gray
massive silty clay loam. It is the parent material
of the overlying soil. Zone 2 is classified as a C
horizon. As in Backhoe Trench 8, Zones 1 and 2
of Backhoe Trench 12 are recent back-dune deposits that overlie an older soil. Zone 3 (38-47 cm)
is a very dark gray clay loam soil (2Abk horizon)
with moderate fine angular blocky structure. The
common CaC03 filaments throughout the zone are
most likely a postburial occurrence. Soil humates

soils. This in turn suggests that the vertical
accretion of the clay dune was relatively rapid,
which is consistent with the age (200-300 years) of
the first buried soil at 45 cm below the surface.
Backhoe Trench 12 is located at the northern
end of the site on the backside of the dune and was
excavated to a depth of 156 cm below the surface.
Nine zones are identified and described from the
west end of the trench.
Zone 1 (0-30 cm) represents the weakly
developed modern surface soil (AC horizon). It is

structureless dark grayish brown silty clay loam.
It is classified as a 2AC horizon. Zone 5 (5788 cm) is a massive dark gray to grayish brown
silty clay. It is a 2Ck horizon and represents the
parent material of the overlying soil. Zones 6 and
7 (88-122 cm) are two weakly developed buried
soils, 3AC and 4AC horizons, respectively. Zone
8 (122-128 cm) is a massive brown clay loam with
common CaCO, filaments and incipient nodules. It
is classified as a 4Ck horizon. Zone 9 (128156+ cm) is another buried soil (5ACk horizon)
consisting of a dark grayish brown to dark brown
clay loam. Nodules and filaments of CaCO, are
common.
The Backhoe Trench 12 profile is very
similar to the one documented in Backhoe Trench
8. It reveals four buried soils representing
intervals of surface stability. These stable periods
probably were short lived, given the weak development of the soils. This suggests that the vertical
accretion of the clay dune was relatively rapid,
which is supported by the age (200-300 years) of
the first buried soil at 38 cm below the surface.
Backhoe Trench 9 was excavated on the
erosional windward face of the dune. It was
excavated to a depth of 182 cm, and six zones
were identified from the west end of the trench.
Zone 1 (0-9 cm) is grayish brown clay loam
with weak fine subangular blocky structure. This
is the A horizon of the modern surface soil. Zone
1 overlies a buried cumulic soil represented by
Zones 2 and 3. Zone 2 (9-39 cm) is grayish brown
clay loam with strong medium subangular blocky
structure. Zone 2 is a 2Ab horizon. Zone 3 is an
11-cm-thick grayish brown silty clay loam with
moderate fine subangular structure. The few soft
CaC03 nodules are probably postburial phenomena.
· Zone 3 is classified as a 2A2bk horizon. Zone 4
(50-124 cm) is a massive grayish brown clay loam
representing the parent material of the overlying
soil. Soft nodules of CaCO, are common, as are
root casts formed of CaCO,. Zone 4 is a 2Ck
horizon. Zone 5 (124-151 cm) is a massive pale
brown silt loam with common soft CaCO, nodules.
Zone 5 is classifed as a 2Ck2 horizon. Zone 6
(151-182+ cm) is a massive yellowish brown silty
clay loam with many soft CaCO, nodules. Zone 6
is a 3Ck horizon. Although not chronometrically
dated, the many CaCO, nodules and the oxidized
43

appearance of the sediments suggest that Zone 6
may be the Beaumont Formation. The top of the
zone is approximately 2 m above the Beaumont
Formation underlying the wind-tidal flaLto the
east (see Geomorphic Locality No. 1 below). This
suggests that, if Zone 6 is a Beaumont Formation
deposit, it is probably an ancient natural levee
upon which clay dune formation is common. The
north wall of Backhoe Trenches 10 and 11 revealed
a similar deposit with oxidized sediments and an
abundant amount of pedogenic carbonate nodules
(Figure 21).
These deposits are unlike the
overlying dune deposits not only in color and
degree of soil development but also in bed
morphology. Although they are not chronometrically dated, they appear to be natural levee
remnants of Pleistocene (Beaumont) age.

hand-dug unit located immediately east of the site
on the wind-tidal flat. It was excavated to a depth
of 32 cm, and two zones were identified. Zone 1
(0-7 cm) represents recent wind-tidal flat deposits
consisting of interbedded very pale brown to pale
brown sand and grayish brown mud ripples. It
overlies Zone 2 (7-32+ cm), a highly weathered
strong coarse subangular blocky brown clay loam.
Zone 2 represents the late Pleistocene Beaumont
Formation.
The sediments and stratigraphy of site
41 WY60 reveal a clay dune that accreted rapidly
and continues to do so. Pauses in dune growth or
accretion are marked by buried soils. The weakly
developed soils, represented by thin A and AC
horizons, suggest that the intervals of stability were
brief.
The soils and stratigraphy are well
preserved and intact on the leeward side of the
dune and can be traced laterally throughout all the
backhoe trenches excavated on the back side. The
stratigraphy of the windward side reveals many
truncated and disturbed zones due to continual
cycles of erosion and deposition. Although the
windward face is eroding through eolian processes,
it appears that the clay dune itself is not moving
laterally downwind but rather is accreting or
building vertically.
Formation of the dune appears to be linked
to a remnant of a late Pleistocene (Beaumont
Formation) natural levee. This topographic rise
served as a barrier and place of accumulation of
eolian-transported sediments from the adjacent
(upwind) wind-tidal flat. Evidence of an underlying late Pleistocene levee comes from basal
deposits in several backhoe trenches. Although
radiocarbon assays are not available from these
deposits, the degree of pedogenic carbonate

44

development, oxidized sediments, and bed
morphology are indicative of a natural levee of
extreme antiquity.
Summary and Conclusions

The preservation and integrity of site
41WY60 were expected to be good. As in the case
of 41WY50, it was anticipated that the intact
stratigraphy, features, datable materials, and
ceramics reported by Day et al. (1981) also would
be encountered during this phase of work. Intact,
laterally consistent stratigraphy and a recognizable
feature were encountered; however, definite
cultural materials were not recovered.
A paucity of artifacts on archeological sites
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley is not uncommon,
but an absence of unquestionable cultural materials
was not expected. The absence of temporally
diagnostic artifacts makes it difficult to relate the
occupation of 41WY60 to others within the Lower
Rio Grande Valley and adjacent regions. Furthermore, the lack of artifacts makes it extremely
difficult to interpret how the site and the area were
utilized. Although 41WY60 did yield a hearth, its
thin shallow nature, apparent lack of reuse, and
lack of associated artifacts, macrobotanical
remains, and fauna! remains also make the interpretation of feature and site utilization difficult.
The provenience of the feature above a
radiocarbon-dated soil horizon (190 ± 70 B.P.)
suggests that it dates to the early Historic period.
The presence of possible Rockport ceramics also
supports a Late Prehistoric/Historic occupation.
This occupation was obviously short term and most
likely does not represent repeated occupations on
a seasonal or yearly basis.

This chapter presents the results of the
geomorphological and paleoenvironmental studies.
First, the geomorphology of clay dunes in terms of
their formation, sedimentology, and geochronology
is discussed, and evidence of a Holocene high sea
stand is presented. The second part presents the
data and interpretations of the paleoenvironmental
studies, which include stable carbon isotopic and
pollen/phytolith analyses. The final parts are
syntheses of the first two in terms of landscape
stability, resource availability, and their
geoarcheological implications. Most of the data
presented below come from site 41WY50.

aggregates of clay from desiccated lagoon margins
and bottoms.
Climatic and environmental conditions are
important factors in the formation and geographical
distribution of clay dunes (Huffman and Price
1949). Huffman and Price (1949:120) describe the
distribution of clay dunes as limited to the leeward
margins of saline wind-tidal flats and basins in
arid to semiarid and dry subhumid zones with high
potential evapotranspiration rates. Strong prevailing winds are also a key factor. All of these
factors are prevalent on the south Texas coast,
where clay dunes are present from Corpus Christi
Bay to the Rio Grande delta and south along the
Gulf coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico.
The predominant sediment source for the clay
dunes along the south Texas coast is wind-tidal
flats. Extensive flats are present along the western
margin of the Laguna Madre, particularly along the
margins of the Rio Grande delta and the area
between the Cayo Atascosa and Fourmile Slough.
These wind-tidal flat areas are associated with the
Gavilan and the Hawk Island accretionary claysand dunes, respectively (Brown et al. 1980:88).
Brown et al. (1980:75) identify four types of windtidal flats along the south Texas coast: (1) firm
sand and mud flats; (2) soft mud and sand with
extensive algal mats that are frequently wet; (3)
sand and mud flats that are alternately emergent
and submergent; and (4) firm gypsiferous mud and
sand with algal-bound mud. The last two types
are found in the project area. Granulometric data
from wind-tidal flat deposits at 41 WY50 (Backhoe
Trench Locality lid) reveal a bimodal clast size
distribution. The modes are very fine to fine sands
and clays finer than 9 phi, while silt-sized
particles are rare (Figure 22). Log probability

GEOMORPHOLOGY

Clay Dune Formation and Sedimentology

The genesis and formation of clay dunes have
been documented extensively in the geologic
literature (e.g., Huffman and Price 1949; Price
1958, 1963; Price and Kornicker 1961). Eolian
dunes of clay are unique and peculiar in that fine
particles such as clays usually are transported
great distances from their source as suspended dust
and deposited as massive sheets. These deposits
are thickest near their source, and both grain size
and bed thickness decrease downwind (Galloway
and Hobday 1983:204; Waters 1992:186, 202).
Generally, only sand or sand-sized particles
accumulate as dunes or dune fields. Thus, the
formation of clay dunes is the result of fine
particles behaving like sand-sized particles.
Coffey (1909) provides one of the earliest
documentations of how this process works,
crediting the unique climatic conditions of the south
Texas coast and the eolian transport of sand-sized

tidal velocities and the cyclical flooding and
retreating nature of the wind tides on the flat.
The flooding of wind-tidal flats is erratic
because astronomical tides are negligible along
most parts of the south Texas coast (Brown et al.·
1980; Fisk 1959). Submergence is caused by
wind-driven waters or drops in barometric pressure
(White et al. 1989). Flooding exposes the sediments, particularly the clays, to evaporite salts,
which along with algal fibers bind clays into sandsized pellets or aggregates upon retreat of the

plots of the cumulative weight percentages of the
wind-tidal flat sediment samples differentiate
traction, saltation, and suspension populations
(Figure 23). The saltation populations represent
the dominant mode of transport and are very well
sorted, while the traction populations are very
small and truncated at 1 phi. Clear truncations
between the saltation and suspension populations
do not exist, representing a mixing of saltation and
suspension populations at the 3- and 4-phi intervals. This is probably the result of decreasing

to the leeward margins of the wind-tidal flat and
accumulate wherever obstructions, such as low
brushy vegetation or areas of local topographical
relief (e.g., natural leeves), occur.
The presence of evaporite salts in the clay
plays a very important role in clay dune formation
by controlling the moisture-holding and moisturereleasing ability or "hygroscopicity" of the saline
clay pellets (Price 1963:766). The gain and loss of
moisture can occur with changes in atmospheric
temperature and humidity, causing the clay to

water and drying. The drying out and disintegration of the wind-tidal flat surface or crust and
formation of clay aggregates involves various
processes (Price 1963:767), including the crystallization or growth of evaporite salts penetrating the
upper layer of crust, the development of a microrelief pattern of blisters on the surface which break
down with further drying, and the curling up of the
thin fragile surface of sun~cracked polygons which
are broken down mechanically by the wind (Figure
24). The clay pellets are transported by the wind

expand or contract. Although the salts are formed
by the desiccation of the wind-tidal flat surface,
Price (1963) found that the salts also enable the
clay pellets to retain enough moisture in their core
to keep their form for the period of time it takes to
transport them from the flat to the dune (Huffman
and Price 1949:124). Upon deposition, the clay
pellets may absorb moisture from atmospheric
humidity through the incorporated evaporite salts
or when the clay is wetted by rain. Once sufficient
moisture is absorbed, the pellets regain some of
their former plasticity, flocculate, and become
fixed in the dune, stabilizing the dune and
preventing lateral or downwind migration (Price
1963:766) (Figure 25). The internal bedding structures of clay dunes also suggest that migration
does not occur (Price 1963:773). The formation of
clay dunes, therefore, is the result of a delicate
balance between drying conditions that form saline
clay aggregates and the ability of the aggregates to
maintain enough moisture to keep their form, for
which the evaporite salts play a major role (Price
1963:766). It should be noted that active clay
dunes have not been documented from nonsaline
flats undergoing deflation, and there seems to be
no way in which nonsaline clay will produce a
large percentage of sand-sized aggregates for
eolian transport and dune formation (Price 1963:
767, 772).
The sedimentology of clay dunes is difficult
to interpret because of the unique processes behind
their formation. Granulometric data from the clay
dune at site 41WY50 reveal that the deposits are
poorly sorted (see Appendix B), which is not
surprising considering the nature of their formation.

Figure 25. Clay pellets (dark circles) in thin section of
sediment sample from 41WY50.

Sediment samples throughout the dune disclose a
clear bimodal distribution of very fine to fine sands
and clays finer than 9 phi (Figure 26). These
distributions are similar to those of the wind-tidal
flat samples. Silt-sized particles are uncommon,
as they are in the deposits of the wind-tidal flat.
Such distributions make sedimentological interpretations difficult. However, since the clays were
deposited as sand-sized aggregates, a better
understanding of clay dune sedimentology may be
obtained from an examination of the sand populations alone, as separated by the sieve analysis (in
which clay aggregates are broken down and thus
excluded).
The sand populations consist of subangular
and angular quartz sand that is moderately well
sorted (Table 5). The sand samples have mean
grain sizes ranging from 2.79 to 3.12 phi and are
asymmetrically skewed with a dominant mode
located at the 3- and 4-phi intervals. This
suggests that the clay aggregates were deposited as
fine and very fine sand-sized particles.
Log probability plots of cumulative weight
percentages of the clay dune sediment samples
(excluding clays in the 9-phi and <9-phi fractions)
were graphed to infer modes of sediment transport
and depositional processes. Most of the graphs
produced are nonsensical, and this may be the
result of more than one depositional process and/or
the gross intervals (i.e., 1 phi) of the sediment
data.

intervals for accurate work; however, it is
speculated that the incomprehensible graphs are
more the result of multiple depositional processes
rather than an inappropriate analysis interval since
useful data were obtained from the wind-tidal flat
samples at 1-phi intervals . The few clay dune
sample graphs that are useful reveal three to four
populations. Normally, eolian deposits have three
distinct populations with two clear truncation
points and are characterized by a very small
moderately sorted traction population, a dominant

(97-99 % of the sample) very well-sorted saltation
population, and a very small suspension population
(Visher 1969).
Some of the samples from
41 WY50 have two small traction populations,
suggesting a possible mix of eolian and stormsurge deposits, the latter being represented by the
coarser population. Truncation points at 2 phi
consistently separate the eolian traction populations from the eolian saltation populations
throughout the samples examined. The saltation
populations represent the dominant mode of

zone of mixing, represented at 3 and 4 phi, is
prevalent. This maybe the result of varying wind
velocities or a mixing of eolian and storm-surge
sediments. The suspension populations are represented by small silt fractions and tend to reveal
severe mixing probably of eolian fines and slackwater deposits from tropical storm inundation.
The sedimentological analysis of the clay
dune at 41 WY50 reveals a mix of sand and clay
particles. Eolian deposition is the predominant
process, with saltation representing the dominant
mode of transport. The saltation population
consists primarily of very fine to fine quartz sands

transport but consist of much smaller portions of
the samples than noted by Visher (1969:1104).
Because the clay-sized particles are excluded from
these plottings, it is assumed that large portions of
the saltation populations are represented by fine to
very fine sand-sized aggregates of clays. If the
clays (9 and <9 phi) are grouped with the very fine
(4 phi) and fine (3 phi) sands based on the relative
sizes of the 3- and 4-phi intervals, more-typical
distributions can be graphed (Figure 27). Rarely
are the saltation populations truncated in the
samples examined, but when they are truncated, it
is consistently at the 4-phi interval. Instead, a

and very fine to fine sand-sized aggregates of
clay.
Sediments deposited by storm surges
represent a secondary component of the clay dune.
The clay dunes tend to be steepest on the
windward side and more gently sloping on the
leeward side, which merges with the Beaumont
surface (Huffman and Price 1949: 124). Since clay
dunes do not migrate downwind, dune growth
occurs by vertical accretion and progradation
toward its sediment source. Slip faces, therefore,
are absent in clay dunes except under rare

conditions of extreme drought and rapid accumulation (Price 1963:773). Storm surges and rains
often leave the windward face intensively
weathered and eroded, while the leeward slope is
generally less eroded due partly to vegetation.
Salt-tolerant vegetation is able to gain a foothold
on the dune only after a period of leaching.
However, on actively accreting dunes, the vegetation is periodically killed when new deposits of
saline clays accumulate on the surface (Price 1963:
774). On relict dunes such as the backside of
51

Archeological and Geomorphological Investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY60

41WY50, the soil becomes permanently less saline
and able to support the common vegetation of
mesquite, prickly pear, trecul yucca, saltweed, and
salt-resistant grasses, further stabilizing the dune
(Huffman and Price 1949:127; Price 1963:774776).
The internal structure of a clay dune usually
consists of leeward-dipping beds of sediment
marked by intervals of stability or buried soils.
These structures are particularly well preserved in
the lee side of the dune. Rarely preserved
1-3-cm-thick graded beds were revealed through
micromorphological analysis of bulk sediment thin

lenses.

When the erosion of the windward side of th

1420-ll97 B.P. (one-sigma calibrated range o
1415 ± 140 B.P.) for truncation is suggested by th
human burial that was eroding out of the wave-cu

(Backhoe Trench Locality lie, Zone 3), based o
the later radiocarbon-dated gully fill of ca,

decreased rate of sedimentation occurring in th
last l, 100 years, which presumably was brought o
by the formation of the escarpment. These age~
also seemingly concur with the calibrated date (ca.
1070 B.P.) of the uppermost buried soil at Backhoe
Trench Locality I la. However, this date probably
is too young based on the sample's provenience,
and these deposits should date between ca. 1080_:

Because of the close
proximity of the Backhoe Trench Locality lla '
sample to the overlying reworked colluvial surface,
contamination through the translocation of morerecent organics is possible.
Interestingly, much earlier storm or floodwater inundation of the clay dune prior to
llOO B.P. is represented by many thin sand lenses
(e.g., Zone 6 of Backhoe Trenches 7 and 9 and
Zone 7 of Backhoe Trenches 2 and 6). This
interval of inundation appears to have been on a
much larger scale, for the sand lenses are present
throughout the backside of the dune. Based on

Geochronology

Although the windward face of the 41WY50
clay dune is truncated, a complete vertical
sequence of deposits from the underlying Beaumont
Formation to the modem surface can be tied
together from various profiles (Figure 28). This
vertical sequence, along with seven radiocarbon
assays (see Table 2 in Chapter 4), provides a
complete geochronological history of the dune.
Dune aggradation apparently commenced by
ca. 3000 B.P., based on radiocarbon assays on soil
humates from basal zones. The growth rates of the
dune are estimated to have ranged from 4 to 17 cm
per century; this is much slower than the 15-31 cm
per century speculated for clay dune growth by
Price and Komicker (1961:248) but is comparable
to the rates of 9.5 to 14.5 cm per century that
Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. (1990:220)
documented for Loma Ochoa. Initially, deposition
was slow, around 5 cm/100 years during the first
500 years of dune development. However, in an
ensuing span of approximately 1,200-1,500 years,
depositional rates increased to 12-17 cm per
century, on! y to decrease again to 4 cm per century
in the last 1,100 years.
These varying rates of sedimentation are
supported by the approximately 14-16 soils that
are preserved in the dune. Most of these soils are
weakly developed and consist only of thin A or AC
horizons, suggesting that dune accretion was
relatively rapid. The strongest developed soil in
the sequence is one of the most recent (e.g., Zones
2 and 3 of Backhoe Trenches 2, 5, 7, and 8),
supporting the notion that aggradation of the clay

these sand lenses and radiocarbon assays, dune
inundation by storm surges and floodwaters
probably was frequent between 2300 and 1100 B.P.
This period coincides with the interval of higher
dune growth rates. The log probability graphs of
sediment samples from this interval suggest severe
mixing of sediments representing more than one
depositional process (Figure 30). It is highly
probable that the accelerated sedimentation rates
were the result of wave energies providing
additional sediments to the dune, suggesting that
the floodwaters or surges of this period were less
erosive and actually contributed sediment to the
dune.
It also appears that during this period the

at a higher elevation and farther landward, based
on the presence of wind-tidal flat sediments that
lap up onto the windward face of the dune in the
profile of Backhoe Trench Locality 1 lc. Based on

Around 3000-4000 B.P., another change evidently
took place, but there is disagreement about what
this change involved. Opinions fall into three
realms of thought: (1) sea level reached its
approximate present position at that time and has
been rather stable since (Brown et al. 1980;
Coleman and Smith 1964; Morton and Price 1987:

above and below its present position since ca.
3000-4000 B.P. The third hypothesis is undoubtedly the most controversial. Much of the evidence
put forth for Holocene high stands has been proven
to be the result of local uplift or the result of storm
surges related to present mean sea level (Flint
1971:328). The presence or absence of evidence
for a Holocene high sea stand also may be a factor
of preservation. Davis and Clifton (1987) suggest
that the preservation of physical evidence depicting
previous sea levels is determined by sediment
inputs and whether the shoreline is transgressive or
progradational and wave or tidally dominated, all
of which ultimately are controlled by the sea level
itself.
Holocene high sea stands have been documented around the world, including western Africa
(Einsele et al. 1974), Europe (Tooley 1978), Brazil
(Suguio et al. 1992), and the Gulf Coast of Texas
(Prewitt and Paine 1987). Some have related high
sea stands to the Holocene climatic optimum,
which would have triggered or accelerated the
melting of continental glacial ice (Fairbridge 1961;
Marner 1984b).
Prewitt and Paine (1987) document the
remnants of a wind-tidal flat near Corpus Christi,
Texas, the top of which lies 1.8 m above present
mean sea level. This implies that when the windtidal flat was active mean sea level was at least
0.8 to 1.2 m higher than present. Remnants of a
possible beach ridge composed of reworked shells
also were observed at the same elevation. Radiocarbon assays on bulk sediment samples date the
wind-tidal flat and high stand between 45003000 B.P. At site 41WY50, the remnants of an
ancient wind-tidal flat were observed at the
windward base of the clay dune. The sedimentary
structures of this unit are identical to those of the
active wind-tidal flat, which lies ca. 10-12 cm
above present mean sea level. The absence of
shell hash and the presence of very thin to medium
beds of algal-bound mud suggest that this unit is
not a storm deposit.
Because astronomical tides currently are
negligible along the south Texas coast and
probably have been since the formation of Padre
Island, any wind-tidal flat formed after the
creation of the barrier is an excellent indication of
sea level at the time of its formation. The top of
the abandoned wind-tidal flat is 1.1 to 1.2 m
above present mean sea level. It is estimated that

mean sea level was at least 1.0 m higher than
present when the wind-tidal flat formed. It is
interesting to note that Brown et al. (1980:76)
make mention of wind-tidal flats at elevations of
LO to 1.5 m above mean sea level 'along the
landward margin of the Laguna Madre but make no
mention of their relationships to mean sea level.
Radiocarbon assays on soil humates from the
windward base of the clay dune suggest that the
wind-tidal flat was deposited no earlier than
2300 B.P., well after the formation of Padre
Island. If formation of the wind-tidal flat and the
clay dune were simultaneous, then these assays
suggest that a second Holocene high stand occurred
along the south Texas coast between 23001100 B.P. and that a ca. 700-year low stand
period may separate it from the earlier high stand
proposed by Prewitt and Paine (1987).
Although the chronology of these two high
stands along the south Texas coast needs to be
refined through more assays directly from the
elevated wind-tidal flats, it is interesting to
compare them with the chronology of the three
Holocene high stands documented along the coast
of Brazil at 5100-3800 B.P., 3500-2700 B.P., and
2500 B.P., the last of which gradually dropped to
the present-day level (Dominguez et al. 1987). It
is estimated that these high stands represent rises
of 3-5 m in sea level. These rises are immense
compared to the estimated eustatic sea level rise
along the south Texas coast; however, compactional subsidence may have masked the actual
height of the Texas high sea stands.
Late Quaternary sea level curves for the
northwestern Gulf of Mexico are derived largely
from the depths and ages of geomorphic features
submerged on the continental shelf (Curray 1960,
1965; Frazier 1974; Nelson and Bray 1970). None
of these Gulf Coast curves support a sea level
higher than that of the present day. However, the
nature of the data utilized to create these curves is
inherently biased against the documentation of sea
levels higher than the present level because the
data are derived from below present mean sea
level.
While late Holocene high sea stands have
been demonstrated for the south Texas coast, they
may not be represented or demonstrable along
other portions of the Gulf Coast due to differential
preservation of key deposits. Wind-tidal flats are
common along the south Texas coast because of

The geomorphological and paleoenvironmental investigations and preliminary reclmstruction of the late Holocene environment of the
project area have some important implications for
interpreting human utilization of the south Texas
coast and the greater region of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. Most importantly, it is suggested
here that environmental conditions limited utilization of much of the coastal zone during the late
Holocene.
The late Holocene environment of the coastal
zone underwent many dynamic changes, including
the formation of Padre Island and the Laguna
Madre, the transgression of the Rio Grande delta,
and the extensive development of wind-tidal flats
and clay dunes. These developments ultimately
affected the ldnds of resources available for
exploitation and their distributions, which in tum
influenced the organization of human subsistence
strategies. Ricklis and Cox (1991) have correlated
environmental changes along the central Texas
coast with observed changes in human adaptation
in the archeological record.
Estuaries and bays are relatively productive
environments but can be short lived because they
fill with sediments and become prograding terrestrial environments. The opposite is true on the
south Texas coast; estuaries form due to subsidence but are quickly inundated with extremely
saline water, continued subsidence transforms the
estuarine environment to a hypersaline lagoonal
environment, and therefore net productivity has
probably decreased throughout the late Holocene
for many parts of the south Texas coast.
The hypersaline environment of the Laguna
Madre greatly limited the littoral resources
available for utilization by hunting and gathering
groups. Rangia cuneata and even Crassostrea
virginica, which were dietary mainstays for prehistoric populations along the central and upper Texas
coasts, are absent. Shellfish are limited to just a
few hypersaline-tolerant species: Fish and waterfowl are abundant, however, and other molluscs
and crustaceans are available nearshore off the
barrier islands. Available plant foods probably
were limited to prickly pear and yucca. However,
the most limited resource and probably the key
limiting factor to utilization of the coastal zone is
freshwater. The semiarid climate of the area

. compactional subsidence and lack of drainage from
the mainland. These depositional environments
appear to be key indicators of sea level; however,
they are not present along the central and upper
Texas coasts. Like the south Texas coast, most of
. the central and upper Texas coasts is transgressive,
but the combination of both marine transgression
due to compactional subsidence and increased run•off along the central and upper Texas coasts may
·have erased any evidence of a high sea stand. This
is typical as sea level drops, the shoreline is
exposed to subaerial dissection, and erosion
increases (Davis and Clifton 1987:177). Subsidence and an ensuing high stand may be the reason
why the earlier high stand proposed by Prewitt and
Paine (1987) is not represented at 41 WY50,

The paleoenvironmental data are limited but
clearly exhibit one dominant trend. The stable
carbon isotope analysis demonstrates that the clay
dune environment has been dominated by C4 and/or
CAM plants throughout its history (Figure 31). A
slight increase in C, plants is depicted in the
historic period and probably represents an infestation of mesquite related to overgrazing. The C4
plants are most likely salt-resistant grasses and
CAM plants, such as prickly pear and yucca.

may become saline because of salts in the ground.
THE ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD
OF THE COASTAL ZONE
Geologic processes play an important role in
the formation of the archeological record. Consideration must be given to the probability that
archeological sites representing various cultural
periods are not equally represented because of
these processes. Coastal environments like those
of the south Texas coast often create a temporal
bias that favors the preservation of later occupations and discriminates against earlier occupations.
The near absence of Paleoindian, early Archaic,
and middle Archaic sites and materials along the
south Texas coast is not an accident. This is due
in large part to the eustatic sea level rise at the end
of the Pleistocene and the compactional subsidence
and marine transgression of the shoreline throughout the Holocene. Most of the coastal zone that
was exposed and utilized by Paleoindian, early
Archaic, and middle Archaic groups is now inundated by waters of the Gulf and Laguna Madre.
Many highly productive environments, such as
rivers, lakes, bays, and lagoons, are preserved on
the wide shallow continental shelf of the western
Gulf.
Undoubtedly, these former terrestrial
environments must have attracted human habitation

HUMAN ADAPTATION AND THE ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD
OF THE LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY: A REVIEW AND
ASSESSMENT FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS

6
This chapter reviews the results of the archeological investigations at 41 WY50 and 41 WY60 in
light of the archeological record of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. The first part of the chapter reviews
the human adaptation and land-use models proposed
by Bousman et al. (1990) and discusses the implications of the 41WY50 and 41WY60 data. This is
followed by a presentation of new interpretations,
concepts, and proposals about human adaptations.
The second part of the chapter consists of a review of
the archeological record regarding the research
potential and expectations for archeological sites and
the implications for future investigations.

The lithic data, however, did not conclusively favor
any one of the three models. The inability to confirm
any of the models may be due to a number of different factors, as acknowledged by Bousman et al.
(1990:130-133).
The additional data from sites 41WY50 and
41WY60 cannot clearly support or contradict any of
the three models of Bousman et al. (1990), nor can a
new model of human adaptation for the Lower Rio
Grande Valley be properly supported at this time.
However, the data do suggest that some of the
concepts and assumptions used by Bousman et al.
(1990) to define their models and resource zones,
especially their characterization of the structure and
productivity of the resources in the coastal zone, the
treatment of the five zones as a single cultural region,
and the use of forager-based models, need to be
reevaluated. Such a reevaluation is presented below.
The ideas discussed are far from complete, however,
and they are synchronically limited, considering only
the prehistoric record of the region since the formation of its modern environments (late Holocene),
which archeologically includes only the Late Prehistoric period and possibly the late Archaic. Clearly,
this discussion serves only as a springboard for future
investigations, and adjustments for temporal and
spatial variations will have to be made as new data
are obtained.
The 41WY50 and 41WY60 data suggest that the
productivity and economic resources of the coastal
zone are far below the levels expected by Bousman
et al. (1990), even considering that they recognized
that species composition and diversity may have been
affected by late Holocene environmental changes
(Bousman et al. 1990:30). In general, coastal areas
contain some of the most productive environments,
such as estuaries or lagoons, where wave stress is

Models of Human Adaptation and Land-Use
for the Lower Rio Grande Valley
Hester (1981) provided two of the earliest
models of human adaptation for the Lower Rio
Grande Valley in his overview of the cultural
chronology and patterns of south Texas. His savanna
adaptation reflects utilization of the interior savanna
grassland and riparian zones, while his maritime
pattern reflects use of the coastal bays, lagoons, and
barrier islands. However, Hester (1981:122) noted
that the models require adjustments with regard to
temporal, spatial, and seasonal changes. Bousman et
al. (1990) later elaborated on these concepts by
testing three similar models of forager subsistence
that incorporate optimal foraging theory and assume
that territorial divisions limited access to subsistence
resources. Bousman et al. (1990:37) viewed the
procurement of subsistence resources and lithic raw
materials as subject to the same kinds of constraints
and proposed that the analysis of lithic assemblages
could serve as a test of best fit between the three
models of adaptation and the archeological record.
59

Archeo/ogical and Geomorphological Investigations at 4IWY50 and 41WY50

reduced due to barriers and/or wide shallow continental shelves and freshwater discharge or run-off
decreases salinity stress.
Such reductions in
biological stress result in increases in species
diversity and productivity (Odum and Copeland
1974:36). Terrestrial game also inhabit these areas
adding to the resource base. Less effort and risk
could be involved in obtaining resources from these
highly productive coastal ecosystems than in interior
terrestrial systems, and in some coastal regions this
could result in a greater degree of sedentism, higher
population densities, and more-complex social
organization (Perlman 1980:257). However, not all
coastal zones are desirable human habitats. An
important difference between the south Texas coast
and the central and upper Texas coasts is the lack of
freshwater drainage along the former, resulting in the
development of broad wind-tidal flats and hypersaline conditions in the Laguna Madre. This greatly
limits species diversity and the number of economic
resources. The absence of potable water also is a
critial limiting factor (Mallouf et al. 1977).
Evidence of prehistoric shellfish utilization in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley is limited to one
Crassostrea virginica midden, 41CF8, which is
located near Brazos Santiago Pass where the
exchange of waters between the Laguna Madre and
the Gulf of Mexico results in decreased salinity
levels. The only known oyster beds in the southern
Laguna Madre occur in this area near the pass
(Prewitt 1974:60). Fishing, which is noted in the
ethnohistorical literature, appears to have been a
more common subsistence activity but seems to have
been confined to the Holocene delta of the Rio
Grande (Salinas 1990). Archeological evidence of
this is limited to one fish bone midden, 41 CF29,
which is located on a clay dune (Horse Island) at the
northern margin of the Rio Grande delta (Prewitt
1974:60). However, fish otoliths are common at
many sites, suggesting that the lack of fish bones may
be a factor of preservation. It appears archeologically that the prehistoric utilization of the coastal
zone of the Lower Rio Grande Valley was limited
primarily to an area south of the Arroyo Colorado,
along the lagoonal and Gulf margin of the modem
Rio Grande delta. Freshwater sources are scarce
north of the Arroyo Colorado, while south of it
freshwater lakes and resacas are more common. It is
no coincidence that the distribution of Rockport
Complex sites reaches its southern limit at Baffin
Bay where the salinity level of the Laguna Madre

increases, drainage from the mainland ceases, and
overall productivity of the coastal environments
decreases markedly until the modem Rio Grande
delta is reached approximately 100 kJ!1 to the south.
The concept or treatment of the five zones as a
single cultural region by Bousman et al. (1990), at
least for the Late Prehistoric period, also may be
inappropriate. Assuming that the Rio Grande acted
as a cultural or territorial boundary between groups
located south and north of the river, based on known
artifact distributions from both sides of the Rio
Grande, Bousman et al. (1990:36) treated the five
environmental zones as a single cultural region or
unit. Within this cultural region, a single group of
foragers, or several groups with similar foraging
subsistence strategies, may have operated, periodically utilizing dense resource patches which might
have allowed for a degree of increased seasonal
sedentism and/or territorial boundaries (Bousman et
al. 1990:36). An alternative interpretation of the
known archeological record, particularly lithic
assemblages, and the resources of the five environmental zones suggests that the five zones defined by
Bousman et al. (1990) may represent the margins of
two cultural regions with differing subsistence and
cultural patterns, separated by a vast area that was
sparsely or intermittently utilized. This interpretation
proposes that the lowland plain, and periodically the
sand sheet, and their associated coastal boundaries
were utilized on a very limited basis.
The lowland plain is where the vast majority of
the archeological investigations and documented
archeological sites associated with the HidalgoWillacy Drainage Ditch system are located. Only 8
of over 100 sites associated with the project have
seen National Register testing, which is a testament
to the poor context, limited integrity, and low artifact
density of the sites in this zone. Based on this
evidence from the archeological record, the ntilization
of this zone appears to have been greatly limited.
Although game and plant food resources are available, their abundance is meager compared to the Rio
Grande floodplain and delta zone to the south and
areas to the north. Water sources are limited to
playas, which are usually saline. The limited use of
this zone may have been associated with the acquisition of salt from La Sal Vieja and El Sal de! Rey, a
pair of saline basins at the northern margin of the
lowland plain, by groups both from the north and
from the south. Historic aboriginal and Spanish use
of these two lakes for salt procurement is well

·
North of the lowland plain and along the
.)•: ~orthem margin of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is
'"' !he south Texas sand sheet, the archeological record
:•,:
?' ()f which is poorly known. Although very few
(!,:archeological investigations have been carried out in
l ''Uthe sand sheet, preliminary investigations have
yielded sites with much higher artifact densities,
' particularly Iithic materials, than sites in the lowland
; plain (see Mallouf et al. 1977:190). Bousman et al.
;• (1990:143) note that the abundance of certain lithic
···
artifacts, such as cores, suggests that a Iithic source
may be located somewhere within the sand sheet.
However, much of the sand sheet is underlain by
fluvio-deltaic deposits of the Lissie and Beaumont
formations, which lack Iithic materials. An alternative suggestion, which Bousman et al. (1990:131) also
note, is that the sand sheet was utilized to a greater
extent than the lowland plain by hunting and gathering
groups. The sand sheet, with its oak mattes, provides
a variety of economic resources, including deer,
rabbits, javelina, prickly pear, and acorns. The
interdunal areas, which capture rainfall and run-off,
not only supply freshwater but also may have served
as excellent natural traps from which hunters could
have surprised or ambushed game attracted to the
water sources.
Who these hunting and gathering peoples were
is unclear. The spatial distribution of Toyah Horizon
sites appears to reach its southern limit along the
northern periphery of the sand sheet; however, the
lack of Toyah sites farther to the south may be biased
by the fact that the sand sheet has not been explored
archeologically. Subsistence activities interpreted
from Toyah sites and assemblages would be an ideal
adaptation in the sand sheet, although it is doubtful
that bison, an important economic resource for Toyah
peoples, ever ranged this far south. Savanna-type
adaptations are certainly represented in the ethnohistorical literature for groups who seasonally utilized
prickly pear fields just north of the sand sheet
(Campbell and Campbel! 1981), and while the sand
sheet does not contain dense prickly pear fields, other
resources abound. Archeologically, the evidence is
limited, but it does appear that the sand sheet was
utilized from time to time (seasonally or during rainy

periods) by foraging groups.
South of the lowland plain is the Rio Grande
floodplain and delta zone of Bousman et al. (1990).
The ethnohistorical record reveals that many
aboriginal groups inhabited this zone and maile use of
its abundant resources (Salinas 1990:255), and it has
been demonstrated archeologically that the coastal
margin of this zone also was utilized intensively. It
is within these zones that A. E. Anderson recorded a
number of sites and collected artifacts. It is also
within these zones that MacNeish (1947, 1958)
defined and delineated the Late Prehistoric Brownsville Complex. Both the artifacts of the Anderson
collection and MacNeish (1947, 1958) suggest
connections between the Brownsville Complex and
more-complex cultures to the south in Tamaulipas.
Huastecan ceramic pottery and figurines,jadite beads,
and obsidian are just some of the materials that
demonstrate ties to the Huastecan peoples of
northeastern Mexico. Another phenomenon that is
largely restricted to these zones is the presence of
cemeteries. In fact, Hester and Rodgers (1971:370)
suggest that the Arroyo Colorado, which marks the
northern boundary of these zones, may have held
some sort of importance for the Brownsville Complex
peoples since many of these cemeteries occur along
this drainage.
Evidence of contact between groups north of the
lowland plain and the Brownsville Complex is scant.
Salinas (1990: 19) suggests that the sparsely inhabited
area served as a linguistic and cultural boundary.
Mallouf et al. (1977:263) note two Perdiz points from
a site in the lowland plain of Hidalgo County, but
other than these. two arrow points, evidence is
lacking. Artifacts associated with the Brownsville
Complex are not found in assemblages from sites to
the north (MacNeish 1947:7); however, shell
ornaments and artifacts have been found farther south
in the Huastecan area (Ekholm 1944) and westward
into the Mexican states of Coahuila and Chihuahua
(Avelyra Arroyo de Anda et al. 1956; MacNeish
1958).
It appears that the Brownsville Complex may
represent Huastecan (Panuco Period VI) peoples or
peoples living on the frontier of Huastecan influence
and operating as a periphery or semiperiphery player
in a macrosystem with the Huastecan area as the core
(see Baugh 1982 for macrosystem definition). This
interpretation suggests that the tradition of viewing
the cultural adaptations and patterns of the Lower
Rio Grande Valley, particularily of the Late

.i'>

61

Archeological and Geomorphological Investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY50

Prehistoric period, as a part of a long tradition of
indigenous hunters and gatherers may be inappropriate. This concept leads to the third potential problem
with the models proposed by Bousman et al. (1990).
Bousman et al. (1990:26-36) utilized the
resource structure and the high effective temperature
or ET value (the annual mean and seasonal distribution of solar radiation) of the Lower Rio Grande
Valley to characterize human adaptations in the
region in terms of forager systems (e.g., Binford
1980), although two of the models, Models II and III,
allowed for increased seasonal sedentism and the
development of group territories in highly productive
and predictable resource patches. However, it
appears that resource densities and distributions in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley overall are atypical of
environments with high ET values, rendering the
presumption of a foraging adaptation tenuous.
Ricklis (1990:169-171) also questions the
assumption that the Lower Rio Grande Valley
prehistoric inhabitants were highly mobile foragers,
particularily for the Rio Grande floodplain and delta
zone and/or Brownsville Complex. Ricklis (1990:
171) alludes to the fact that the elaborate shell
industry of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is not
indicative of a highly mobile foraging population.
The cemeteries also suggest that Brownsville
Complex peoples had strong territorial ties, a
territory whose northern boundary may have been
marked by the Arroyo Colorado.
The highly
productive Rio Grande delta and floodplain may have
led to a greater intensity of use and more-frequent
reoccupation of the zone by foraging group(s},
resulting in the establishment of cemeteries.
However, the exclusion of habitation areas within
these formal burial areas is suggestive of a more
complex pattern of sedentism and social structure
(Goldstein 1981).
Ricklis (1990:171-172) suggests that a model
based on a less mobile collecting strategy may be
more appropriate for the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
Salinas (1990:216) notes that during the winter fish
were dried and stored, a practice more characteristic
of collectors than foragers. The connections between
the Brownsville Complex and the Huasteca, the shell
industry, and the formal cemeteries appear to
represent a society of more complexity than small
bands of foragers. From this perspective, it appears
that the Brownsville Complex represents logistical
collectors, or possibly simple horticulturalists, who
may have supplemented their diet with fish and other

marine resources during the winter months.
Research Goals and Assessment of the
Archeological Record for th~
Lower Rio Grande Valley
The preceding review of human adaptations
temporally limited, the result of a poorly underst
and biased archeological record. This is only on
many important data gaps and research needs th
should be addressed in the Lower Rio Grande Vall
by future investigations. Some recent archeologic
overviews (e.g., Black 1989; Ricklis 1990) ha
noted some of these research needs as part of
overall larger south Texas or coastal Texas regio
but they do not single-handedly or specificall
address the research needs of the Lower Rio Grand·
Valley. A single point is common in all the reviews·
however, and that is the basic need for meaningfu
archeological data.
An understanding of the region's cultural·
chronology is an obvious point of concern. This goal
is hampered by a lack of datable materials (i.e.,
charcoal}, well-defined stratigraphy, and timediagnostic artifacts at most sites. Collins et al.
(1989) recommend that radiocarbon dating of soil and
sediment humates and optical luminescence dating of.
sediments can provide important chronological data ·.
for poorly preserved and artifact-sparse sites. These<<
techniques may provide chronological control not only .
over geomorphic events but also to some extent over
cultural events.
There is also a tremedous need for archeological data predating the late Archaic. An absolute
chronology does not exist, and tool types and assemblages are poorly defined. This need for data,
however, is hindered by the fact that late Pleistocene
and early to middle Holocene landforms and surfaces
are so poorly preserved. Upland Pleistocene surfaces
were severely deflated during the early and middle
Holocene. Pleistocene and early Holocene coastlines
have subsided or have been inundated by rising sea
levels. Many environments that probably attracted
human habitation, such as rivers, lakes, bays, and
lagoons, are preserved on the wide shallow continental shelf of the western Gulf of Mexico, and it is
likely that many Paleoindian and early to middle
Archaic sites are preserved within these environments.
Coastal bays and lagoons probably were not as saline
as the modern Laguna Madre since the barrier islands
were not in place, resulting in a greater diversity of
62

Chapter 6: Human Adaptation and the Archeological Record of the Lower Rio Grande Valley

resources and the potential for greater utilization by
humans. Therefore, even if the early archeological
record of the region was preserved, the terrestrial
record may be limited as populations probably would
have been drawn to the resource-dense coastal areas.
The Late Prehistoric period is better known than
the preceding periods; however, many questions
remain. The tentatively defined Brownsville Complex
lacks thoroughly excavated sites and radiocarbon
assays establishing an absolute chronology. An
important beginning to understanding this poorly
understood complex would be a thorough analysis of
the A. E. Anderson collection at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. It should be analyzed
and compared to artifact assemblages from
Tamaulipas, South Texas, and the Falcon Reservoir
area.
The elaborate shell industry should be
compared to other shell ornament and tool industries
from the Corpus Christi area and the coastal
Tamaulipas (Huastecan) area. Shell species should
be identified, as well as their sources or ranges.
Manufacturing methods and stages need to be
understood and delineated, and their presence in
regions outside the Lower Rio Grande Valley needs
to be studied. Source analysis of exotic materials
such as ceramics and obsidian through petrography
and neutron activitation or x-ray diffraction should be
carried out. Although several cemeteries and burials
have been documented and attributed to the Brownsville Complex, none of the human remains have been
dated by radiocarbon assay. In addition to radiocarbon dating, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic
analyses should be carried out to infer dietary
patterns. It is also important that habitation sites be
found and documented. Such analyses and studies
could further our understanding of this cultural
manifestation, including its mortuary and subsistence
practices, material culture, and exchange systems, and
may establish whether the Brownsville Complex is a
valid concept.
In the sand sheet area to the north, very little is
known about the Late Prehistoric period. Even the
most modest data on sites and tool assemblages
would greatly increase understanding of the archeological record in this area and could shed some light
on what Late Prehistoric cultural manifestations are
represented.
Lithic raw materials are rare in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. It is important to understand how
this affected the procurement of raw materials and the
manufacture, curation, and discard of lithic artifacts.

Micro-use-wear analyses should be included as part
of these lithic studies, and the importance of shell as
a lithic substitute also should be considered. An
important aspect of these studies would be the manufacture, temporal variance, and function of the many
small triangular bifaces that dominate assemblages in
the region.
Features, primarily shallow basin-shaped
hearths, are poorly understood. A better understanding of their use lives and functions may be obtained
from micromorphological studies of feature block thin
sections. This technique has shown great promise for
identifying hearth fuel and the nature of the feature
fill (see Appendix E).
Because Holocene environmental changes in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley have played such an
important role in site formation, a rigorous geomorphological/paleoenvironmental program should be a
part of any archeological investigation. Such investigations could include, but not be limited to, detailed
documentation of significant profiles, dating of soils
and sediments, stable carbon isotope analysis on soil
humates, micro-faunal analysis, and pollen and
phytolith analyses of selected samples.
Little of the archeological data generated thus
far from the previous investigations carried out in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley can thoroughly address
these issues. New and meaningful data are sorely
needed and can be obtained only from new and
different sites. It is well established that many older
environments are not preserved in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley and that some areas, such as the
lowland plain and parts of the coast, have little
potential for yielding the kinds of sites needed to
address the issues discussed above. It is recommended that any future survey efforts focus intensively on limited areas of high site potential rather
than on extensive areal coverage.
In the case of Paleoindian and early to middle
Archaic sites, few areas in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley have the potential to yield these early sites
intact. The only preserved terrestrial environment
where these early occupations potentially may be
found is the Holocene alluvial fill of the Rio Grande
Valley. Previous geomorphological studies of the
Rio Grande Valley suggest that alluvial deposits
predating the late Holocene are preserved (Boyd et
al. 1994; Kibler and Freeman 1993). If this is the
case, then the potential for preserved Paleoindian and
early to middle Archaic sites is high. Survey efforts
on the Rio Grande floodplain and associated
63

Archeo/ogica/ and Geomorphological Investigations at 41WY50 and 41WY50

Holocene terraces should make use of deep mechanical trenching, particularily on levees overlooking
resacas. There is also a limited potential for the
preservation of early occupation sites in some of the
larger, more stable dunes of the sand sheet. Deep
testing is recommended for these larger dunes, as
well as the close inspection of adjacent interdunal
areas for the presence of early time-diagnostic
materials that may be eroding out at the base of the
dunes.
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites are
much more common, as late Holocene environments
are better preserved across the Lower Rio Grande
Valley. Prewitt (1974) defines five topographic/
geomorphic environments where sites tend to cluster:
clay dune-laguna, clay dune-lake or playa, resacalaguna, resaca, and barrier island. Another specific
environment can be added to this list, that being the
lower reaches of the Arroyo Colorado. Burials and
cemeteries appear to be common along this drainage.
Levees should be extensively tested by hand and
backhoe trenches. Survey efforts should focus intensively on all six of these areas, utilizing shovel tests
and backhoe trenches.
Chronological data are not the only meaningful
information needed. The most productive sites are
those that are well preserved and relatively artifact
and ecofact dense. Sites that occur within the
previously mentioned six environments often are
disturbed and artifact poor. Past investigations (e.g.,
Hall et al. 1987) have defined sites on as little as the
presence of bone fragments, unmodified shells, and
burned clay lumps in combination. While this definition of a site should not be abandoned, sites like this

have little research potential. Further testing
excavation efforts in the region should be reserved
sites likely to contain temporal data (e.g., project
points, ceramics, human remains, and. charcoal)
artifact- or ecofact-dense components. Testing
excavation of sites lacking these characteristi
should be avoided.
To summarize these recommendations, an inte
sive level of effort is proposed for certain areas
environments in the Lower Rio Grande Valley whe
the potential for intact sites with relatively dens'
artifacts and/or ecofacts is high. Two areas, th
Holocene valley fill of the Rio Grande and the large
stabilized sand dunes of the sand sheet, offer the bes
potential for the presence of sites predating the lat~
Archaic and should be inspected through dee~
mechanical testing and shovel tests. Smaller environ..,
ments, such as clay dunes and levees overlooking
resacas, within and outside these larger areas offer
the best potential for containing intact artifact-dense
sites, cemeteries, and isolated burials. Efforts
focusing on these areas should make extensive use of
shovel testing and mechanical testing to locate and
evaluate sites. The costs for such intensive efforts
can be offset by the fact that the overall areal coverage is limited, as areas of low site potential and
artifact-poor sites are excluded. Costs can be offset
further by concentrating excavation efforts on relatively small numbers of sites with relatively high
artifact or ecofact densities, intact stratigraphy, and
overall high research potential. At the same time,
however, large areas within these few chosen sites
should be excavated to add sorely needed archeological data.

medium, or coarse, depending on ped morphology
or type. The type, referring to the shape of the
peds, is identified as blocky (subangular and
angular), platy, prismatic, columnar, or granular.
Soil horizons not containing these characteristics
are considered structureless. Final soil horizon
classifications were made based on the terminology
and criteria presented by Birkeland (1984) and
Bettis (1984) .
In the absence of soil formation, the
sedimentary structures of a zone are presented.
Types of sedimentary structures include, but are
not limited to, planar laminations, graded beds,
cross-stratifications, trough cross-stratifications,
ripples, climbing ripples, and massive structures.
Mottles are described by color, abundance,
contrast, and size. Abundance is shown as few
(<2 %) , common (2-20%), and many (>20%), while
contrast is described as faint, distinct, or prominent. Size ranges are given as fine (<0.5 cm),
medium (0.5-1.5 cm), or coarse(> 1.5 cm). Terms
pertaining to abundance are also used to describe
the occurrence of inclusions or intrusive objects,
such as gravels and charcoal. The lower boundary
of each zone or horizon is described in terms of
distinctiveness-very abrupt (<0.l cm), abrupt (O.l2.5 cm), clear (2.5-6.4 cm), gradual (6.4-12.7 cm),
and diffused (> 12.7 cm)- and topography- smooth,
wavy, irregular, and broken.

geomorphic profiles are described and
ccording to the procedures and criteria
y Buol et al. (1980:21-43), Birkeland
d Bettis (1984). The color (Munsell Soil
t) and consistency (loose, very friable,
m, very firm, and extremely firm) of a
iment are recorded from a moist condid definitions of texture consist of: (1)
se, single-grained, moist cast will
.J2) sandy loam (mostly sand with enough
ay to be somewhat coherent, individual

-five sediment samples from site
ere submitted to the Soils and Physical
Laboratory, Department of Geography,
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, for grain-size
rain sizes were measured by hydrometer
alysis at 1-phi intervals. Five of the 35
so were analyzed for soluble salts {Table

determination of elastic sediment sizes is
the Wentworth scale (Wentworth 1922).
e uses millimeters to determine class size
isions; for example, the lower size limit of
0.0625 mm (fine sand), while the upper size
2 mm (very coarse sand). This scale can be
d to a logarithmic scale (e.g., Krumbein
which is known as the phi scale. Thus, a phi
f zero equals 1 mm, -1 phi equals 2 mm, 1
uals 0.5 mm, and so on. The use of the
mic ratio scales for grain sizes results in
normally distributed sediment populations.

analyses produced two sets of data that have been
combined in Table 7. The hydrometer analysis
separated grain sizes smaller than sand (4 phi) at 1phi intervals, while the sieve analysis separated the
sand fraction (particles coarser than 4 phi) at the
same interval. The textural boundaries utilized in this
analysis in terms of the phi scale are given in Table
7. The textural phi values are percentages based on
weight.

James W. Westgate
Department of Geology
Lamar University
Beaumont, Texas

red Texas habitats of the species whose remains were
collected from the two sites. Tue aquatic species
prefer estuarine or freshwater habitats such as the
nearby Laguna Madre and its tributaries. Terrestrial
forms identified at the species level include the Texas
gopher tortoise, the southern plains woodrat, and the
hispid pocket mouse. Coastal populations of the first
two species are restricted today to south Texas, while
the hispid pocket mouse range extends southward
from Galveston Bay (Pritchard 1979; Schrnidly 1983).
Tables 9 and 10 are itemized lists of the
vertebrate remains recovered from each site presented
by test unit and level. Tue specimens are identified
to taxon, element, number, side, and minimum
number of individuals. Several mammalian specimens are identified as being from small (mouse to
rabbit) or medium (fox to deer) sized species. Most
of the remains identified as chelonian are probably
from the Texas gopher tortoise. There is no obvious
indication of seasonality represented by the fauna!
remains, although thin sections of the three otoliths
could provide additional information.

INTRODUCTION

Tue archeological excavations at two Willacy
unty clay dune sites, 41WY50 and 41WY60,
lded 286 vertebrate specimens. Approximately
% (n = 77) are not identifiable beyond their
gnition as vertebrate remains. Tue other 73% are
ntified at least to the level of Class. Tue
ecimens were identified in the Paleontology
boratory of the Department of Geology at Lamar
·versity using comparative materials from the
nt vertebrate collections of the Departments of
logy and Biology. All of the remains appear to
present species currently inhabiting Willacy County.
possible exception is the phalanx from a bovid
hich does not allow differentiation between that of
bison or a domestic form of cattle.

INTRODUCTION
Three samples of sediment and feature fill
eatures 3 and 10) from site 41WY50 were
cessed and analyzed for their pollen and
tolith content. The following presents the
thods and results of the analysis, and recomndations for future palynological research in the

METHODS
samples were processed according to
dard palynological procedures as follows: (1)
ml of each sample was measured into a 600-ml
aker; (2) two Lycopodium tablets (11,300 ± 500

expansion-contraction process caused by being
wetted and dried; and (2) the pressure phenomenon
described by Burstyn and Bartlett (1975). The
more frequently this cycle occurs in a ~oil, the
greater the potential for fossil pollen to be
destroyed or deteriorated, first by developing
stress cracks in the exine and next by further
breakdown of the pollen wall by mechanical
processes.
These conditions combine to destroy pollen
grains which are normally highly durable in many
sedimentary samples (Hall 1981; Havinga 1964).
As a result, paleobotanical research in the south
Texas region has produced few significant records
of Quaternary-age vegetation and has contributed
little to the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of
that area (Dering and Bryant 1993).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE
INVESTIGATIONS
The results of the analysis of pollen samples
from 41WY50, combined with the results of many
other attempts to extract pollen from sediments in
south Texas (Dering and Bryant 1994), indicate
that pollen preservation in the south Texas region
is very poor. This does not rule out the possibility
that fossil pollen can be recovered from archeological sites in south Texas. Continued testing for the
presence of pollen would be recommended in
specific cases where microenvironments would be
favorable for the preservation of pollen. For
example, King et al. (1975) found excellent
preservation in specific microenvironments at the
Rhoades Site in eastern North America, even
though the general preservational environment was
poor. Excellent pollen recovery was obtained from
archeological features, especially in association
with copper artifacts and tree bark. King et al.
(1975) recommended that there is a need for a
strategy that includes sampling areas of a site that
may be best for pollen preservation. If adequate
pollen preservation is present at south Texas sites,
it probably will be a specific microenvironment,
most likely an archeological feature with a
comparatively sealed context such as the remnants
of a structure or a cooking or temporary storage
area. If one of these favorable environments is not
found, it is doubtful that adequate pollen recovery
can be obtained from other samples at the site.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Examination of the three samples indicated
hat no fossil pollen is present in the sediments or
eature fill. A few club-shaped phytoliths were
bserved, but there is not enough material to
arrant further analysis.
The poor preservation is typical of the very
alkaline sediments and high oxidation rates present
'n south Texas. High temperatures and repeated
et-dry cycles that occur in the region also
ontribute to the destruction of palynomorphs.
Each time the soil hydration-dehydration process
.occurs, the pollen trapped in the soil is subjected to
two potentially destructive processes: (1) the

Micromorphology involves the study of
undisturbed soils and sediments at a microscopic
scale. It is a technique to aid in the identification
and interpretation of the geomorphic and anthropogenic processes affecting archeological site formation. Commonly this technique involves the use of
thin sections- a 25-30-micron-thick slice of soil and
sediment mounted on a glass slide. The procedures
for collecting the samples, impregnating them, cutting
them into thin sections, and mounting them are
discussed in detail by Courty et al. (1989).
Two block samples of sediments and hearth
features were collected from the profiles of test
units or existing cross-section exposures for
micromorphological analysis. The two samples
were collected from Features 9 and IO at site
41WY50. Both samples included feature fill
(charcoal) and underlying and overlying sediments.
The Feature 9 sample revealed a thin
(1-2 cm) layer of wood charcoal atop a zone of
oxidized sediments, which clearly represents in situ
burning (Figure 32). The sediments above and
below the feature depict the poorly sorted deposits
of very fine to fine quartz sand and clay pellets or
aggregates. Bioturbation is limited throughout the

sample. Micro bedding structures, depicting the
incremental accretion of the dune, consist of graded
parallel laminations (3-6 mm thick). Weathering
or surface stability is marked by zones of flocculated clay pellets, whereas zones of distinct pellets
and quartz sand represent more-rapid depositional
episodes.
The sample from Feature IO revealed a thin
(less than 1 cm) layer of grass charcoal atop a
zone of oxidized sediments (Figure 33). Grass
silicas or phytoliths are abundantly revealed
throughout the feature fill under polarized light.
Tiny bone fragments are present in the overlying
sediments but are not burned and probably are not
associated with the feature. Micro bedding structures, similar to those observed in the Feature 9
sample, also were observed in the Feature IO
sample.
The identification of the oxidized sediments
conclusively shows that the features represent in
situ burning and not the decomposition of organic
materials. The identification of grass used as a
fuel in Feature IO suggests that woody plant
species made up a small percentage of the dune's
plant community.
