ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed water treatment plant (3 acres), a
backwash line (1200 feet), a raw water line (400 feet), and one mile of water line was
conducted in southern Brazos County, Texas by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) on November 2 and 3, 2006. One prehistoric archaeological site (41BZ160) was
found. Based on the presence of an arrow point preform, this site dates to the Late
Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory. The fairly large size of most of the flakes, the
presence of primary and secondary flakes, and the abundance of natural and plain
platforms combined with the arrow point preform indicate that some initial tool manufacture
in the form of biface reduction occurred at this site. This project was performed under
Antiquities Permit 4309 issued by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.
Artifacts collected include 16 pieces of lithic debitage and a broken arrow point preform.
These artifacts were discarded. This site is not eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. Copies of this report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas as well
as the Wellborn Special Utility District (SUD) and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Wellborn Special Utility District (SUD) plans to construct a 16-inch water
pipeline along four miles of State Highway 6 and one mile along Harlan Road, which will
connect the pipeline to the proposed surface water treatment plant on a high hill
overlooking the Navasota River (Figure 1). The treatment plant will be constructed on a
three-acre tract that is part of a larger tract of 22 acres owned by the Wellborn SUD.
The trench for the water line will be approximately two feet wide and five feet deep. The
line will be placed beneath 36 inches of cover. In addition, there will be a backwash line
(1200 feet) from the treatment plant to an existing pond, and a raw water (400 feet) line
that will terminate at the river. A portion of the raw water line will be constructed
beneath an already disturbed area that was cut away by heavy machinery. The
remaining part is in an area where clay and/or bedded sandstone is at the surface or in
the clay floodplain of the Navasota River. The project area is depicted on two USGS
7.5â topographic quadrangles. They are Ferguson Crossing dated 1959 (revised 1980)
(3096-412) and Millican dated 1959 (photorevised 1980) (3096-1433). The area
surveyed has been superimposed on the Millican topographic quadrangle, and this map
appears as Figure 2. This figure also depicts the location of the 11 shovel tests that
were excavated along the route of the pipeline parallel to Harlan Road.
Archaeological sites have been found in the vicinity of the current project area
along the river and in inland settings. The tract where the water treatment plant is to be
placed was viewed by BVRA as a high probability area for a prehistoric or historic site
as it is on a high hill overlooking the confluence of an unnamed creek and the Navasota
River. BVRA was retained to perform an archaeological survey of the portion of the
project area that has not been examined in the past by another archaeological firm.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal
Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). Fenneman
subdivides this province according to the age of the geological formations (Gulf series) that
roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated within the East Texas
timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized by gently rolling to hilly
topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 95
degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and
Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400 feet.
Project Area
The project area is located in three different settings. The five-mile route along
State Highway 6 is within a totally destroyed highway right-of-way due to construction of
additional lanes along this busy road. The one-mile access road passes through woods
and pasture; however, the water line will be placed in the already disturbed right-of-way.
This area is depicted in Figure 3 below.

The proposed water treatment plant, backwash line, and raw water line will be
constructed on a high hill and slopes overlooking the confluence of an unnamed creek
and the Navasota River (Figure 4). A portion of the raw water line is within the
floodplain of the river. The area is sparsely wooded with oaks and mixed hardwoods.
Surface visibility in the site area was estimated to be 20 percent due to rodent burrows
and sparse ground cover in places. At the crest of the hill, the soils contained shallow
clays and sandstone with occasional rocky outcrops. South of this area is deep sand.

Figure 4. View of Proposed Plant Site and Site 41BZ160

According to the soil survey for Brazos County (Chervenka 2003), the soils along
the access route consist of Falba fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (FaB), Padina
loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (PaC), Shalba-Rock outcrop complex, 2 to 6
percent slopes (ScC), and Shiro Loamy fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes (SkB). The
soils at the site of the proposed treatment plant consist of PaC and ScC, soils. Along
the raw water line the soils consist of ScC soils and Gladewater clay, frequently flooded
(Gd). The soils along the backwash line consist of PaC soils. The soils in the project
area are depicted in Figure 5. Appendix I present descriptions of the various soils in the
project area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of
Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is situated within the
Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a statistical overview
published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:114), Brazos County
contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985, 0 sites in the county had been excavated, 0 had
been tested by hand, and 33 had been surface collected. Two recorded prehistoric sites
in the county were listed as Paleo-Indian, 1 was listed as General Archaic, and 1 was
listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:114). The archaeological potential of
Brazos County is reflected in part by the increasing number of recorded sites found as a
result of cultural resource management studies. As a result of these investigations, the
number of recorded sites now stands at 159 (TARL site records).
Previous Investigations
There have been three major surveys in the vicinity of the project area. These are
a survey of the Navasota River Basin by the Texas Archeological Survey (Sorrow and Cox
1973), the Millican project by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter 1982) in 1981, and at
least one survey along State Highway 6 was conducted by the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT). It is not clear from the site records that sites were recorded
during the TxDOT surveys since no reports were available for review. However, not one
of the sites recorded along this highway are within the current project area. In addition,
several prehistoric sites have been recorded along the right-of-way of State Highway 6 by
William E. Moore on his personal time.
The study by Sorrow and Cox (1973) was an assessment of the cultural resources
of the Navasota River Basin prior to the construction of the proposed Millican Lake. At the
time of their reconnaissance, only 12 sites were known within the lower Navasota River
Basin (Sorrow and Cox 1973:3). Due to heavy rains, much of the area was not
investigated. Also, dense vegetation obscured much of the ground surface making site
identification difficult since shovel testing was not conducted. Still, 14 sites (41BZ17 â
41BZ30) were found in the Brazos County portion. An additional eight sites (41BZ8 â
41BZ15) were recorded prior to this study, and they are discussed in the report by Sorrow
and Cox (1973:Figure 1); however, it is not clear if these sites were visited during this
survey. The researchers concluded that the number of prehistoric sites identified during
the reconnaissance is but a small percentage of the total number of sites present within
the basin. Evidence of Paleo-Indian through Late Prehistoric utilization was documented
based on projectile points and pottery collected. It is recommended in the report (Sorrow
and Cox 1973:36) that âa thorough evaluative survey of the study area should be
undertaken accompanied by selective subsurface testing.â

7

According to the authors (Sorrow and Cox 1973:4), âone aspect of site location
deserves special consideration.â They are referring to the potential for deeply buried sites.
They cite 41BZ26 as an example since it was located due to the presence of disturbance
caused by quarrying activities. They do not mention the depth at which artifacts were
found, but an Angostura point was found below Archaic points and ceramics.
Five areas were investigated by Steven M. Kotter for Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
during their preliminary assessment of the Millican project within the Navasota River Basin.
The area nearest to the current project area is referred to in Kotterâs report as the Millican
Damsite Transect Area (Kotter 1982:Figure 1). Within this transect, six survey areas are in
Brazos County. They are areas A, B, D, E, F, and G (Kotter 1982:Figure 8). Eighteen
prehistoric sites were found in these areas.
Area A is located within a portion of the modern Navasota River floodplain. Two
sites were identified. They are 41BZ44 and 41BZ45, and they were found on banks of
relict channels of the Navasota River. Kotter (1982:57) believes that they probably
represent âmultiple activity areas which at the time of their occupation were closely
associated with the channel of the Navasota River.â A riverine resource orientation is
suggested for both sites.
Area B is a low-lying portion of the right valley wall of the Navasota River, which is
composed of Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits and forms a divide between the river
and Millican Creek. One site (41BZ141) was recorded along the eroded margin of the
area immediately above the modern floodplain of the Navasota River. Kotter (1982:57)
believes that this site represents a limited activity area associated with the river. Both
valley wall and riverine resource orientations are suggested.
Area D is located in the valley floor of Millican Creek, which consists solely of the
modern floodplain. No sites were identified.
Area E consists of a portion of the right valley wall of Millican Creek that is
composed of bedrock strata of the Whitsett Member and the Catahoula Formation.
Eleven prehistoric sites (41BZ47 â 41BZ57) were identified, and two previously recorded
sites (41BZ7 and 41BZ9) were visited. The survey crew found no evidence of site 41BZ7.
Four sites were found within the lower portion of the valley wall and immediately above the
modern floodplain of Millican Creek (41BZ48, 41BZ49, 41BZ56, and 41BZ547). Four sites
were found within the middle portion of the valley wall (41BZ51 â 41BZ53 and 41BZ55).
Three of the newly recorded sites (41BZ47, 41BZ50, and 41BZ54) and previously
recorded site 41BZ9 are situated within the upper portion of the creekâs valley wall. The
sites are believed to represent limited activity areas, multiple activity areas, lithic
procurement areas, and campsites.

8

Area F consists of a portion of the right valley wall of Millican Creek, which is
composed of bedrock strata of the Whitsett Member. One prehistoric site (41BZ43) was
identified. This site is a small exposure (5 m x 5 m) of thinly distributed remains. This site
is situated on a low rise immediately above the valley floor of Millican Creek. According to
the report by Kotter (1982:61), it is described as a limited activity area. Both valley wall
and riverine resource orientations are suggested.
Area G consists of a portion of the left valley wall of Millican Creek that is composed
of Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits of the Navasota River. Three prehistoric sites
(41BZ29 [previously recorded], 41BZ40, and 41BZ42) were identified. These sites are
small to moderate in size and contain thinly distributed buried cultural materials. They are
situated on small rises which occur on a relatively flat landform (possibly a cut bench)
which parallels Millican Creek. Sites 41BZ40 and 41BZ42 are believed to represent
campsites associated with Millican Creek. Both valley wall and riverine resource
orientations are suggested.
No reference of shovel testing was made. In fact, Kotter (1982:6) states that it was
hard for the survey crews to locate sites because they were buried, and surface visibility
was often hindered by dense vegetation. Therefore, critical information regarding the
newly recorded sites was probably not obtained, and sites may have been missed. One of
the important aspects of this study was the identification of sites in various environmental
and topographic settings. Most researchers believe that the gravels in this area used to
make stone tools were obtained from gravel bars in the Brazos River and Navasota River.
This reconnaissance identified concentrations of lithic gravels on underlying hard
sandstone at the heads of slope drainages (Kotter 1982:60).
Major Investigations in the County
Some of the more notable investigations in the area include the Richard Carter site
(41BZ74) (Carlson 1983, 1987), the Brazos Valley Slopes Archaeological project (Thoms
1993a), White Creek Archaeological project (Thoms 1993b), the Bush Presidential Library
(Moore and Warren 1993), and the Tradition Golf and Country Club at University Ranch
(Moore 2000, 2001)
The single largest archaeological project in the general area was a 20-year study at
the Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA) site in Grimes County by Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc. resulting in numerous contract reports. This study resulted in the
recording, testing, and mitigation of a large number of prehistoric and historic sites. The
Project Archaeologist for TMPA, Edward P. Baxter, supervised all field phases of this
project. The interested reader is advised to consult the library at the TARL in order to gain
access to those reports that were generated as a result of this investigation.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the presence
of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Brazos County were reviewed in order to
become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Field Survey
The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and the Project Archaeologist was
Edward P. Baxter. An archaeological survey of a one-mile proposed waterline, a threeacre treatment plant site, a 400-foot backwash line, and a 1200-foot raw water line was
conducted on November 3 and 4, 2006. The remaining portion of the proposed waterline
along State Highway 6 lies in a previously surveyed area and was not investigated during
this project. The ground cover adjacent to Harlan Road was too heavy to allow for good
surface visibility in many places. In some places, ditch erosion provided excellent visibility.
Within the rest of the project area there were scattered rodent burrows that offered some
exposure of the sandy soil. These areas were visually inspected for cultural materials.
The vegetation on top of the hill consisted of scattered post oaks and other hardwoods.
The site of the proposed waterline, proposed water treatment plant, the proposed
backwash line, and the proposed raw water line were not flagged or staked. The Project
Archaeologist was able to identify the project area boundaries after viewing the area with
the manager of the special utility district. The Project Archaeologist began shovel testing
at the intersection of State Highway 6 and along Harlan Road and worked to the northeast
in the direction of the proposed site of the water treatment plant.
All excavated earth was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Data
obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix II). All shovel
tests were backfilled after evaluation and mapping, and the location of each test was
plotted on the topographic map (Figure 2) and a site map (Figure 6). In all 33 shovel tests
were excavated. Eleven were dug along the access road, and 22 were dug within the
footprint of the proposed water treatment plant. The siteâs boundaries were delineated by
a series of shovel tests in the four cardinal directions. Testing ceased when two negative
tests were excavated in each direction. Other scattered shovel tests were excavated on
the landform. Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital camera, and a
hand-held GPS was used to help locate project area boundaries and record shovel tests
and sites. . Artifacts were bagged and labeled in the field. They were analyzed by William
A. Dickens in the laboratory, and his results appear in this report in the section entitled
Artifact Analysis below. Jean Hughes at TARL prepared them for permanent at TARL.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
The survey for the Wellborn SUD surface water treatment plan yielded one arrow
point preform and sixteen pieces of debitage. All artifacts were recovered from five
positive shovel tests. Each artifact was analyzed by coding for those individual and
discreet attributes common to each artifact type. The various components of the biface
(i.e., length, width, and thickness) were measured and examined for specific
technological traits. In addition, stage of manufacture, condition, and possible reason
for abandonment, material type, and any use modifications were also recorded.
Debitage is usually the most common artifact type recovered from archaeological
sites. For this reason, and the fact that these materials can offer a great deal of
information on the activities conducted at a site, the flake debris were closely examined.
Each individual flake within the debitage assemblage was coded for size, condition,
flake type, platform type, presence or absence of heat, and material type. In order to
establish size, each flake was passed through a series of nested sieve screens that
range from 2 inches (size grade 1) to 1/4 inch (size grade 7) with those falling through
the 1/4 inch screen assigned to a size grade 8. Flake types, determined by the amount
of cortex present on the flakesâ surfaces combined with flake size, are useful in
establishing stage of bifacial reduction. That is, large flakes with some cortex (natural
surface) present on one or more surfaces are considered to represent initial or early
stage reduction, while smaller flakes without cortex are thought to represent late stage
reduction debris (Ahler 1975; Behm 1983:11-14; Newcomer 1971:88-90; Stahle and
Dunn 1982:85-94).
It must be understood, however, that flakes often break, and that large numbers
of small flakes are also produced throughout the manufacturing process as a result of
edge straightening, platform creation, and other minor manipulations necessary for a
successful flake removal and tool manufacture. In addition, small flakes are also
produced during maintenance (re-sharpening) tasks, use-related activities, and the
manufacture of small task specific tools, such as perforators, scrapers, and a variety of
cutting-type tools.
Another factor that may explain the presence of small flakes is the size of the tool
produced. For example, arrow point manufacture during the Late Prehistoric period
required smaller blanks or preforms than the larger dart points common to earlier
periods. Flakes produced from such blanks for arrow points are smaller than
comparable flakes produced during dart point manufacture. However, many larger tools
with large flake removals were also produced within arrow point lithic assemblages,
thus, any definitive reliance based strictly on flake size for the separation of arrow point
and dart point assemblages is not recommended.

11

The other attributes, such as flake type (briefly described above), platform type,
raw material types, and the presence of heating all add to a better understanding of
those technological strategies and activities mentioned above. For example, flake type,
type of platform (the degree of preparation conducted at the point of impact for flake
removal), hard or soft hammer indicators, such as platform lipping or ventral bulb size,
are useful in recognizing the reduction sequences present.
The presence or absence of heating (color change, pot-lidding, or crazing) is
often viewed as an indication of a process in which the raw material was thermally
altered. This alteration was often performed on those raw materials that were hard to
flake. By heating prepared blanks or large flakes, the flaking capability of the material is
changed, resulting in material that is easier to flake (Dickens 1995a). However, like
most all attributes studied, other factors may result in visual similarities. For example,
natural grass fires or the presence of hearths and earth ovens may also result in the
heat alteration of both discarded debitage and other materials not related to tool
reduction and manufacture.
Of the 16 flakes in the sample, one is Size Grade 4, nine are Size Grade 5, four
are Size Grade 6, and two are Size Grade 7. Flake types include primary (n=3),
secondary (n=3), and interior or tertiary (n=10). The condition of the flakes is as follows:
whole (n=8), medial (n=4), medial distal (n=2), and medial proximal (n=2). Platform
types consist of crushed (n=1), natural (n=6), plain (n=7), and polyhedral (n=2).
Artifact Descriptions
The single biface (Figure 6) was recovered from Level 5 (50 - 60 cm) of Shovel
Test 17. It is incomplete. The distal tip is missing, probably broken during manufacture.
The reminder measures 22.8 mm long, 16.6 mm wide, and 3.4 mm thick. It is made on
a flake of light yellow chert. This specimen is a late stage biface intended to be an
arrow point, but failed (fracturing) during the final shaping process.

Figure 6. Arrow Point Preform

12

Arrow points are lithic indicators for the Late Prehistoric period that began around
A.D. 600-700 (Turner and Hester 1993:57-61). Although a specific placement of this
small biface cannot be assigned to a specific arrow point type, it is a preform intended
for the manufacture of an arrow point. Therefore, the other lithics at this site are
believed to date to the Late Prehistoric period as well.
The sixteen flakes are all made of chert. From some of the cortex that remains
on several of the flakes, it is evident that these were made from local chert gravels,
common to the region (Dickens 1995b:179-181). Size grades range from Size Grade 4
to Size Grade 7 with most (n = 10) within Size Grade 5 or larger. Flake types include
primary, secondary, and interior with interior flakes (n=10) comprising the majority.
Platforms, where present, are primarily natural (no modification) or plain (cortex
removed with no additional preparation). Heating was noted on three specimens. Two
flakes were heated from natural causes; however, the third flake may have been flaked
after heating in an attempt to form it into a possible biface. This flake is fairly thick and
conforms to Size Grade 5 (Shovel Test 18, Level 6).
The fairly large size of most of the flakes, the presence of both primary and
secondary flakes, and the abundance of natural and plain platforms combined with the
small biface indicate that some initial tool manufacture, in the form of biface reduction,
occurred at this site. Unaltered raw materials, due to their size and irregularity, were
rarely carried far from their source. Rather, some initial early stage reduction or flaking
was performed near the raw material source before being carried to more distant
permanent camps. The alternative to this is if the permanent camp is located near the
material source (quarry). Thus, the presence of large primary flakes and the other
attributes present within the flake assemblage, suggests that the raw material source
was (or is) located in the near vicinity of this site.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
General
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area, and the area has not been previously examined by a
professional archaeologist. Archaeological surveys have been conducted in the area, and
these are discussed above in the Archaeological Background section of this report.
Numerous prehistoric sites have been recorded in the vicinity of the project area.
Site Description
This survey located one prehistoric site (41BZ160) within the footprint of the water
treatment plant. It was identified by the presence of lithic debitage and a small biface
believed to represent an arrow point preform. The presence of this preform dates this site
to the Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory. The artifact return is minimal with only
six of the twenty-two shovel tests in the site area yielding artifacts. No evidence of a
feature was observed. This site is located on a high hill overlooking the Navasota River to
the north and east. All of the artifacts were found in sandy soil on the backside of the hill.
The soils at the top of the hill are shallow and contain clay between 30 and 45 cm below
the surface and sandstone within 30 cm of the ground surface or exposed at the surface.
The size of this site is estimated to be approximately 80 m (east-west) by 90 m (northsouth). On the back slope, artifacts were found between 10 cm and 100 cm in a sandy
mantle that overlies a clay substratum. It is postulated that biface reduction took place at
this site (see Artifact Analysis above). This site is not considered to be eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places because of the paucity of artifacts, and the
artifacts are not worthy of curation. The 22 shovel tests excavated at site 41BZ160 are
depicted in Figure 6, and the location of this site on the topographic map is depicted in
Appendix III.
This survey was conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as
outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
One prehistoric site (41BZ160) was found within the footprint of the proposed
water treatment plant. As stated above, this site is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is,
therefore, recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned by the
Wellborn SUD. Should evidence of permanent occupation be encountered during the
construction phase, all work should cease until the situation can be assessed by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. Evidence of a significant site may
include concentrations of burned rock or large numbers of artifacts and, in extreme
cases, human burials. If the Wellborn SUD decides to change its construction plans to
affect areas not examined during this survey, additional investigation by a professional
archaeologist may be necessary.
