ABSTRACT
Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3), on April 22, 2010, conducted a 100-percent intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey of the proposed Wiener Estate A-1 well site in Panola County,
Texas. Sphere 3 performed this survey for Classic Hydrocarbons, Inc., an oil and gas company based
in Fort Worth, Texas. Classic Hydrocarbons, Inc. contracted with Sphere 3 to conduct a 100%
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed project location to determine if any properties
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State
Archaeological Landmark (SAL) will be affected by proposed construction. Marc A. Tiemann served
as Project Archaeologist and James Belew served as Principal Investigator, supervising all fieldwork.
No archaeological sites were identified during the cultural resource investigations. Therefore, no
further cultural resource investigations are recommended prior to construction.

INTRODUCTION
On April 22, 2010, Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. conducted a 100% intensive pedestrian cultural
resources survey of the proposed Wiener Estate A-1 well site for Classic Hydrocarbons, Inc. The
project area is located approximately 1,000 feet north of the Sabine River at the Toledo Bend
Reservoir in Panola County, Texas. The proposed well pad is square encompassing a 350-foot by 350­
foot area. Maps of the proposed project area and shovel test locations are included in Figures 1 and 2.
Sphere 3 completed the fieldwork in one day with a 4-person crew. The Texas Antiquities Permit No.
5612 was required because the well site is within property owned or leased by the Sabine River
Authority. There was no federal involvement in the project at the time of the survey. These
investigations were conducted in compliance with the procedural rules of the Guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and of the Texas Antiquities Code. The weather was partly
cloudy, cool, and dry permitting ideal conditions for fieldwork throughout the investigations.
PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE PROJECT AREA
A search of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (2010) at http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us was conducted
to assess whether any previously recorded archaeological sites would be impacted by proposed
construction activities. Based on the search, no archaeological sites were found to be recorded within
one mile of the proposed construction activities.

CULTURE HISTORY
Paleo-Indian Period (before 10,000 to 6500 B.C.)
This cultural period designates populations known to inhabit the Americas from the terminal
Pleistocene to the early Holocene. It is represented by peoples known to share a pan-hemispheric
cultural system. Peoples inhabiting East Texas at this time exhibit remarkable similarities in cultural
traits with other groups of this period that appear throughout North and South America.
American anthropologists and prehistorians are in nearly unanimous agreement that the earliest human
populations to enter North America entered by crossing Beringia, the now submerged land bridge
separating Siberia from North America. During this time Sea levels had dropped to about 250 to 350
feet below present levels (Meltzer 1989), creating this broad isthmus by which herds of animals were
followed into the interior of North America. As they progressed southward, human populations
inhabited new lands adapting to new environments.
Controversy regarding the use of the term “Paleoindian” to describe all cultural developments for the
first humans in the New World has been discussed early on in the literature as some scholars find its
use descriptively inadequate (Willey and Phillips 1958:80). In further complicating this matter, recent
discoveries at Monte Verde, Chile, South America (Petit 1998) and the Topper Site, North Carolina
(Goodyear 2000) indicate settlements of peoples earlier than 10,000 with lithic assemblages devoid of
projectile points. These “pre-projectile point” cultures do not appear in the archaeological record for
Texas and it is generally accepted that the “first Americans” to appear in Texas coincide with Clovis
spear point users at 10,000 B.C.

This period of the terminal Pleistocene was significantly cooler and drier than the present climate.
Populations are characterized as consisting of highly mobile bands of large-game hunters. Projectile
points during this period are lanceolates ranging from skillfully fluted (Clovis and Folsom) to unfluted
varieties (Scottsbluff, Plainview, Meserve, and Angostura). These points, representing long, stout
spears and the atlatl that thrusted them, suggests the existence of a subsistence strategy based primarily
on hunting large mammals (Wilmsen 1970).
Archaic Period (6,000 to 200 B.C.)
The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherer cultures, which implemented regionally specialized approaches
toward exploiting the environment (Muller 1986). During this period, the archaeological record is
characterized by the introduction of gouges, manos, and metates that indicate an increased reliance on
vegetal resources. Tool kits also undergo increasing diversification and specialization. The number of
sites increases during the middle and later Archaic phases. Predominant location of sites changes from
major streams to minor streams and natural springs (Perttula and Skiles 1986:48-53). The utilization of
environmentally specific resources made necessary the development of resource-specific tools, such as
stone pipes, mortars, pestles, and mealing stones. The Archaic artifact assemblage contains bone, shell
and copper substances (Neuman 1984). This hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, with
settlement patterns approaching semi-sedentary residency lasted until the development of pottery and
bow and arrow.
The earliest appearances of ceramics and the bow-and-arrow in Texas occurred in the extreme
northeast and in the far west between 500 B.C. and A.D. 1. For northeast Texas, the “Woodland
Stage” is employed to explain Texas’ earliest known ceramic-bearing area, as activities related to the
Tchefuncte culture of Louisiana (ca. 500 BC – AD 1) produced documented manifestations as far west
as the Red River basin of northeast Texas (Gregory and Curry 1978:43; Neuman 1984). By later
Woodland years, arrow points utilized in the long bow have become dominant in this area over the larger
dart points utilized throughout the Archaic in the atlatl (Perttula and Skiles 1986: 53-54; Story 1990:
249). The Woodland concludes with the widespread use of bow and arrow and a broad variety of
ceramics (Story et al. 1990).
Early Ceramic (Woodland) Period (c. 500 BC – AD 1200)
The Early Ceramic period is primarily characterized by an increased utilization of the environment. By
the end of the earliest Woodland phase, the people of the East Texas have increased their reliance on
cultigens (corn and squash) and are remaining longer at specific locales. Gradual shifts toward more
permanent settlements had been occurring since about 2000 BC. Long distance exchange networks were
probably in full operation, as copper, marine shell, and other raw materials were imported from
thousands of kilometers distant (Sabo and Early 1988:73). During the early Woodland phase,
populations residing throughout East Texas were within the sphere of influence of complex cultural
groups in Louisiana. The Poverty Point was still a powerful cultural force to the east, no doubt
interacting and influencing groups in East Texas. These changes evolved out of ancestral Archaic
traditions.
By middle Woodland times, pottery—specifically, sand tempered ware—had become common
throughout East Texas and northwest Louisiana. Horticulture became more indispensable to overall
food procurement with widespread production and storage of domesticated maize, squash, and gourds
(Newman 1984). By later Woodland years, arrow points utilized in the long bow have become
dominant over the larger dart points utilized throughout the Archaic in the atlatl (Perttula and Skiles
1986: 53-54; Story 1990: 249). The Woodland concludes with the widespread use of bow and arrow and
a broad variety of ceramics (Story et al. 1990).

Late Prehistoric Period (c. A.D. 800 -1680)
As distinctive cultural sequences are developing in Louisiana (i.e. Tchefuncte, Marksville, TroyvilleColes Creek, Poverty Point, Plaquemine, and Mississippian), the indigenous development of the
Caddoan culture emerges which is strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the Lower
Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).
The Caddoan culture proliferates in East Texas. The Caddoan culture exhibited continuity along the
traits of house site construction and subsistence practices. Houses were circular, as demonstrated by
excavated post mold patterns from the Hanna Site (16RR4) and the Werner Mound site (16BO8)
(Thomas et al. 1980:111, Webb 1983:219-221). Floral and faunal remains recovered from Caddoan
sites are maize, squash, gourd, hickory nut, acorns, deer and a variety of other mammalian and aquatic
fauna. This represents a particularly wide variety of subsistence foods being exploited (Jeter and
Williams, Jr. 1989:202). Caddo subsistence and social organization differ markedly from the previous
periods. Horticulture and then agriculture supplemented hunting and gathering. Larger aggregates of
people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas in the early years but
an absence of ceremonial mounds in later years of the Caddo cultural sequence (Miller et al 2000).
Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds. Extensive commercial networks
also were established. Service (1962, 1975) was first to define a stratified social structure
corresponding to the chiefdom level.
Historic Period
The historic period describes briefly the transition in the area from domination by native peoples to
European settlement and the subsequent establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The land was
initially inhabited by the confederacies of the Caddos and the Hasinais during this period. These two
groups of allied confederations were known as the Timber Tribes (Lagrone 1979). They resided in
farming villages, raising grain and vegetables and hunting for small game in the forests. They also
constructed burial mounds.
During the European colonization of the New World, Spain and France both claimed the area which
would later become Panola County. The former established a line of protected missions not far south
of Panola County. The explorations of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle formed the basis to
France’s claim. The area was also the subject of a series of disputes between the United States and
Spain and Mexico.
Several white settlements in the area transpired after treaties between Mexico and the United States
were signed as a result of the Mexican War of Independence which made available the lands along the
Sabine River. These settlements followed the old Spanish mission and Indian trails known as Old San
Antonio Road and Trammel Trace. Several families, among them the Martins, Reeds, and the
LaGrones settled the area so that by 1840, at least forty-nine families were established in the area that
became Panola County, the majority arriving from Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Alabama (Lagrone 1979). By 1848, the town of Carthage was established as the county seat.
By 1900 Panola County had 3,413 farms and a population of 21,404 (LaGrone 1979). Cotton, logging,
and poultry industries were flourishing. It was not until the Great Depression that trends in prosperity
were reversed. The county experienced significant declines as low prices, federal crop restrictions, and
other associated problems caused farmers to abandon the county (LaGrone 1979). However, the
county experienced a renewed growth during the 1940s as the oil industry tapped into a very large
underground reservoir covering nearly half the county when the Jordan well was drilled a mile west of
Carthage (LaGrone 1979).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area lies within the Austroriparian biotic province, one of seven recognized by Blair
(1950) and Dice (1943) for the state of Texas based on ecological associations of a relatively stable
assemblage of plants and animals. This ecotone describes a region comprised of hardwoods and pines
extending eastward to the Atlantic, the dominant species being loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). The
environmental setting for the project area consists of low-lying alluvial terraces and floodplain
wetlands. Vegetation consists of a mix of hardwoods.
The Soil Survey of Panola County, Texas (1975) maps the soils for the well site as Urbo-Mantachie
association (UMX). Urbo series soils are formed in bottomlands of recent alluvial sediment. These
soils are slowly permeable and somewhat poorly drained. Mantachie series soils are formed in
bottomlands along creeks and the Sabine River. They are moderately permeable and somewhat poorly
drained. Profiles for excavated shovel tests are consistent with the mapped soils of the survey manual
(Figure 3).
FIELD METHODOLOGY
Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. conducted a 100 % intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of the
project area relying on visual examination and shovel testing. Shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm
levels to the clay substrate or to the maximum depth that could be reached manually using a posthole
digger. Shovel tests were excavated at 30 meter grid intervals. The excavated matrix was then
screened through ¼-inch wire hardware cloth. If any cultural materials were recovered from a shovel
test, then additional site delineation shovel tests were excavated at grid intervals of 10 meters aligned
with the x and y axis of the well pad orientation. Two consecutive shovel tests with negative recovery
were used to define site boundaries.
FINDINGS
A total of 9 shovel tests was excavated within the boundaries of the proposed well pad. All excavated
shovel tests contained no cultural materials. Shovel tests ranged from 12 to 19 cm below the ground
surface. The primary soil matrix of each shovel test was either silty clay or clay. Appendix A contains
a shovel test log for this survey.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on topography and proximity to riparian resources, the potential for finding cultural resources
within the well site was determined to be moderate. Visual examination and shovel testing, however,
did not identify any archaeological sites. No further cultural resources work is recommended for the
proposed Wiener Estate A-1 well site.
