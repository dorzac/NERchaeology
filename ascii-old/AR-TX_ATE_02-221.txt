Abstract

AbstrAct
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological resource survey on
behalf of New Braunfels Utilities (NBU) and their engineering contractor Freese and
Nichols, Inc. (FNI) in advance of the Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project
in Comal County, Texas. NBU is proposing building one new pump station (half-acre),
expanding capacity at an already existing pump station (half-acre), and installing new
and upgrading existing waterlines between the two of them (approximately 3.5 miles)
along the south side of State Highway (SH) 46. Because NBU is a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, it is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), requiring survey for
archeological resources within the project footprint. All work was carried out to conform to
13 TAC 26, which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT.
Fieldwork was conducted on October 18–19th, 2017 by AmaTerra under Antiquities Permit
8195. Fieldwork included a pedestrian survey with 100 percent surface inspection of the
proposed construction easements supplemented with shovel testing at 100-meter intervals.
Additional tests were placed in the proposed new pump station while the pump station
expansion was visually inspected only. The surface was found to be vegetated with grasses
and understory foliage with mesquite shrub, cedar and Live Oak trees in the more densely
vegetated areas. Ground visibility ranged from 50 to 100 percent across the project area. A
single prehistoric site, 41CM411, was newly recorded as part of the survey and consisted of a
small, diffuse surficial lithic scatter. Two previously recorded sites (41CM47 and 41CM298)
were revisited as part of the investigation as well. Site 41CM47 is a mid- to late nineteenth
century historic structural complex known colloquially as the “Walzem Chapel” and 41CM298
consists of several surficial lithic scatters and a quarry site. AmaTerra recommends that no
further work is necessary within the project footprint prior to construction, and the portions
of the three sites within the proposed construction easements are recommended ineligible for
listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). All notes and forms generated while conducting
fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin,
Texas.

Introduction and Management Summary
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) archeologists conducted an archeological resource
survey on behalf of New Braunfels Utilities (NBU) and their engineering contractor Freese
and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) for the proposed Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project,
which includes two half-acre water pump stations and 3.2 miles of associated water pipeline
through property and easements controlled by NBU in Comal County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2;
Appendix A). The Comal County Pump Station is a proposed new facility to be located
south of Range Road and will consist of an above ground storage tank and pump station. The
second facility is the Highway 46 Pump Station, located west of Mission Valley Road and the
intersection of State Highway (SH) 46. This station has already been constructed, but as part of
the Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project, will be expanded. Construction at the
facility will be limited to the previously disturbed pump station property. Additionally, a total
of approximately 18,300 linear feet (approximately 5,577 meters [m]) of new 16- to 24-inch
water pipelines will be newly installed and/or upgraded along SH 46 as well as surrounding
neighborhoods that branch from the highway. Portions of these new lines will be installed
within existing NBU owned utility easements, adjacent to existing water lines, while others
will be installed within new easements on otherwise private property to be secured specifically
for this project. Approximately 14,100 linear feet (approximately 4,300 m) will be installed
within open terrain whereas 4,200 linear feet (approximately 1,300 m) will be installed under
existing roads. The project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because the
construction will occur on property and easements controlled by NBU, a political subdivision
of the State of Texas. All work was carried out to conform 13 TAC 26 which outlines the
regulations for implementing ACT and was surveyed under Antiquities Permit 8195. With
no federal involvement anticipated, this project is not subject to cultural resource regulatory
oversight outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
The project’s footprint consists of 20-foot-wide waterline easements and the two half-acre
pump stations. The pipeline will be installed primarily through open-cut trenching with
occasional borings. AmaTerra archeologists James J. Hill (Principal Investigator) and Amy
Goldstein (Project Archeologist) expended twenty-six person-hours onsite during fieldwork
from October 18–19, 2017.
Because the survey was of short duration, this document is laid out in short report format as
defined under the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resource
Reports (2017). Chapter Two will present the methodology used during fieldwork, Chapter Three
will summarize field observations and results, and Chapter Four will provide recommendations
for the projects ACT compliance obligations.
Of note: Shortly after field survey was completed, project engineers considered alternative
routes for some portions of the waterlines. At the same time, construction at the proposed
Comal County Pump Station could not be delayed pending reroute investigation and regulatory

review. AmaTerra submitted an interim coordination letter on the proposed pump station (Hill
to Durst, 11/10/2017). On November 28, 2017, the THC concurred with recommendations
that the pump station construction could proceed with no significant archeological resources
affected. Copies of this correspondence are included as Appendix C.

Methodology
Archeological fieldwork along the waterline areas conformed to a modified 100 percent intensive
linear survey standard set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In unpaved
areas, this included visual inspection of the entire project area along with manual shovel test
excavation at 100-m (328 feet) intervals within the proposed six-meter wide (approximately
20-foot) easement. The waterline corridors proposed to be installed beneath existing roads
were briefly visually assessed, but not subjected to shovel testing. In total, approximately
2.5 miles of proposed waterline easement were surveyed for archeological resources. The
remaining mile of proposed construction easements were visually assessed from the existing
SH-46 right-of-way (ROW) as they were proposed either under existing roads or were in one
of the three parcels where right-of-entry (ROE) was not available at the time of the survey. The
proposed Comal County Pump Station was visually inspected and subject to three subsurface
shovel tests (in accordance with CTA standards for area survey of projects of one acre or less).
The proposed expansion at the existing Highway 46 Pump Station was visually inspected and
deemed too disturbed to warrant subsurface testing.
The survey area was loaded onto handheld GPS units to aid in navigation within the projects
proposed footprint. Areas of disturbance were photographed, and notes were made on
the conditions archeologists encountered during their investigations. The entire proposed
construction easement and pump stations were flagged prior to AmaTerra’s archeological
survey. This enabled archeologists to clearly discern the proposed project area.
Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and, due to shallow bedrock, extended
to a maximum depth of 50 cm below surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in
10-cm increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests
were backfilled upon completion. Relevant information for all shovel tests was be recorded on
a standardized form and shovel test locations were marked with handheld GPS units.
Although portions of the project area had been previously surveyed by Hicks & Company in
2006, AmaTerra surveyed the entire project area (Miller et al. 2006). A total of 50 shovel tests
were excavated within the proposed 20-foot wide waterline easements and associated halfacre pump stations, exceeding the recommended 46 shovel tests recommended under CTA
guidelines.
One newly recorded site was identified during the survey (41CM411), and two previously
recorded sites (41CM47 and 41CM298) were re-visited. For the purposes of this investigation,
an archeological site was defined as containing: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m
radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on
the surface or exposed during shovel testing, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least
three total artifacts, or (4) two positive tests located within 20 m of each other. Shovel tests
were excavated in each site recorded or revisited as part of the survey to explore the depth and
extent of deposits.

Survey Results
Environmental Setting
The surface of the proposed project area was found to be heavily impacted in several areas by
previous land-clearing, agricultural practices, road construction, and previous utility installation
(Figures 3 and 4). The undisturbed portions of the project (roughly 80 percent) consisted
of sections of open agricultural pasture and scattered wooded areas sparsely vegetated with
grasses and patches of mesquite, with dispersed cedar and Live Oak trees (Figures 5 and 6).
Soils were typically loamy and ranged from a 10YR 3/4 to a 10YR 5/4 with shallow limestone
bedrock eroding at or near the surface across the project area (Figure 7).

Shovel Testing
A total of 50 shovel tests were excavated as part of the field efforts (Appendix B). Along
the 2.5-mile segment of proposed waterline easement surveyed by AmaTerra, archeologists
excavated 47 shovel tests. Sixteen were excavated during the delineation of newly recorded
and re-visited sites while the remaining 31 served as a discovery tactic. 3 additional tests were
placed at the proposed location of the Comal County Pump Station. No shovel tests were
excavated within the Highway 46 pump station as it was shown to be heavily disturbed. A
typical shovel test measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended no
deeper than 50 cm below surface (cmbs). Variability within shovel tests did exist depending
largely on localized field conditions including areas of disturbance, soil types, bedrock, etc.
The average shovel test was excavated to a depth of 15 cmbs as shallow bedrock was observed
across much of the project area. The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and
all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel
tests was recorded on a standardized form and will be curated at TARL along with all other
documentation associated with the project after the final report is submitted to NBU.

Site Summary
Field efforts identified a newly recorded archeological site (41CM411) and two previously
recorded archeological sites (41CM47 and 41CM298). The definition of a site was based on:
(1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such as
a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, or
(3) a positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two positive tests located
within an individual structures footprint. Historical sites documented were subject to archival
research. This research included an attempt to determine history of ownership and land use
through deed research, and map research, wherever possible.

In general, sites identified within the project area had a minimum of six subsurface tests
excavated to define site boundaries relative to the study area (Figure 8). Specific site information
was recorded on standardized forms and has been submitted to TARL for inclusion in their
archives and to obtain new site trinomials. All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to
their original locations as no artifacts were collected. A discussion of each site is found below.

Newly Recorded Sites
41CM411
Site 41CM411 is a small, surficial prehistoric lithic scatter consisting of approximately 20
pieces of lithic debitage and a single, crude biface fragment spread over a 75 x 40-m area
(Figure 9). It is located on a low rise within an open agricultural field that is bisected by a
two-track access road approximately 400 m (0.25-miles) northwest of SH 46 and the Heuco
Springs Loop Road intersection just outside of the City of New Braunfels. The site is spread
across the surface of an exposed agricultural field where ground surface visibility is 80–100
percent (Figure 10).
Six shovel tests were excavated within the surface scatter, all were negative (Figure 11).
According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2017), soils within the site area are affiliated
with the Medlin-Eckrant silty loam association with 1–8 percent slopes. Shovel tests placed

within the site area encountered light
brown (10YR 4/4) loamy soil that overlays
limestone bedrock at depths that range from
5 to 10 cmbs. Vegetation consisted primarily
of cedar trees located on the periphery of
the site intermixed with Live Oak, grasses
and shrubs.
Cultural materials found on the surface
were in a secondary context, as was
confirmed by lithic debitage observed
eroding slightly downslope on southside of
the survey corridor. Archeologists did not
observe any features, diagnostic artifacts or
otherwise dateable material. The prehistoric
assemblage observed within the proposed

waterline easement is unexceptional to
the region and contains little potential
additional data. The site has been heavily impacted by modern ranching and presumed tree
clearing as well as slope wash. This likely has contributed to the displacement of artifacts
across the site. Shovel testing revealed no buried material and shallow soils (10 cmbs). As
such, the site retains limited research potential due to a lack of integrity, depth of deposits,
diagnostic material and features beyond the data that has been gathered during survey. No
additional work is suggested and 41CM411 is not recommended eligible for listing as a SAL.

Previously Recorded Sites
41CM47
Site 41CM47, also known colloquially as the Walzem Chapel, is a mid-nineteenth century
Catholic chapel (circa 1850s–1870s) with an associated dry stacked stone wall, a small corner
of which the proposed waterline easement overlaps (Figure 12 and 13). Walzem Chapel was
initially recorded in 1966 by Daniel E. Fox (Texas Historical Commission 2017a). Limited
information was available on the Atlas, as the chapel itself was incorrectly plotted and well
outside the current proposed project area. The site is located just south of the intersection of
Soledad Lane and La Bahia Loop. Much of the site resides in a manicured park in a corner lot
within the Mission Valley housing development. A Historical Marker placed at the entrance
to the park in February of 2015 gives a brief history of the chapel itself as well as its builder
Johann Joseph Walzen and his wife Anna Gertruda Walzem (Texas Historical Commission
2017b). The marker reads:
“Located in the Mission Valley Settlement, Walzem Chapel was built to serve Catholics
in this once remote area. In the mid-1800s, German immigrants came to Texas under
the auspices of the Adelsverein in search of freedom and economic opportunity. Johann
Joseph and Anna Gertruda Walzem settled in the Mission Valley Settlement in the
1850s and built a home. Mr. Walzem was a stone mason and has been credited with
building several houses in the Mission Valley Settlement. Walzem and his family were
important members of the community in the early days of New Braunfels development.
“Johann and his sons built the chapel (Also known as St. John Chapel) located on
an acre plot in the north end of their original 160-acre tract. Legend has it that after
working for several years, Mr. Walzem visited his homeland and upon returning to
Texas, built the chapel in thanksgiving for a safe trip. The chapel is mistakenly referred
to as “Walzem Mission” due to its location in the community. A stone at the top of the
entrance to the chapel is marked “1870,” indicating the completion date. The walls
were made of limestone locally quarried and cut by Johann and his sons with mortar
from a local kiln, demonstrating pioneer’s ability to survive in the wilderness.
“Johann gave the land and the chapel to the Right Reverend Bishop C.M. DuBois
of the Catholic Church in 1871 and it eventually was purchased by a developer. The
homeowners of the subdivision now care for the chapel and property. While the stone
walls of the chapel are all that remain, a reminder of the challenges and isolation of
the frontier still linger.”

Deed research revealed the park (including the chapel) is privately owned by the Mission
Valley Homeowners Association after the contractor for the development deeded the property
to the association shortly after the completion of the development. Before that, the property
was primarily owned by the Catholic Church with the Archbishop of San Antonio, I. P. F.
Flores, conveying the land from the Church to private owners (presumably the developer) in
early 1989 (Comal County Historical Commission 2017). The chapel itself is enclosed by a
modern iron fence surrounded by flower beds and other decorative vegetation (Figure 14).

Figure 13. The Walzem Chapel (41CM47), view from the southeast.

Several sections of dry stacked stone wall were identified and recorded during the 41CM47
site revisit (Figure 15). A small, mostly fallen section of wall was present within the proposed
waterline easement (Figure 16). Multiple sections of piled stone were noted across the site
however, it is unclear if they represent other sections of dilapidated stone wall. As the stone
wall is largely in disrepair across the site, the exact extent is unknown as the site boundary
extends well outside the proposed current project footprint. The exact dimensions of the wall
are unknown as the portion within the project area has completely collapsed, however visual
inspection of a section of wall outside of the project area showed it to be much more intact
elsewhere. In this section, the wall was approximately 2.5 feet tall and one foot wide (see
Figure 15). Two shovel tests were excavated within a small section of the proposed easement as
it crosses from a tie-in with existing lines through the site boundary, in this instance limited to
the northern corner. Two additional shovel tests were excavated just outside of it. All four were
negative and shallow with underlying limestone bedrock encountered at 10 cmbs. Outside of
the chapel and associated stone walls, no other artifacts, features, or associated buildings were
observed during the investigation within the current project area.
What remains today of the chapel and walls are in relatively good condition. The chapel itself
is still standing and portions of the stone wall that surround the property are also intact. Future
research value exists as it is unknown how much of the site has been tested or examined outside
of the standing chapel (previously recorded in 1966) or the stone walls (recorded as part of
the AmaTerra survey). Upon submittal of an electronic site update form to TARL, AmaTerra
archeologists were informed that an old farmhouse and cemetery were also noted during the
original recording of the site, albeit more than “300 yards away” (Jean Hughes, personal
communication, 2017). According to the original Walzem Deed, these are located roughly that

distance to the south of the Chapel (Comal County Historical Commission 2017: Attachment
C). This is well outside the confines of the current site boundary and proposed project location.
The THC’s website includes a draft National Register of Historic Places District nomination
form for the “Walzem Homestead” dated to May of 2017. The form includes the Walzem
residence and associated outbuildings and other features. The Chapel is not included as a
contributing component to this district (Kupferschmid 2017).
A 1921 topographic map clearly depicts the Walzem Chapel just to the west of a two-track
road (Figure 17). Helical lines on the map presumably depict stone walls/fences that were
at least visible to the cartographer at the time, none of which presumably correspond to the
walls/fences identified during the current survey. A 1958 aerial photograph retained enough
resolution to view the site vicinity in some detail (Figure 18). In the photograph, the chapel
lacks a roof and no other structural features are visible, particularly in the project vicinity. If
the stone walls were present at the time, they are not clearly visible and therefore suggest that
they may post-date the chapel.
With no structural remnants observed on the surface, within shovel tests, or on historic maps
and aerial photographs, and with tests revealing extremely shallow soils directly overlaying
bedrock, it is highly unlikely that the purported cemetery or any other associated features are
located within the currently-proposed project footprint (if they are extant at all). The chapel
and any other intact features should be avoided if any future construction is proposed in the
area. If future construction should take place near 41CM47, investigators should be aware of
the possibility of a cemetery located somewhere within Walzem’s original property.

Chapter 3

Although the stone wall feature bisects a small section of the proposed waterline easement, the
section of wall in question is already heavily damaged and reduced to near-rubble. It should
not impede the proposed construction as further damage would be negligible. Though this site
has numerous features and possibly a cemetery, surface inspection and subsurface tests within
the proposed project corridor confirm that the only construction related impacts will be for a
small section of dry-laid stone wall. Stone walls of this nature are not uncommon to the region
and beyond their direct association with the Walzem Chapel, they are unremarkable. The
wall within the proposed easement is not intact and other sections remain better-preserved on
the site. Maps and aerial photographs from the early- to mid-twentieth century furthermore
suggest that they may post-date the chapel. Construction is therefore unlikely to impact SALeligible components to 41CM47. No additional work is recommended at this time. However,
the site, upon detailed testing at a future date yet to be determined, may be eligible as a SAL,
but not within the current project footprint as the small section of the site located within the
proposed construction easement is in ruin.

41CM298
Briefly revisited as part of the survey, 41CM298 was recorded by Hicks & Company archeologists
in 2006 as part of the SH 46 highway expansion project (Texas Historical Commission 2017a).
The site was defined as a series of several diffuse, light, lithic scatters and a quarry site (Miller
et al. 2006). The site was plotted previously in the southeastern terminus of the project area,
located along a low, northwardly descending hillslope.
Although four pieces of lithic debitage were noted along the extreme south edge of the site
boundary, they were recorded in a secondary context. Construction efforts related to the expansion
of SH 46 has caused the destruction of much of the site. Six shovel tests were excavated along
the previously recorded southern boundary of 41CM298, but were all negative as the area was
confirmed to be heavily disturbed (Figure 19). Limestone bedrock was observed within 5–10
cm below surface within the shovel tests and no features or otherwise datable or diagnostic
material was observed. The site retains limited research potential due to a lack of integrity,
depth of deposits, diagnostic material and features beyond the data that has been previously
collected. No additional work within the proposed easement is recommended. Due to the lack
of artifacts observed during survey nearby and the extent of disturbance, construction within
the SH 46 Pump Station is also unlikely to impact significant site components and no further
work is warranted.

Summary and Recommendations
On October 18–19, 2017, AmaTerra archeologists carried out a 100-percent surface inspection
supplemented with shovel testing at 100-m intervals for NBU’s proposed Highway 46 West
Water System Expansion Project in Comal County, Texas. Additional tests were placed at
one of two separate pump station locations. Disturbances were noted in portions of the APE,
although most of the project area was clear of visible impacts. Access was available to the
entire proposed project area apart from three parcels where ROE was not granted at the time
of the survey. However, cultural resource occurrence is suspected to be minimal in these areas
as they were visually assessed from the ROW at the time of the survey. Other than the limited
ROE restrictions, archeologists did not encounter any other conditions that inhibited the survey.
AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8195 and
work conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC 26
which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT.
Fifty shovel tests were excavated as part of the investigations along the proposed waterline
easements and pump station locations. A single newly-recorded archeological site (41CM411)
was recorded and two previously recorded sites (41CM47 and 41CM298) were revisited during
fieldwork. Site 41CM411 is a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter with extremely shallow soils and
negligible potential to contain intact buried deposits. It is characterized by a lack of features
and a lack of dateable material, and by the presumed horizontal displacement of artifacts across
the surface caused by sheet wash. The previously recorded 41CM298 lithic scatter and quarry
site was absent within the project corridor aside from four secondarily deposited artifacts at
the edge of the site. Accordingly, the project will not impact it. The previously-recorded midnineteenth century historic Walzem Chapel (41CM47) site was found to have been incorrectly
plotted on the Atlas (Texas Historical Commission 2017a) and relocated closer to the proposed
waterline easements during the survey. Although a historic limestone wall feature was
noted within the proposed construction easement, that wall section is heavily damaged and
construction impacts to the site are suspected to be minimal. No further work is recommended
within the portion of 41CM47 located within the proposed project footprint.
The Principal Investigator recommends no further work is necessary within the current project
area prior to construction and the portions of the three sites within the proposed construction
easements are recommended ineligible for listing as SALs. No artifacts were collected during
this survey. All records generated during fieldwork will be permanently curated at the TARL.

Re: Interim Coordination for Proposed Pump Station Location at part of New Braunfels Utilities’ Highway
46 West Water System Expansion Project, New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas (Antiquities Permit 8195).
Request for interim concurrence with a recommendation for clearance to proceed of surveyed and site-free
proposed Comal County Pump Station prior to late December construction.
Dear Mr. Durst,
On behalf of New Braunfels Utilities (NBU) and their engineering contractor Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI),
AmaTerra Environmental Inc. (AmaTerra) has prepared this letter as interim Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT)
coordination for the Comal County Pump, a component of NBU’s proposed Highway 46 West Water System
Expansion project. The pump station is located approximately 3.5-miles northwest of the city of New
Braunfels and is part of the larger Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project. Overall, the proposed
Project includes, one new half-acre pump station (Comal County Pump Station), expanding capacity at an
already existing half-acre pump station (Highway 46 Pump Station), and installing new and upgrading
existing waterlines between the two of them (approximately 3.2 miles total) along the south side of State
Highway (SH) 46 and downstream of the proposed Comal County Pump Station. While all of the proposed
project components to date have been subject to 100% intensive survey and will be formally presented in a
summary report in the near future, this interim letter relates specifically to the Comal County Pump Station.
Construction at the Comal County Pump Station has a firm start date of late December but design engineers
have recently identified a potential alternative route for the project’s proposed water pipeline component that
must be evaluated. This letter is presented with the intent of maintaining the construction schedule for the
Comal County Pump Station while allowing more time to verify if an alternative pipeline corridor is viable
(and survey it as necessary). The initial archaeological survey of the project area has been completed and field
data indicates there will be no impact on archeological resources at the proposed Comal County Pump Station.
The project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because the construction will occur on property
and easements controlled by NBU, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. All work was carried out to
conform to 13 TAC 26 which outlines the regulations for implementing ACT and was surveyed under
Antiquities Permit 8195. With no federal involvement anticipated, this project is not subject to cultural
resource regulatory oversight outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
Summary of Findings
AmaTerra archeological staff completed the initial archeological resources survey on October 17-18, 2017
for the proposed Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project (Figure 1). The Comal County Pump
Station is located south of Range Road and will consist of an aboveground storage tank and pump station
(Appendix A). The proposed pump station was visually inspected and subject to three subsurface shovel tests
(in accordance with CTA standards for area survey of projects of one acre or less) (Table 1; Figures 2 and

Interim Coordination for Highway 46 West Water System Expansion Project, Comal County, Texas

3). Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and, due to shallow bedrock, extended to a
maximum depth of 50 cm below surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and
all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Relevant
information for all shovel tests was be recorded on a standardized form and shovel test locations were marked
with handheld GPS units.
The surface of the proposed pump station location was found to be heavily impacted by previous land-clearing
and grading with exposed bedrock in the property corners dictating that all subsurface tests were limited to
the site’s center. Soils were all loamy, relatively shallow and disturbed as evidence by heavily eroded and
mottled soils. No archeological sites were recorded during the survey and no artifacts were collected. As such,
due to a lack of any identified archeological materials and an overall poor preservation potential as a result of
previous construction related disturbances, no additional work is recommended.

Regulatory Recommendations

The Principal Investigator (PI) has determined there is minimal potential for construction to impact intact
archeological resources on the basis of previously disturbed soils and a lack of archeological materials on the
ground surface within subsurface tests. AmaTerra requests your concurrence with the PI’s recommendation
that construction may proceed at the Comal County Pump Station in accordance with ACT regulations with
no archeological resources impacted. A full report of all fieldwork and findings for the Highway 46 West
Water System Expansion Project as a whole will be presented in the near future upon completion of field
investigations.
