MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 23 July 2019, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the portions of Wink to Webster LLC’s (W2W) proposed Winkler to
Midland pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that are located on public land in central Winkler County
and northern Midland County, Texas (Project Area). Approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers
[km]) of the proposed ROW cross land owned by the City of Midland (City) in Winkler and
Midland counties. Because the City is a political subdivision of the state, the portions of the
proposed ROW on City property fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of W2W in compliance with the ACT. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project
Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs). The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
(TAC) permit number 9002.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.7 miles (148.0 kilometers [km]) long by
50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide (approximately 555.8 acres). However, the 2 segments of the
proposed ROW across City property total approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long by 50.0 feet
(15.2 m) wide (approximately 4.8 acres).
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
16 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Winkler to Midland pipeline ROW across property owned by the City will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that W2W be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.
Any artifacts recovered during the investigations and all records produced during the
investigations are to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and 13 TAC Section 26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
portions of Wink to Webster LLC’s (W2W) proposed Winkler to Midland pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) that are located on public land in northern Midland County, Texas (Project Area; Figures
1-1 through 1-5). Approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers [km]) of the proposed ROW cross
land owned by the City of Midland (City) in Winkler and Midland counties. Because the City is a
political subdivision of the state, the portions of the proposed ROW on City property fall under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area on behalf of W2W in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if
any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.7 miles (148.0 kilometers [km]) long by
50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide (approximately 555.8 acres). However, the 2 segments of the
proposed ROW across City property total approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long by 50.0 feet
(15.2 m) wide (approximately 4.8 acres).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s president) served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Steven
Schooler (archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations. The cultural
resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit
number 9002.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 23 July 2019. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area
totals 0.8 miles (1.3 km) in length, a minimum of 13 shovel tests were necessary within the

Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 16 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings on
the assessed publicly owned parcels. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 16 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Winkler to Midland pipeline ROW across property owned by the City will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that W2W be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The westernmost segment of the proposed ROW located on City property is located
approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) east of Kermit in Winkler County, Texas. This segment
measures approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) in length. It can be found on the US Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Kermit, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The easternmost
segment of the proposed ROW on City property is located on the east side of Midland, in
Midland County, Texas. This segment measures approximately 0.3 miles (0.5 km) in length. It
can be found on the USGS 7.5-minute Northeast Midland, Texas, topographic quadrangle map.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.7 miles (148.0 km) long by 50.0 feet (15.2 m)
wide (approximately 555.8 acres). However, the 2 segments of the proposed ROW across City
property measure approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long by 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide
(approximately 4.8 acres). Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural
resources survey are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The western segment of the Project Area in Winkler County is located within an area of
shifting sand dunes that are dotted with playa basins (see Figures 1-2 and 1-4). Elevations
along this segment of the Project Area are generally level, ranging between 2890.0 and 2895.0
feet (880.9 and 882.4 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, this segment is situated within
the Lower Pecos River Basin. There are no obvious water channels in the vicinity of this
segment, although several surrounding playa basins serve to drain the area.
The eastern segment of the Project Area in Midland County is located within an
undeveloped parcel of rangeland on the east side of Midland. Elevations within this segment of
the Project Area are also generally level, ranging between 2,740.0 and 2,745.0 feet (835.2 and
836.7 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, this segment of the Project Area is situated
within the Upper Colorado River Basin. It drains to the south into Midland Draw.

CLIMATE

The climate of Winkler and Midland counties is semiarid. Winters are mild, with an
average temperature of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an
average daily maximum temperature of 94.5°F. The average annual total precipitation is
between 12.0 and 14.0 inches (30.5 and 35.6 centimeters [cm]), with the majority of it falling
between April and October (NRCS 1973 and 1999).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated within Blair’s Kansan biotic province that takes in the
Panhandle and the red plains to the east of the escarpment of the high plains. The plants and
animals are mostly grassland species, but some Austroriparian species extend along wooded
stream valleys into the eastern part of the province (Blair 1950).
The western segment of the Project Area in Winkler County is located within the
Shinnery Sands ecoregion of the High Plains, while the eastern segment of the Project Area in
Midland County is located along the southern edge of the Llano Estacado ecoregion of the High
Plains (Griffith et al. 2007). The Shinnery Sands ecoregion includes sand dunes and flat sandy
recharge areas dotted with playa basins. It gets its name from the Harvard (shin) oak that
stabilizes the dune areas with its extensive root system. In addition to the shin oak, sagebrush,
bluestem, and yucca are common plants in this community. The shinnery sands provide habitat
for the lesser prairie chicken, mule deer, bobcat, coyotes, and peccaries (Griffith et al. 2007).

The Llano Estacado ecoregion was historically a shortgrass prairie supporting large
herds of buffalo. Common plants species on these prairies included buffalograss, blue and
sideoats grama, silver bluestem, mesquite, yucca, prickly pear, and juniper (Griffith et al. 2007).
In addition to supporting vast bison herds, this ecosystem also included prairie dogs, blackfooted ferrets, burrowing owls, coyotes, pronghorn antelope, gray wolves, and a variety of deer.
Playa basins scattered across this region also attracted migratory waterfowl as the sandhill
crane (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.),
and Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, also were likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are hypothesized to have been low and probably
consisted of small family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the
period may suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band
aggregation for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in
upland tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and
Folsom points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the
later span of the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locations and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence
strategies in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

climates. Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy,
Hardin, and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow as
well as ceramics in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continued to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the segment of the Project Area in Winkler
County, while a review of the Atlas database indicated the presence of 2 previously recorded
archeological sites within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the segment of the Project Area in
Midland County (THC 2019). A review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic
properties listed on the NRHP within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of either of the 2 segments of
the Project Area (NPS 2019). The previously recorded archeological sites and their distances
from the Midland County segment of the Project Area are summarized in Table 4-1 below, while
their locations relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1. No documented cultural
resources, including any listed on the NRHP or designated as SALs, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no prior cultural
resources surveys have been undertaken anywhere within the limits the current Project Area.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
segment of the Project Area in Winkler County within an area of shifting sands dotted with playa
basins, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed at least a moderate
potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within this segment of the Project Area.
The segment of the Project Area in Midland County is located between Midland Draw and a
large playa basin. This also suggested at least a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within this segment of the Project Area.
Regarding historic-era resources, the absence of visible structures in immediate
proximity to the segment of the Project Area in Winkler County on the relevant topographic
quadrangle maps and aerial imagery suggested a decreased potential for historic-era standing
structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of this segment of the Project
Area. For the segment of the Project Area in Midland County, a small corral complex is visible
to the west of this segment of the Project Area in historic aerial imagery dating to 1963 and
topographic quadrangles dating to 1968. While no portion of this corral complex is within the
limits of the Project Area, its proximity suggested at least a moderate potential for associated
historic-era cultural debris within this segment of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive survey of the Project Area on 23 July
2019. This entailed surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area.
The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area totals 0.8 miles (1.3 km) in length, a minimum of
13 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests within the Project Area.
All shovel tests measured approximately 12.0 inches (30.5 centimeters [cm]) in diameter and
were excavated in arbitrary 3.9-inch (10.0-cm) levels. All excavated shovel test matrices were
screened through 0.3-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the
dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests, and
cultural material observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. Shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A.
Any artifacts recovered during the investigations and all records produced during the
investigations are to be curated at the TARL in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and 13 TAC Section 26.17.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 23 July 2019, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
portions of W2W’s proposed Winkler to Midland pipeline ROW that are located on public land in
central Winkler County and northern Midland County, Texas. Approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km)
of the proposed ROW cross land owned by the City of Midland in Winkler and Midland counties.
Because the City is a political subdivision of the state, the portions of the proposed ROW on
City property fall under the regulations of the ACT. At the request of Whitenton, Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of W2W in compliance
with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The
cultural resources survey was conducted under TAC permit number 9002.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 23 July 2019. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The
TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area totals 0.8 miles (1.3 km) in length, a minimum of
13 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 16
excavated shovel tests.
The shovel tests within the Winkler County portion of the Project Area consisted of loose
desert sands measuring at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) deep, while the shovel tests excavated within
the Midland County portion of the Project Area consisted of shallow and dense sandy silts over
caliche reached at depths around 1.6 feet (0.5 m) below surface (Figures 6-1 and 6-2; also see
Shovel Test Data in Appendix A).

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Winkler to Midland pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will
have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that W2W be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
Any artifacts recovered during the investigations and all records produced during the
investigations are to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and 13 TAC Section 26.17.
